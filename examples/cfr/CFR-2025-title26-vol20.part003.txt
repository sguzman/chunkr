Although the Internal Revenue Service will not grant a request for reasonable administrative costs where the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are not met, a taxpayer may file a claim for reasonable administrative costs with the court with jurisdiction over the judicial proceeding. The court may award the taxpayer reasonable administrative costs under section 7430(a). Under section 7430(c)(4)(C)(ii), where the final determination with respect to the tax, interest, or penalty at issue is made by a court, the court determines whether the taxpayer qualifies as a prevailing party. Thus, where the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are not met, the taxpayer's only possibility of obtaining an award of reasonable administrative costs is to obtain an award of these costs from the court. In the event the court awards reasonable administrative costs, it may also award litigation costs for the reasonable costs of pursuing the claim for reasonable administrative costs,
provided the requirements under section 7430 regarding an award of reasonable administrative costs are satisfied with respect to these costs. A claim filed with the court should be made in accordance with the rules of the court.
(c)
Procedure for recovering reasonable administrative costs
—(1)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Service will not award administrative costs under section 7430 unless the taxpayer files a written request to recover reasonable administrative costs in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(2)
Where request must be filed.
A request required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service personnel who have jurisdiction over the tax matter underlying the claim for the costs, except that requests with respect to administrative proceedings defined by § 301.7430-8(c) should be made to the Chief, Local Insolvency Unit. However, if those persons are unknown to the taxpayer making the request, the taxpayer may send the request to the Internal Revenue Service office that considered the underlying matter.
(3)
Contents of request.
The request must be in writing and must contain the following statements, affidavits, documentation, and information with regard to the taxpayer's administrative proceeding—
(i)
Statements.
(A) A statement that the underlying substantive issues or the issue of reasonable administrative costs are not, and have never been, before any court of the United States (including the Tax Court or United States Court of Federal Claims) with jurisdiction over those issues;
(B) A clear and concise statement of the reasons why the taxpayer alleges that the position of the Internal Revenue Service in the administrative proceeding was not substantially justified. For administrative proceedings commenced after July 30, 1996, if the taxpayer alleges that the Internal Revenue Service did not follow any applicable published guidance, the statement must identify all applicable published guidance that the taxpayer alleges that the Internal Revenue Service did not follow. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B), the term applicable published guidance means final or temporary regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, information releases, notices, announcements, and, if issued to the taxpayer, private letter rulings, technical advice memoranda, and determination letters. Also, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B), the term administrative proceeding includes only those administrative proceedings or portions of administrative proceedings occurring on or after the administrative proceeding date as defined in § 301.7430-3(c).For costs incurred after January 18, 1999, if the taxpayer alleges that the United States has lost in courts of appeal for other circuits on substantially similar issues, the taxpayer must provide, for each such case, the full name of the case, volume and pages of the reporter in which the opinion appears, the circuit in which the case was decided, and the year of the opinion;
(C) A statement sufficient to demonstrate that the taxpayer has substantially prevailed as to the amount in controversy or with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented in the proceeding;
(D) A statement that the taxpayer has not unreasonably protracted the portion of the administrative proceeding for which the taxpayer is requesting costs; and
(E) A statement supported by a detailed affidavit executed by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative that sets forth the nature and amount of each specific item of reasonable administrative costs for which the taxpayer is seeking recovery. This statement must identify whether the representation is on a pro bono basis as defined in § 301.7430-4(d) and, if so, to whom payment should be made. Specifically, the statement must direct whether payment should be made to the taxpayer's representative or to the representative's employer.
(ii)
Affidavit or affidavits.
(A) An affidavit executed by the taxpayer stating that the taxpayer meets the net worth and size limitations of § 301.7430-5(f);
(B) An affidavit supporting the statement described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section; and
(C) For costs incurred after January 18, 1999, if more than $125 per hour (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of
living pursuant to § 301.7430-4(b)(3)) is claimed for the fees of a representative in connection with the administrative proceeding, an affidavit is necessary stating that a special factor described in § 301.7430-4(b)(3) is applicable, such as the difficulty of the issues presented in the case or the lack of local availability of tax expertise. If a special factor is claimed based on specialized skills and distinctive knowledge as described in § 301.7430-4(b)(2)(ii), the affidavit should state—
(
1
) Why the specialized skills and distinctive knowledge were necessary in the representation;
(
2
) That there is a limited availability of representatives possessing these specialized skills and distinctive knowledge; and
(
3
) How the representative's education and experience qualifies the representative as someone with the necessary specialized skills and distinctive knowledge.
(iii)
Documentation and information.
(A) A copy of the billing records of the representative for the requested fees; and
(B) An address at which the taxpayer wishes to receive notice of the determination of the Internal Revenue Service with regard to the request for reasonable administrative costs.
(C) In cases of pro bono representation, time records similar to billing records, detailing the time spent and work completed, must be submitted for the requested fees.
(4)
Form of Request.
No specific form is required for the request other than one that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Where practicable the required statements may be included in a single document. Similarly, where practicable, the required affidavits may be combined in a single affidavit to the extent they are to be executed by the same person.
(5)
Period for requesting costs from the Internal Revenue Service.
To recover reasonable administrative costs pursuant to section 7430 and this section, the taxpayer must file a written request for costs within 90 days after the date the final adverse decision of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to all tax, additions to tax, interest, and penalties at issue in the administrative proceeding is mailed or otherwise furnished to the taxpayer. For purposes of this section,
interest
means the interest that is specifically at issue in the administrative proceeding independent of the taxpayer's objections to the underlying tax, additions to tax, and penalties imposed. The final decision of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of this section is the document that resolves the taxpayer's liability with regard to all tax, additions to tax, interest, and penalties at issue in the administrative proceeding (such as a Form 870 or closing agreement), or a notice of assessment for that liability (such as the notice and demand under section 6303), whichever is earlier mailed or otherwise furnished to the taxpayer. For purposes of this section, if the 90th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the 90-day period shall end on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday as defined by section 7503.
(6)
Notice.
The Internal Revenue Service is authorized, but not required, to notify the taxpayer of its decision to grant or deny (in whole or in part) an award for reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and this section by certified mail or registered mail. If the Internal Revenue Service does not respond on the merits to a request by the taxpayer for an award of reasonable administrative costs filed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section within 6 months after the request is filed, the Internal Revenue Service's failure to respond may be considered by the taxpayer as a decision of the Internal Revenue Service denying an award for reasonable administrative costs.
(7)
Appeal to Tax Court.
A taxpayer may appeal a decision by the Internal Revenue Service denying (in whole or in part) a request for reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and this section by filing a petition for reasonable administrative costs with the Tax Court. The petition must be in accordance with the Tax Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure and must be filed with the Tax Court after the Internal Revenue Service denies (in whole or in part) the taxpayer's request for reasonable administrative
costs. Once a notice of decision denying (in whole or in part) an award for reasonable administrative costs is mailed by the Internal Revenue Service via certified mail or registered mail as required by paragraph (c)(6) of this section, a taxpayer may obtain judicial review of that decision by filing a petition for review with the Tax Court prior to the 91st day after the mailing of the notice of decision.
(d)
Unreasonable protraction of administrative proceeding.
An award of reasonable administrative costs will not be made where the taxpayer unreasonably protracted the administrative proceeding. However, a taxpayer that unreasonably protracted only a portion of the administrative proceeding, but not other portions of the administrative proceeding, may recover reasonable administrative costs for the portion(s) of the administrative proceeding that the taxpayer did not unreasonably protract, if the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are otherwise satisfied.
(e) The following examples primarily illustrate paragraph (a) of this section:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. The administrative file contains certain documents provided by A as substantiation for the tax matters at issue. Appeals determines that the information submitted is insufficient. Appeals then issues a notice of deficiency. After receiving the notice of deficiency but before the 90-day period for filing a petition with the Tax Court has expired, and before filing a petition with the Tax Court, A convinces Appeals that the information previously submitted and reviewed by Appeals is sufficient and, therefore, the notice of deficiency is incorrect and A owes no additional tax. Pursuant to section 6212(d), the notice of deficiency is rescinded. Appeals then closes the case showing a zero deficiency and mails A a notice to this effect. Assuming that Appeals did not rely on any new information provided by A in rescinding the notice of deficiency and that all of the other requirements of section 7430 are satisfied, A may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred after the date of the 30-day letter (the administrative proceeding date as defined in Treas. Reg. § 301.7430-3(c)). To recover these costs, A must file a request for administrative costs with the Appeals office personnel who settled A's tax matter, or if that person is unknown to A, with the Area Director of the area that considered the underlying matter, within 90 days after the date of mailing of the Office of Appeals' final decision that A owes no additional tax.

# Example 2.
Taxpayer B files a request for an abatement of interest pursuant to section 6404 and the regulations thereunder. The Area Director issues a notice of proposed disallowance of the abatement request (akin to a 30-day letter). B requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. No agreement is reached with Appeals and the Office of Appeals issues a notice of disallowance of the abatement request. B does not file suit in the Tax Court, but instead contacts the Appeals office within 180 days after the mailing date of the notice of disallowance of the abatement request to attempt to reverse the decision. B convinces the Appeals office that the notice of disallowance is in error. The Appeals office agrees to abate the interest and mails the taxpayer a notification of this decision. The mailing date of the notification from Appeals of the decision to abate interest commences the 90-day period from which the taxpayer may request administrative costs. Assuming that Appeals did not rely on any new information provided by B in reversing its notice of disallowance, and that all of the other requirements of section 7430 are satisfied, B may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred after the date the Area Director issued the notice of proposed disallowance of the abatement request (the administrative proceeding date as defined in Treas. Reg. § 301.7430-3(c)). To recover these costs, B must file a request for costs with the Appeals office personnel who settled B's tax matter, or if that person is unknown to B, with the Area Director of the area that considered the underlying matter within 90 days after the date of mailing of the Office of Appeals' final decision that B is entitled to abatement of interest.

# Example 3.
Taxpayer C receives a notice of proposed adjustment and employment tax 30-day letter. C requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. The administrative file contains certain documents provided by C to support C's position in the tax matters at issue. Appeals determines that the documents submitted are insufficient. Appeals then issues a notice of determination of worker classification. After receiving the notice of determination of worker classification but before the 90-day period for filing a petition with the Tax Court has expired, C convinces Appeals that the documents previously submitted and reviewed by Appeals adequately support its position and, therefore, C owes no additional employment tax. Appeals then closes the case showing a zero tax adjustment and mails C a no-change letter. Assuming that Appeals did not rely on any new information provided by C in reversing its notice of determination of worker
classification, and that all of the other requirements of section 7430 are satisfied, C may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred after the date of the notice of proposed adjustment and 30-day letter (the administrative proceeding date as defined in Treas. Reg. § 301.7430-3(c)). To recover these costs, C must file a request for administrative costs with the Appeals office personnel who settled C's tax matter, or if that person is unknown to C, with the Area Director of the area that considered the underlying matter, within 90 days after the date of mailing of the Office of Appeals' final decision that C owes no additional tax.
[T.D. 8542, 59 FR 29360, June 7, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8725, 62 FR 39118, July 22, 1997; T.D. 9050, 68 FR 14320, Mar. 25, 2003; T.D. 9756, 81 FR 10484, Mar. 1, 2016]
§ 301.7430-3
Administrative proceeding and administrative proceeding date.
(a)
Administrative proceeding.
For purposes of section 7430, an administrative proceeding generally means any procedure or other action before the Internal Revenue Service that is commenced after November 10, 1988. However, an administrative proceeding does not include—
(1) Proceedings involving matters of general application, including hearings on regulations, comments on forms, or proceedings involving revenue rulings or revenue procedures;
(2) Proceedings involving requests for private letter rulings or similar determinations;
(3) Proceedings involving technical advice memoranda, except those submitted after the administrative proceeding date (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section); and
(4) Proceedings in connection with collection actions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), including proceedings under section 7432 or 7433, except proceedings brought under section 7433(e) and § 301.7433-2 or proceedings otherwise described in § 301.7430-8(c). See § 301.7430-8.
(b)
Collection action.
A collection action generally includes any action taken by the Internal Revenue Service to collect a tax (or any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs in addition to the tax) or any action taken by a taxpayer in response to the Internal Revenue Service's act or failure to act in connection with the collection of a tax (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs in addition to the tax). A collection action for purposes of section 7430 and this section includes any action taken by the Internal Revenue Service under Chapter 64 of Subtitle F to collect a tax. Collection actions also include collection due process hearings under sections 6320 and 6330 (unless the underlying tax liability is properly at issue), and those actions taken by a taxpayer to remedy the Internal Revenue Service's failure to release a lien under section 6325 or to remedy any unauthorized collection action as described by section 7433, except those collection actions described by section 7433(e). An action or procedure directly relating to a claim for refund after payment of an assessed tax is not a collection action.
(c)
Administrative proceeding date
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, the term
administrative proceeding date
means the earlier of—
(i) The date of the receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals;
(ii) The date of the notice of deficiency; or
(iii) The date on which the first letter of proposed deficiency that allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals is sent.
(2)
Notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.
For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals is the final written document, mailed or delivered to the taxpayer, that is signed by an individual in the Office of Appeals who has been delegated the authority to settle the dispute on behalf of the Commissioner, and states or indicates that the notice is the final determination of the entire case. A notice of claim disallowance issued by the Office of Appeals is a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals. Solely for purposes of determining the administrative proceeding date, a notice of deficiency issued by the Office
of Appeals is not a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.
(3)
Notice of deficiency.
A notice of deficiency is a notice described in section 6212(a), including a notice rescinded pursuant to section 6212(d). For purposes of determining reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, the following will be treated as a notice of deficiency:
(i) A notice of final partnership administrative adjustment described in section 6223(a)(2).
(ii) A notice of determination of worker classification issued pursuant to section 7436.
(iii) A final notice of determination denying innocent spouse relief issued pursuant to section 6015.
(4)
First letter of proposed deficiency that allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Office of Appeals.
Generally, the first letter of proposed deficiency that allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Office of Appeals is the first letter issued to the taxpayer that describes the proposed adjustments and advises the taxpayer of the opportunity to contact the Office of Appeals. It also may be a claim disallowance or the first letter of determination that allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Office of Appeals.
(d)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A files a request for and is granted an Appeals office conference. At the Appeals conference no agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. The Office of Appeals then issues a notice of deficiency. Upon receiving the notice of deficiency, A does not file a petition with the Tax Court. Instead, A pays the deficiency and files a claim for refund. The claim for refund is considered by the Internal Revenue Service and the Area Director issues a notice of proposed claim disallowance. A requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. A convinces Appeals that A's claim is correct and Appeals allows A's claim. A may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred on or after the date of the notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter), but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. A cannot recover costs incurred prior to the date of the 30-day letter because these costs were incurred before the administrative proceeding date.

# Example 2.
Taxpayer B files an individual income tax return showing a balance due. No payment is made with the return and the Internal Revenue Service assesses the amount shown on the return. The Internal Revenue Service issues a Notice Of Intent to Levy And Notice Of Your Right To A Hearing pursuant to sections 6330(a) and 6331(d). B timely requests and is granted a Collection Due Process (CDP) hearing. In connection with the CDP hearing, B enters into an installment agreement as a collection alternative. The costs that B incurred in connection with the CDP hearing were not incurred in an administrative proceeding, but rather in a collection action. Accordingly, B may not recover those costs as reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 8542, 59 FR 29362, June 7, 1994, as amended by T.D. 9050, 68 FR 14320, Mar. 25, 2003; T.D. 9756, 81 FR 10485, Mar. 1, 2016]
§ 301.7430-4
Reasonable administrative costs.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, reasonable administrative costs are any costs described in paragraph (b) of this section that are incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding (as defined in § 301.7430-3(a)) and incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date (as defined in § 301.7430-3(c)).
(b)
Costs described
—(1)
In general.
The costs described in this paragraph are the reasonable and necessary amount of costs incurred by the taxpayer to present the taxpayer's position with respect to the merits of the tax controversy or the recovery of reasonable administrative costs. These costs include—
(i) Any administrative fees or similar charges imposed by the Internal Revenue Service;
(ii) Reasonable expenses of expert witnesses;
(iii) Reasonable costs of any study, analysis, engineering report, test or project that is necessary for, and incurred in preparation of, the taxpayer's case; and
(iv) Reasonable fees paid or incurred for the services of a representative (as
defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) in connection with the administrative proceeding.
(2)
Representative and specially qualified representative
—(i)
Representative.
A representative is a person compensated for services rendered in connection with the administrative proceeding, who is authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service or the Tax Court.
(ii)
Specially qualified representative.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a specially qualified representative is a representative (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) possessing a distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill that is necessary to adequately represent the taxpayer in the proceeding.Examples of a unique and specialized skill or distinctive knowledge would be an identifiable practice specialty such as patent law or knowledge of a foreign law or language where that specialty or knowledge is necessary to adequately represent the taxpayer in the proceeding.For purposes of this paragraph, neither knowledge of tax law nor experience in representing taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service is considered distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill.An extraordinary level of general representational knowledge and ability that is useful in all proceedings is not considered, in and of itself, distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill.Specially qualified representatives also do not include those who have a distinctive knowledge of the underlying subject matter of the controversy in circumstances where that distinctive knowledge could reasonably be supplied through the use of an expert, or could readily be obtained through literature pertaining to the subject.
(3)
Limitation on fees for a representative
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, fees incurred after January 18, 1999, and described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section that are recoverable under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder as reasonable administrative costs may not exceed $125 per hour (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of living and, if appropriate, a special factor adjustment).
(ii)
Cost of living adjustment.
The Internal Revenue Service will make a cost of living adjustment to the $125 per hour limitation for fees incurred in any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1996. The cost of living adjustment will be an amount equal to $125 multiplied by the cost of living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year (substituting “calendar year 1995” for “calendar year 1992” in section 1(f)(3)(B)). If the dollar limitation as adjusted by this cost of living increase is not a multiple of $10, the dollar amount will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10 (rounding up if the amount is a multiple of $5).
(B)
Percentage adjustment.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the base year for determining the cost of living adjustment is the calendar year 1986. The cost of living adjustment for fees incurred in any calendar year subsequent to 1986 is the percentage (if any) by which the yearly average CPI--U for the calendar year immediately prior to the year in which the fees are incurred exceeds the January CPI--U for the calendar year 1986.
(iii)
Special factor adjustment
—(A)
In general.
If the presence of a special factor is demonstrated by the taxpayer, the amount reimbursable is the amount of reasonable fees paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the proceeding for the services of a representative as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(B)
Special factor.
A
special factor
is a factor, other than an increase in the cost of living, that justifies an increase in the $125 per hour limitation of section 7430(c)(1)(B)(iii). The undesirability of the case, the work and the ability of counsel, the results obtained, and customary fees and awards in other cases, are factors applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation and do not constitute special factors for the purpose of increasing the $125 per hour limitation. By contrast, the limited availability of a specially qualified representative for the proceeding, the limited local availability of tax expertise, and the difficulty of the issues are special factors justifying an increase in the $125 per hour limitation.
(C)
Limited availability.
Limited availability of a specially qualified representative is established by demonstrating that a specially qualified representative for the proceeding is not available at the $125 per hour rate (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of living). The representative's special qualification must be based on nontax expertise.Initially, this showing may be made by submission of an affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by the taxpayer's counsel, that in a case similar to the taxpayer's, a specially qualified representative that practices within a reasonable distance from the taxpayer's principal residence or principal office would normally charge a client similar to the taxpayer at a rate in excess of this amount. If the Internal Revenue Service challenges this initial showing, the taxpayer may submit additional evidence to establish the limited availability of a specially qualified representative at the rate specified above.
(D)
Limited local availability of tax expertise.
Limited local availability of tax expertise is established by demonstrating that a representative possessing tax expertise is not available in the taxpayer's geographical area. Initially, this showing may be made by submission of an affidavit signed by the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer's counsel, that no representative possessing tax expertise practices within a reasonable distance from the taxpayer's principal residence or principal office. The hourly rate charged by representatives in the geographical area is not relevant in determining whether tax expertise is locally available. If the Internal Revenue Service challenges this initial showing, the taxpayer may submit additional evidence to establish the limited local availability of a representative possessing tax expertise.
(E)
Difficulty of the issues.
In determining whether the difficulty of the issues justifies an increase in the $125 per hour limitation on the applicable hourly rate, the Internal Revenue Service will consider the following factors:
(
1
) The number of different provisions of law involved in each issue.
(
2
) The complexity of the particular provision or provisions of law involved in each issue.
(
3
) The number of factual issues present in the proceeding.
(
4
) The complexity of the factual issues present in the proceeding.
(F)
Example.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Taxpayer A is represented by B, a CPA and attorney with a LL.M. Degree in Taxation with Highest Honors who regularly handles cases dealing with TEFRA partnership issues. B represents A in an administrative proceeding involving TEFRA partnership issues that is subject to the provisions of this section. Assuming A qualifies for an award of reasonable administrative costs by meeting the requirements of section 7430, the amount of the award attributable to the fees of B may not exceed the $125 per hour limitation (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of living), absent a special factor. B is not a specially qualified representative because extraordinary knowledge of the tax laws does not constitute distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill constituting a special factor. A higher rate may be justified by another special factor, that is, the limited local availability of tax expertise or the difficulty of the issues.
(c)
Certain costs excluded
—(1)
Costs not incurred in an administrative proceeding.
Costs that are not reasonable administrative costs for purposes of section 7430 include any costs incurred in connection with a proceeding that is not an administrative proceeding within the meaning of § 301.7430-3.
(2)
Costs incurred in an administrative proceeding but not reasonable
—(i)
In general.
Costs incurred in an administrative proceeding that are incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date, and that are otherwise described in paragraph (b) of this section, are not recoverable unless they are reasonable in both nature and amount.For example, costs normally included in the hourly rate of the representative by the custom and usage of the representative's profession, when billed separately, are not recoverable separate and apart from the representative's hourly rate. These costs typically include costs such as secretarial and overhead expenses. In contrast, costs that are normally billed separately may be reasonable administrative costs that may be recoverable in addition to
the representative's hourly rate. Therefore, necessary costs incurred for travel; expedited mail delivery; messenger service; expenses while on travel; long distance telephone calls; and necessary copying fees imposed by the Internal Revenue Service, any court, bank or other third party, when normally billed separately from the representative's hourly rate, may be reasonable administrative costs.
(ii)
Special Rule for Expert Witness' Fees on Issue of Prevailing Market Rates.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the taxpayer may initially establish a limited availability of specially qualified representatives for the proceeding by submission of an affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by the taxpayer's representative. The Internal Revenue Service may endeavor to rebut the affidavit submitted on this issue by demonstrating either that a specially qualified representative was not necessary to represent the taxpayer in the proceeding, that the taxpayer's representative is not a specially qualified representative or that the prevailing rate for specially qualified representatives does not exceed $125 per hour (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of living). Unless the Internal Revenue Service endeavors to demonstrate that the prevailing rate for specially qualified representatives does not exceed $125 per hour (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of living), fees for expert witnesses used to establish prevailing market rates are not included in the term reasonable administrative costs.
(3)
Litigation costs.
Litigation costs are not reasonable administrative costs because they are not incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding. Litigation costs include—
(i) Costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of a petition with the United States Tax Court or in connection with the commencement of any other court proceeding; and
(ii) Costs incurred after the filing of a petition with the United States Tax Court or after the commencement of any other court proceeding.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
After incurring fees for representation during the Internal Revenue Service's examination of A's income tax return, A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A files a request for and is granted an Appeals office conference. At the conference no agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. The Internal Revenue Service then issues a notice of deficiency. Upon receiving the notice of deficiency, A discontinues A's administrative efforts and files a petition with the Tax Court. A's costs incurred before the date of the mailing of the 30-day letter are not reasonable administrative costs because they were incurred before the administrative proceeding date. Similarly, A's costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of a petition with the Tax Court are litigation costs and not reasonable administrative costs.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that after A receives the notice of deficiency, in addition to petitioning the Tax Court, A recontacts Appeals and A convinces Appeals that the information previously submitted during the review by Appeals is sufficient and, therefore, the notice of deficiency is incorrect and A owes no additional tax. The Internal Revenue Service and A agree to a stipulated decision in the Tax Court case to reflect Appeals' decision. The Tax Court enters the decision. If A seeks administrative costs, A may recover costs incurred after the date of the mailing of the 30-day letter, costs incurred in recontacting Appeals after the issuance of the notice of deficiency, and costs incurred up to the time the Tax Court petition was filed, as reasonable administrative costs, but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. The costs incurred before the date of the mailing of the 30-day letter are not reasonable administrative costs because they were incurred before the administrative proceeding date, as set forth in § 301.7430-3(c)(1)(iii). A's costs incurred in connection with the filing of a petition with the Tax Court are not reasonable administrative costs because those costs are litigation costs. Similarly, A's costs incurred after the filing of the petition are not reasonable administrative costs, as they are litigation costs.
(d)
Pro bono representation
—(1)
In general.
Fees recoverable under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder as reasonable administrative costs may exceed the attorneys' fees paid or incurred by the prevailing party if such fees are less than the reasonable attorneys' fees because an individual is representing the prevailing party on a pro bono basis. In addition to attorneys' fees, reasonable costs incurred or paid
by the individual providing the pro bono representation that are normally billed separately also may be recovered under this section. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service may, in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, provide for additional rules that apply for awards of costs for pro bono representation for purposes of this paragraph (d).
(2)
Requirements.
Pro bono representation is established by demonstrating—
(i) Representation was provided for no fee or for a fee that (taking into account all the facts and circumstances) constitutes a nominal fee;
(ii) The representative intended to provide representation for no fee or for a nominal fee from the commencement of the representation. Intent to provide representation for no fee or for a nominal fee may be demonstrated through documentation such as a retainer agreement. An individual will not be considered to have represented a client on a pro bono basis if the facts demonstrate that the individual anticipated a fee greater than a nominal fee or provided representation on a contingency fee basis. The fact that the representative intended to seek recovery of fees under section 7430 will not prevent the representative from satisfying this requirement.
(3)
Nominal fee.
A
nominal fee
is defined as a fee that is insignificantly small or minimal. A nominal fee is a trivial payment, bearing no relation to the value of the representation provided, taking into account all the facts and circumstances.
(4)
Payment when representation provided at no charge or for a nominal fee.
A prevailing party who receives representation at no charge or for a nominal fee and who satisfies the requirements under this section is eligible to receive reasonable fees in excess of the fees actually paid or incurred. Payment will be made to the representative or the representative's employer.
(5)
Recordkeeping.
Contemporaneous records must be maintained, demonstrating the work performed and the time allocated to each task. These records should contain similar information to billing records.
(6)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following example:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A, an attorney, files a petition with the Tax Court and pays a $60 filing fee. A appears pro se in the court proceeding. If A prevails, he will not be entitled to an award of reasonable litigation costs for his services. A is rendering services on his own behalf, not providing pro bono representation. His lost opportunity costs are not compensable under section 7430. A may recover the filing fee as a litigation cost, but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied.
[T.D. 8542, 59 FR 29363, June 7, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8725, 62 FR 39118, July 22, 1997; T.D. 9756, 81 FR 10486, Mar. 1, 2016]
§ 301.7430-5
Prevailing party.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of an award of reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 in the case of administrative proceedings commenced after July 30, 1996, a taxpayer is a prevailing party (other than by reason of section 7430(c)(4)(E)) only if—
(1) At least one issue (other than recovery of administrative costs) remains in dispute as of the date that the Internal Revenue Service takes a position in the administrative proceeding, as described in paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) The position of the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified;
(3) The taxpayer substantially prevails as to the amount in controversy or with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented; and
(4) The taxpayer satisfies the net worth and size limitations referenced in paragraph (f) of this section.
(b)
Position of the Internal Revenue Service.
The position of the Internal Revenue Service in an administrative proceeding is the position taken by the Internal Revenue Service as of the earlier of—
(1) The date of the receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals; or
(2) The date of the notice of deficiency or any date thereafter.
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A pays the amount of the proposed deficiency and files a claim for refund. A's claim is considered and a notice of proposed claim disallowance is issued by the Area Director. A does not request an Appeals office conference and the Area Director issues a notice of claim disallowance. A then files suit in a United States District Court. A cannot recover reasonable administrative costs because the notice of claim disallowance is not a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals or a notice of deficiency. Accordingly, the Internal Revenue Service has not taken a position in the administrative proceeding pursuant to section 7430(c)(7)(B).

# Example 2.
Taxpayer B receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). B disputes the proposed adjustments and requests an Appeals office conference. The Appeals office determines that B has no additional tax liability. B requests administrative costs from the date of the 30-day letter. B is not the prevailing party and may not recover administrative costs because all of the proposed adjustments in the case were resolved as of the date that the Internal Revenue Service took a position in the administrative proceeding.
(d)
Substantially justified
—(1)
In general.
The position of the Internal Revenue Service is substantially justified if it has a reasonable basis in both fact and law. A significant factor in determining whether the position of the Internal Revenue Service is substantially justified as of a given date is whether, on or before that date, the taxpayer has presented all relevant information under the taxpayer's control and relevant legal arguments supporting the taxpayer's position to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service personnel. The appropriate Internal Revenue Service personnel are personnel responsible for reviewing the information or arguments, or personnel who would transfer the information or arguments in the normal course of procedure and administration to the personnel who are responsible.
(2)
Position in courts of appeal.
Whether the United States has won or lost an issue substantially similar to the one in the taxpayer's case in courts of appeal for circuits other than the one to which the taxpayer's case would be appealable should be taken into consideration in determining whether the Internal Revenue Service's position was substantially justified.
(3)
Example.
The provisions of this section (d) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The Internal Revenue Service, in the conduct of a correspondence examination of taxpayer A's individual income tax return, requests substantiation from A of claimed medical expenses. A does not respond to the request and the Internal Revenue Service issues a notice of deficiency. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A presents sufficient information and arguments to convince a tax compliance officer that the notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. The revenue agent then closes the case showing no deficiency. Although A incurred costs after the issuance of the notice of deficiency, A is unable to recover these costs because, as of the date these costs were incurred, A had not presented relevant information under A's control and relevant legal arguments supporting A's position to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service personnel. Accordingly, the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified at the time the costs were incurred.
(4)
Included costs.
(i) An award of reasonable administrative costs shall only include costs incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date as defined in section 301.7430-3(c) of this chapter.
(ii) If the Internal Revenue Service takes a position in an administrative proceeding, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, and the position is not substantially justified, the taxpayer may be permitted to recover costs incurred before the position was taken, but not before the dates set forth in this paragraph (d)(4).
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Pursuant to section 6672, taxpayer D receives from the Area Director Collection Operations (Collection) a proposed assessment of trust fund taxes (Trust Fund Recovery Penalty). D requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. Appeals considers the issues and decides to uphold Collection's recommended assessment. Appeals notifies D of this decision in writing. Collection then assesses the tax and notice and demand is made. D timely pays the minimum
amount required to commence a court proceeding, files a claim for refund, and furnishes the required bond. Collection disallows the claim, but Appeals, on reconsideration, reverses its original position, thus upholding D's position. If Appeals' initial determination was not substantially justified, D may recover administrative costs incurred on or after the mailing of the proposed assessment of trust fund taxes, because the proposed assessment is the first determination letter that allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.

# Example 2.
Taxpayer E receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). E pays the amount of the proposed deficiency and files a claim for refund. E's claim is considered and a notice of proposed disallowance is issued by the Area Director. E requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. No agreement is reached with Appeals and the Office of Appeals issues a notice of claim disallowance. E does not file suit in a United States District Court but instead contacts the Appeals office to attempt to reverse the decision. E convinces the Appeals officer that the notice of claim disallowance is in error. The Appeals officer then abates the assessment. E may recover reasonable administrative costs if the position taken in the notice of claim disallowance issued by the Office of Appeals was not substantially justified and the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. If so, E may recover administrative costs incurred from the mailing date of the 30-day letter because the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are met. E cannot recover the costs incurred prior to the mailing of the 30-day letter because they were incurred before the administrative proceeding date.
(6)
Exception.
If the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified with respect to some issues in the proceeding and not substantially justified with respect to the remaining issues, any award of reasonable administrative costs to the taxpayer may be limited to only reasonable administrative costs attributable to those issues with respect to which the position of the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified. If the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified for only a portion of the period of the proceeding and not substantially justified for the remaining portion of the proceeding, any award of reasonable administrative costs to the taxpayer may be limited to only reasonable administrative costs attributable to that portion during which the position of the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified. Where an award of reasonable administrative costs is limited to that portion of the administrative proceeding during which the position of the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified, whether the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified is determined as of the date any cost is incurred.
(7)
Presumption.
If the Internal Revenue Service did not follow any applicable published guidance in an administrative proceeding commenced after July 30, 1996, the position of the Internal Revenue Service, on those issues to which the guidance applies and for all periods during which the guidance was not followed, will be presumed not to be substantially justified. This presumption may be rebutted. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(7), the term
applicable published guidance
means final or temporary regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, information releases, notices, and announcements published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin and, if issued to or with respect to the taxpayer, private letter rulings, technical advice memoranda, and determination letters (§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). Also, for purposes of this paragraph (d)(7), the term administrative proceeding includes only those administrative proceedings or portions of administrative proceedings occurring on or after the administrative proceeding date as defined in § 301.7430-3(c).
(e)
Amount in controversy.
The amount in controversy shall include the amount in issue as of the administrative proceeding date as increased by any amounts subsequently placed in issue by any party. The amount in controversy is determined without increasing or reducing the amount in controversy for amounts of loss, deduction, or credit carried over from years not in issue.
(f)
Most significant issue or set of issues presented.
(1)
In general.
Where the taxpayer has not substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy the taxpayer may nonetheless be a prevailing party if the taxpayer substantially prevails with respect to
the most significant issue or set of issues presented. The issues presented include those raised as of the administrative proceeding date and those raised subsequently. Only in a multiple issue proceeding can a most significant issue or set of issues presented exist. However, not all multiple issue proceedings contain a most significant issue or set of issues presented. An issue or set of issues constitutes the most significant issue or set of issues presented if, despite involving a lesser dollar amount in the proceeding than the other issue or issues, it objectively represents the most significant issue or set of issues for the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue Service. This may occur because of the effect of the issue or set of issues on other transactions or other taxable years of the taxpayer or related parties.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In the purchase of an ongoing business, Taxpayer F obtains from the previous owner of the business a covenant not to compete for a period of five years. On audit of F's individual income tax return for the year in which the business was acquired, the Internal Revenue Service challenges the basis assigned to the covenant not to compete and a deduction taken as a business expense for a seminar attended by F. Both parties agree that the covenant not to compete is amortizable over a period of five years; however, the Internal Revenue Service asserts that the proper basis of the covenant is $25,000, while F asserts the basis is $50,000 and claims a deduction of $10,000 in the year in which the business was acquired. F deducted $12,000 for the seminar. The Internal Revenue Service determines that the deduction for the seminar should be disallowed entirely. In the notice of deficiency, the Internal Revenue Service adjusts the amortization deduction to reflect the change to the basis of the covenant not to compete, and disallows the seminar expense. Thus, of the two adjustments determined for the year under audit, the adjustment attributable to the disallowance of the seminar is larger than that attributable to the covenant not to compete. Due to the impact on the next succeeding four years, however, the covenant not to compete adjustment is the most significant issue to both F and the Internal Revenue Service.
(g)
Net worth and size limitations
—(1)
Individuals.
A taxpayer who is a natural person meets the net worth and size limitations of this paragraph if the taxpayer's net worth does not exceed two million dollars. For purposes of determining net worth, individuals filing a joint return, and jointly incurring administrative or litigation costs shall have their net worth determined jointly, with all assets and liabilities treated as joint for purposes of the net worth evaluation, and applying a joint cap of four million dollars. Individuals who file a joint return, but incur separate administrative or litigation costs, by retaining separate representation, and/or seeking individual administrative review or petitioning the court individually, such as under section 6015, shall have their net worth determined separately, with only those assets and liabilities reasonably attributable to each spouse considered against separate caps of two million dollars per spouse.
(2)
Estates and trusts.
An estate or a trust meets the net worth and size limitations of this paragraph if the estate or trust's net worth does not exceed two million dollars. The net worth of an estate shall be determined as of the date of the decedent's death provided the date of death is prior to the date the court proceeding is commenced. The net worth of a trust shall be determined as of the last day of the last taxable year involved in the proceeding.
(3)
Others.
(i) A taxpayer that is a partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization (other than an organization described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) meets the net worth and size limitations of this paragraph if, as of the administrative proceeding date:
(A) The taxpayer's net worth does not exceed seven million dollars; and
(B) The taxpayer does not have more than 500 employees.
(ii) A taxpayer who is a natural person and owns an unincorporated business is subject to the net worth and size limitations contained in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section if the tax at issue (or any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs in addition to the tax) relates directly to the business activities of the unincorporated business.
(4)
Special rule for charitable organizations and certain cooperatives.
An organization described in section 501(c)(3) exempt from taxation under section 501(a), or a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1141j(a) (as in effect on October 22, 1986), meets the net worth and size limitations of this paragraph if, as of the administrative proceeding date, the organization or cooperative association does not have more than 500 employees.
(5)
Special rule for TEFRA partnership proceedings.
(i) In cases involving partnerships subject to the unified audit and litigation procedures of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (TEFRA partnership cases), the TEFRA partnership meets the net worth and size limitations requirements of this paragraph (g) if, on the administrative proceeding date—
(A) The partnership's net worth does not exceed seven million dollars; and
(B) The partnership does not have more than 500 employees.
(ii) In addition, each partner requesting fees pursuant to section 7430 must meet the appropriate net worth and size limitations set forth in paragraph (g)(1), (g)(2), or (g)(3) of this section. For example, if a partner is an individual, his or her net worth must not exceed two million dollars as of the administrative proceeding date. If the partner is a corporation, its net worth must not exceed seven million dollars and it must not have more than 500 employees.
(6)
Determining net worth.
For purposes of determining net worth under this paragraph (g), assets are valued based on the cost of their acquisition.
(h)
Determination of prevailing party.
If the final decision with respect to the tax, interest, or penalty is made at the administrative level, the determination of whether a taxpayer is a prevailing party shall be made by agreement of the parties, or absent an agreement, by the Internal Revenue Service. See § 301.7430-2(c)(7) regarding the right to appeal the decision of the Internal Revenue Service denying (in whole or in part) a request for reasonable administrative costs to the Tax Court.

[T.D. 9756, 81 FR 10489, Mar. 1, 2016]
§ 301.7430-7
Qualified offers.
(a)
In general.
Section 7430(c)(4)(E) (the qualified offer rule) provides that a party to a court proceeding satisfying the timely filing and net worth requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii) shall be treated as the prevailing party if the liability of the taxpayer pursuant to the judgment in the proceeding (determined without regard to interest) is equal to or less than the liability of the taxpayer which would have been so determined if the United States had accepted the last qualified offer of the party as defined in section 7430(g). For purposes of this section, the term
judgment
means the cumulative determinations of the court concerning the adjustments at issue and litigated to a determination in the court proceeding. In making the comparison between the liability under the qualified offer and the liability under the judgment, the taxpayer's liability under the judgment is further modified by the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The provisions of the qualified offer rule do not apply if the taxpayer's liability under the judgment, as modified by the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, is determined exclusively pursuant to a settlement, or to any proceeding in which the amount of tax liability is not in issue, including any declaratory judgment proceeding, any proceeding to enforce or quash any summons issued pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code (Code), and any action to restrain disclosure under section 6110(f). If the qualified offer rule applies to the court proceeding, the determination of whether the liability under the qualified offer would have equaled or exceeded the liability pursuant to the judgment is made by reference to the last qualified offer made with respect to the tax liability at issue in the administrative or court proceeding. An award of reasonable administrative and litigation costs under the qualified offer rule only includes those costs incurred on or after the date of the last qualified offer and is limited to those costs attributable to the adjustments at issue at the time the last qualified offer was made that were included in the court's judgment other than by reason of settlement. The qualified offer rule is inapplicable to reasonable administrative or litigation costs otherwise awarded to a taxpayer who is a prevailing party under any other provision of section 7430(c)(4). This section sets forth the requirements to be satisfied for a taxpayer to be treated as a prevailing party by reason of the taxpayer making a qualified offer, as well as the circumstances leading to the application of the exceptions, special rules, and coordination provisions of the qualified offer rule. Furthermore, this section sets forth the elements necessary for an offer to be treated as a qualified offer under section 7430(g).
(b)
Requirements for treatment as a prevailing party based upon having made a qualified offer
—(1)
In general.
In order to be treated as a prevailing party by reason of having made a qualified offer, the liability of the taxpayer for the type or types of tax and the taxable year or years at issue in the proceeding (as calculated pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section), based on the last qualified offer (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) made by the taxpayer in the court or administrative proceeding, must equal or exceed the liability of the taxpayer pursuant to the judgment by the court for the same type or types of tax and the same taxable year or years (as calculated pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section). Furthermore, the taxpayer must meet the timely filing and net worth requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii). If all of the adjustments subject to the last qualified offer are settled prior to the entry of the judgment by the court, the taxpayer is not a prevailing party by reason of having made a qualified offer. The taxpayer may, however, still qualify as a prevailing party if the requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A) are met. If one or more adjustments covered by a qualified offer (see paragraph (c)(3)) are settled following a ruling by the court that substantially resolves those adjustments, then those adjustments will not be treated as having been settled prior to the entry of the judgment by the court and instead will be treated as amounts included in the judgment as a result of the court's determinations. For purposes of the preceding sentence, rulings relating to discovery, admissibility of evidence, and
burden of proof are not rulings that substantially resolve adjustments covered by a qualified offer.
(2)
Liability under the last qualified offer.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the taxpayer's liability under the last qualified offer is the change in the taxpayer's liability that would have resulted if the United States had accepted the taxpayer's last qualified offer on all of the adjustments that were at issue in the administrative or court proceeding at the time that the offer was made compared to the amount shown on the return or returns (or as previously adjusted). The portion of a taxpayer's liability that is attributable to adjustments raised by either party after the making of the last qualified offer is not included in the calculation of the liability under that offer. The taxpayer's liability under the last qualified offer is calculated without regard to adjustments that the parties have stipulated will be resolved in accordance with the outcome of a separate pending Federal, state, or other judicial or administrative proceeding. For example, the parties may stipulate that the taxpayer's liability will be resolved in accordance with the outcome of an alternative dispute resolution proceeding or a separate court proceeding, such as a probate, tort liability, or trademark action. Furthermore, the taxpayer's liability under the last qualified offer is calculated without regard to interest, unless the taxpayer's liability for, or entitlement to, interest is a contested issue in the administrative or court proceeding and is one of the adjustments included in the last qualified offer.
(3)
Liability pursuant to the judgment.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the taxpayer's liability pursuant to the judgment is the change in the taxpayer's liability resulting from amounts contained in the judgment as a result of the court's determinations, and amounts contained in settlements not included in the judgment, that are attributable to all adjustments that were included in the last qualified offer compared to the amount shown on the return or returns (or as previously adjusted). This liability includes amounts attributable to adjustments included in the last qualified offer and settled by the parties prior to the entry of judgment regardless of whether those amounts are actually included in the judgment entered by the court. The taxpayer's liability pursuant to the judgment does not include amounts attributable to adjustments that are not included in the last qualified offer, even if those amounts are actually included in the judgment entered by the court. The taxpayer's liability under the judgment is calculated without regard to adjustments that the parties have stipulated will be resolved in accordance with the outcome of a separate pending Federal, state, or other judicial or administrative proceeding. Furthermore, the taxpayer's liability pursuant to the judgment is calculated without regard to interest, unless the taxpayer's liability for, or entitlement to, interest is a contested issue in the administrative or court proceeding and is one of the adjustments included in the last qualified offer. Where adjustments raised by either party subsequent to the making of the last qualified offer are included in the judgment entered by the court, or are settled prior to the court proceeding, the taxpayer's liability pursuant to the judgment is calculated by treating the subsequently raised adjustments as if they had never been raised.
(c)
Qualified offer
—(1)
In general.
A qualified offer is defined in section 7430(g) to mean a written offer which—
(i) Is made by the taxpayer to the United States during the qualified offer period;
(ii) Specifies the offered amount of the taxpayer's liability (determined without regard to interest, unless interest is a contested issue in the proceeding);
(iii) Is designated at the time it is made as a qualified offer for purposes of section 7430(g); and
(iv) By its terms, remains open during the period beginning on the date it is made and ending on the earliest of the date the offer is rejected, the date the trial begins, or the 90th day after the date the offer is made.
(2)
To the United States.
(i) A qualified offer is made to the United States when it is delivered to the office or personnel within the Internal Revenue
Service, Office of Appeals, Office of Chief Counsel (including field personnel) or Department of Justice that has jurisdiction over the tax matter at issue in the administrative or court proceeding. If those offices or persons are unknown to the taxpayer making the qualified offer, the taxpayer may deliver the offer to the appropriate office, as follows:
(A) If the taxpayer's initial pleading in a court proceeding has been answered, the taxpayer may deliver the offer to the office that filed the answer.
(B) If the taxpayer's petition in the Tax Court has not yet been answered, the taxpayer may deliver the offer to the Office of Chief Counsel, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20224.
(C) If the taxpayer's initial pleading in any Federal court, other than the Tax Court, has not yet been answered, the taxpayer may deliver the offer to the Attorney General of the United States, 950 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20530-0001. For a suit brought in a United States district court, a copy of the offer should also be delivered to the United States Attorney for the district in which the suit was brought.
(D) In any other situation, the taxpayer may deliver the offer to the office that sent the taxpayer the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.
(ii) Until an offer is received by the appropriate personnel or office under this paragraph (c)(2), it is not considered to have been made, with the following exception. If the offer is deposited in the United States mail, in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the appropriate personnel or office under this paragraph (c)(2), the date of the United States postmark stamped on the cover in which the offer is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of receipt of that offer by the addressee. If any offer is deposited with a designated delivery service, as defined in section 7502(f)(2), in lieu of the United States mail, the provisions of section 7502(f)(1) shall apply in determining whether that offer qualifies for this exception.
(3)
Specifies the offered amount.
A qualified offer specifies the offered amount if it clearly specifies the amount for the liability of the taxpayer, calculated as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The offer may be a specific dollar amount of the total liability or a percentage of the adjustments at issue in the proceeding at the time the offer is made. This amount must be with respect to all of the adjustments at issue in the administrative or court proceeding at the time the offer is made and only those adjustments. The specified amount must be an amount, the acceptance of which by the United States will fully resolve the taxpayer's liability, and only that liability (determined without regard to adjustments that the parties have stipulated will be resolved in accordance with the outcome of a separate pending Federal, state, or other judicial or administrative proceeding, or interest, unless interest is a contested issue in the proceeding) for the type or types of tax and the taxable year or years at issue in the proceeding. In cases involving multiple tax years, if adjustments in different tax years arise from separate and distinct issues such that the resolution of issues in one or more tax years will not affect the taxpayer's liability in one or more of the other tax years in the proceeding, then a qualified offer may be made for less than all of the tax years involved. A qualified offer, however, must resolve all of the issues for the tax years covered by the offer and also must cover all tax years in the proceeding affected by those issues. A tax year (affected year) is affected by an issue if the treatment of the issue in another tax year involved in the proceeding necessarily affects the treatment of the issue in the affected year.
(4)
Designated at the time it is made as a qualified offer.
An offer is not a qualified offer unless it designates in writing at the time it is made that it is a qualified offer for purposes of section 7430(g). An offer made at a time when one or more adjustments not included in the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review
in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals have been raised by the taxpayer and remain unresolved, is not considered to be a qualified offer unless contemporaneously or prior to the making of the offer, the taxpayer has provided the United States with the substantiation and legal and factual arguments necessary to allow for informed consideration of the merits of those adjustments. For example, a taxpayer will be considered to have provided the United States with the necessary substantiation and legal and factual arguments if the taxpayer (or a recognized representative of the taxpayer described in § 601.502 of this chapter) participates in an Appeals office conference, participates in an Area Counsel conference, or confers with the Department of Justice, and at that time, discloses all relevant information. All relevant information includes, but is not limited to, the legal and factual arguments supporting the taxpayer's position on any adjustments raised by the taxpayer after the issuance of the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals. A taxpayer has disclosed all relevant information if the taxpayer has supplied sufficient information to allow informed consideration of the taxpayer's tax matter to the extent the information and its relevance were known or should have been known to the taxpayer at the time of the conference.
(5)
Remains open.
A qualified offer must, by its terms, remain open for acceptance by the United States from the date it is made, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, until the earliest of the date it is rejected in writing by a person with authority to reject the offer, the date the trial begins, or the 90th day after being received by the United States. The offer, by its written terms, may remain open after the occurrence of one or more of the above-referenced events. Once made, the period during which a qualified offer remains open may be extended by the taxpayer prior to its expiration, but an extension cannot be used to make an offer meet the minimum period for remaining open required by this paragraph (c)(5).
(6)
Last qualified offer.
A taxpayer may make multiple qualified offers during the qualified offer period. For purposes of the comparison under paragraph (b) of this section, the making of a qualified offer supersedes any previously made qualified offers. In making the comparison described in paragraph (b) of this section, only the qualified offer made most closely in time to the end of the qualified offer period is compared to the taxpayer's liability under the judgment.
(7)
Qualified offer period.
To constitute a qualified offer, an offer must be made during the qualified offer period. The qualified offer period begins on the date on which the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals is sent to the taxpayer. For this purpose, the date of the notice of claim disallowance will begin the qualified offer period in a refund case. If there has been no notice of claim disallowance in a refund case, the qualified offer period begins on the date on which the answer or other responsive pleading is filed with the court. The qualified offer period ends on the date which is thirty days before the date the case is first set for trial. In determining when the qualified offer period ends for cases in the Tax Court and other Federal courts using calendars for trial, a case will be considered set for trial on the date scheduled for the calendar call. A case may be removed from a trial calendar at any time. Thus, a case may be removed from a trial calendar before the date that precedes by thirty days the date scheduled for that trial calendar. The qualified offer period does not end until the case remains on a trial calendar on the date that precedes by 30 days the scheduled date of the calendar call for that trial session. The qualified offer period may not be extended beyond the periods set forth in this paragraph (c)(7), although the period during which a qualified offer remains open may extend beyond the end of the qualified offer period.
(8)
Interest as a contested issue.
To constitute a qualified offer, an offer
must specify the offered amount of the taxpayer's liability (determined without regard to interest, unless interest is a contested issue in the proceeding), as provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(3) of this section. Therefore, a qualified offer generally may only include an offer to compromise tax, penalties, additions to the tax, and additional amounts. Interest may only be included in a qualified offer if interest is a contested issue in the proceeding. For purposes of this section, interest is a contested issue in the proceeding only if the court in which the proceeding could be brought would have jurisdiction to determine the amount of interest due on the underlying tax, penalties, additions to the tax, and additional amounts. Examples of proceedings in which interest might be a contested issue include proceedings in which the increased interest rate for large corporate underpayments under section 6621(c) is imposed by the Internal Revenue Service and interest abatement proceedings brought under section 6404. Interest is not a contested issue in the proceeding if the court that would have jurisdiction over the proceeding would not have jurisdiction to determine the amount or rate of interest, regardless of whether the taxpayer attempts to raise interest as an issue in the proceeding. Consequently, interest will not be a contested issue in the vast majority of tax cases because they merely involve the straightforward application of statutory interest under section 6601. Accordingly, in those cases, interest may not be included in the offer.
(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1. Definition of a judgment,
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits Taxpayer A for year X and issues a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter) proposing to disallow deductions 1, 2, 3, and 4. A files a protest and participates in a conference with the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals (Appeals). Appeals allows deduction 1, and issues a statutory notice of deficiency for deductions 2, 3, and 4. A's petition to the United States Tax Court for year X never mentions deduction 2. Prior to trial, A concedes deduction 3. After the trial, the Tax Court issues an opinion allowing A to deduct a portion of deduction 4. As used in paragraph (a) of this section, the term judgment means the cumulative determinations of the court concerning the adjustments at issue in the court proceeding. Thus, the term judgment does not include deduction 1 because it was never at issue in the court proceeding. Similarly, the term judgment does not include deduction 2 because it was not placed at issue by A in the court proceeding. Although deduction 3 was at issue in the court proceeding, it is not included in the term judgment because it was not determined by the court, but rather by concession or settlement. For purposes of section 7430(c)(4)(E), the term judgment only includes the portion of deduction 4 disallowed by the Tax Court.

# Example 2. Liability under the offer and liability under the judgment,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that A makes a qualified offer after the Appeals conference, which is not accepted by the IRS. A's offer is with respect to all adjustments at issue at that time. Those adjustments are deductions 2, 3, and 4. At the conclusion of the litigation, A's entitlement to an award based upon the qualified offer will depend, among other things, on a comparison of the change in A's liability for income tax for year X resulting from the judgment of the Tax Court with the change that would have resulted had the IRS accepted A's qualified offer. In making this comparison, the term judgment (as discussed in
Example 1
) is modified by including the amounts of settled or conceded adjustments that were at issue at the time the qualified offer was made. Any settled or conceded adjustments that were not at issue at the time the qualified offer was made, either because the settlement or concession occurred before the offer or because the adjustment was not raised until after the offer, are not included in the comparison. Thus, A's offer on deductions 2, 3, and 4 is compared with the change in A's liability resulting from the Tax Court's determination of deduction 4, and the concessions of issues 2 and 3 by A.

# Example 3. Offer must resolve full liability,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
except that A's offer after the Appeals conference explicitly states that it is only with respect to adjustments 2 and 3 and not with respect to adjustment 4. Even if A's liability pursuant to the judgment, calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section as illustrated in
Example 2,
is equal to or less than it would have been had the IRS accepted A's offer after the Appeals conference, A is not a prevailing party under section 7430(c)(4)(E). A qualified offer must include all adjustments at issue at the time the offer is made. Since A's offer excluded adjustment 4, which was an adjustment at issue at the time the offer was made, it does not constitute a qualified offer pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

# Example 4. Offer must resolve full liability,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A makes a qualified offer that is accepted by the IRS. After the offer is accepted, A attempts to reduce the amount A will pay pursuant to the offer by applying net operating loss carryovers to the years in issue. Because the net operating losses were not at issue when the offer was made, A's offer was a qualified offer. Whether A is entitled to apply net operating losses to reduce the amount stated in the offer will depend upon the application of contract principles, local court rules, and, because net operating losses are at issue, section 6511(d) and related provisions.

# Example 5. Qualified offer rule for multiple tax years, partial resolution offer is a qualified offer,
Taxpayer B receives a notice of deficiency for taxable years 2001, 2002, and 2003. For 2001, the statutory notice disallows business deductions. For 2002, the statutory notice increases income for unreported lottery winnings. For 2003, the statutory notice disallows a child care credit. B submits a qualified offer only with respect to 2002. Since the adjustments for the three tax years are separate and distinct, B may submit a qualified offer for a single year. If B's liability under the judgment is equal to or less than the qualified offer with respect to 2002, irrespective of 2001 and 2003, B is a prevailing party for 2002 for purposes of section 7430(g). Assuming B satisfies the remaining requirements of section 7430, B may recover reasonable administrative and litigation costs that are attributable to 2002 from the date of the qualified offer. To qualify for any costs with respect to 2001 or 2003, B must satisfy the requirements of section 7430(c)(4).

# Example 6. Qualified offer rule for multiple tax years, partial resolution offer is not a qualified offer,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5
except that with respect to 2002, in addition to increasing B's income for the unreported lottery winnings, the statutory notice also disallows a charitable contribution deduction. B submits a settlement offer that purports to be a qualified offer, but only covers the unreported lottery winnings. B's offer is not a qualified offer because it does not address the charitable contribution issue, and thus, does not fully resolve B's liability for 2002.

# Example 7. Qualified offer rule for multiple tax years, partial resolution offer is not a qualified offer,
Taxpayer C receives a notice of deficiency for taxable years 2001, 2002, and 2003 adjusting the amount of a depreciation deduction due to the Internal Revenue Service's increase to the recovery period. C submits a settlement offer relating only to 2003 that purports to be a qualified offer. C's offer is not a qualified offer because the issue in the three tax years is not separable given that the treatment of the issue in one of the years necessarily affects the treatment of the issue in the other years, and C's offer only applies to one of the years in the proceeding. In cases involving multiple tax years with nonseparable tax issues affecting all tax years, an offer is not a qualified offer unless it resolves the liability for all tax years at issue in the administrative or judicial proceeding.

# Example 8. Qualified offer rule inapplicable when all issues settled,
Taxpayer D receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter) proposing to disallow both a personal interest deduction in the amount of $10,000 (Adjustment 1), and a charitable contribution deduction in the amount of $2,000 (Adjustment 2), and to include in income $4,000 of unreported interest income (Adjustment 3). D timely files a protest with Appeals. At the Appeals conference, D presents substantiation for the charitable contribution and presents arguments that the interest paid was deductible mortgage interest and that the interest received was held in trust for Taxpayer E. At the conference, D also provides the Appeals officer assigned to D's case a written offer to settle the case for a deficiency of $2,000, exclusive of interest. The offer states that it is a qualified offer for purposes of section 7430(g) and that it will remain open for acceptance by the IRS for a period in excess of 90 days. After considering D's substantiation and arguments, the Appeals Officer accepts the $2,000 offer to settle the case in full. Although D's offer is a qualified offer, because all three adjustments contained in the qualified offer were settled, the qualified offer rule is inapplicable.

# Example 9. Qualified offer rule inapplicable when all issues contained in the qualified offer are settled; subsequently raised adjustments ignored,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 8
except that D's qualified offer was for a deficiency of $1,800 and the IRS rejected that offer. Subsequently, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency disallowing the three adjustments contained in
Example 8,
and, in addition, disallowing a home office expense in the amount of $5,000 (Adjustment 4). After petitioning the Tax Court, D presents the field attorney assigned to the case with a written offer, which is not designated as a qualified offer for purposes of section 7430(g), to settle the three adjustments that had been the subject of the qualified offer, plus adjustment 4, for a total deficiency of $2,500. After negotiating with D, a settlement is reached on the three adjustments that were the subject of the rejected qualified offer, for a deficiency of $1,800. Adjustment 4 is litigated in the Tax Court and the court determines that D is entitled to the full $5,000 deduction for that adjustment. Consequently, a decision is entered by the Tax Court reflecting the $1,800 settlement amount, which matches exactly the amount
of D's only qualified offer in the case. Although the determined liability for adjustments 1, 2, and 3 equals that of the rejected qualified offer, because all three adjustments contained in the qualified offer were settled, the qualified offer rule is inapplicable.

# Example 10. Exclusion of adjustments made after the qualified offer is made,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 9
except the settlement is reached only on adjustments 1 and 2, for a liability of $1,500. Adjustments 3 and 4 are tried in the Tax Court and in accordance with the court's opinion, the taxpayer has a $300 deficiency attributable to adjustment 3, and a $1,550 deficiency attributable to adjustment 4. Consequently, a decision is entered reflecting the $1,500 settled amount, the $300 liability on adjustment 3, and the $1,550 liability on adjustment 4. The $3,350 deficiency reflected in the Tax Court's decision exceeds the last (and only) qualified offer made by D. For purposes of determining whether D is a prevailing party as a result of having made a qualified offer in the proceeding, the liability attributable to adjustment 4, which was raised after the last qualified offer was made, is not included in the comparison of D's liability under the judgment with D's offered liability under the last qualified offer. Thus, D's $1,800 liability under the judgment, as modified for purposes of the qualified offer rule comparison, is equal to D's offered liability under the last qualified offer. Because D's liability under the last qualified offer equals or exceeds D's liability under the judgment, as calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, D is a prevailing party for purposes of section 7430. Assuming D satisfies the remaining requirements of section 7430, D may recover those reasonable administrative and litigation costs attributable to adjustment 3. To qualify for any further award of reasonable administrative and litigation costs, D must satisfy the requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A).

# Example 11. Qualified offer in a refund case,
Taxpayer E timely files an amended return claiming a refund of $1,000. This refund claim results from several omitted deductions which, if allowed, would reduce E's tax liability from $10,000 to $9,000. E receives a notice of claim disallowance and files a complaint with the appropriate United States District Court. Subsequently, E makes a qualified offer for a refund of $500. The offer is rejected and after trial the court finds E is entitled to a refund of $700. The change in E's liability from the tax shown on the return that would have resulted from the acceptance of E's qualified offer is a reduction in that liability of $500. The change in E's liability from the tax shown on the return resulting from the judgment of the court is a reduction in that liability of $700. Because E's liability under the qualified offer exceeds E's liability under the judgment, E is a prevailing party for purposes of section 7430. Assuming E satisfies the remaining requirements of section 7430, E may recover those reasonable litigation costs incurred on or after the date of the qualified offer. To qualify for any further award of reasonable administrative and litigation costs E must satisfy the requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A).

# Example 12. End of qualified offer period when case is removed from Tax Court trial calendar more than 30 days before scheduled trial calendar,
Taxpayer F has petitioned the Tax Court in response to the issuance of a notice of deficiency. F receives notice that the case will be heard on the July trial session in F's city of residence. The scheduled date for the calendar call for that trial session is July 1st. On May 15th, F's motion to remove the case from the July trial session and place it on the October trial session for that city is granted. The scheduled date for the calendar call for the October trial session is October 1st. On May 31st, F delivers a qualified offer to the field attorney assigned to the case. On August 31st, F delivers a revised qualified offer to the field attorney assigned to the case. Neither offer is accepted. The case is tried during the October trial session, and at some time thereafter, a decision is entered by the court. Assume the judgment in the case, as calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, is greater than the amount offered, as calculated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in the qualified offer delivered on May 31st, but less than the amount offered, as similarly calculated, in the qualified offer delivered on August 31st. Because the qualified offer period did not end until September 1st, and the offer of August 31st otherwise satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the offer delivered on August 31st is a qualified offer. Furthermore, because the August 31st qualified offer is closer in time to the end of the qualified offer period than the May 31st qualified offer, the August 31st qualified offer is the last qualified offer made by F. Consequently, the August 31st offer is the qualified offer that is compared to the judgment for purposes of determining whether F is a prevailing party under section 7430(c)(4)(E). Because F's liability under the August 31st qualified offer equals or exceeds F's liability under the judgment as calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, F is a prevailing party for purposes of section 7430.

# Example 13. End of qualified offer period when case is removed from Tax Court trial calendar less than 30 days before scheduled trial calendar,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 12
except that F's motion was granted on June 15th. Because the qualified offer period ended on June 1st when the case remained on the July trial session on the date that preceded by 30 days the scheduled date of the calendar call for that trial session, the offer delivered on May 31st was F's last qualified offer. The August 31st offer is not a qualified
offer for purposes of this rule. Consequently, F is not a prevailing party under the qualified offer rule. Therefore, F must satisfy the requirements of section 7430(c)(4)(A) to qualify for any award of reasonable administrative and litigation costs.

# Example 14. When a qualified offer can be made and to whom it must be made,
During the examination of Taxpayer G's return, the IRS issues a notice of deficiency without having first issued a 30-day letter. After receiving the notice of deficiency G timely petitions the Tax Court. The next day G mails an offer to the office that issued the notice of deficiency, which offer satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) through (6) of this section. This is the only written offer made by G during the administrative or court proceeding, and by its terms it is to remain open for a period in excess of 90 days after the date of mailing to the office issuing the notice of deficiency. The office that issued the notice of deficiency transmitted the offer to the field attorney with jurisdiction over the Tax Court case. After answering the case, the field attorney refers the case to Appeals pursuant to Rev. Proc. 87-24 (1987-1 C.B. 720). See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter. After careful consideration, Appeals rejects the offer and holds a conference with G during which some adjustments are settled. The remainder of the adjustments are tried in the Tax Court and G's liability resulting from the Tax Court's determinations, when added to G's liability resulting from the settled adjustments, is less than G's liability would have been under the offer rejected by Appeals. Because the Tax Court case had not yet been answered when the offer was sent, G properly mailed the offer to the office that issued the notice of deficiency. Thus, G's offer satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Furthermore, even though G did not receive a 30-day letter, G's offer was made after the beginning of the qualified offer period, satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(7) of this section, because the issuance of the statutory notice provided G with notice of the IRS's determination of a deficiency, and the docketing of the case provided G with an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals under Rev. Proc. 87-24. See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter. Because G's offer satisfied all of the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the offer was a qualified offer and G is a prevailing party.

# Example 15. Substitution of parties permitted under last qualified offer,
Taxpayer H receives a 30-day letter and participates in a conference with the Office of Appeals but no agreement is reached. Subsequently, H receives a notice of deficiency and petitions the Tax Court. Upon receiving the Internal Revenue Service's answer to the petition, H sends a qualified offer to the field attorney who signed the answer, by United States mail. The qualified offer stated that it would remain open for more than 90 days. Thirty days after making the offer, H dies and, on motion under Rule 63(a) of the Tax Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure by H's personal representative, I is substituted for H as a party in the Tax Court proceeding. I makes no qualified offers to settle the case and the case proceeds to trial, with the Tax Court issuing an opinion partially in favor of I. Even though I was not a party when the qualified offer was made by H, that offer constitutes a qualified offer because by its terms, when made, it was to remain open until at least the earlier of the date it is rejected, the date of trial, or 90 days. If the liability of I under the qualified offer, as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, equals or exceeds the liability under the judgment of the Tax Court, as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, I will be a prevailing party for purposes of an award of reasonable litigation costs under section 7430.

# Example 16. Qualified offer may not compromise interest unless it is a contested issue.
Taxpayer J receives a notice of deficiency making an adjustment resulting in a deficiency in tax of $6,500 plus a penalty of $500. Interest is not a contested issue in the proceeding. Within the qualified offer period, J submits a written offer to settle the case for a deficiency of $1,000, including all taxes, penalties, and interest. The offer states that it is a qualified offer for purposes of section 7430(g) and that it will remain open for acceptance by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of 90 days. Section 7430(g)(2)(B) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section state that the amount of a qualified offer must be without regard to interest unless interest is at issue in the proceeding. Since J's offer attempts to compromise interest, which is not a contested issue in the proceeding, it is not a qualified offer.

# Example 17. Qualified offer based on new defense or legal theory.
Taxpayers K and L received a statutory notice of deficiency for tax year 2005, a tax year when they were married and filed a joint income tax return. Taxpayer K files a separate petition claiming innocent spouse relief and simultaneously submits an offer purporting to be a qualified offer. The offer states that K is entitled to innocent spouse relief and offers to settle the 2005 deficiency as to K. K's innocent spouse claim was not raised during K and L's audit, nor was it raised during their appeals conference. Additionally, at no time prior to or contemporaneously with submitting the offer did K file with the Internal Revenue Service a Form 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse Relief, or otherwise provide the information specified in § 1.6015-5(a) of this chapter. K's offer is not a qualified offer
because K did not file a Form 8857 or otherwise provide substantiation or legal and factual arguments necessary to allow for informed consideration of the merits of the innocent spouse claim as required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section, contemporaneously with the offer or prior to making the offer.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section is applicable with respect to qualified offers made in administrative or court proceedings described in section 7430 after December 24, 2003, except that paragraph (c)(8) is effective as of
March 1, 2016.
[T.D. 9106, 68 FR 74850, Dec. 29, 2003; T.D. 9106, 69 FR 4059, Jan. 28, 2004; T.D. 9756, 81 FR 10489, Mar. 1, 2016]
§ 301.7430-8
Administrative costs incurred in damage actions for violations of section 362 or 524 of the Bankruptcy Code.
(a)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Service may grant a taxpayer's request for recovery of reasonable administrative costs incurred in connection with the administrative proceeding before the Internal Revenue Service relating to the willful violation of section 362 or 524 of the Bankruptcy Code only if the taxpayer is a prevailing party.
(b)
Prevailing party.
A taxpayer is a prevailing party for purposes of this section only if—
(1) The taxpayer satisfies the net worth and size limitations in paragraph (f) of § 301.7430-5;
(2) The taxpayer establishes that in connection with the collection of his or her federal tax an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service has willfully violated a provision of section 362 or 524 of the Bankruptcy Code; and
(3) The position of the Internal Revenue Service in the proceeding was not substantially justified.
(c)
Administrative proceeding.
For purposes of this section, an administrative proceeding is a proceeding related to an administrative claim presented to the Internal Revenue Service seeking relief from a violation of section 362 or 524 of the Bankruptcy Code by the Internal Revenue Service or recovery of damages from the Internal Revenue Service under § 301.7433-2(e).
(d)
Costs incurred after filing of bankruptcy petition.
Administrative costs may be recovered only if incurred on or after the date of filing of the bankruptcy petition that formed the basis for the stay on collection under Bankruptcy Code section 362 or the discharge injunction under Bankruptcy Code section 524, as the case might be.
(e)
Time for filing claim for administrative costs.
(1) For purposes of this section, the taxpayer must file a claim for administrative costs before the Internal Revenue Service not later than 90 days after the date the Internal Revenue Service mails to the taxpayer, or otherwise notifies the taxpayer of, the decision regarding the claim for relief from or damages relating to a violation of the collection stay or the discharge injunction.
(2) If the Internal Revenue Service denies the claim for administrative costs in whole or in part, the taxpayer must file a petition with the Bankruptcy Court for administrative costs no later than 90 days after the date on which the denial of the claim for administrative costs is mailed, or otherwise furnished, to the taxpayer. If the Internal Revenue Service does not respond on the merits to a request by the taxpayer for an award of reasonable administrative costs within six months after such request is filed, the Internal Revenue Service's failure to respond may be considered by the taxpayer as a denial of an award of reasonable administrative costs.
(3) For purposes of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, if the 90th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the 90-day period shall end on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. The term legal holiday means a legal holiday in the District of Columbia. If the request for costs is to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at an office of the Internal Revenue Service located outside the District of Columbia, the term legal holiday also means a statewide legal holiday in the state where such office is located.
(f)
Effective date.
This section is applicable with respect to actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service after July 22, 1998.
[T.D. 9050, 68 FR 14320, Mar. 25, 2003]
§ 301.7432-1
Civil cause of action for failure to release a lien.
(a)
In general.
If any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service knowingly, or by reason of negligence, fails to release a lien on property of the taxpayer in accordance with section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, such taxpayer may bring a civil action for damages against the United States in federal district court. The total amount of damages recoverable is the sum of:
(1) The actual, direct economic damages sustained by the taxpayer which, but for the officer's or the employee's knowing or negligent failure to release the lien under section 6325, would not have been sustained; and
(2) Costs of the action.
The amount of actual, direct economic damages that are recoverable is reduced to the extent such damages reasonably could have been mitigated by the plaintiff. An action for damages filed in federal district court may not be maintained unless the taxpayer has filed an administrative claim pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section and has waited the period required under paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Finding of satisfaction or unenforceability.
For purposes of this section, a finding under section 6325(a)(1) that the liability for the amount assessed, together with all interest in respect thereof, has been fully satisfied or has become legally unenforceable is treated as made on the earlier of:
(1) The date on which the district director of the district in which the taxpayer currently resides or the district in which the lien was filed finds full satisfaction or legal unenforceability; or
(2) The date on which such district director receives a request for a certificate of release of lien in accordance with § 401.6325-1(f), together with any information which is reasonably necessary for the district director to conclude that the lien has been fully satisfied or is legally unenforceable.
(c)
Actual, direct economic damages
—(1)
Definition.
Actual, direct economic damages are actual pecuniary damages sustained by the taxpayer that would not have been sustained but for an officer's or an employee's failure to release a lien in accordance with section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code. Injuries such as inconvenience, emotional distress and loss of reputation are compensable only to the extent that they result in actual pecuniary damages.
(2)
Litigation costs and administrative costs not recoverable.
Litigation costs and administrative costs described in this paragraph are not recoverable as actual, direct economic damages. Litigation costs may be recoverable under section 7430 (
see
paragraph (j) of this section) or, solely to the extent described in paragraph (d) of this section, as costs of the action.

[T.D. 7421, 41 FR 20878, May 21, 1976]
§ 301.7477-1
Declaratory judgments relating to the value of certain gifts for gift tax purposes.
(a)
In general.
If the adjustment(s) proposed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not result in any deficiency in or refund of the donor's gift tax liability for the calendar year, and if the requirements contained in paragraph (d) of this section are satisfied, then the declaratory judgment procedure under section 7477 is available to the donor for determining the amount of one or more of the donor's gifts during that calendar year for Federal gift tax purposes.
(b)
Declaratory judgment procedure
—(1)
In general.
If a donor does not resolve a dispute with the IRS concerning the value of a transfer for gift tax purposes at the Examination level, the donor will be sent a notice of preliminary determination of value (Letter 950-G or
such other document as may be utilized by the IRS for this purpose from time to time, but referred to in this section as Letter 950-G), inviting the donor to file a formal protest and to request consideration by the appropriate IRS Appeals office. See §§ 601.105 and 601.106 of this chapter. Subsequently, the donor will be sent a notice of determination of value (Letter 3569, or such other document as may be utilized from time to time by the IRS for this purpose in cases where no deficiency or refund would result, but referred to in this section as Letter 3569) if—
(i) The donor requests Appeals consideration in writing within 30 calendar days after the mailing date of the Letter 950-G, or by such later date as determined pursuant to IRS procedures, and the matter is not resolved by Appeals;
(ii) The donor does not request Appeals consideration within the time provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; or
(iii) The IRS does not issue a Letter 950-G in circumstances described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section.
(2)
Notice of determination of value.
The Letter 3569 will notify the donor of the adjustment(s) proposed by the IRS, and will advise the donor that the donor may contest the determination made by the IRS by filing a petition with the Tax Court before the 91st day after the date on which the Letter 3569 was mailed to the donor by the IRS.
(3)
Tax Court petition.
If the donor does not file a timely petition with the Tax Court, the IRS determination as set forth in the Letter 3569 will be considered the final determination of value, as defined in sections 2504(c) and 2001(f). If the donor files a timely petition with the Tax Court, the Tax Court will determine whether the donor has exhausted available administrative remedies. Under section 7477, the Tax Court is not authorized to issue a declaratory judgment unless the Tax Court finds that the donor has exhausted all administrative remedies within the IRS. See paragraph (d)(4) of this section regarding the exhaustion of administrative remedies.
(c)
Adjustments subject to declaratory judgment procedure.
The declaratory judgment procedures set forth in this section apply to adjustments involving all issues relating to the transfer, including without limitation valuation issues and legal issues involving the interpretation and application of the gift tax law.
(d)
Requirements for declaratory judgment procedure
—(1)
In general.
The declaratory judgment procedure provided in this section is available to a donor with respect to a transfer only if all the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) through (5) of this section with regard to that transfer are satisfied.
(2)
Reporting.
The transfer is shown or disclosed on the return of tax imposed by chapter 12 for the calendar year during which the transfer was made or on a statement attached to such return. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the term
return of tax imposed by chapter 12
means the last gift tax return (Form 709, “United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return” or such other form as may be utilized for this purpose from time to time by the IRS) for the calendar year filed on or before the due date of the return, including extensions granted if any, or, if a timely return is not filed, the first gift tax return for that calendar year filed after the due date. For purposes of satisfying this requirement, the transfer need not be reported in a manner that constitutes adequate disclosure within the meaning of § 301.6501(c)-1(e) or (f) (and thus for which, under §§ 20.2001-1(b) and 25.2504-2(b) of this chapter, the period during which the IRS may adjust the value of the gift will not expire). The issuance of a Letter 3569 with regard to a transfer disclosed on a return does not constitute a determination by the IRS that the transfer was adequately disclosed, or otherwise cause the period of limitations on assessment to commence to run with respect to that transfer. In addition, in the case of a transfer that is shown on the return, the IRS may in its discretion defer until a later time making a determination with regard to such transfer. If the IRS exercises its discretion to defer such determination in that case, the transfer will not be addressed in the Letter 3569 (if any) sent to the donor currently, and the donor is not yet eligible for a declaratory judgment with
regard to that transfer under section 7477.
(3)
IRS determination and actual controversy.
The IRS makes a determination regarding the gift tax treatment of the transfer that results in an actual controversy. The IRS makes a determination that results in an actual controversy with respect to a transfer by mailing a Letter 3569 to the donor, thereby notifying the donor of the adjustment(s) proposed by the IRS with regard to that transfer and of the donor's rights under section 7477.
(4)
Exhaustion of administrative remedies
—(i)
In general.
The Tax Court determines whether the donor has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the IRS for resolving the controversy.
(ii)
Appeals office consideration.
For purposes of this section, the IRS will consider a donor to have exhausted all administrative remedies if, prior to filing a petition in Tax Court (except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this section), the donor, or a qualified representative of the donor described in § 601.502 of this chapter, timely requests consideration by Appeals and participates fully (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4)(vi) of this section) in the Appeals consideration process. A timely request for consideration by Appeals is a written request from the donor for Appeals consideration made within 30 days after the mailing date of the Letter 950-G, or by such later date for responding to the Letter 950-G as is agreed to between the donor and the IRS.
(iii)
Request for Appeals office consideration not granted.
If the donor, or a qualified representative of the donor described in § 601.502 of this chapter, timely requests consideration by Appeals and Appeals does not grant that request, the IRS nevertheless will consider the donor to have exhausted all administrative remedies within the IRS for purposes of section 7477 upon the issuance of the Letter 3569, provided that the donor, or a qualified representative of the donor described in § 601.502 of this chapter, after the filing of a petition in Tax Court for a declaratory judgment pursuant to section 7477, participates fully (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4)(vi) of this section) in the Appeals office consideration if offered by the IRS while the case is in docketed status.
(iv)
No Letter 950-G issued.
If the IRS does not issue a Letter 950-G to the donor prior to the issuance of Letter 3569, the IRS nevertheless will consider the donor to have exhausted all administrative remedies within the IRS for purposes of section 7477 upon the issuance of the Letter 3569, provided that—
(A) The IRS decision not to issue the Letter 950-G was not due to actions or inactions of the donor (such as a failure to supply requested information or a current mailing address to the Area Director having jurisdiction over the tax matter); and
(B) The donor, or a qualified representative of the donor described in § 601.502 of this chapter, after the filing of a petition in Tax Court for a declaratory judgment pursuant to section 7477, participates fully (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4)(vi) of this section) in the Appeals office consideration if offered by the IRS while the case is in docketed status.
(v)
Failure to agree to extension of time for assessment.
For purposes of section 7477, the donor's refusal to agree to an extension of the time under section 6501 within which gift tax with respect to the transfer at issue (if any) may be assessed will not be considered by the IRS to constitute a failure by the donor to exhaust all administrative remedies available to the donor within the IRS.
(vi)
Participation in Appeals consideration process.
For purposes of this section, the donor or a qualified representative of the donor described in § 601.502 of this chapter participates fully in the Appeals consideration process if the donor or the qualified representative timely submits all information related to the transfer that is requested by the IRS in connection with the Appeals consideration and discloses to the Appeals office all relevant information regarding the controversy to the extent such information and its relevance is known or should be known by the donor or the qualified representative during the time the issue is under consideration by Appeals.
(5)
Timely petition in Tax Court.
The donor files a pleading with the Tax Court requesting a declaratory judgment under section 7477. This pleading must be filed with the Tax Court before the 91st day after the date of mailing of the Letter 3569 by the IRS to the donor. The pleading must be in the form of a petition subject to Tax Court Rule 211(d).
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section, and assume that in each case the Tax Court petition is filed on or after September 9, 2009.
These examples, however, do not address any other situations that might affect the Tax Court's jurisdiction over the proceeding:

# Example 1. Exhaustion of administrative remedies,
The donor (D) timely files a Form 709, “United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,” on which D reports D's completed gift of closely held stock. After conducting an examination, the IRS concludes that the value of the stock on the date of the gift is greater than the value reported on the return. Because the amount of D's available applicable credit amount under section 2505 is sufficient to cover any resulting tax liability, no gift tax deficiency will result from the adjustment. D is unable to resolve the matter with the IRS examiner. The IRS sends a Letter 950-G to D informing D of the proposed adjustment. D, within 30 calendar days after the mailing date of the letter, submits a written request for Appeals consideration. During the Appeals process, D provides to the Appeals office all additional information (if any) requested by Appeals relevant to the determination of the value of the stock in a timely fashion. The Appeals office and D are unable to reach an agreement regarding the value of the stock as of the date of the gift. The Appeals office sends D a notice of determination of value (Letter 3569). For purposes of section 7477, the IRS will consider D to have exhausted all available administrative remedies within the IRS, and thus will not contest the allegation in D's petition that D has exhausted all such administrative remedies.

# Example 2. Exhaustion of administrative remedies,
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that D does not timely request consideration by Appeals after receiving the Letter 950-G. A Letter 3569 is mailed to D more than 30 days after the mailing of the Letter 950-G and prior to the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment of gift tax. D timely files a petition in Tax Court pursuant to section 7477. After the case is docketed, D requests Appeals consideration. In this situation, because D did not respond timely to the Letter 950-G with a written request for Appeals consideration, the IRS will not consider D to have exhausted all administrative remedies available within the IRS for purposes of section 7477 prior to filing the petition in Tax Court, and thus may contest any allegation in D's petition that D has exhausted all such administrative remedies.

# Example 3. Exhaustion of administrative remedies,
D timely files a Form 709 on which D reports D's completed gifts of interests in a family limited partnership. After conducting an examination, the IRS proposes to adjust the value of the gifts as reported on the return. No gift tax deficiency will result from the adjustments, however, because D has a sufficient amount of available applicable credit amount under section 2505. D declines to consent to extend the time for the assessment of gift tax with respect to the gifts at issue. Because of the pending expiration of the period of limitation on assessment within which a gift tax, if any, could be assessed, the IRS determines that there is not adequate time for Appeals consideration. Accordingly, the IRS mails to D a Letter 3569, even though a Letter 950-G had not first been issued to D. D timely files a petition in Tax Court pursuant to section 7477. After the case is docketed in Tax Court, D is offered the opportunity for Appeals to consider any dispute regarding the determination and participates fully in the Appeals consideration process. However, the Appeals office and D are unable to resolve the issue. The IRS will consider D to have exhausted all administrative remedies available within the IRS, and thus will not assert that D has not exhausted all such administrative remedies.

# Example 4. Legal issue,
D transfers nonvested stock options to a trust for the benefit of D's child. D timely files a Form 709 reporting the transfer as a completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes and complies with the adequate disclosure requirements for purposes of triggering the commencement of the applicable statute of limitations. Pursuant to § 301.6501(c)-1(f)(5), adequate disclosure of a transfer that is reported as a completed gift on the Form 709 will commence the running of the period of limitations for assessment of gift tax on D, even if the transfer is ultimately determined to be an incomplete gift for purposes of § 25.2511-2 of this chapter. After conducting an examination, the IRS concurs with the reported valuation of the stock options, but concludes that the reported transfer is not a completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes. D is unable to resolve the matter with the IRS examiner. The IRS sends a Letter 950-G to D, who timely mails a written request for Appeals consideration. Assuming that the IRS mails to D a Letter 3569 with regard to this transfer, and that D complies with the administrative procedures set forth in this section, including
the exhaustion of all administrative remedies available within the IRS, then D may file a petition for declaratory judgment with the Tax Court pursuant to section 7477.

# Example 5. Transfers in controversy,
On April 16, 2007, D timely files a Form 709 on which D reports gifts made in 2006 of fractional interests in certain real property and of interests in a family limited partnership (FLP). However, although the gifts are disclosed on the return, the return does not contain information sufficient to constitute adequate disclosure under § 301.6501(c)-1(e) or (f) for purposes of the application of the statute of limitations on assessment of gift tax with respect to the reported gifts. The IRS conducts an examination and concludes that the value of both the interests in the real property and the FLP interests on the date(s) of the transfers are greater than the values reported on the return. No gift tax deficiency will result from the adjustments because D has a sufficient amount of remaining applicable credit amount under section 2505. However, D does not agree with the adjustments. The IRS sends a Letter 950-G to D informing D of the proposed adjustments in the value of the reported gifts. D, within 30 calendar days after the mailing date of the letter, submits a written request for Appeals consideration. The Appeals office and D are unable to reach an agreement regarding the value of any of the gifts. In the exercise of its discretion, the IRS decides to resolve currently only the value of the real property interests, and to defer the resolution of the value of the FLP interests. On May 28, 2009, the Appeals office sends D a Letter 3569 addressing only the value of the gifts of interests in the real property. Because none of the gifts reported on the return filed on April 16, 2007 were adequately disclosed for purposes of § 301.6501(c)-1(e) or (f), the period of limitations during which the IRS may adjust the value of those gifts has not begun to run. Accordingly, the Letter 3569 is timely mailed. If D timely files a petition in Tax Court pursuant to section 7477 with regard to the value of the interests in the real property, then, assuming the other requirements of section 7477 are satisfied with regard to those interests, the Tax Court's declaratory judgment, once it becomes final, will determine the value of the gifts of the interests in the real property. Because the IRS has not yet put the gift tax value of the interests in the FLP into controversy, the procedure under section 7477 is not yet available with regard to those gifts.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to civil proceedings described in section 7477 filed in the United States Tax Court on or after September 9, 2009.
[T.D. 9460, 74 FR 46347, Sept. 9, 2009; 74 FR 55136, Oct. 27, 2009]

# miscellaneous provisions
§ 301.7502-1
Timely mailing of documents and payments treated as timely filing and paying.
(a)
General rule.
Section 7502 provides that, if the requirements of that section are met, a document or payment is deemed to be filed or paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the envelope or other appropriate wrapper (envelope) in which the document or payment was mailed. Thus, if the envelope that contains the document or payment has a timely postmark, the document or payment is considered timely filed or paid even if it is received after the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. Section 7502 does not apply in determining whether a failure to file a return or pay a tax has continued for an additional month or fraction thereof for purposes of computing the penalties and additions to tax imposed by section 6651. Except as provided in section 7502(e) and § 301.7502-2, relating to the timely mailing of deposits, and paragraph (d) of this section, relating to electronically filed documents, section 7502 is applicable only to those documents or payments as defined in paragraph (b) of this section and only if the document or payment is mailed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and is delivered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Document defined.
(i) The term
document,
as used in this section, means any return, claim, statement, or other document required to be filed within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of the internal revenue laws, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section.
(ii) The term does not include returns, claims, statements, or other documents that are required under any provision of the internal revenue laws or the regulations thereunder to be delivered by any method other than mailing.
(iii) The term does not include any document filed in any court other than the Tax Court, but the term does include any document filed with the Tax Court, including a petition and a notice of appeal of a decision of the Tax Court.
(iv) The term does not include any document that is mailed to an authorized financial institution under section 6302. However, see § 301.7502-2 for special rules relating to the timeliness of deposits and documents required to be filed with deposits.
(2)
Claims for refund
—(i)
In general.
In the case of certain taxes, a return may constitute a claim for credit or refund. Section 7502 is applicable to the determination of whether a claim for credit or refund is timely filed for purposes of section 6511(a) if the conditions of section 7502 are met, irrespective of whether the claim is also a return. For rules regarding claims for refund on late filed tax returns, see paragraph (f) of this section. Section 7502 is also applicable when a claim for credit or refund is delivered after the last day of the period specified in section 6511(b)(2)(A) or in any other corresponding provision of law relating to the limit on the amount of credit or refund that is allowable.
(ii)
Example.
The rules of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(A) Taxpayer A, an individual, mailed his 2004 Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,” on May 10, 2005, but no tax was paid at that time because the tax liability disclosed by the return had been completely satisfied by the income tax that had been withheld on A's wages. On April 15, 2008, A mails, in accordance with the requirements of this section, a Form 1040X,
“Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,” claiming a refund of a portion of the tax that had been paid through withholding during 2004. The date of the postmark on the envelope containing the claim for refund is April 15, 2008. The claim is received by the IRS on April 18, 2008.
(B) Under section 6511(a), A's claim for refund is timely if filed within three years from May 10, 2005, the date on which A's 2004 return was filed. As a result of the limitations of section 6511(b)(2)(A), if A's claim is not filed within three years after April 15, 2005, the date on which A is deemed under section 6513 to have paid his 2004 tax, A is not entitled to any refund. Because A's claim for refund is postmarked and mailed in accordance with the requirements of this section and is delivered after the last day of the period specified in section 6511(b)(2)(A), section 7502 is applicable and the claim is deemed to have been filed on April 15, 2008.
(3)
Payment defined.
(i) The term
payment,
as used in this section, means any payment required to be made within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under the authority of any provision of the internal revenue laws, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section.
(ii) The term does not include any payment that is required under any provision of the internal revenue laws or the regulations thereunder to be delivered by any method other than mailing. See, for example, section 6302(h) and the regulations thereunder regarding electronic funds transfer.
(iii) The term does not include any payment, whether it is made in the form of currency or other medium of payment, unless it is actually received and accounted for. For example, if a check is used as the form of payment, this section does not apply unless the check is honored upon presentation.
(iv) The term does not include any payment to any court other than the Tax Court.
(v) The term does not include any deposit that is required to be made with an authorized financial institution under section 6302. However, see § 301.7502-2 for rules relating to the timeliness of deposits.
(4)
Last date or last day prescribed.
As used in this section, the term
the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment
includes any extension of time granted for that action. When the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, section 7503 applies. Therefore, in applying the rules of this paragraph (b)(4), the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday is treated as the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. Also, when the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment falls within a period disregarded under section 7508 or section 7508A, the next succeeding day after the expiration of the section 7508 period or section 7508A period that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday is treated as the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment.
(c)
Mailing requirements
—(1)
In general.
Section 7502 does not apply unless the document or payment is mailed in accordance with the following requirements:
(i)
Envelope and address.
The document or payment must be contained in an envelope, properly addressed to the agency, officer, or office with which the document is required to be filed or to which the payment is required to be made.
(ii)
Timely deposited in U.S. mail.
The document or payment must be deposited within the prescribed time in the mail in the United States with sufficient postage prepaid. For this purpose, a document or payment is deposited in the mail in the United States when it is deposited with the domestic mail service of the U.S. Postal Service. The domestic mail service of the U.S. Postal Service, as defined by the Domestic Mail Manual as incorporated by reference in the postal regulations, includes mail transmitted within, among, and between the United States of America, its territories and possessions, and Army post offices (APO), fleet post offices (FPO), and the United Nations, NY. (See Domestic Mail Manual, section G011.2.1, as incorporated by reference in 39 CFR 111.1.) Section 7502
does not apply to any document or payment that is deposited with the mail service of any other country.
(iii)
Postmark
—(A)
U.S. Postal Service postmark.
If the postmark on the envelope is made by the U.S. Postal Service, the postmark must bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. If the postmark does not bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment, the document or payment is considered not to be timely filed or paid, regardless of when the document or payment is deposited in the mail. Accordingly, the sender who relies upon the applicability of section 7502 assumes the risk that the postmark will bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment. See, however, paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to the use of registered mail or certified mail to avoid this risk. If the postmark on the envelope is made by the U.S. Postal Service but is not legible, the person who is required to file the document or make the payment has the burden of proving the date that the postmark was made. Furthermore, if the envelope that contains a document or payment has a timely postmark made by the U.S. Postal Service, but it is received after the time when a document or payment postmarked and mailed at that time would ordinarily be received, the sender may be required to prove that it was timely mailed.
(B)
Postmark made by other than U.S. Postal Service
—(
1
)
In general.
If the postmark on the envelope is made other than by the U.S. Postal Service—
(
i
) The postmark so made must bear a legible date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment; and
(
ii
) The document or payment must be received by the agency, officer, or office with which it is required to be filed not later than the time when a document or payment contained in an envelope that is properly addressed, mailed, and sent by the same class of mail would ordinarily be received if it were postmarked at the same point of origin by the U.S. Postal Service on the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment.
(
2
)
Document or payment received late.
If a document or payment described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B)(
1
) is received after the time when a document or payment so mailed and so postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service would ordinarily be received, the document or payment is treated as having been received at the time when a document or payment so mailed and so postmarked would ordinarily be received if the person who is required to file the document or make the payment establishes—
(
i
) That it was actually deposited in the U.S. mail before the last collection of mail from the place of deposit that was postmarked (except for the metered mail) by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document or making the payment;
(
ii
) That the delay in receiving the document or payment was due to a delay in the transmission of the U.S. mail; and
(
iii
) The cause of the delay.
(
3
)
U.S. and non-U.S. postmarks.
If the envelope has a postmark made by the U.S. Postal Service in addition to a postmark not so made, the postmark that was not made by the U.S. Postal Service is disregarded, and whether the envelope was mailed in accordance with this paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) will be determined solely by applying the rule of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.
(2)
Registered or certified mail.
If the document or payment is sent by U.S. registered mail, the date of registration of the document or payment is treated as the postmark date. If the document or payment is sent by U.S. certified mail and the sender's receipt is postmarked by the postal employee to whom the document or payment is presented, the date of the U.S. postmark on the receipt is treated as the postmark date of the document or payment. Accordingly, the risk that the document or payment will not be postmarked on the day that it is deposited
in the mail may be eliminated by the use of registered or certified mail.
(3)
Private delivery services.
Under section 7502(f)(1), a service of a private delivery service (PDS) may be treated as an equivalent to United States mail for purposes of the postmark rule if the Commissioner determines that the service satisfies the conditions of section 7502(f)(2). Thus, the Commissioner may, in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), prescribe procedures and additional rules to designate a service of a PDS for purposes of the postmark rule of section 7502(a).
(d)
Electronically filed documents
—(1)
In general.
A document filed electronically with an electronic return transmitter (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and authorized pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in the manner and time prescribed by the Commissioner is deemed to be filed on the date of the electronic postmark (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) given by the authorized electronic return transmitter. Thus, if the electronic postmark is timely, the document is considered filed timely although it is received by the agency, officer, or office after the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing such document.
(2)
Authorized electronic return transmitters.
The Commissioner may enter into an agreement with an electronic return transmitter or prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance the procedures under which the electronic return transmitter is authorized to provide taxpayers with an electronic postmark to acknowledge the date and time that the electronic return transmitter received the electronically filed document.
(3)
Definitions
—(i)
Electronic return transmitter.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), the term
electronic return transmitter
has the same meaning as contained in section 3.01(4) of Rev. Proc. 2000-31 (2000-31 I.R.B. 146 (July 31, 2000))(see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or in procedures prescribed by the Commissioner.
(ii)
Electronic postmark.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), the term
electronic postmark
means a record of the date and time (in a particular time zone) that an authorized electronic return transmitter receives the transmission of a taxpayer's electronically filed document on its host system. However, if the taxpayer and the electronic return transmitter are located in different time zones, it is the taxpayer's time zone that controls the timeliness of the electronically filed document.
(e)
Delivery
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in section 7502(f) and paragraphs (c)(3) and (d) of this section, section 7502 is not applicable unless the document or payment is delivered by U.S. mail to the agency, officer, or office with which the document is required to be filed or to which payment is required to be made.
(2)
Exceptions to actual delivery
—(i)
Registered and certified mail.
In the case of a document (but not a payment) sent by registered or certified mail, proof that the document was properly registered or that a postmarked certified mail sender's receipt was properly issued and that the envelope was properly addressed to the agency, officer, or office constitutes prima facie evidence that the document was delivered to the agency, officer, or office. Other than direct proof of actual delivery, proof of proper use of registered or certified mail, and proof of proper use of a duly designated PDS as provided for by paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, are the exclusive means to establish prima facie evidence of delivery of a document to the agency, officer, or office with which the document is required to be filed. No other evidence of a postmark or of mailing will be prima facie evidence of delivery or raise a presumption that the document was delivered.
(ii)
Equivalents of registered and certified mail.
Under section 7502(f)(3), the Secretary may extend the prima facie evidence of delivery rule of section 7502(c)(1)(A) to a service of a designated PDS, which is substantially equivalent to United States registered or certified mail. Thus, the Commissioner may, in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), prescribe procedures and additional rules to designate a service
of a PDS for purposes of demonstrating prima facie evidence of delivery of a document pursuant to section 7502(c).
(f)
Claim for credit or refund on late filed tax return
—(1)
In general.
Generally, an original income tax return may constitute a claim for credit or refund of income tax. See § 301.6402-3(a)(5). Other original tax returns can also be considered claims for credit or refund if the liability disclosed on the return is less than the amount of tax that has been paid. If section 7502 would not apply to a return (but for the operation of paragraph (f)(2) of this section) that is also considered a claim for credit or refund because the envelope that contains the return does not have a postmark dated on or before the due date of the return, section 7502 will apply separately to the claim for credit or refund if—
(i) The date of the postmark on the envelope is within the period that is three years (plus the period of any extension of time to file) from the day the tax is paid or considered paid (see section 6513), and the claim for credit or refund is delivered after this three-year period; and
(ii) The conditions of section 7502 are otherwise met.
(2)
Filing date of late filed return.
If the conditions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section are met, the late filed return will be deemed filed on the postmark date.
(3)
Example.
The rules of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) Taxpayer A, an individual, mailed his 2001 Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,” on April 15, 2005, claiming a refund of amounts paid through withholding during 2001.

§ 301.7503-1
Time for performance of acts where last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
(a)
In general.
Section 7503 provides that when the last day prescribed under authority of any internal revenue law for the performance of any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, such act shall be considered performed timely if performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For this purpose, any authorized extension of time shall be included in determining the last day for performance of any act. Section 7503 is applicable only in case an act is required under authority of any internal revenue law to be performed on or before a prescribed date or within a prescribed period. For
example, if the 2-year period allowed by section 6532(a)(1) to bring a suit for refund of any internal revenue tax expires on Thursday, November 23, 1995 (Thanksgiving Day), the suit will be timely if filed on Friday, November 24, 1995, in the Court of Federal Claims, or in a district court. Section 7503 applies to acts to be performed by the taxpayer (such as, the filing of any return of, and the payment of, any income, estate, or gift tax; the filing of a petition with the Tax Court for redetermination of a deficiency, or for review of a decision rendered by such Court; the filing of a claim for credit or refund of any tax) and acts to be performed by the Commissioner, a district director, or the director of a regional service center (such as, the giving of any notice with respect to, or making any demand for the payment of, any tax; the assessment or collection of any tax).
(b)
Legal holidays.
For the purpose of section 7503, the term
legal holiday
includes the legal holidays in the District of Columbia as found in D.C. Code Ann. 28-2701. In the case of any return, statement, or other document required to be filed, or any other act required under the authority of the internal revenue laws to be performed, at an office of the Internal Revenue Service, or any other office or agency of the United States, located outside the District of Columbia but within an internal revenue district, the term
legal holiday
includes, in addition to the legal holidays in the District of Columbia, any statewide legal holiday of the state where the act is required to be performed. If the act is performed in accordance with law at an office of the Internal Revenue Service or any other office or agency of the United States located in a territory or possession of the United States, the term
legal holiday
includes, in addition to the legal holidays in the District of Columbia, any legal holiday that is recognized throughout the territory or possession in which the office is located.

Other bonds, notes, checks, and other securities shall be disposed of in accordance with instructions issued by the Commissioner.

The time, place, manner, and terms of sale of personal property acquired for the United States shall be as follows:

A public notice of sale shall be posted at the post office nearest the place of sale and in at least two other public places. The notice shall specify the property to be sold and the time, place, manner, and conditions of sale. In addition, the district director may use such other methods of advertising as he believes will result in obtaining the highest price for the property. The place of sale shall be within the internal revenue district where the property was originally acquired by the United States. However, if the district director believes that a substantially higher price may be obtained, the sale may be held outside his district.
(ii)
Rejection of bids and adjournment of sale.
The internal revenue officer conducting the sale reserves the right to reject any and all bids and withdraw the property from the sale. When it appears to the internal revenue officer conducting the sale that an adjournment of the sale will best serve the interest of the United States, he may order the sale adjourned from time to time. If the sale is adjourned for more than 30 days in the aggregate, public notice of the sale must again be given in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(iii)
Liquidated damages.
The notice shall state whether, in the case of default in payment of the bid price, any amount deposited with the United States will be retained as liquidated damages. In case liquidated damages are provided, the amount thereof shall not exceed $200.
(3)
Agreement to bid.
The district director may, before giving notice of sale, solicit offers from prospective bidders and enter into agreements with such persons that they will bid at least a specified amount in case the property is offered for sale. In such cases, the district director may also require such persons to make deposits to secure the performance of their agreements. Any such deposit, but not more than $200, shall be retained as liquidated damages in case such person fails to bid the specified amount and the property is not sold for as much as the amount specified in such agreement.

(i) Payment in full upon acceptance of the highest bid, without regard to the amount of such bid, or

(5)
Method of sale.
The property may be sold either—
(i) At public auction, at which open competitive bids shall be received, or
(ii) At public sale under sealed bids.

(iv)
Time for receiving and opening bids.
Each bid shall be submitted in a securely sealed envelope. The bidder shall indicate in the upper left hand corner of the envelope his name and address and the time and place of sale as announced in the public notice of sale. A bid will not be considered unless it is received by the internal revenue officer conducting the sale prior to the opening of the bids. The bids will be opened at the time and place stated in the notice of sale, or at the time fixed in the announcement of the adjournment of the sale.
(v)
Consideration of bids.
The internal revenue officer conducting the sale shall have the right to waive any technical defects in a bid. After the opening, examination, and consideration of all bids, the internal revenue officer conducting the sale shall announce the amount of the highest bid or bids and the name of the successful bidder or bidders, unless in the opinion of the officer a higher price can be obtained for the property than has been bid. In the event the highest bids are equal in amount (and unless in the opinion of the internal revenue officer conducting the sale a higher price can be obtained for the property than has been bid), the officer shall determine the successful bidder by drawing lots. Any remittance submitted in connection with an unsuccessful bid shall be returned to the bidder at the conclusion of the sale.
(vi)
Withdrawal of bids.
A bid may be withdrawn on written or telegraphic request received from the bidder prior to the time fixed for opening the bids.
A technical defect in a bid confers no right on the bidder for the withdrawal of his bid after it has been opened.
(7)
Payment of bid price.
All payments for property sold pursuant to this section shall be made by cash or by a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order. If payment in full is required upon acceptance of the highest bid, the payment shall be made at such time. If payment in full is not made at such time, the internal revenue officer conducting the sale may forthwith proceed again to sell the property in the manner provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph (a). If deferred payment is permitted, the initial payment shall be made upon acceptance of the bid, and the balance shall be paid on or before the date fixed for payment thereof. Any remittance submitted with a successful sealed bid shall be applied toward the purchase price.
(8)
Delivery and removal of personal property.
The risk of loss is on the purchaser of the property upon acceptance of his bid. Possession of any property shall not be delivered to the purchaser until the purchase price has been paid in full. If payment of part of the purchase price for the property is deferred, the United States will retain possession of such property as security for the payment of the balance of the purchase price and, as agent for the purchaser, will cause the property to be cared for until the purchase price has been paid in full or the sale is declared null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price. In such case, all charges and expenses incurred in caring for the property after acceptance of the bid shall be borne by the purchaser.
(9)
Certificate of sale.
The internal revenue officer conducting the sale shall issue a certificate of sale to the purchaser upon payment in full of the purchase price.
(b)
Accounting.
In case of the resale of such property, the proceeds of the sale shall be paid into the Treasury as internal revenue collections, and there shall be rendered by the district director a distinct account of all charges incurred in such sale. For additional accounting rules, see section 7809 and the instructions thereunder.

§ 301.7507-1
Banks and trust companies covered.
(a) Section 7507 applies to any national bank, or bank or trust company organized under State law, a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits and making loans and discounts, and which has—
(1) Ceased to do business by reason of insolvency or bankruptcy, or
(2) Been released or discharged from its liability to its depositors for any part of their deposit claims, and the depositors have accepted in lieu thereof a lien upon its subsequent earnings or claims against its assets either (i) segregated and held by it for benefit of the depositors or (ii) transferred to an individual or corporate trustee or agent who liquidates, holds or operates the assets for the benefit of the depositors.
(b) As used in this section and §§ 301.7507-2 to 301.7507-11, inclusive:
(1) The term
bank,
unless otherwise indicated by the context, means any national bank, or bank or trust company organized under State law, within the scope of section 7507.
(2) The terms
statute of limitations
and
limitations
mean all applicable provisions of law (including section 7507) which impose, change, or affect the limitations, conditions, or requirements relative to the allowance of refunds and abatements or the assessment or collection of tax, as the case may be.
(3) The term
segregated assets
includes transferred or trusteed assets, or assets set aside or earmarked, to all or a portion of which, or the proceeds of which, the depositors are absolutely or conditionally entitled.

[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 8641, 60 FR 66105, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 301.7507-2
Scope of section generally.
(a)
Purpose.
Section 7507 is intended to assist depositors of a bank which had ceased to do business by reason of insolvency to recover their deposits, by prohibiting collection of taxes of the bank which would diminish the assets necessary for payment of its depositors and also assist depositors of banks which are in financial difficulties but which, in certain conditions, continue in business.
(b)
Requisites of application.
In order that section 7507 shall operate in a case where the bank continues business it is necessary that the depositors shall agree to accept, in lieu of all or a part of their deposit claims as such, claims against segregated assets, or a lien upon subsequent earnings of the bank, or both. When such an agreement exists, no tax diminishing such assets or earnings, or both, otherwise available and necessary for payment of depositors, may be collected therefrom. If, under such an agreement, the depositors have the right also to look to the unsegregated assets of the bank for recovery, in whole or in part, the unsegregated assets are likewise, until they exceed the amount of the depositors' claims chargeable thereto, unavailable for tax collection. Any tax of such a bank, or part of any tax, which is once uncollectible under section 7507, cannot thereafter be collected except from any residue of segregated assets remaining after claims of depositors against such assets have been paid.
(c)
Interest.
For the purposes of section 7507, depositors' claims include bona fide interest, either on the deposits as such, or on the claims accepted in lieu of deposits as such.
(d)
Limitations on immunity.
Section 7507 is not primarily intended for the relief of banks as such. It does not prevent tax collection, from assets not necessary, or not available, for payment of depositors, from a bank within section 7507(a), at any time within the statute of limitations. In other words, the immunity of such a bank is not complete, but ceases whenever, within the statutory period for collection, it becomes possible to make collection without diminishing assets necessary for payment of depositors. In the case of a bank within section 7507(b), any immunity to which the bank is entitled is absolute except as to segregated assets. Any tax coming within such immunity may never be collected. With respect to segregated assets, such a bank is subject to the same rule as a bank within section 7507(a), that is to say, after claims of depositors against segregated assets have been paid, any surplus is subject, within the statute of limitations, to collection of any tax, due at any time, the collection of which was suspended by the section. The section is not for the relief of creditors other than depositors, although it may incidentally operate for their benefit. See § 301.7507-4 and paragraph (b) of § 301.7507-9.
§ 301.7507-3
Segregated or transferred assets.
(a)
In general.
In a case involving segregated or transferred assets, it is not necessary, for application of section 7507, that the assets shall technically constitute a trust fund. It is sufficient that segregated assets be definitely separated from other assets of the bank and that transferred assets be definitely separated both from other assets of the bank and from other assets held or owned by the trustee or agent to whom assets of the bank have been transferred; that the bank be wholly or partially released from liability for repayment of deposits as such; and that the depositors have claims against the separated assets. Any excess of separated assets over the amount necessary for payment of such depositors will be available for tax collection after full payment of depositors' claims under the agreement against such assets. But see paragraph (a) of § 301.7507-9.
(b)
Corporate transferees.
Where the segregated assets are transferred to a separate corporate trustee or corporate agent, the assets and earnings therefrom are within the protection of the section, until full payment of depositors' claims against such assets and earnings, no matter by whom the stock of such corporation is held, and no matter whether the assets be liquidated or operated or held for benefit of the depositors.
§ 301.7507-4
Unsegregated assets.
(a)
Depositors' claims against assets.
(1) Claims of depositors, to the extent that they are to be satisfied out of segregated assets, will not be considered in determining the availability of unsegregated assets for tax collection. If depositors have agreed to accept payment out of segregated assets only, collection of tax from unsegregated assets will not diminish the assets available and necessary for payment of the depositors' claims. Thus, it may be possible to collect taxes from the unsegregated assets of a bank although the segregated assets are immune under the section.
(2) If the unsegregated assets of the bank are subject to any portion of the depositors' claims, such unsegregated assets will be within the immunity of the section only to the extent necessary to satisfy the claims to which such assets are subject. Taxes will still be collectible from the unsegregated assets to the extent of the amount by which the total value of such assets exceeds the liability to depositors to be satisfied therefrom. Therefore, if, for example, in the case of a bank having a tax liability, not previously immune under the section, of $50,000, the deposit claims against the bank are in the amount of $75,000, and the assets available for satisfaction of deposit claims amount to $100,000, the $50,000 tax is collectible to the extent of the $25,000 excess of assets over deposit claims. Collection is not to be postponed until the full amount of the tax is collectible.
(b)
Depositors' claims against earnings.
Even though under a bona fide agreement a bank has been released from depositors' claims as to unsegregated assets, if all or a portion of its earnings are subject to depositors' claims, all assets the earnings from which, in whole or part, are charged with the payment of depositors' claims, will be immune from tax collection. But see paragraph (a) of § 301.7507-5.
§ 301.7507-5
Earnings.
(a)
Availability for tax collection.
Earnings of a bank within section 7507(b), whether from segregated or unsegregated assets, which are necessary for, applicable to, and actually used for, payment of depositors' claims under an agreement, are within the immunity of the section. If only a portion or percentage of income from segregated or unsegregated assets is available and necessary for payment of depositors' claims, the remaining income is available for tax collection. Earnings of the bank's first fiscal year ending after the making of the agreement not applicable to payment of depositors will be assumed to be applicable for collection of any tax due prior or subsequent to execution of the agreement. Earnings of subsequent fiscal periods from unsegregated assets not applicable to depositors' claims will be assumed to be applicable to payment of taxes as to which immunity under the section has not previously attached. Earnings from segregated assets are available for collection of tax, whether previously uncollectible under the section or not, after depositors' claims against such assets have been paid in full. See paragraph (a) of § 301.7507-3 and paragraph (a) of § 301.7507-9.
(b)
Tax computation.
The fact that earnings of a given year may be wholly or partly unavailable under section 7507 for collection of taxes does not exempt the income for that year, or any part thereof, from tax liability. The section affects collectibility only, and is not concerned with taxability. Accordingly, the taxpayer's income tax return shall correctly compute the tax liability, even though in the opinion of the taxpayer it is immune from tax collection under the section. The tax shall be determined with respect to the entire gross income and not merely with respect to the portion of the earnings out of which tax may be collected. As to establishment of immunity from tax collection see § 301.7507-7.

# Example.
(1) An agreement, executed in the year 1954 between a bank and its depositors, provides (i) that certain assets are to be segregated for the benefit of the depositors who have waived (as claims against unsegregated assets of the bank) a percentage of the deposits; (ii) that 40 percent of the bank's net earnings, for years beginning with 1954, from unsegregated assets, shall be paid to the depositors until the portion of their claims waived with respect to unsegregated assets of the bank has been paid; and (iii) that the unsegregated assets shall not be subject to depositors' claims. The net income of the bank for the calendar year 1954 is $10,000, $4,000 produced by the segregated, and $6,000 produced by the unsegregated assets. Such amount shall be considered the net earnings for the purpose of section 7507 in computing the portion of the earnings to be paid to depositors. The bank has an outstanding tax liability for prior years of $7,000. The income tax liability of the bank for 1954 is 30 percent of $10,000, or $3,000, making a total outstanding tax liability of $10,000. The portion of the earnings of the bank for 1954 remaining after provision for depositors is $3,600 ($6,000 less 40 percent thereof, or $2,400). It will be assumed that of the total outstanding tax liability of $10,000, $3,600 may be assessed and collected, leaving $6,400 to be collected from any excess of the segregated assets after claims of depositors against such segregated assets have been paid in full. No part of the $6,400 immune from collection from 1954 earnings may be collected thereafter from unsegregated assets of the bank or earnings therefrom, so that except for any possible surplus of the segregated assets the $6,400 is uncollectible.
(2) In the year 1955, the earnings are again $10,000, $4,000 from segregated and $6,000 from unsegregated assets, as in 1954. However, the return filed shows income of $5,000 and a tax liability of $1,500. An investigation shows the true income to be $10,000, on which the tax is $3,000. The full $3,000 will be assumed to be collectible. The $600 difference between $3,600 (the excess of earnings from unsegregated assets over the amount going to the depositors), and the $3,000 tax for 1955, is not available for collection of the tax for prior years, which became immune as described above, but may be available for collection of tax for subsequent years.
(c) No significance attaches to the selection of the years 1954 and 1955 in the example set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The rules indicated by the
example are equally applicable to subsequent or prior years not excluded by limitations.
§ 301.7507-6
Abatement and refund.
(a) An assessment or collection, no matter when made, if contrary to section 7507, is subject to abatement or refund within the applicable statutory period of limitations.
(b) Collection from a bank within section 7507(b) which diminishes assets necessary for payment of depositors, if made prior to agreement with depositors, is not contrary to the section, and affords no ground for refund.
(c) Any abatement or refund is subject to existing statutory periods of limitation, which periods are not suspended or extended by section 7507. In order to secure a refund of any taxes paid for any taxable year during the period of immunity the bank must file claim therefor.
§ 301.7507-7
Establishment of immunity.
(a) The mere allegation of insolvency, or that depositors have claims against segregated or other assets or earnings, will not of itself secure immunity from tax collection. It must be affirmatively established to the satisfaction of the district director that collection of tax will be contrary to section 7507. See also § 301.7507-8.
(b) Any claim, by a bank, of immunity under section 7507(b), shall be supported by a statement, under oath or affirmation, which shall show: (1) The total of depositors' claims outstanding, and (2) separately and in detail, the amount of each of the following, and the amount of depositors' claims properly chargeable against each: (i) Segregated or transferred assets; (ii) unsegregated assets; (iii) estimated future average annual earnings and profits; (iv) amount collectible from shareholders; and (v) any other resources available for payment of depositors' claims. The detail shall show the full amount of depositors' claims chargeable against each of the items in subdivisions (i) to (v), inclusive, of this subparagraph even though part or all of the amount chargeable against a particular item is also chargeable against some other item or items. There shall also be filed a copy of any agreement between the bank and its depositors, and any other agreement or document bearing on the claim of immunity. The statement shall show the basis, as “book,” “market,” etc., of valuation of the assets.
§ 301.7507-8
Procedure during immunity.
(a)
Statements to be filed.
As long as complete or partial immunity is claimed, a bank within section 7507(b) shall file with each income tax return a statement as required by § 301.7507-7, in duplicate, and shall also file such additional statements as the district director may require. Whether or not additional statements shall be required, and the frequency thereof, will depend on the circumstances, including the financial status and apparent prospects of the bank, and the time which is available for assessment and collection. If a copy of an agreement or document has once been filed, a copy of the same agreement or document need not again be filed with a subsequent statement, if it is shown by the subsequent statement, when and where and with what return the copy was filed. In case of amendment a copy of the amendment must be filed with the return for the taxable year in which the amendment is made.
(b)
Failure to file.
Failure of a bank to file any required statement will be treated as indicating that the bank is not entitled to immunity.
§ 301.7507-9
Termination of immunity.
(a)
In general.
(1) In the case of a bank within section 7507(a), immunity will end whenever, and to the extent that, taxes may be assessed and collected, within the applicable limitation periods as extended by section 7507, without diminishing the assets available and necessary for payment of depositors. Immunity of a bank within section 7507 (b) is terminated, as to segregated assets, whenever claims of depositors against such assets have been paid in full. See § 301.7507-3. As to segregated assets, the termination of immunity is complete, and any balance remaining after payment of depositors is available, within statutory limitations, for collection of tax due at any
time. However, taxes of the bank will be collectible from segregated assets only to the extent that the bank has a legal or equitable interest therein. Assets as to which there has been a complete conveyance for benefit of depositors, and the bank has bonafide been divested of all legal and equitable interest, are not available for collection of the bank's tax liability.
(2) As to unsegregated assets of a bank within section 7507(b), immunity terminates only as to taxes thereafter becoming due. When taxes are once immune from collection, the immunity as to unsegregated assets is absolute. But see paragraph (a) of § 301.7507-4.
(b)
General creditors.
While the immunity from tax collection is for protection of depositors, and not for benefit of general creditors, in some cases the immunity will not end until the assets are sufficient to cover indebtedness of creditors generally. This situation will exist where under applicable law the claims of general creditors are on a parity with those of depositors, so that to pay depositors in full it is necessary to pay all creditors in full.
(c)
Shareholder liability.
In determining the sufficiency of the assets to satisfy the depositors' claims, shareholders' liability to the extent collectible shall be treated as available assets. See § 301.7507-7.
(d)
Deposit insurance.
Deposit insurance payable to depositors shall not be treated as an asset of the bank and shall be disregarded in determining the sufficiency of the assets to meet the claims of depositors. For taxable years ending on or after April 22, 1992, deposit insurance does not include Federal Financial Assistance (as defined in section 597) and other payments described in section 597(a) prior to its amendment by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 and, therefore, such payments must be taken into account to determine whether a bank's assets are sufficient to meet claims of depositors.
(e)
Notice by bank.
A bank within section 7507(b), upon termination of immunity with respect to (1) earnings, (2) segregated or transferred assets, or (3) unsegregated assets, shall immediately notify the district director for the internal revenue district in which the taxpayer's returns were filed of such termination of immunity. See paragraph (b) of § 301.7507-8.
(f)
Payment by bank.
As immunity terminates with respect to any assets, it will be the duty of the bank, without notice from the district director, to make payment of taxes collectible from such assets.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 8641, 60 FR 66105, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 301.7507-10
Collection of tax after termination of immunity.
If, in the case of a bank within section 7507(b), segregated assets (including earnings therefrom), in excess of those necessary for payment of outstanding deposits become available, such excess of segregated assets shall be applied toward satisfaction of accumulated outstanding taxes previously immune under the section, and not barred by the statute of limitations. But see § 301.7507-3. Where sufficient segregated or unsegregated assets are available, statutory interest shall be collected with the tax. When unsegregated assets or earnings therefrom previously immune become available for tax collection, they will be available only for collection of taxes (including interest and other additions) becoming due after immunity ceases. See the example in paragraph (b) of § 301.7507-5.
§ 301.7507-11
Exception of employment taxes.
The immunity granted by section 7507 does not apply to taxes imposed by chapter 21 or chapter 23 of the Code.
§ 301.7508-1
Time for performing certain acts postponed by reason of service in a combat zone.
(a)
General rule.
The period of time that may be disregarded for performing certain acts under section 7508 applies to acts described in section 7508(a)(1) and to other acts specified in a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(b)
Effective date.
This section applies to any period for performing an act
that has not expired before December 30, 1999.
[T.D. 8911, 65 FR 78411, Dec. 15, 2000]
§ 301.7508A-1
Postponement of certain tax-related deadlines by reasons of a federally declared disaster or terroristic or military action.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules by which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may postpone deadlines for performing certain acts with respect to taxes other than taxes not administered by the IRS such as firearms tax (chapter 32, section 4181); harbor maintenance tax (chapter 36, section 4461); and alcohol and tobacco taxes (subtitle E).
(b)
Postponed deadlines
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a taxpayer determined by the Secretary to be affected by a federally declared disaster (as defined in section 1033(h)(3)) or a terroristic or military action (as defined in section 692(c)(2)), the Secretary may specify a postponement period (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) of up to one year that may be disregarded in determining under the internal revenue laws, in respect of any tax liability of the affected taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section)—
(i) Whether any or all of the acts described in paragraph (c) of this section were performed within the time prescribed;
(ii) The amount of interest, penalty, additional amount, or addition to the tax; and
(iii) The amount of credit or refund.
(2)
Effect of postponement period.
When an affected taxpayer is required to perform a tax-related act by a due date that falls within the postponement period, the affected taxpayer is eligible for postponement of time to perform the act until the last day of the period. The affected taxpayer is eligible for relief from interest, penalties, additional amounts, or additions to tax during the postponement period.
(3)
Interaction between postponement period and extensions of time to file or pay
—(i)
In general.
The postponement period under section 7508A runs concurrently with extensions of time to file and pay, if any, under other sections of the Internal Revenue Code.
(ii)
Original due date prior to, but extended due date within, the postponement period.
When the original due date precedes the first day of the postponement period and the extended due date falls within the postponement period, the following rules apply. If an affected taxpayer received an extension of time to file, filing will be timely on or before the last day of the postponement period, and the taxpayer is eligible for relief from penalties or additions to tax related to the failure to file during the postponement period. Similarly, if an affected taxpayer received an extension of time to pay, payment will be timely on or before the last day of the postponement period, and the taxpayer is eligible for relief from interest, penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts related to the failure to pay during the postponement period.
(4)
Due date not extended.
The postponement of the deadline of a tax-related act does not extend the due date for the act, but merely allows the IRS to disregard a time period of up to one year for performance of the act. To the extent that other statutes may rely on the date a return is due to be filed, the postponement period will not change the due date of the return.
(5)
Additional relief.
The rules of this paragraph (b) demonstrate how the IRS generally implements section 7508A. The IRS may determine, however, that additional relief to taxpayers is appropriate and may provide additional relief to the extent allowed under section 7508A. To the extent that the IRS grants additional relief, the IRS will provide specific guidance on the scope of relief in the manner provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(c)
Acts for which a period may be disregarded
—(1)
Acts performed by taxpayers.
Paragraph (b) of this section applies to the following acts performed by affected taxpayers (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section)—
(i) Filing any return of income tax, estate tax, gift tax, generation-skipping transfer tax, excise tax (other than firearms tax (chapter 32, section 4181); harbor maintenance tax (chapter 36, section 4461); and alcohol and tobacco taxes (subtitle E)), or employment tax (including income tax withheld at source and income tax imposed
by subtitle C or any law superseded thereby);
(ii) Paying any income tax, estate tax, gift tax, generation-skipping transfer tax, excise tax (other than firearms tax (chapter 32, section 4181); harbor maintenance tax (chapter 36, section 4461); and alcohol and tobacco taxes (subtitle E)), employment tax (including income tax withheld at source and income tax imposed by subtitle C or any law superseded thereby), any installment of those taxes (including payment under section 6159 relating to installment agreements), or of any other liability to the United States in respect thereof, but not including deposits of taxes pursuant to section 6302 and the regulations under section 6302;
(iii) Making contributions to a qualified retirement plan (within the meaning of section 4974(c)) under section 219(f)(3), 404(a)(6), 404(h)(1)(B), or 404(m)(2); making distributions under section 408(d)(4); recharacterizing contributions under section 408A(d)(6); or making a rollover under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), or 408(d)(3);
(iv) Filing a petition with the Tax Court, or for review of a decision rendered by the Tax Court;
(v) Filing a claim for credit or refund of any tax;
(vi) Bringing suit upon a claim for credit or refund of any tax; and
(vii) Any other act specified in a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, announcement, news release, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(2)
Acts performed by the government.
Paragraph (b) of this section applies to the following acts performed by the government—
(i) Assessing any tax;
(ii) Giving or making any notice or demand for the payment of any tax, or with respect to any liability to the United States in respect of any tax;
(iii) Collecting by the Secretary, by levy or otherwise, of the amount of any liability in respect of any tax;
(iv) Bringing suit by the United States, or any officer on its behalf, in respect of any liability in respect of any tax;
(v) Allowing a credit or refund of any tax; and
(vi) Any other act specified in a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(d)

(ii) Any business entity or sole proprietor whose principal place of business is located in a covered disaster area;
(iii) Any individual who is a relief worker affiliated with a recognized government or philanthropic organization and who is assisting in a covered disaster area;
(iv) Any individual whose principal residence (for purposes of section 1033(h)(4)), or any business entity or sole proprietor whose principal place of business is not located in a covered disaster area, but whose records necessary to meet a deadline for an act specified in paragraph (c) of this section are maintained in a covered disaster area;

(viii) Any individual visiting the covered disaster area who was killed or injured as a result of the disaster; or
(ix) Any other person determined by the IRS to be affected by a federally declared disaster (within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3)).
(2)
Covered disaster area
means an area of a federally declared disaster (within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3)) to which the IRS has determined paragraph (b) of this section applies.
(3)
Postponement period
means the period of time (up to one year) that the IRS postpones deadlines for performing tax-related acts under section 7508A.
(e)
Notice of postponement of certain acts.
If a tax-related deadline is postponed under section 7508A and this section, the IRS will publish a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, announcement, news release, or other guidance (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) describing the acts postponed, the postponement period, and the location of the covered disaster area. Guidance under this paragraph (e) will be published as soon as practicable after the occurrence of a terroristic or military action or declaration of a federally declared disaster.
(f)
Examples.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, has its principal place of business in County M in State W. Pursuant to a timely filed request for extension of time to file, Corporation X's 2008 Form 1120, “U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return,” is due on September 15, 2009. Also due on September 15, 2009, is Corporation X's third quarter estimated tax payment for 2009. Corporation X's 2009 third quarter Form 720, “Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return,” and third quarter Form 941, “Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return,” are due on October 31, 2009. In addition, Corporation X has an employment tax deposit due on September 15, 2009.
(ii) On September 1, 2009, a hurricane strikes County M in State W. On September 7, 2009, certain counties in State W (including County M) are determined to be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3) that are eligible for assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford Act. Also on September 7, 2009, the IRS determines that County M in State W is a covered disaster area and publishes guidance announcing that the time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after September 1, 2009, and on or before November 30, 2009, has been postponed to November 30, 2009, pursuant to section 7508A.
(iii) Because Corporation X's principal place of business is in County M, Corporation X is an affected taxpayer. Accordingly, Corporation X's 2008 Form 1120 will be timely if filed on or before November 30, 2009. Corporation X's 2009 third quarter estimated tax payment will be timely if made on or before November 30, 2009. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X's 2009 third quarter Form 720 and third quarter Form 941 will be timely if filed on or before November 30, 2009. However, because deposits of taxes are excluded from the scope of paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X's employment tax deposit is due on September 15, 2009. In addition, Corporation X's deposits relating to the third quarter Form 720 are not postponed. Absent reasonable cause, Corporation X is subject to the failure to deposit penalty under section 6656 and accrual of interest.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that because of the severity of the hurricane, the IRS determines that postponement of government acts is necessary. During 2009, Corporation X's 2005 Form 1120 is being examined by the IRS. Pursuant to a timely filed request for extension of time to file, Corporation X timely filed its 2005 Form 1120 on September 15, 2006. Without application of this section, the statute of limitation on assessment for the 2005 income tax year will expire on September 15, 2009. However, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, assessment of tax is one of the government acts for which up to one year may be disregarded. Because September 15, 2009, falls within the period in which government acts are postponed, the statute of limitation on assessment for Corporation X's 2005 income tax will expire on November 30, 2009. Because Corporation X did not timely file an extension of time to pay, payment of its 2005 income tax was due on March 15, 2006. As such, Corporation X will be subject to the failure to pay penalty and related interest beginning on March 15, 2006. The due date for payment of Corporation X's 2005 income tax preceded the postponement period. Therefore, Corporation X is not entitled to the suspension of interest or penalties during the disaster period with respect to its 2005 income tax liability.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
, except that the examination of the 2005 taxable year was completed earlier in 2009, and on July 28, 2009, the IRS mailed a statutory notice of deficiency to Corporation X. Without application of this section, Corporation X has 90 days (or until October 26, 2009) to file a petition with the Tax Court. However, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, filing a petition with the Tax Court is one of the taxpayer acts for which a period of up to one year may be disregarded. Because Corporation X is an affected taxpayer, Corporation X's petition to the Tax Court will be timely if filed on or before November 30, 2009, the last day of the postponement period.

# Example 4.
(i) H and W, individual calendar year taxpayers, intend to file a joint Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,” for the 2008 taxable year and are required to file a Schedule H, “Household Employment Taxes.” The joint return is due on April 15,
2009. H and W's principal residence is in County M in State Q.
(ii) On April 2, 2009, a severe ice storm strikes County M. On April 5, 2009, certain counties in State Q (including County M) are determined to be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3) that are eligible for assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford Act. Also on April 5, 2009, the IRS determines that County M in State Q is a covered disaster area and publishes guidance announcing that the time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after April 2, 2009, and on or before June 2, 2009, has been postponed to June 2, 2009.
(iii) Because H and W's principal residence is in County M, H and W are affected taxpayers. April 15, 2009, the due date for the filing of H and W's 2008 Form 1040 and Schedule H, falls within the postponement period described in the IRS published guidance. Thus, H and W's return will be timely if filed on or before June 2, 2009. If H and W request an extension of time to file under section 6081 on or before June 2, 2009, the extension is deemed to have been filed by April 15, 2009. Thus, H and W's return will be timely if filed on or before October 15, 2009.
(iv) April 15, 2009, is also the due date for the payment due on the return. This date falls within the postponement period described in the IRS published guidance. Thus, the payment of tax due with the return will be timely if paid on or before June 2, 2009 the last day of the postponement period. If H and W fail to pay the tax due on the 2008 Form 1040 by June 2, 2009, and do not receive an extension of time to pay under section 6161, H and W will be subject to failure to pay penalties and accrual of interest beginning on June 3, 2009.

# Example 5.
(i) H and W, residents of County D in State G, intend to file an amended return to request a refund of 2008 taxes. H and W timely filed their 2008 income tax return on April 15, 2009. Under section 6511(a), H and W's amended 2008 tax return must be filed on or before April 16, 2012 (because April 15, 2012 falls on a Sunday, H and W's amended return was due to be filed on April 16, 2012).
(ii) On April 2, 2012, an earthquake strikes County D. On April 6, 2012, certain counties in State G (including County D) are determined to be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3) that are eligible for assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford Act. Also on April 6, 2012, the IRS determines that County D in State G is a covered disaster area and publishes guidance announcing that the time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after April 2, 2012, and on or before October 2, 2012, has been postponed to October 2, 2012.
(iii) Under paragraph (c) of this section, filing a claim for refund of tax is one of the taxpayer acts for which the IRS may disregard a period of up to one year. The postponement period for this disaster begins on April 2, 2012, and ends on October 2, 2012. Accordingly, H and W's claim for refund for 2008 taxes will be timely if filed on or before October 2, 2012. Moreover, in applying the lookback period in section 6511(b)(2)(A), which limits the amount of the allowable refund, the period from October 2, 2012, back to April 2, 2012, is disregarded under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Thus, if the claim is filed on or before October 2, 2012, amounts deemed paid on April 15, 2009, under section 6513(b), such as estimated tax and tax withheld from wages, will have been paid within the lookback period of section 6511(b)(2)(A).

# Example 6.
(i) A is an unmarried, calendar year taxpayer whose principal residence is located in County W in State Q. A intends to file a Form 1040 for the 2008 taxable year. The return is due on April 15, 2009. A timely files Form 4868, “Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.” Due to A's timely filing of Form 4868, the extended filing deadline for A's 2008 tax return is October 15, 2009. Because A timely requested an extension of time to file, A will not be subject to the failure to file penalty under section 6651(a)(1), if A files the 2008 Form 1040 on or before October 15, 2009. However, A failed to pay the tax due on the return by April 15, 2009 and did not receive an extension of time to pay under section 6161. Absent reasonable cause, A is subject to the failure to pay penalty under section 6651(a)(2) and accrual of interest.
(ii) On September 30, 2009, a blizzard strikes County W. On October 5, 2009, certain counties in State Q (including County W) are determined to be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3) that are eligible for assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford Act. Also on October 5, 2009, the IRS determines that County W in State Q is a covered disaster area and announces that the time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after September 30, 2009, and on or before December 2, 2009, has been postponed to December 2, 2009.
(iii) Because A's principal residence is in County W, A is an affected taxpayer. Because October 15, 2009, the extended due date to file A's 2008 Form 1040, falls within the postponement period described in the IRS's published guidance, A's return is timely if filed on or before December 2, 2009. However, the payment due date, April 15, 2009, preceded the postponement period. Thus, A will continue to be subject to failure to pay penalties and accrual of interest during the postponement period.

# Example 7.
(i) H and W, individual calendar year taxpayers, intend to file a joint Form 1040 for the 2008 taxable year. The joint return is due on April 15, 2009. After credits for taxes withheld on wages and estimated tax payments, H and W owe tax for the 2008 taxable year. H and W's principal residence is in County J in State W.
(ii) On March 3, 2009, severe flooding strikes County J. On March 6, 2009, certain counties in State W (including County J) are determined to be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3) that are eligible for assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford Act. Also on March 6, 2009, the IRS determines that County J in State W is a covered disaster area and publishes guidance announcing that the time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after March 3, 2009, and on or before June 1, 2009, has been postponed to June 1, 2009.
(iii) Because H and W's principal residence is in County J, H and W are affected taxpayers. April 15, 2009, the due date for filing the 2008 joint return, falls within the postponement period described in the IRS published guidance. Therefore, H and W's joint return without extension will be timely if filed on or before June 1, 2009. Similarly, H and W's 2008 income taxes will be timely paid if paid on or before June 1, 2009.
(iv) On April 30, 2009, H and W timely file Form 4868, “Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.” H and W's extension will be deemed to have been filed on April 15, 2009. Thus, H and W's 2008 income tax return will be timely if filed on or before October 15, 2009.
(v) H and W did not request or receive an extension of time to pay. Therefore, the payment of tax due with the 2008 joint return will be timely if paid on or before June 1, 2009. If H and W fail to pay the tax due on the 2008 joint return by June 1, 2009, H and W will be subject to failure to pay penalties and accrual of interest beginning on June 2, 2009.

# Example 8.
(i) H and W, individual calendar year taxpayers, entered into an installment agreement with respect to their 2006 tax liabilities. H and W's installment agreement required H and W to make regularly scheduled installment payments on the 15th day of the month for the next 60 months. H and W's principal residence is in County K in State X.
(ii) On May 1, 2009, severe flooding strikes County K. On May 5, 2009, certain counties in State X including County K) are determined by the Federal government to be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3), and are eligible for assistance under the Stafford Act. Also on May 5, 2009, the IRS determines that County K in State X is a covered disaster area and publishes guidance announcing that the time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after May 1, 2009 and on or before July 1, 2009, has been postponed to July 1, 2009.
(iii) Because H and W's principal residence is in County K, H and W are affected taxpayers. Pursuant to the IRS's grant of relief under section 7508A, H and W's installment agreement payments that become due during the postponement period are suspended until after the postponement period has ended. H and W will be required to resume payments no later than August 15, 2009. Skipped payments will be tacked on at the end of the installment payment period. Because the installment agreement pertains to prior year tax liabilities, interest and penalties will continue to accrue. H and W may, however, be entitled to abatement of the failure to pay penalties incurred during the postponement period upon establishing reasonable cause.
(g)
Mandatory 60-day postponement
—(1)
In general.
In addition to (or concurrent with) the postponement period specified by the Secretary in an exercise of the authority under section 7508A(a) to postpone time-sensitive acts by reason of a federally declared disaster, qualified taxpayers (as defined in section 7508A(d)(2)) are entitled to a mandatory 60-day postponement period during which the time to perform those time-sensitive acts is disregarded in the same manner as under section 7508A(a). The rules of this paragraph (g)(1) apply with respect to a postponement period specified by the Secretary under section 7508A(b), to postpone acts as provided in section 7508A(d)(4). Except for the acts set forth in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, section 7508A(d) does not apply to postpone any acts.
(2)
Acts postponed.
The time-sensitive acts that are postponed for the mandatory 60-day postponement period are the acts determined to be postponed by the Secretary's exercise of authority under section 7508A(a) or (b). In addition, in the case of any person described in section 7508A(b), the time-sensitive acts postponed for the mandatory 60-day postponement period include those described in section 7508A(d)(4):
(i) Making contributions to a qualified retirement plan (within the meaning of section 4974(c)) under section
219(f)(3), 404(a)(6), 404(h)(1)(B), or 404(m)(2);
(ii) Making distributions under section 408(d)(4);
(iii) Recharacterizing contributions under section 408A(d)(6); and
(iv) Making a rollover under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), or 408(d)(3).
(3)
Calculation of mandatory 60-day postponement period
—(i)
In general.
The mandatory 60-day postponement period begins on the earliest incident date specified in a disaster declaration for a federally declared disaster and ends on the date that is 60 days after the latest incident date specified in the disaster declaration. In accordance with section 7508A(d)(5), the mandatory 60-day postponement period under section 7508A(d) runs concurrently with the postponement period determined by the Secretary in exercising discretion under section 7508A(a) or (b) if the period determined by the Secretary is equal to or longer than 60 days after the latest incident date. If the period determined by the Secretary in exercising discretion under section 7508A(a) or (b) ends prior to 60 days after the latest incident date, in accordance with section 7508A(d)(5), the mandatory 60-day postponement period will run concurrently for the length of the period determined by the Secretary under section 7508A(a) or (b) and then continue running in addition to the period determined by the Secretary under section 7508A(a) or (b).
(ii)
Limitations on the mandatory 60-day postponement period.
(A) In no event will the mandatory 60-day postponement period be calculated to exceed one year.
(B) In the event the Secretary determines to postpone time-sensitive acts pursuant to a declaration establishing a federally declared disaster for purposes of section 7508A that does not specify an incident date, there is no mandatory postponement period under section 7508A(d). In such cases, the only postponement period will be the period determined by the Secretary under section 7508A(a) or (b).
(4)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples:
(i)
Example (1).
Individual A lives in a state that experienced severe but isolated tornado damage on March 15. On March 20, FEMA issued a
Federal Register
Notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the President for the state where Individual A lives, describing the incident date for the tornado as March 15. Based upon that major disaster declaration, the IRS published a news release identifying the taxpayers (by county) affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508A and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from March 15 through July 31, pursuant to section 7508A(a). The county where Individual A lives was included in the news release. Under section 7508A(d), the mandatory 60-day postponement period that Individual A is entitled to begins on March 15 and ends 60 days after March 15, on May 14. The mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the IRS provided to Individual A under section 7508A(a).
(ii)
Example (2).
Individual B lives in a coastal state which experienced harmful effects from a hurricane that began to affect the weather in his state on August 15 and ceased to be a weather factor in his state on August 19. On August 22, FEMA issued a
Federal Register
Notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the President, determining that the coastline counties in the state, including the county where Individual B lives, were severely affected and that these counties were entitled to both individual assistance and public assistance. The major disaster declaration specified the earliest incident date for the hurricane in the state where Individual B lives as August 15 and the latest incident date as August 19. Based upon that major disaster declaration, the IRS published a news release identifying the taxpayers affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508A and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from August 15 through December 31, pursuant to section 7508A(a). Under section 7508A(d), the mandatory 60-day postponement period that Individual B is entitled to begins on August 15 and ends 60 days after August
19, on October 18. The mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the IRS provided to Individual B under section 7508A(a).
(iii)
Example (3).
Individual C lives in a county of a state that is experiencing ongoing wildfires. On August 14, FEMA issued a
Federal Register
Notice announcing an emergency declaration approved by the President to make public assistance available under the Stafford Act to local governments to fight the wildfires. This declaration specified an earliest incident date of August 14 and no latest incident date. On August 17, FEMA issued a
Federal Register
Notice announcing a major disaster declaration approved by the President for the same wildfires incident, announcing that the residents of the county where Individual C lives were eligible to receive individual assistance under the Stafford Act. This declaration specified August 15 as the earliest incident date and described the incident period as ongoing. Based upon that major disaster declaration, the IRS exercised its discretion under section 7508A(a) to publish a news release identifying the taxpayers (by county) affected by the wildfires disaster for purposes of section 7508A and specifying both the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement from August 15 through December 15. Following the initial news release, the wildfires disaster remained ongoing, with no ending incident date specified, for several months. The IRS published a second news release postponing the time-sensitive acts through January 15. FEMA subsequently amended the major disaster declaration to specify the latest incident date of November 19. Because the IRS acted in its discretion to provide relief in response to the major disaster declaration, and not to provide relief in response to the emergency declaration, the mandatory 60-day postponement period that Individual C is entitled to under section 7508A(d) begins on August 15, the earliest incident date specified in the major disaster declaration, and ends 60 days after the latest incident date of November 19. The mandatory postponement period applies to the same time-sensitive acts and runs concurrently with the relief the IRS provided to Individual C under section 7508A(a), and ends on January 18, which is 60 days after the latest incident date and three days beyond the postponement period specified by the IRS under section 7508A(a) in its news release.
(iv)
Example (4).
Individual D lives in the United States, which is experiencing a nationwide emergency as a result of its residents being exposed to a highly infectious and dangerous pandemic disease. On March 13, the President declared a nationwide emergency under section 501(b) of the Stafford Act. The pandemic became a federally declared disaster for purposes of section 7508A on March 13, however, no incident date was specified in the President's emergency declaration. Pursuant to the President's March 13 emergency declaration, the IRS published several notices identifying the taxpayers affected by the disaster for purposes of section 7508A and specifying the time-sensitive acts that are postponed and a period of postponement that generally ran from April 1 through July 15, pursuant to section 7508A(a). Because, in this circumstance, the emergency declaration pursuant to which the notices were published did not specify an incident date, there is no mandatory postponement period under section 7508A(d). The only postponement period is the period determined by the Secretary pursuant to the discretionary authority under section 7508A(a).

This summons power may be used in an investigation of either civil or criminal tax-related
liability. The Commissioner may designate one or more officers or employees of the IRS as the individuals before whom a person summoned pursuant to section 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), 6427(j)(2), or 7602 shall appear.

(B)
Persons providing expert evaluation and assistance.
For the purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, persons providing expert evaluation and assistance may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(ii)
IRS contractor participation in an IRS summons interview
—(A)
In general.

(B)
Court reporters, translators, and interpreters are not barred from asking questions.
Court reporters who are hired as contractors by the IRS to make a record of an IRS summons interview are permitted to ask typical housekeeping questions of a summoned witness. Examples of such questions include, but are not limited to, asking whether the witness swears to tell the truth, asking the witness to spell a word or phrase, and asking whether the witness can speak up or speak rather than gesture an answer. Translators and interpreters who are hired as contractors by the IRS to assist in the interview of a summoned witness are
permitted to translate any of the questions that are asked of the witness by an IRS or Office of Chief Counsel officer or employee and to ask questions which may be necessary to clarify the translation.
(c)
Proscription on issuing of administrative summons when a Justice Department referral is in effect
—(1)
In general.
The Commissioner may neither issue a summons under this title nor initiate a proceeding to enforce a previously issued summons by way of section 7604 with respect to any person whose tax liability is in issue, if a Justice Department referral is in effect with respect to that person for that liability.
(2)
Justice Department referral in effect.
A Justice Department referral is in effect with respect to any person when:
(i) The Secretary recommends, within the meaning of this paragraph, that the Attorney General either commence a grand jury investigation of or criminal prosecution of such person for any alleged offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws, or
(ii) The Attorney General (or Deputy Attorney General or Assistant Attorney General) under section 6103(h)(3)(B) requests in writing that the Secretary disclose a return of, or return information relating to, such person. The request must set forth that the need for disclosure is for the purpose of a grand jury investigation of or potential or pending criminal prosecution of such person for any alleged offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws.
The referral is effective at the time the document recommending criminal prosecution or grand jury investigation is signed by the Secretary or upon the Secretary's receipt of the section 6103(h)(3)(B) request.
(3)
Cessation of Justice Department referral.
A Justice Department referral ceases to be in effect with respect to a person:

(B) Will not authorize a grand jury investigation of that person with respect to such offense, or
(C) Will discontinue any grand jury investigation of that person with respect to such offense;
(ii) When a final disposition with respect to a criminal proceeding brought against that person has been made; or
(iii) When the Secretary receives written notification from the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General, that the Justice Department will not prosecute such person for any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws, based upon a previous request for disclosure under section 6103(h)(3)(B).
(4)
Taxable years and taxes imposed by separate chapters of the Code treated separately
—(i)
In general.

(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(4):

# Example 1.
A Justice Department referral is in effect for D's criminal evasion of income tax for the taxable year 1979. The Commission may issue a summons respecting D's 1980 criminal and/or civil tax liability. The Commissioner may not issue a summons respecting D's 1979 income tax liability.

# Example 2.
A referral has been made to the Department of Justice for the criminal prosecution of F with regard to F's income tax liability for the taxable year 1978. The Commissioner may issue a summons respecting F's gift tax liability for the taxable year 1978.

# Example 3.
A referral has been made to the Department of Justice for a grand jury investigation respecting G's 1980 income tax liability. The Commissioner may issue a summons related to an investigation of G's liability for Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) taxes for the taxable year 1980.

# Example 4.
A referral has been made to the Department of Justice respecting J's criminal evasion of windfall profit tax for all quarters of the calendar year 1982. The Commissioner may issue a summons respecting J's liability for highway motor vehicle use tax covering the same periods.

# Example 5.
A referral has been made to the Department of Justice for a grand jury investigation respecting L's 1983 income tax liability. The Commissioner may issue a summons related to the investigation of L's liability under sections 6700 (abusive tax shelter promoter penalty) and 7408 of the Code for his conduct during 1983.

§ 301.7602-2
Third party contacts.
(a)
In general.
Subject to the exceptions in paragraph (f) of this section, no officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may contact any person other than the taxpayer with respect to the determination or collection of such taxpayer's tax liability without giving the taxpayer reasonable notice in advance that such contacts may be made. A record of persons so contacted must be made and given to the taxpayer upon the taxpayer's request.
(b)
Third-party contact defined.
Contacts subject to section 7602(c) and this regulation shall be called “third-party contacts.” A third-party contact is a communication which—
(1) Is initiated by an IRS employee;
(2) Is made to a person other than the taxpayer;
(3) Is made with respect to the determination or collection of the tax liability of such taxpayer;
(4) Discloses the identity of the taxpayer being investigated; and
(5) Discloses the association of the IRS employee with the IRS.
(c)
Elements of third-party contact explained
—(1)
Initiation by an IRS employee
—(i)
Explanation
—(A)
Initiation.
An IRS employee initiates a communication whenever it is the employee who first tries to communicate with a person other than the taxpayer. Returning unsolicited telephone calls or speaking with persons other than the taxpayer as part of an attempt to speak to the taxpayer are not initiations of third-party contacts.
(B)
IRS employee.
For purposes of this section, an IRS employee includes all officers and employees of the IRS, the Chief Counsel of the IRS and the National Taxpayer Advocate, as well as a person described in section 6103(n), an officer or employee of such person, or a person who is subject to disclosure restrictions pursuant to a written agreement in connection with the solicitation of an agreement described in section 6103(n) and its implementing regulations. No inference about the employment or contractual relationship of such other persons with the IRS may be drawn from this regulation for any purpose other than the requirements of section 7602(c).
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c)(1):

# Example 1.
An IRS employee receives a message to return an unsolicited call. The employee returns the call and speaks with a person who reports information about a taxpayer who is not meeting his tax responsibilities. Later, the employee makes a second call to the person and asks for more information. The first call is not a contact initiated by an IRS employee. Just because the employee must return the call does not change the fact that it is the other person, and not the employee, who initiated the contact. The second call, however, is initiated by the employee and so meets the first element.

# Example 2.
An IRS employee wants to hire an appraiser to help determine the value of a taxpayer's oil and gas business. At the initial interview, the appraiser signs an agreement that prohibits him from disclosing return information of the taxpayer except as allowed by the agreement. Once hired, the appraiser initiates a contact by calling an
industry expert in Houston and discusses the taxpayer's business. The IRS employee's contact with the appraiser does not meet the first element of a third-party contact because the appraiser is treated, for section 7602(c) purposes only, as an employee of the IRS. For the same reason, however, the appraiser's call to the industry expert does meet the first element of a third-party contact.

# Example 3.
A revenue agent trying to contact the taxpayer to discuss the taxpayer's pending examination twice calls the taxpayer's place of business. The first call is answered by a receptionist who states that the taxpayer is not available. The IRS employee leaves a message with the receptionist stating only his name and telephone number, and asks that the taxpayer call him. The second call is answered by the office answering machine, on which the IRS employee leaves the same message. Neither of these phone calls meets the first element of a third-party contact because the IRS employee is trying to initiate a communication with the taxpayer and not a person other than the taxpayer. The fact that the IRS employee must either speak with a third party (the receptionist) or leave a message on the answering machine, which may be heard by a third party, does not mean that the employee is initiating a communication with a person other than the taxpayer. Both the receptionist and the answering machine are only intermediaries in the process of reaching the taxpayer.
(2)
Person other than the taxpayer
—(i)
Explanation.
The phrases “person other than the taxpayer” and “third party” are used interchangeably in this section, and do not include—
(A) An officer or employee of the IRS, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section, acting within the scope of his or her employment;
(B) Any computer database or website regardless of where located and by whom maintained, including databases or web sites maintained on the Internet or in county courthouses, libraries, or any other real or virtual site; or
(C) A current employee, officer, or fiduciary of a taxpayer when acting within the scope of his or her employment or relationship with the taxpayer. Such employee, officer, or fiduciary shall be conclusively presumed to be acting within the scope of his or her employment or relationship during business hours on business premises.
(ii)
Examples:
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c)(2):

# Example 1.
A revenue agent examining a taxpayer's return speaks with another revenue agent who has previously examined the same taxpayer about a recurring issue. The revenue agent has not contacted a “person other than the taxpayer” within the meaning of section 7602(c).

# Example 2.
A revenue agent examining a taxpayer's return speaks with one of the taxpayer's employees on business premises during business hours. The employee is conclusively presumed to be acting within the scope of his employment and is therefore not a “person other than the taxpayer” for section 7602(c) purposes.

# Example 3.
A revenue agent examining a corporate taxpayer's return uses a commercial online research service to research the corporate structure of the taxpayer. The revenue agent uses an IRS account, logs on with her IRS user name and password, and uses the name of the corporate taxpayer in her search terms. The revenue agent later explores several Internet web sites that may have information relevant to the examination. The searches on the commercial online research service and Internet websites are not contacts with “persons other than the taxpayer.”
(3)
With respect to the determination or collection of the tax liability of such taxpayer
—(i)
Explanation
—(A)
With respect to.
A contact is “with respect to” the determination or collection of the tax liability of such taxpayer when made for the purpose of either determining or collecting a particular tax liability and when directly connected to that purpose. While a contact made for the purpose of determining a particular taxpayer's tax liability may also affect the tax liability of one or more other taxpayers, such contact is not for that reason alone a contact “with respect to” the determination or collection of those other taxpayers' tax liabilities. Contacts to determine the tax status of a pension plan under chapter 1, subchapter D (Deferred Compensation) of the Internal Revenue Code, are not “with respect to” the determination of plan participants” tax liabilities. Contacts to determine the tax status of a bond issue under chapter 1, subchapter B, Part IV (Tax Exemption Requirements for State and Local Bonds) of the Internal Revenue Code, are not “with respect to” the determination of the bondholders' tax liabilities. Contacts to determine the tax status of an organization under chapter 1, subchapter F (Exempt Organizations) of
the Internal Revenue Code, are not “with respect to” the determination of the contributors' liabilities, nor are any similar determinations “with respect to” any persons with similar relationships to the taxpayer whose tax liability is being determined or collected.
(B)
Determination or collection.
A contact is with respect to the “determination or collection” of the tax liability of such taxpayer when made during the administrative determination or collection process. For purposes of this paragraph (c) only, the administrative determination or collection process may include any administrative action to ascertain the correctness of a return, make a return when none has been filed, or determine or collect the tax liability of any person as a transferee or fiduciary under chapter 71 of title 26.
(C)
Tax liability.
A
tax liability
means the liability for any tax imposed by title 26 of the United States Code (including any interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, or penalty) and does not include the liability for any tax imposed by any other jurisdiction nor any liability imposed by other Federal statutes.
(D)
Such taxpayer.
A contact is with respect to the determination or collection of the tax liability of “such taxpayer” when made while determining or collecting the tax liability of a particular, identified taxpayer. Contacts made during an investigation of a particular, identified taxpayer are third-party contacts only as to the particular, identified taxpayer under investigation and not as to any other taxpayer whose tax liabilities might be affected by such contacts.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of this paragraph (c)(3):

# Example 1.
As part of a compliance check on a return preparer, an IRS employee visits the preparer's office and reviews the preparer's client files to ensure that the proper forms and records have been created and maintained. This contact is not a third-party contact “with respect to” the preparer's clients because it is not for the purpose of determining the tax liability of the preparer's clients, even though the agent might discover information that would lead the agent to recommend an examination of one or more of the preparer's clients.

# Example 2.
A revenue agent is assigned to examine a taxpayer's return, which was prepared by a return preparer. As in all such examinations, the revenue agent asks the taxpayer routine questions about what information the taxpayer gave the preparer and what advice the preparer gave the taxpayer. As a result of the examination, the revenue agent recommends that the preparer be investigated for penalties under section 6694 or 6695. Neither the examination of the taxpayer's return nor the questions asked of the taxpayer are “with respect to” the determination of the preparer's tax liabilities within the meaning of section 7602(c) because the purpose of the contacts was to determine the taxpayer's tax liability, even though the agent discovered information that may result in a later investigation of the preparer.

# Example 3.
To help identify taxpayers in the florist industry who may not have filed proper returns, an IRS employee contacts a company that supplies equipment to florists and asks for a list of its customers in the past year in order to cross-check the list against filed returns. The employee later contacts the supplier for more information about one particular florist who the employee believes did not file a proper return. The first contact is not a contact with respect to the determination of the tax liability of “such taxpayer” because no particular taxpayer has been identified for investigation at the time the contact is made. The later contact, however, is with respect to the determination of the tax liability of “such taxpayer” because a particular taxpayer has been identified. The later contact is also “with respect to” the determination of that taxpayer's liability because, even though no examination has been opened on the taxpayer, the information sought could lead to an examination.

# Example 4.
A revenue officer, trying to collect the trust fund portion of unpaid employment taxes of a corporation, begins to investigate the liability of two corporate officers for the section 6672 Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (TFRP). The revenue officer obtains the signature cards for the corporation's bank accounts from the corporation's bank. The contact with the bank to obtain the signature cards is a contact with respect to the determination of the two identified corporate officers' tax liabilities because it is directly connected to the purpose of determining a tax liability of two identified taxpayers. It is not, however, a contact with respect to any other person not already under investigation for TFRP liability, even though the signature cards might identify other potentially liable persons.

# Example 5.
The IRS is asked to rule on whether a certain pension plan qualifies under section 401 so that contributions to
the pension plan are excludable from the employees' incomes under section 402 and are also deductible from the employer's income under section 404. Contacts made with the plan sponsor (and with persons other than the plan sponsor) are not contacts “with respect to” the determination of the tax liabilities of the pension plan participants because the purpose of the contacts is to determine the status of the plan, even though that determination may affect the participants' tax liabilities.

# Example 6(a).
The IRS audits a TEFRA partnership at the partnership (entity) level pursuant to sections 6221 through 6233. The tax treatment of partnership items is at issue, but the respective tax liabilities of the partners may be affected by the results of the TEFRA partnership audit. With respect to the TEFRA partnership, contacts made with employees of the partnership acting within the scope of their duties or any partner are not section 7602(c) contacts because they are considered the equivalent of contacting the partnership. Contacts relating to the tax treatment of partnership items made with persons other than the employees of the partnership who are acting within the scope of their duties or the partners are section 7602(c) contacts with respect to the TEFRA partnership, and reasonable advance notice should be provided by sending the appropriate Letter 3164 to the partnership's tax matters partner (TMP). Individual partners who are merely affected by the partnership audit but who are not identified as subject to examination with respect to their individual tax liabilities need not be sent Letters 3164.

# Example 6(b).
In the course of an audit of a TEFRA partnership at the partnership (entity) level, the IRS intends to contact third parties regarding transactions between the TEFRA partnership and specific, identified partners. In addition to the partnership's TMP, the specific, identified partners should also be provided advance notice of any third-party contacts relating to such transactions.
(4)
Discloses the identity of the taxpayer being investigated
—(i)
Explanation.
An IRS employee discloses the taxpayer's identity whenever the employee knows or should know that the person being contacted can readily ascertain the taxpayer's identity from the information given by the employee.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c)(4):

# Example 1.
A revenue agent seeking to value the taxpayer's condominium calls a real estate agent and asks for a market analysis of the taxpayer's condominium, giving the unit number of the taxpayer's condominium. The revenue agent has revealed the identity of the taxpayer, regardless of whether the revenue agent discloses the name of the taxpayer, because the real estate agent can readily ascertain the taxpayer's identity from the address given.

# Example 2.
A revenue officer seeking to value the taxpayer's condominium calls a real estate agent and, without identifying the taxpayer's unit, asks for the sales prices of similar units recently sold and listing prices of similar units currently on the market. The revenue officer has not revealed the identity of the taxpayer because the revenue officer has not given any information from which the real estate agent can readily ascertain the taxpayer's identity.
(5)
Discloses the association of the IRS employee with the IRS.
An IRS employee discloses his association with the IRS whenever the employee knows or should know that the person being contacted can readily ascertain the association from the information given by the employee.
(d)
Pre-contact notice
—(1)
In general.
An officer or employee of the IRS may not make third-party contacts without providing reasonable notice in advance to the taxpayer that contacts may be made. The pre-contact notice may be given either orally or in writing. If written notice is given, it may be given in any manner that the IRS employee responsible for giving the notice reasonably believes will be received by the taxpayer in advance of the third-party contact. Written notice is deemed reasonable if it is—
(i) Mailed to the taxpayer's last known address;
(ii) Given in person;
(iii) Left at the taxpayer's dwelling or usual place of business; or
(iv) Actually received by the taxpayer.
(2)
Pre-contact notice not required.
Pre-contact notice under this section need not be provided to a taxpayer for third-party contacts of which advance notice has otherwise been provided to the taxpayer pursuant to another statute, regulation or administrative procedure. For example, Collection Due Process notices sent to taxpayers pursuant to section 6330 and its regulations constitute reasonable advance notice that contacts with third parties may be made in order to effectuate a levy.
(e)
Post-contact reports
—(1)
Requested reports.
A taxpayer may request a record of persons contacted in any
manner that the Commissioner reasonably permits. The Commissioner may set reasonable limits on how frequently taxpayer requests need be honored. The requested report may be mailed either to the taxpayer's last known address or such other address as the taxpayer specifies in the request.
(2)
Contents of record
—(i)
In general.
The record of persons contacted should contain information, if known to the IRS employee making the contact, which reasonably identifies the person contacted. Providing the name of the person contacted fully satisfies the requirements of this section, but this section does not require IRS employees to solicit identifying information from a person solely for the purpose of the post-contact report. The record need not contain any other information, such as the nature of the inquiry or the content of the third party's response. The record need not report multiple contacts made with the same person during a reporting period.
(ii)
Special rule for employees.
For contacts with the employees, officers, or fiduciaries of any entity who are acting within the scope of their employment or relationship, it is sufficient to record the entity as the person contacted. A fiduciary, officer or employee shall be conclusively presumed to be acting within the scope of his employment or relationship during business hours on business premises. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii), the term
entity
means any business (whether operated as a sole proprietorship, disregarded entity under § 301.7701-2 of the regulations, or otherwise), trust, estate, partnership, association, company, corporation, or similar organization.
(3)
Post-contact record not required.
A post-contact record under this section need not be made, or provided to a taxpayer, for third-party contacts of which the taxpayer has already been given a similar record pursuant to another statute, regulation, or administrative procedure.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (e):

# Example 1.
An IRS employee trying to find a specific taxpayer's assets in order to collect unpaid taxes talks to the owner of a marina. The employee asks whether the taxpayer has a boat at the marina. The owner gives his name as John Doe. The employee may record the contact as being with John Doe and is not required by this regulation to collect or record any other identifying information.

# Example 2.
An IRS employee trying to find a specific taxpayer and his assets in order to collect unpaid taxes talks to a person at 502 Fernwood. The employee asks whether the taxpayer lives next door at 500 Fernwood, as well as where the taxpayer works, what kind of car the taxpayer drives and whether the camper parked in front of 500 Fernwood belongs to the taxpayer. The person does not disclose his name. The employee may record the contact as being with a person at 502 Fernwood. If the employee then makes the same inquiries of another person on the street in front of 500 Fernwood, and does not learn that person's name, the latter contact may be reported as being with a person on the street in front of 500 Fernwood.

# Example 3.
An IRS employee examining a return obtains loan documents from a bank where the taxpayer applied for a loan. After reviewing the documents, the employee talks with the loan officer at the bank who handled the application. The employee has contacted only one “person other than the taxpayer.” The bank and not the loan officer is the “person other than the taxpayer” for section 7602(c) purposes. The contact with the loan officer is treated as a contact with the bank because the loan officer was an employee of the bank and was acting within the scope of her employment with the bank.

# Example 4.
An IRS employee issues a summons to a third party with respect to the determination of a taxpayer's liability and properly follows the procedures for such summonses under section 7609, which requires that a copy of the summons be given to the taxpayer. This third-party contact need not be maintained in a record of contacts available to the taxpayer because providing a copy of the third-party summons to the taxpayer pursuant to section 7609 satisfies the post-contact recording and reporting requirement of this section.

# Example 5.
An IRS employee serves a levy on a third party with respect to the collection of a taxpayer's liability. The employee provides the taxpayer with a copy of the notice of levy form that shows the identity of the third party. This third-party contact need not be maintained in a record of contacts available to the taxpayer because providing a copy of the notice of levy to the taxpayer satisfies the post-contact recording and reporting requirement of this section.
(f)
Exceptions
—(1)
Authorized by taxpayer
—(i)
Explanation.
Section 7602(c) does not apply to contacts authorized
by the taxpayer. A contact is “authorized” within the meaning of this section if—
(A) The contact is with the taxpayer's authorized representative, that is, a person who is authorized to speak or act on behalf of the taxpayer, such as a person holding a power of attorney, a corporate officer, a personal representative, an executor or executrix, or an attorney representing the taxpayer; or
(B) The taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative requests or approves the contact.
(ii)
No prevention or delay of contact.
This section does not entitle any person to prevent or delay an IRS employee from contacting any individual or entity.
(2)
Jeopardy
—(i)
Explanation.
Section 7602(c) does not apply when the IRS employee making a contact has good cause to believe that providing the taxpayer with either a general pre-contact notice or a record of the specific person contacted may jeopardize the collection of any tax. For purposes of this section only, good cause includes a reasonable belief that providing the notice or record will lead to—
(A) Attempts by any person to conceal, remove, destroy, or alter records or assets that may be relevant to any tax examination or collection activity;
(B) Attempts by any person to prevent other persons, through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, from communicating any information that may be relevant to any tax examination or collection activity; or
(C) Attempts by any person to flee, or otherwise avoid testifying or producing records that may be relevant to any tax examination or collection activity.
(ii)
Record of contact.
If the circumstances described in this paragraph (f)(2) exist, the IRS employee must still make a record of the person contacted, but the taxpayer need not be provided the record until it is no longer reasonable to believe that providing the record would cause the jeopardy described.
(3)
Reprisal
—(i)
In general.
Section 7602(c) does not apply when the IRS employee making a contact has good cause to believe that providing the taxpayer with either a general pre-contact notice or a specific record of the person being contacted may cause any person to harm any other person in any way, whether the harm is physical, economic, emotional or otherwise. A statement by the person contacted that harm may occur against any person is sufficient to constitute good cause for the IRS employee to believe that reprisal may occur. The IRS employee is not required to further question the contacted person about reprisal or otherwise make further inquiries regarding the statement.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (f)(3):

# Example 1.
An IRS employee seeking to collect unpaid taxes is told by the taxpayer that all the money in his and his brother's joint bank account belongs to the brother. The IRS employee contacts the brother to verify this information. The brother refuses to confirm or deny the taxpayer's statement. He states that he does not believe that reporting the contact to the taxpayer would result in harm to anyone but further states that he does not want his name reported to the taxpayer because it would appear that he gave information. This contact is not excepted from the statute merely because the brother asks that his name be left off the list of contacts.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the brother states that he fears harm from the taxpayer should the taxpayer learn of the contact, even though the brother gave no information. This contact is excepted from the statute because the third party has expressed a fear of reprisal. The IRS employee is not required to make further inquiry into the nature of the brothers' relationship or otherwise question the brother's fear of reprisal.

# Example 3.
An IRS employee is examining a joint return of a husband and wife, who recently divorced. From reading the court divorce file, the IRS employee learns that the divorce was acrimonious and that the ex-husband once violated a restraining order issued to protect the ex-wife. This information provides good cause for the IRS employee to believe that reporting contacts which might disclose the ex-wife's location may cause reprisal against any person. Therefore, when the IRS employee contacts the ex-wife's new employer to verify salary information provided by the ex-wife, the IRS employee has good cause not to report that contact to the ex-husband, regardless of whether the new employer expresses concern about reprisal against it or its employees.
(4)
Pending criminal investigations
—(i)
IRS criminal investigations.
Section 7602(c) does not apply to contacts made during an investigation, or inquiry to determine whether to open an investigation, when the investigation or inquiry is—
(A) Made against a particular, identified taxpayer for the primary purpose of evaluating the potential for criminal prosecution of that taxpayer; and
(B) Made by an IRS employee whose primary duties include either identifying or investigating criminal violations of the law.
(ii)
Other criminal investigations.
Section 7602(c) does not apply to contacts which, if reported to the taxpayer, could interfere with a known pending criminal investigation being conducted by law enforcement personnel of any local, state, Federal, foreign or other governmental entity.
(5)
Governmental entities.
Section 7602(c) does not apply to any contact with any office of any local, state, Federal or foreign governmental entity except for contacts concerning the taxpayer's business with the government office contacted, such as the taxpayer's contracts with or employment by the office. The term
office
includes any agent or contractor of the office acting in such capacity.
(6)
Confidential informants.
Section 7602(c) does not apply when the employee making the contact has good cause to believe that providing either the pre-contact notice or the record of the person contacted would identify a confidential informant whose identity would be protected under section 6103(h)(4).
(7)
Nonadministrative contacts
—(i)
Explanation.
Section 7602(c) does not apply to contacts made in the course of a pending court proceeding.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (f)(7):

# Example 1.
An attorney for the Office of Chief Counsel needs to contact a potential witness for an upcoming Tax Court proceeding involving the 1997 and 1998 taxable years of the taxpayer. Section 7602(c) does not apply because the contact is being made in the course of a pending court proceeding.

# Example 2.
While a Tax Court case is pending with respect to a taxpayer's 1997 and 1998 income tax liabilities, a revenue agent is conducting an examination of the taxpayer's excise tax liabilities for the fiscal year ending 1999. Any third-party contacts made by the revenue agent with respect to the excise tax liabilities would be subject to the requirements of section 7602(c) because the Tax Court proceeding does not involve the excise tax liabilities.

# Example 3.
A taxpayer files a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and receives a discharge. A revenue officer contacts a third party in order to determine whether the taxpayer has any exempt assets against which the IRS may take collection action to enforce its federal tax lien. At the time of the contact, the bankruptcy case has not been closed. Although the bankruptcy proceeding remains pending, the purpose of this contact relates to potential collection action by the IRS, a matter not before or related to the bankruptcy court proceeding.

§ 301.7603-1
Service of summons.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Hand delivery or delivery to place of abode.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a summons issued under section 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), 6427(j)(2), or 7602 shall be served by an attested copy delivered in hand to the person to whom it is directed, or left at such person's last and usual place of abode.
(2)
Summonses issued to third-party recordkeepers.
A summons issued under section 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), 6427(j)(2), or 7602 for the production of records (or testimony about such records) by a third-party recordkeeper, as described in section 7603(b)(2) and § 301.7603-2, may also be served by certified or registered mail to the third-party recordkeeper's last known address, as defined in § 301.6212-2. If service to a third-party recordkeeper is made by certified or registered mail, the date of service is the date on which the summons is mailed.
(b)
Persons who may serve a summons.
The officers and employees of the Internal Revenue Service whom the Commissioner has designated to carry out the authority described in § 301.7602-1(b) to issue a summons are authorized to serve a summons issued under section 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), 6427(j)(2), or 7602.
(c)
Effect of certificate of service.
The certificate of service signed by the person serving the summons shall be evidence of the facts it states on the hearing of an application for the enforcement of the summons.
(d)
Sufficiency of description of summoned records.
When a summons requires the production of records, it shall be sufficient if such records are described with reasonable certainty.
(e)

For purposes of this section and § 301.7603-2, the term
records
includes books, papers, or other data.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section is applicable on April 30, 2008.
[T.D. 9395, 73 FR 23344, Apr. 30, 2008]
§ 301.7603-2
Third-party recordkeepers.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Accountant.
A person is an accountant under section 7603(b)(2)(F) for purposes of determining whether that person is a third-party recordkeeper if, on the date the records described in the summons were created, the person was registered, licensed, or certified as an accountant under the authority of any state, commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, or of the District of Columbia.
(2)
Attorney.
A person is an attorney under section 7603(b)(2)(E) for purposes of determining whether that person is a third-party recordkeeper if, on the date the records described in the summons were created, the person was registered, licensed, or certified as an attorney under the authority of any state, commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, or of the District of Columbia.
(3)
Credit cards
—(i)
Person extending credit through credit cards.
The term
person extending credit through the use of credit cards or similar devices
under section 7603(b)(2)(C) generally includes any person who issues a credit card. The term does not include a seller of goods or services who honors credit cards issued by other parties but who does not extend credit through the use of credit cards or similar devices.
(ii)
Devices similar to credit cards.
An object is a device similar to a credit card under section 7603(b)(2)(C) only if it is physical in nature, such as a charge plate or similar device that may be tendered to obtain an extension of credit. Thus, a person who extends credit by requiring customers to sign sales slips without requiring the use of, or reference to, a physical object issued by that person is not a third-party recordkeeper under section 7603(b)(2)(C).
(iii)
Debit cards.
A debit card is not a credit card or similar device because a debit card is not tendered to obtain an extension of credit.
(4)
Enrolled agent.
A person is an enrolled agent under section 7603(b)(2)(I) for purposes of determining whether that person is a third-party recordkeeper if the person is enrolled as an agent authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Circular 230, 31 CFR Part 10.
(5)
Owner or developer of certain computer code and data.
An owner or developer of computer software source code under section 7603(b)(2)(J) is a third-party recordkeeper when summoned to produce a computer software source code (as defined in section 7612(d)(2)), or an executable code and associated data described in section 7612(b)(1)(A)(ii), even if that person did not make or keep records of another person's business transactions or affairs.
(b)
When third-party recordkeeper status arises
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, a person listed in section 7603(b)(2) is a third-party recordkeeper for purposes of section 7609(c)(2)(E) and § 301.7603-1 only if the summons served on that person seeks records (or testimony regarding such records) of a third party's business transactions or affairs and such recordkeeper made or kept the records in the capacity of a third-party recordkeeper. For instance, an accountant is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being an accountant) with respect to the accountant's records of a sale of property by the accountant to another person. Similarly, a credit card issuer is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being a person extending credit through the use of credit cards or similar devices) with respect to—
(i) Records relating to non-credit card transactions, such as a cash sale by the issuer to a holder of the issuer's credit card; or
(ii) Records relating to transactions involving the use of another issuer's credit card.
(2)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
V issues a credit card (the V card) that is honored by R, a retailer. When using the V card, C, a customer, signs a sales slip in triplicate. C, R, and V each retain one copy. Only the copy held by V is held by a third-party recordkeeper under section 7603(b)(2), even though R may issue its own credit card.

# Example 2.
R, a retailer, issues its own credit card (the R card) to C, a customer. When C makes a credit purchase from R using the R card, C signs a sales slip in duplicate. C and R each retain one copy. Because R keeps the copy in its capacity as credit card issuer, as well as in its capacity as a retailer, it is a third-party recordkeeper under section 7603(b)(2) with respect to its copy of the sales slip.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section is applicable on April 30, 2008.
[T.D. 9395, 73 FR 23345, Apr. 30, 2008]
§ 301.7604-1
Enforcement of summons.
(a)
In general.
Whenever any person summoned under section 6420(e)(2), 6421(f)(2), or 7602 neglects or refuses to obey such summons, or to produce books, papers, records, or other data, or to give testimony, as required, application may be made to the judge of the district court or to a U.S. commissioner for the district within which the person so summoned resides or is found for an attachment against him as for a contempt.
(b)
Persons who may apply for an attachment.
The officers and employees of the Internal Revenue Service whom the Commissioner has designated to carry out the authority given him by § 301.7602-1(b) to issue a summons are authorized to apply for an attachment as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7297, 38 FR 34803, Dec. 19, 1973]
§ 301.7605-1
Time and place of examination.
(a)
Time and place of examination to be reasonable
—(1)
In general.
The time and place of examination pursuant to the provisions of sections 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), 6427(j)(2), or 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code are to be fixed by an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service, and officers and employees are to endeavor to schedule a time and place that are reasonable under the circumstances. This section sets forth general criteria for the Service to apply in determining whether a particular time and place for an examination are reasonable under the circumstances. Officers and employees should exercise sound judgment in applying these criteria to the circumstances at hand and should balance convenience of the taxpayer with the requirements of sound and efficient tax administration.
(2)
International examinations.
Except for the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this section does not apply to examinations that fall under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Assistant Commissioner (International).
(3)
Criminal investigations.
Except for the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this section does not apply to criminal investigations.
(b)
Time of examination
—(1)
Date and time of examination.
It is reasonable for the Service to schedule the day (or days) for an examination during a normally scheduled workday (or workdays) of the Service, during the Service's normal business hours. It is reasonable for the Service to schedule examinations throughout the year, without regard to seasonal fluctuations in the businesses of particular taxpayers or their representatives. However, the Service will work with taxpayers or their representatives to try to minimize any adverse effects in scheduling the date and time of an examination.
(2)
Date of appearance when summons is used.
If a summons is issued under authority of section 7602(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, or under the corresponding authority of sections 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), or 6427(j)(2), the date fixed for appearance before an officer or employee of the Service must be no less than 10 days from the date of the summons.
(c)
Type of examination
—(1)
In general.
The Service will determine whether an examination will be an office examination (
i.e.,
an examination conducted at a Service office) or a field examination
(
i.e.,
an examination conducted at the taxpayer's residence or place of business, or some other location that is not a Service office), based upon the complexity of the return and which form of examination will be more conducive to effective and efficient tax administration.
(2)
Office examination held in location other than Service office in case of clear need.
The Service will grant a request to hold an office examination at a location other than a Service office in a case of clear need, such as when it would be unreasonably difficult for the taxpayer to travel to a Service office because of the taxpayer's advanced age or infirm physical condition, or when the taxpayer's books, records, and source documents are too cumbersome for the taxpayer to bring to a Service office.
(d)
Place of examination
—(1)
In general.
The Service generally will make an initial determination of the place for an examination, including the Internal Revenue Service district to which an examination will be assigned, based upon the address shown on the return for the period selected for examination. Requests by taxpayers to transfer the place of examination will be resolved on a case-by-case basis, using the criteria set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Office examinations
—(i)
In general.
An office examination of an individual or sole proprietorship generally is based on the residence of the individual taxpayer. An office examination of a taxpayer that is an entity generally is based on the location where the taxpayer entity's original books, records, and source documents are maintained. An office examination generally will take place at the closest Service office within the district encompassing the taxpayer's residence or at the closest Service office within the district where the taxpayer entity's books, records, and source documents are maintained. It generally is not reasonable for the Service to require a taxpayer to attend an examination at an office within an assigned district other than the closest Service office.
(ii)
Exception.
If the office within the assigned district closest to an individual taxpayer's residence or the location where a taxpayer entity's books, records and source documents are maintained does not have an examination group or the appropriate personnel to conduct the examination, it generally is reasonable for the Service to require the taxpayer to attend an examination at the closest Service office within the assigned district that has an examination group or the appropriate personnel.
(iii)
Travel considerations.
In scheduling office examinations, the Service in appropriate circumstances will take into account the distance a taxpayer would have to travel.
(3)
Field examinations
—(i)
In general.
A field examination will generally take place at the location where the taxpayer's original books, records, and source documents pertinent to the examination are maintained. In the case of a sole proprietorship or taxpayer entity, this will usually be the taxpayer's principal place of business.
(ii)
Exception for certain small businesses.
If an examination is scheduled by the Service at the taxpayer's place of business and the taxpayer represents to the Service in writing that conducting the examination at the place of business would essentially require the business to close or would unduly disrupt business operations, the Service, upon verification, will change the place of examination to a Service office within the district where the taxpayer's books, records, and source documents are maintained.
(iii)
Site visitations.
Regardless of where an examination takes place, the Service may visit the taxpayer's place of business or residence to establish facts that can only be established by direct visit, such as inventory or asset verification. The Service generally will visit for these purposes on a normal workday of the Service during the Service's normal duty hours.
(e)
Requests by taxpayers to change place of examination
—(1)
In general.
The Service will consider, on a case-by-case basis, written requests by taxpayers or their representatives to change the place that the Service has set for an examination. In considering these requests, the Service will take into account the following factors—
(i) The location of the taxpayer's current residence;
(ii) The location of the taxpayer's current principal place of business;
(iii) The location at which the taxpayer's books, records, and source documents are maintained;
(iv) The location at which the Service can perform the examination most efficiently;
(v) The Service resources available at the location to which the taxpayer has requested a transfer; and
(vi) Other factors that indicate that conducting the examination at a particular location could pose undue inconvenience to the taxpayer.
(2)
Circumstances in which the Service normally will permit transfers.
A request by a taxpayer to transfer the place of examination will generally be granted under the following circumstances:
(i)
Office examination
—(A) If the current residence of the taxpayer, in the case of an individual or sole proprietorship, or the location where the taxpayer's books, records, and source documents are maintained, in the case of a taxpayer entity, is closer to a different Service office in the same district as the office where the examination has been scheduled, the Service normally will agree to transfer the examination to the closer Service office.
(B) If the current residence of a taxpayer, in the case of an individual or sole proprietorship, or the location where a taxpayer entity's books, records, and source documents are maintained, is in a district other than the district where the examination has been scheduled, the Service normally will agree to transfer the examination to the closest Service office in the other district.
(ii)
Field examinations
—(A) If a taxpayer does not reside at the residence where an examination has been scheduled, the Service will agree to transfer the examination to the taxpayer's current residence.
(B) If, in the case of an individual, a sole proprietorship, or a taxpayer entity, the taxpayer's books, records, and source documents are maintained at a location other than the location where the examination has been scheduled, the Service will agree to transfer the examination to the location where the taxpayer's books, records, and source documents are maintained.
(3)
Transfer for convenience of taxpayer's representative.
The location of the place of business of a taxpayer's representative will generally not be considered in determining the place for an examination. However, the Service in its sole discretion may determine, based on the factors described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, to transfer the place of examination to the representative's office.
(4)
Transfer within thirteen months of expiration of limitations period.
If any applicable period of limitations on assessment or collection provided in the Internal Revenue Code will expire within thirteen months from the date of a taxpayer's request to transfer the place of an examination, the Service may require, as a condition for an otherwise permissible transfer, that the taxpayer first agree in writing to extend the limitations period for up to one year.
(5)
Transfer to office with insufficient resources.
The Service is not required to transfer an examination to an office or district that does not have adequate resources to conduct the examination.
(f)
Safety of Service officers and employees.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this regulation, officers and employees of the Service may decline to conduct an examination at a particular location if it appears that the possibility of physical danger may exist at that location. In these circumstances, the Service may transfer an examination to a Service office and take any other steps necessary to protect its officers and employees.
(g)
Transfers initiated by Service.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as precluding the Service from initiating the transfer of an examination if the transfer would promote the effective and efficient conduct of the examination. Should a taxpayer request that such a transfer not be made, the Service will consider the request according to the principles and criteria set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
(h)
Restrictions on examination of taxpayer.
No taxpayer shall be subjected to unnecessary examination or investigations, and only one inspection of a
taxpayer's books of account shall be made for each taxable year unless the taxpayer requests otherwise or unless an authorized internal revenue officer, after investigation, notifies the taxpayer in writing that an additional inspection is necessary. The inspection of a taxpayer's books of account pursuant to the procedures of § 1.1441-4(b) (3) and (4) is not an inspection of a taxpayer's books of account for purposes of section 7605(b) and this section.
(i)
Restriction on examination of churches
—(1)
In general.
This section imposes certain restrictions upon the examination of the books of account and religious activities of a church or convention or association of churches for the purpose of determining whether such organization may be engaged in activities the income from which is subject to tax under section 511 as unrelated business taxable income. The purposes of these restrictions are to protect such organizations from undue interference in their internal financial affairs through unnecessary examinations to determine the existence of unrelated business taxable income, and to limit the scope of examination for this purpose to matters directly relevant to a determination of the existence or amount of such income. This section also imposes additional restrictions upon other examinations of such organizations.
(2)
Books of account.
No examination of the books of account of an organization which claims to be a church or a convention or association of churches shall be made except after the giving of notice as provided in this subparagraph and except to the extent necessary (i) to determine the initial or continuing qualification of the organization under section 501(c)(3); (ii) to determine whether the organization qualifies as one, contributions to which are deductible under section 170, 545, 556, 642, 2055, 2106, or 2522; (iii) to obtain information for the purpose of ascertaining or verifying payments made by the organization to another person in determining the tax liability of the recipient, such as payments of salaries, wages, or other forms of compensation; or (iv) to determine the amount of tax, if any, imposed by the Code upon such organization. No examination of the books of account of a church or convention or association of churches shall be made unless the Regional Commissioner believes that such examination is necessary and so notifies the organization in writing at least 30 days in advance of examination. The Regional Commissioner will conclude that such examination is necessary only after reasonable attempts have been made to obtain information from the books of account by written request and the Regional Commissioner has determined that the information cannot be fully or satisfactorily obtained in that manner. In any examination of a church or convention or association of churches for the purpose of determining unrelated business income tax liability pursuant to such notice, no examination of the books of account of the organization shall be made except to the extent necessary to determine such liability.
(3)
Religious activities.
No examination of the religious activities of an organization which claims to be a church or convention or association of churches shall be made except (i) to the extent necessary to determine the initial or continuing qualification of the organization under section 501(c)(3); (ii) to determine whether the organization qualifies as one, contributions to which are deductible under section 170, 545, 556, 642, 2055, 2106, or 2522; or (iii) to determine whether the organization is a church or convention or association of churches subject to the provisions of part III of subchapter F of chapter 1. The requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph that the Regional Commissioner give notice prior to examination of the books of account of an organization do not apply to an examination of the religious activities of the organization for any purpose described in this subparagraph. Once it has been determined that the organization is a church or convention or association of churches, no further examination of its religious activities may be made in connection with determining its liability, if any, for unrelated business income tax.
(4)
Effective date.
The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to audits and examinations of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.
(j)
Effective date.
Paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section, inclusive, are effective for examinations scheduled after April 2, 1993.

In general
—(1) Section 7609 requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to follow special procedures when summoning a third party's testimony, records, or computer software source code. Except as provided in § 301.7609-2(b), the IRS must provide notice of a third-party summons to any person identified in the summons, other than the person summoned. A person entitled to notice of a third-party summons may intervene in any proceeding brought to enforce the summons or may bring a proceeding to quash the summons, regardless of whether they receive notice of the summons from the IRS pursuant to section 7609(a) and § 301.7609-2.
(2) Neither section 7609 nor the regulations hereunder limit the IRS's ability to obtain information, other than by summons, through formal or informal procedures authorized by sections 7601 and 7602.
(b)
Cross references.
See § 301.7609-2 for rules relating to persons who must be notified of a third-party summons and exceptions to the notification requirements.

§ 301.7609-2
Notification of persons identified in third-party summonses.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Persons entitled to notice.
Except as provided in § 301.7609-2(b), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shall give notice of a third-party summons to any person, other than the person summoned, who is identified in the summons. The only persons so identified are the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued and any other person identified in the description of summoned records or testimony. For example, if the IRS issues a summons to a bank with respect to the liability of C that requires the production of account records of A and B, both of whom are named in the summons, the IRS must notify A, B and C of the summons.
(2)
Time for providing notice.
If notice is required by this paragraph, such notice must be given within three days of the date on which the summons is served on the third party, but no later than 23 days prior to the date fixed in the summons as the date on which the examination of the summoned person or records is scheduled.
(3)
Methods for serving notice.
Notice may be served by hand delivery to any person entitled to notice or by leaving notice at such person's last and usual place of abode. Notice also may be served by certified or registered mail to the person's last known address, as defined in § 301.6212-2. If service to a person entitled to notice is made by certified or registered mail, the date of service is the date on which the notice is mailed.
(4)
Content of the notice.
Notice required to be given to any person entitled to notice must be accompanied by a copy of the summons that has been served and must include an explanation of the right to bring a proceeding to quash the summons. The copy of the summons accompanying the notice is not required to contain the attestation that appears pursuant to section 7603 on the copy of the summons served on the summoned person.
(b)
Exceptions.
The IRS is not required to provide notice to persons identified in the following third-party summonses:
(1)
Summons served on the taxpayer.
The IRS is not required to provide notice of a summons served on the person with respect to whose liability the summons was issued, or any officer or employee of such person.
(2)
Existence of records.
The IRS is not required to provide notice in the case of a summons issued to determine whether or not records of the business transactions or affairs of a person identified in the summons have been made or kept.
(3)
Numbered account or similar arrangement.
The IRS is not required to provide notice in the case of a summons issued solely to determine the identity of a person having a numbered account or similar arrangement with a bank or other institution. An account is a numbered account or similar arrangement within the meaning of this paragraph if it is an account through which a person may authorize transactions solely through the use of a number, symbol, code name, or other device not involving the disclosure of the person's identity. The term
person having a numbered account or similar arrangement
includes the person who opened the account and any person authorized to access the account or to receive records or statements concerning it.
(4)
Summonses in aid of the collection of liabilities
—(i)
In general.
The IRS is not required to provide notice in the case of a summons issued in aid of the collection of liabilities. A summons is in aid of the collection of liabilities within the meaning of this paragraph if it is issued in connection with the collection of—
(A) An assessment or judgment against the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued; or
(B) The liability determined at law or in equity of any transferee or fiduciary of a person described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A third-party summons is issued to a bank to determine the amount held in an account in the name of A, against whom unpaid income taxes have been assessed. Notice of the summons is not required to be given to A or any other persons identified in the summons because the summons is issued in connection with the collection of taxes that have been assessed.

# Example 2.
A third-party summons is issued to determine whether assessments should be made against A, who is potentially liable for a trust fund recovery penalty under section 6672 with respect to the assessed but unpaid withholding tax liability of employer E. The summons is captioned: In the matter of A. Notice of the summons must be provided to A and to any other persons identified in the summons because the summons was issued with respect to A's potential, unassessed liability under section 6672.
(5)
Summonses issued by a criminal investigator.
The IRS is not required to provide notice in the case of a summons issued by a criminal investigator to a person other than a third-party recordkeeper, as defined in section 7603(b). For purposes of section 7609(c)(2)(E), a summons issued by a criminal investigator is any summons issued as part of a criminal investigation by an IRS officer or employee having authority to conduct a criminal investigation and to issue a summons.
(6)
John Doe summons.
The IRS is not required to provide notice in the case of a John Doe summons issued under section 7609(f).
(7)
Summons issued pursuant to a court order to prevent spoliation of evidence.
The IRS is not required to provide notice in the case of a summons for which a court determines there is reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination, to prevent communication of information from other persons
through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, or to flee to avoid prosecution, testifying, or production of records.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section is applicable on April 30, 2008.

(a)
Duty of the summoned party.
Upon receipt of a summons, the summoned party must begin to assemble the summoned records. The summoned party must be prepared to produce the summoned records on the date on which the summons states that they are to be examined, regardless of the institution or anticipated institution of a proceeding to quash or the summoned party's intervention in a proceeding to quash, as allowed under section 7609(b)(2)(C).
(b)
Disclosing summoned party not liable
—(1)
In general.
A summoned party, or an agent or employee thereof, who makes a disclosure of records or gives testimony as required by a summons in good faith reliance on the certificate of the Secretary (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) or an order of a court requiring production of records or giving of testimony, will not be liable for any claim arising from such disclosure brought by any customer, any party with respect to whose tax liability the summons was issued, or any other person.
(2)
Certificate of the Secretary.
The Secretary may issue to the summoned party a certificate if the person with respect to whose liability the summons was issued expressly consents to the examination of the records summoned and the taking of testimony. The Secretary also may issue to the summoned party a certificate stating that—
(i) The 20-day period within which a person entitled to notice of the summons may institute a proceeding to quash the summons has expired; and
(ii) No proceeding has been instituted within that period.
(c)
Reimbursement of costs.
Summoned third parties may be entitled to reimbursement of their costs of assembling and preparing to produce summoned records, to the extent allowed by section 7610 and § 301.7610-1.
(d)
Notification of suspension of periods of limitations in connection with a John Doe summons
—(1)
Requirement of notification.
If any periods of limitations are suspended under section 7609(e)(2) and § 301.7609-5(d) with respect to a John Doe summons described in section 7609(f), the summoned party is required under section 7609(i)(4) to provide notice of such suspension to all persons with respect to whose liability the summons was issued.
(2)
Content of notification.
A summoned party required to notify a person of the suspension of the periods of limitations shall provide the following information to such person—
(i) A John Doe summons was served on the summoned party seeking records that may be relevant to the person's tax liability;
(ii) The date on which the summons was served;
(iii) The tax period(s) to which the summons relates;
(iv) Six months have passed since service of the summons and the summoned party's response to the summons has not been finally resolved;
(v) The periods of limitations under section 6501 (relating to assessment and collection) and section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecution), have been suspended; and
(vi) The date on which suspension of the periods of limitations under sections 6501 and 6531 began.
(3)
Time and manner of notification.
The notification must be made in writing and may be delivered in person, by mail sent to the address last known by the summoned party, or by use of any electronic means of transmission. Notification should be made as soon as possible after the suspension of the periods of limitations begins. Failure by a summoned party to give notice of the suspension of periods of limitations as required by section 7609(i)(4) does not prevent the suspension of the periods of limitations under section 7609(e)(2).

§ 301.7609-4
Right to intervene; right to institute a proceeding to quash.
(a)
Intervention in proceeding with respect to enforcement of a summons.
Under
section 7609(b)(1), a person entitled to notice of a summons under section 7609(a) and § 301.7609-2 is entitled to intervene in any proceeding brought under section 7604 with respect to the enforcement of that summons.
(b)
Right to institute a proceeding to quash
—(1)
In general.
Under section 7609(b), a person entitled to notice of a summons under section 7609(a) and § 301.7609-2 may institute a proceeding to quash the summons in the United States district court for the district in which the summoned person resides or is found.
(2)
Requirements for a proceeding to quash.
To institute a proceeding to quash a summons, a person entitled to notice of the summons must, not later than the 20th day following the day the notice of the summons was served on or mailed to such person—
(i) File a petition to quash a summons in the name of the person entitled to notice of the summons in the proper district court;
(ii) Notify the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by sending a copy of that petition to quash by registered or certified mail to the IRS employee and office designated in the notice of summons to receive the copy; and
(iii) Notify the summoned person by sending by registered or certified mail a copy of the petition to quash to the summoned person.
(3)
Failure to give timely notice.
If a person entitled to notice of the summons fails to give proper and timely notice to either the summoned person or the IRS in the manner described in this paragraph, that person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash and the district court lacks jurisdiction to hear the proceeding. For example, if the person entitled to notice mails a copy of the petition to the summoned person, but fails to mail a copy of the petition to the designated IRS employee and office, the person entitled to notice has failed to institute a proceeding to quash. Similarly, if the person entitled to notice mails a copy of such petition to the summoned person but, instead of sending a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail to the designated IRS employee and office, the person entitled to notice provides the designated IRS employee and office the petition by some other means, the person entitled to notice has failed to institute a proceeding to quash.
(4)
Failure to institute a proceeding to quash.
If a person entitled to notice fails to institute a proceeding to quash within 20 days following the day the notice of the summons was served on or mailed to such person, the IRS may examine the summoned records and take summoned testimony following the 23rd day after notice of the summons was served on or mailed to the person entitled to notice.
(c)
Presumption no notice has been mailed.
Section 7609(b)(2)(B) permits a person entitled to notice to institute a proceeding to quash by filing a petition in district court and notifying both the IRS and the summoned person. Unless the person entitled to notice has notified both the IRS and the summoned person in the appropriate manner, the person entitled to notice has failed to institute a proceeding to quash. For the purpose of permitting the IRS to examine the summoned witnesses and records, it is presumed that the notification was not timely mailed if the copy of the petition was not delivered to the summoned person or to the person and office designated to receive the notice on behalf of the IRS within three days after the close of the 20-day period allowed for instituting a proceeding to quash.

(b)
Intervention in an action to enforce the summons
—(1) In general. If a person entitled to notice of a summons under section 7609(a) and § 301.7609-2 with respect to whose liability the summons was issued, or such person's agent,
nominee, or other person acting under the direction or control of the person entitled to notice, takes any action to intervene in a proceeding with respect to enforcement of such summons brought pursuant to section 7604, that person's periods of limitations under sections 6501 (relating to assessment and collection) and 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions) for the tax period or periods that are the subject of the summons are suspended for the period during which such proceeding is pending.
(2)
Action to intervene.
A person entitled to notice takes any action to intervene in a proceeding to enforce a summons within the meaning of § 301.7609-4(a) on the date when a motion to intervene is filed with the court.
(c)
Institution of a proceeding to quash a summons
—(1)
In general.
If a person entitled to notice of a summons under section 7609(a) and § 301.7609-2 with respect to whose liability the summons was issued, or such person's agent, nominee, or other person acting under the direction or control of such person, takes any action described in § 301.7609-4(b) to institute a proceeding to quash such summons, that person's periods of limitations under sections 6501 and 6531 for the tax period or periods that are the subject of the summons are suspended for the period during which such proceeding is pending.
(2)
Action to institute a proceeding to quash a summons.
A person entitled to notice takes any action to institute a proceeding to quash if he or she files a petition to quash the summons in any district court, regardless of whether the timely filing requirements of section 7609(b)(2)(A) or the notice requirements of section 7609(b)(2)(B) are satisfied. For example, a person entitled to notice takes an action to institute a proceeding to quash a summons for purposes of this section if that person files a petition to quash the summons in district court and notifies the summoned person by sending a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, but fails to mail a copy of that notice to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service (IRS) person and office.
(d)
Summoned party's failure to finally resolve the response to a summons after six months from service
—(1)
In general.
If a third party's response to a summons for which the IRS was required to provide notice to persons identified in the summons, or to a John Doe summons described in section 7609(f), is not finally resolved within six months after the date of service of the summons, the periods of limitations are suspended under sections 6501 and 6531, for the person with respect to whose liability the summons was issued and for any person whose identity is sought to be obtained by a John Doe summons, for the tax period or periods that are the subject of the summons. The suspension shall begin on the date which is six months after the service of the summons and shall end on the date on which there is a final resolution of the summoned party's response to the summons.
(2)
Example.
The rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are illustrated by the following example:
A John Doe summons is issued on April 1, 2004, to the promoter of a tax shelter and seeks the names of all participants in the shelter in order to investigate the participants' income tax liabilities for 2001 and 2002. The district court approves service of the summons on April 30, 2004, and the summons is served on the promoter on May 3, 2004. The promoter does not provide the names of the participants. The periods of limitations for the participants' income tax liabilities and criminal prosecution for 2001 and 2002 are suspended under section 7609(e)(2) beginning on November 3, 2004, the date which is six months after the date the John Doe summons was served until the date on which the promoter's response to the summons is finally resolved.
(e)
Definitions

Agent, nominee, etc.
A person is the agent, nominee, or other person of a person entitled to notice under section 7609(a) and § 301.7609-2, and is acting under the direction or control of the person entitled to notice for purposes of section 7609(e)(1), if the person entitled to notice has the ability in fact or at law to cause the agent, nominee or other person, to take the actions permitted under section 7609(b).
(2)
Period during which a proceeding is pending
—(i)
Intervention in an enforcement proceeding.
The period during which the periods of limitations under sections 6501 and 6531 are suspended under section 7609(e)(1) begins on the
date any person described in paragraph (b) of this section intervenes in an action to enforce the summons. The periods of limitations remain suspended until all appeals are disposed of, or until the expiration of the period during which an appeal may be taken or a request for further review may be made. The periods of limitations remain suspended for the period during which a proceeding is pending, regardless of compliance (or partial compliance) with the summons during that period. If, following issuance of an order to enforce a third-party summons, a collateral proceeding is brought challenging whether production made by the summoned party fully satisfied the court order and whether sanctions should be imposed against the summoned party for a failure to satisfy that order, the periods of limitations remain suspended until all appeals of the collateral proceeding are disposed of, or until the expiration of the period during which an appeal may be taken or a request for further review of the collateral proceeding may be made. Any collateral proceeding to the original proceeding shall be considered to be a continuation of the original proceeding.
(ii)
Proceeding to quash a summons.
The period during which the periods of limitations under sections 6501 and 6531 are suspended under section 7609(e)(1) begins on the date any person described in paragraph (c) of this section files a petition to quash the summons in district court. The periods of limitations remain suspended until all appeals are disposed of, or until expiration of the period in which an appeal may be taken or a request for further review may be made. The periods of limitations remain suspended for the period during which a proceeding is pending, regardless of compliance (or partial compliance) with the summons during that period.
(iii)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (e)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A revenue agent issues a summons to A, an accountant for B, requiring production of records relating to B's income tax liabilities for 2002. The summons is served on A on March 1, 2004. B files a petition to quash the summons in district court on March 15, 2004. The district court dismisses B's petition on July 1, 2004. B fails to appeal this decision by filing a notice of appeal within 60 days from the date of the district court's order of dismissal. The revenue agent notifies A that B did not appeal the district court's order. A turns over all of the records requested in the summons. The periods of limitations applicable to B for 2002 under sections 6501 and 6531 are suspended under section 7609(e)(1) from March 15, 2004, the date B filed a petition to quash, until August 30, 2004, the last day on which B could have filed a notice of appeal.

# Example 2.
A revenue agent issues a summons to A, an accountant for B, requiring production of records relating to B's income tax liabilities for 2003. The summons is served on A on June 1, 2005. B files an untimely petition to quash the summons in district court on June 29, 2005. The district court dismisses B's petition on July 29, 2005. B does not file an appeal of the district court's order. The periods of limitations applicable to B for 2003 under sections 6501 and 6531 are suspended under section 7609(e)(1) from June 29, 2005, the date B filed an untimely petition to quash, until September 27, 2005, the last day on which B could have filed a notice of appeal.
(3)
Final resolution of the summoned third party's response to a summons.
For purposes of section 7609(e)(2)(B), final resolution with respect to a summoned party's response to a third-party summons occurs when the summons or any order enforcing any part of the summons is fully complied with and all appeals or requests for further review are disposed of, the period in which an appeal may be taken has expired or the period in which a request for further review may be made has expired. The determination of whether there has been full compliance will be made within a reasonable time, given the volume and complexity of the records produced, after the later of the giving of all testimony or the production of all records requested by the summons or required by any order enforcing any part of the summons. If, following an enforcement order, collateral proceedings are brought challenging whether the production made by the summoned party fully satisfied the court order and whether sanctions should be imposed against the summoned party for a failing to do so, the suspension of the periods of limitations shall continue until the summons or any order enforcing any part of the
summons is fully complied with and the decision in the collateral proceeding becomes final. A decision in a collateral proceeding becomes final when all appeals are disposed of, the period in which an appeal may be taken has expired or the period in which a request for further review may be made has expired.

Fees and costs for witnesses.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 7610 provides that the Internal Revenue Service may make payments to certain persons who are asked to give information to the Service. Under section 7610 witnesses generally will not be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred but instead will be paid in accordance with the payment rates established by regulations. Paragraph (b) of this section contains elaborations of certain terms found in section 7610 and definitions of other terms used in the regulations under section 7610(a)(b); and paragraphs (c) and (d) contain rules and rates applicable to payments under section 7610. Section 7610 and its regulations are effective for summonses issued after February 28, 1977, except as otherwise provided.
(b)
Definitions
—(1) Directly incurred costs. Directly incurred costs are costs incurred solely, immediately, and necessarily as a consequence of searching for, reproducing, or transporting records in order to comply with a summons. They do not include a proportionate allocation of fixed costs, such as overhead, equipment depreciation, etc. However, where a third party's records are stored at an independent storage facility that charges the third party a search fee to search for, reproduce, or transport particular records requested, these fees are considered to be directly incurred by the summoned third party.
(2)
Reproduction cost.
Reproduction costs are costs incurred in making copies or duplicates of summoned documents, transcripts, and other similar material.
(3)
Search costs.
Search costs include only the total-cost of personnel time directly incurred in searching for records or information and the cost of retrieving information stored by computer. Salaries of persons locating and retrieving summoned material are not includible in search costs. Also, search costs do not include salaries, fees, or similar expenditures for analysis of material or for managerial or legal advice, expertise, or research, or time spent for these activities.
(4)
Third party.
A third party is any person served with a summons, other than a person with respect to whose liability a summons is issued, or an officer, employee, agent, accountant, or attorney of that person.
(5)
Third party records.
Third party records are books, papers, records, or other data in which the person with respect to whose liability a summons is issued does not have a proprietary interest at the time the summons is served.
(6)
Transportation costs.
Transportation costs include only costs incurred to transport personnel to search for records or information requested and costs incurred solely by the need to transport the summoned material to the place of examination. These costs do not include the cost of transporting the summoned witness for appearance at the place of examination. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for payment of travel expenses.
(c)
Conditions and rates of payments
—(1)
Basis for payment.
Payment for search, reproduction, and transportation costs will be made only to third parties served with a summons to produce third party records or information and only for material requested by the summons. Payment will be made only for these costs that are both directly incurred and reasonably necessary. Search, reproduction, and transportation costs must be considered separately in determining whether costs are reasonably necessary. No payment will be made until the third party has satisfactorily complied with the summons and has submitted an itemized bill or invoice showing specific details concerning the costs to the Internal Revenue Service employee before whom the third party was summoned. If a third party charges any other person for any cost for which the
third party is seeking payment from the Service, the amount charged to the other person must be subtracted from the amount the Internal Revenue Service must pay.
(2)
Payment rates.
The following rates are established.
(i)
Search costs.
(A) For the total amount of personnel time required to locate records or information, $8.50 per person hour for summonses issued after July 19, 1983. For summonses issued on or before such date, $5.00 per person hour.
(B) For retrieval of information stored by computer in the format in which it is normally produced, actual costs, based on computer time and necessary supplies, except that personnel time for computer search is payable only under subparagraph (2)(i)(A) of this paragraph.
(ii)
Reproductions costs.
(A) For copies of documents $.20 per page for summonses issued after July 19, 1983. For copies of documents issued on or before such date, $.10 per page.
(B) For photographers, films and other materials, actual cost, except that personnel time is payable only under subparagraph (2)(i)(A) of this paragraph.
(iii)
Transportation costs.
For transportation costs, actual cost, except that personnel time is payable only under subparagraph (2)(i)(A) of this paragraph.
(d)
Appearance fees and allowances
—(1) In general. Under section 7610(a)(1) and this paragraph, the Service shall pay a summoned person certain fees and allowances. No payments will be made until after the party summoned appears and has submitted any necessary receipts or other evidence of costs to the Service employee before whom the person was summoned. This paragraph is effective with respect to appearances made after October 26, 1978.
(2)
Attendance fees.
A summoned person shall be paid an attendance fee for each day's attendance. A summoned person shall also be paid the attendance fee for the time necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the place of attendance at the beginning and end of the attendance or at any time during the attendance. The attendance fee is the higher of $30 per day or the amount paid under 28 U.S.C. 1821(b) to witnesses in attendance at courts of the United States at the time of the summoned person's appearance.
(3)
Travel allowances.
A summoned person who travels by common carrier shall be paid for the actual expenses of travel on the basis of the means of transportation reasonably utilized and the distance necessarily traveled to and from the summoned person's residence by the shortest pratical route in going to and returning from the place of attendance. Such a summoned person shall utilize a common carrier at the most economical rate reasonably available. A receipt or other evidence of actual cost shall be furnished. A travel allowance equal to the mileage allowance which the Administrator of General Services has prescribed, under 5 U.S.C. 5704, for offical travel of employees of the Federal Government shall be paid to each summoned person who travels by privately owned vehicle. That rate is $.20 per mile as of April 20, 1980. Computation of mileage under this paragraph shall be made on the basis of a uniform table of distances adopted by the Administrator of General Services. Toll charges for toll roads, bridges, tunnels, and ferries, taxicab fares between places of lodging and carrier terminals, and parking fees (upon presentation of a valid parking receipt) shall be paid in full to a summoned person incurring those expenses.
(4)
Subsistence allowances.
A subsistence allowance shall be paid to a summoned person (other than a summoned person who is incarcerated) when an overnight stay is required at the place of attendance because the place is so far removed from the residence of the summoned person as to prohibit return thereto from day to day. A subsistence allowance for a summoned person shall be paid in an amount not to exceed the maximum per diem allowance prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, under 5 U.S.C. 5702(a), for official travel in the area of attendance by employees of the Federal Government. As of April 30, 1979, that maximum per diem allowance is $35 per day. A subsistence allowance for a summoned person attending in an area designated by the Administrator of
General Services as a high-cost area shall be paid in an amount not to exceed the maximum actual subsistence allowance prescribed by the Administrator, under 5, U.S.C. 5702(c)(B), for official travel in that area by employees of the Federal Government. As of April 30, 1979, maximum rates of up to $50 per day have been prescribed by the Administrator for certain areas. An alien who has been paroled into the United States for prosecution, under section 212 (d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)), or an alien who either has admitted belonging to a class of aliens who are deportable or has been determined under section 242(b) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(b)) to be deportable, shall be ineligible to receive the fees or allowances provided for under section 7610(a)(1).

# Church Tax Inquiry
Q-1: When may the Internal Revenue Service begin an inquiry of a church's tax liability?
A-1: Under section 7611 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Internal Revenue Service may begin a church tax inquiry only when the appropriate Regional Commissioner (or higher Treasury official) reasonably believes, on the basis of facts and circumstances recorded in writing, that the organization (1) may not qualify for tax exemption as a church; (2) may be carrying on an unrelated trade or business (within the meaning of section 513); or (3) may be otherwise engaged in activities subject to tax. Information received by the Internal Revenue Service at its request may not be used to form the basis of a reasonable belief to begin a church tax inquiry, unless the Service's request is made within the procedures of section 7611, is a request permitted by these questions and answers to be made without application of the procedures of section 7611, or is a request to which the procedures of section 7611 do not apply.
Q-2: What is a church tax inquiry within the meaning of section 7611?
A-2: A church tax inquiry is any inquiry to a church (other than a routine request described in Q and A-4, an inquiry described in Q and A-5, an investigation described in Q and A-6 or an examination described in Qs and As 10 and 14), to serve as a basis for determining whether the organization qualifies for tax exemption as a church or whether it is carrying on an unrelated trade or business or is otherwise engaged in activities subject to tax. An inquiry is considered to commence when the Internal Revenue Service requests information or materials from a church of a type contained in church records. The term “church tax inquiry” does not include routine requests for information or inquiries regarding matters which do not primarily concern the tax status or liability of the church itself. See Q and A-4 with respect to routine requests regarding, among other things, withholding responsibilities for income tax or FICA (social security) tax liabilities. See Q and A-6 with respect to the types of investigations, other than routine requests, that are outside the scope of the procedures of section 7611. See Q and A-5 with respect to requests for third party records that are outside the scope of the procedures of section 7611.
Q-3: What is a “church” for purposes of the church tax inquiry and examination procedures of section 7611?
A-3: Solely for purposes of applying the procedures of section 7611, and as used in these questions and answers, the term “church” includes any organization claiming to be a church and any convention or association of churches. For purposes of the procedures of section 7611 and these questions and answers a church does not include separately incorporated church-supported schools or other organizations incorporated separately from the church.

# Routine Requests
Q-4: What is a routine request to a church that is outside the scope of and does not necessitate application of the procedures set forth in section 7611?
A-4: Routine requests to a church will not be considered to commence a church tax inquiry and will not necessitate application of the procedures set forth in section 7611. Routine requests for this purpose include (but are not limited to) questions regarding (1) the filing or failure to file any tax return or information return by the church; (2) compliance with income tax or FICA (social security) tax withholding responsibilities by the church; (3) any supplemental information needed to complete the mechanical processing of any incomplete or incorrect return filed by the church; (4) information necessary to process applications for exempt status and letter ruling requests; (5) information necessary to process and update periodically a church's (i) registrations for tax-free transactions (excise tax), (ii) elections for exemption from windfall profit tax, or (iii) employment tax exemption requests; (6) information identifying a church that is used to update the Cumulative List of Tax Exempt Organizations (Publication No. 78) and other computer files; and (7) confirmation that a specific business is or is not owned or operated by a church.

# Third Party Records
Q-5: To what extent may the Internal Revenue Service gain access to third party records?
A-5: The Internal Revenue Service may request a church to provide information necessary to locate third-party records (for instance, bank records), including information regarding the church's chartered name, state and year of incorporation, and location of checking and savings accounts, without application of the procedures of section 7611.
Records (for instance, cancelled checks or other records in the possession of a bank) held by third party recordkeepers, as defined in section 7609, are not considered church records. Thus, subject to the provisions set forth in section 7609 regarding third party summonses, access is permitted to such records without regard to the requirements of the procedures set forth in section 7611. The Internal Revenue Service is generally required, under other rules, to inform a church of any Internal Revenue Service requests for materials.
Third party materials may be acquired without application of the procedures of section 7611; however, a determination that a church is not entitled to an exemption, or an assessment of tax for unrelated business income against a church, may not be made solely on the basis of third party records, without first complying with the requirements of two notices and offering of a conference (see Qs and As 9 and 10) pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 7611. This limitation does not apply to assessments of tax other than income tax resulting from loss of exemption or for unrelated business income (for instance, assessments of social security or other employment taxes). Third party bank records will not be used in a manner inconsistent with the procedures set forth in section 7611 or in these questions and answers.

# Scope of Section 7611
Q-6: What types of investigations, other than routine requests and requests for information necessary to locate and examine third party records, and examination of those records, are outside the scope of the procedures of section 7611?
A-6: The church inquiry and examination procedures described in section 7611 do not apply to (1) any inquiry or examination relating to the tax liability of any person other than a church; (2) any termination assessment under
section 6851 or 6852, or jeopardy assessment under section 6861; or (3) any case involving a knowing failure to file a return or a willful attempt to defeat or evade tax (including but not limited to any case involving a failure by the church to withhold or pay social security or other employment taxes or income tax required to be withheld from wages). Additionally, the church inquiry and examination procedures do not apply to any criminal investigations.
The church tax inquiry and examination procedures also do not apply to inquiries or examinations which relate primarily to the tax status (including, but not limited to, social security or self-employment tax or income tax required to be withheld from wages) or liability of persons other than the church (including, but not limited to, the tax status or liability of a contributor or contributors to the church), rather than the tax status or liability of the church itself. These may include, but are not limited to: (1) inquiries or examinations regarding the inurement of church funds to a particular individual or individuals or to another organization, which may result in the denial of all or part of such individual's or organization's deduction for charitable contributions to a church; (2) inquiries or examinations regarding the assignment of income or services or contributions to a church; and (3) inquiries or examinations regarding a vow of poverty by an individual or individuals followed by a transfer of property or an assignment of income or services to a church. Inquiries may be made to a church regarding these matters without being considered to have commenced a church tax inquiry under section 7611, and an examination of church records may be made relating to these issues (including enforcement of a summons for access to such records) without application of the requirements contained in section 7611 applicable to church tax inquiries and examinations. Such examinations are subject to the general rules regarding examinations of taxpayer books and records.
Q-7: What action may be taken if the church or its agents fail to respond to routine requests, or questions regarding other individuals' or organizations' tax liabilities?
A-7: Repeated (two or more) failures by a church or its agents to reply to routine requests (see Q and A-4) will be considered by the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Regional Commissioner to be a reasonable basis for commencement of a church tax inquiry under the church tax inquiry and examination procedures of section 7611. The failure of a church to respond to repeated requests for information regarding individuals' or other organizations' tax liabilities (see Q and A-6) will be considered a reasonable basis for commencement of a church tax inquiry. Failure by a church to provide information necessary to locate third-party records (see Q and A-5) will be a factor, but not a conclusive factor, in determining if there is reasonable cause for commencing a church tax inquiry. For this purpose, a failure to respond to a request means either that no response has been made or that the response does not make a reasonable attempt to submit the information called for by the specific language of the request.
Q-8: Where an inquiry or examination is outside the scope of and does not necessitate application of the procedures of section 7611, what are the limitations on the Internal Revenue Service's actions?
A-8: Inquiries or examinations which are outside the scope of the procedures of section 7611 and therefore are conducted without application of the procedures of section 7611 (for instance, those addressed in Q and A-6) will be limited to the determination of facts and circumstances specifically relating to the tax liabilities of the individuals or other organizations in question. For example, in a case against an individual or other organization, information may be requested or church records examined, if pertinent, regarding amounts of money, property, or services transferred to the individual or individuals in question (including, but not limited to wages, loans, or noncontractual transfers), the use of church funds for personal expenses, or other similar matters, without having to follow the church tax inquiry and
examination procedures. As one example, in an assignment of income case against an individual or other organization, information could be requested or church records examined if relevant to an individual's assignment of particular income, donation of property, or transfer of a business to a church. However, without following the church tax inquiry and examination procedures, no examination of a contributor or membership list in the possession of the church will be made, other than under the applicable procedures of section 7611, for the purpose of determining the overall financial structure of the church, merely because such structure was relevant to the church's qualification as a tax-exempt entity and therefore indirectly relevant to the validity of contributors' deductions in general. Inquiries or examinations regarding individuals' or other organizations' tax liabilities will not be used in a manner inconsistent with the procedures set forth in section 7611 or in these questions and answers.

# Notice Requirements
Q-9: What satisfies the inquiry notice requirement (first notice) upon commencement of a church tax inquiry?
A-9: Upon commencing a church tax inquiry, the appropriate Regional Commissioner is required to provide written notice to the church of the beginning of the inquiry. This notice will include (1) an explanation of the concerns which gave rise to the inquiry and the general subject matter of the inquiry, which is sufficiently specific to allow the church to understand the particular area of church activities or behavior which is at issue; (2) a general explanation of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which authorize the inquiry or which may otherwise be involved in the inquiry; and (3) a general explanation of applicable administrative and constitutional provisions with respect to the inquiry, including the right to a conference with the Internal Revenue Service before an examination of church records is commenced. The inquiry notice (first notice) will generally request information in an effort to alleviate the concerns which gave rise to the inquiry.
However, the Internal Revenue Service is not precluded from expanding its inquiry beyond the concerns expressed in the inquiry notice (first notice) as a result of facts and circumstances which subsequently comes to its attention (including, where appropriate, an expansion of an unrelated business income inquiry to include questions of tax-exempt status, and vice-versa).
The inquiry notice requirement (first notice) does not require the Internal Revenue Service to share particular items of evidence with the church, or to identify its sources of information regarding church activities, if providing such information would be damaging to the inquiry or to the sources of information. For example, in an inquiry regarding unrelated business income, the Internal Revenue Service might state that its inquiry was prompted by a local newspaper advertisement regarding a church-owned business. However, the Internal Revenue Service would not be required to reveal the existence or identity of any so-called “informers” within a church (including present or former employees).
Q-10: What must be done to satisfy the examination notice requirement (second notice) before commencing an examination of church records or religious activities with respect to an examination conducted under section 7611?
A-10: Where an examination is conducted under section 7611, church records or religious activities of a church may be examined only if, at least 15 days prior to the examination, written notice of the proposed examination is provided to the church and to the appropriate Regional Counsel. This notice is in addition to the notice of commencement of inquiry (first notice) previously provided to the church.
The notice of examination (second notice) is required to include (1) a copy of the church tax inquiry notice (first notice) previously provided to the church; (2) a description of the church records and activities sought to be examined; and (3) a copy of all documents which were collected or prepared by the Internal Revenue Service for use in
the examination, and which are required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) as supplemented by section 6103 of the Code (relating to disclosure and confidentiality of tax return information). The documents to be supplied under this provision will be limited to documents specifically concerning the church whose records are to be examined and will not include documents relating to other inquiries or examinations or to Internal Revenue Service practices and procedures in general. Disclosure to the church will be subject to restrictions regarding the disclosure of the existence or identity of informants. Although a description of materials to be examined will be provided in the notice of examination (second notice), the description does not restrict the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to examine church records or religious activities which are not specifically mentioned in the notice of examination (second notice) but which are properly within the scope of the examination. Thus, the Internal Revenue Service is not precluded from expanding its inquiry beyond the concerns expressed in the examination notice (second notice) as a result of facts and circumstances which subsequently come to its attention (including, where appropriate, an expansion of an unrelated business income examination to include questions of tax--exempt status, and vice versa).
At the time the notice of examination (second notice) is provided to the church, a copy of the same notice will be provided to the appropriate Regional Counsel. The Regional Counsel is then allowed 15 days from issuance of the second notice in which to file an advisory objection to the examination. (This is concurrent with the 15-day period during which an examination of church records is prohibited pending a request for a conference.)
As part of the notice of examination (second notice), the church will be offered an opportunity to meet with an Internal Revenue Service official to discuss the concerns which gave rise to the inquiry and the general subject matter of the inquiry. An examination will not begin until 15 days after the mailing of the notice of examination (second notice). The organization may request a conference at any time prior to beginning of the examination and a conference so requested will be scheduled within a reasonable time after the request is made.
The purpose of the conference is to remind the church, in general terms, of the stages of the church tax inquiry and examination procedures and to discuss the relevant issues that may arise as part of the inquiry, in an effort to resolve the issues of tax exemption or liability without the necessity of an examination of church records or activities. Information properly excludable from a written notice of examination (second notice) (including information regarding the identity of third-party witnesses or evidence provided by such witnesses) is not a subject for discussion at, and will not be revealed during, a conference.
Once a conference request is timely made, an examination will begin only following the conference. The conference requirement may not be utilized to delay an examination beyond the time reasonably necessary to prepare for and hold the conference. The holding of one conference with the church will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 7611 and these questions and answers.

# Action After Issuance of Notice
Q-11: What action may be taken after issuance of the examination notice (second notice)?
A-11: After the examination notice (second notice) is issued, the organization may request a conference as described in Q and A-10 (see Q and A-12 with respect to time for issuance of examination notice). If the matters of concern which gave rise to the issuance of the examination notice (second notice) are resolved at the conference, it may be determined that an examination is not necessary. If the matters of concern are not resolved at the conference, or if the organization does not request a conference, the examination will ordinarily begin.
The examination will be conducted under the Internal Revenue Service's general examination procedures and
the procedures of section 7611. The outcome of such an examination will ordinarily be: (1) No change in tax-exempt status or tax liability; (2) no change in such status or liability, conditioned on compliance with a request to modify in future tax periods matters such as internal accounting practices and procedures or coupled with a caution to refrain from increasing certain activities limited by the Internal Revenue Code, such as lobbying programs aimed at influencing legislation; (3) a proposal to revoke tax-exempt status; (4) a proposal asserting unrelated business income tax liability; or (5) a proposal asserting liability for other taxes.
In certain exceptional circumstances the Internal Revenue Service may, in lieu of an examination, propose to revoke the organization's exemption based upon the facts and circumstances which form the basis for a reasonable belief to commence an inquiry under section 7611 and any other appropriate information that becomes apparent as a result of the inquiry, the conference, or both.
Pursuant to section 7611(d), the Regional Counsel is required to approve, in writing, certain final determinations that are within the scope of section 7611 and adversely affect tax-exempt status or increase any tax liability. The Regional Counsel will review and approve (1) a determination that an organization is not entitled to tax-exempt status; (2) a determination that an organization is not entitled to receive tax-deductible contributions; or (3) the issuance of a notice of tax deficiency to a church arising out of an inquiry or examination or, in cases where deficiency procedures are inapplicable, the assessment of any underpayment of tax by the church arising out of an inquiry or examination. The Regional Counsel will also state in writing that there has been substantial compliance with section 7611, when applicable.

# Procedural Time Limitations
Q-12: When may the notice of examination (second notice) be sent?
A-12. The notice of examination (second notice) may be mailed to a church not less than 15 days after the notice of commencement of a church tax inquiry (first notice). Thus, at least 30 days must pass between the first notice and the actual examination of church records since an examination may not begin until 15 days after the notice of examination (second notice). For example, if notice of commencement of an inquiry is mailed to a church on March 1st, the notice of proposed examination may be mailed to the church no earlier than the 15th day after the date of the inquiry notice, or March 16th. If the notice of examination (second notice) was mailed March 16th, no examination of church records may be made prior to day 30; thus, the earliest date the examination may commence is March 31st. If an organization does not request a conference prior to day 30, the Internal Revenue Service may proceed to examine church records and complete its investigation or make a determination based on the information already in its possession.
Q-13: What is the limitation on the amount of time the Internal Revenue Service has to complete inquiries and examinations?
A-13: The Internal Revenue Service is required to complete any church inquiry or examination, and to make a final determination with respect thereto, not later than two years after the date on which the notice of examination (second notice) is mailed to the church. The running of this two-year period is suspended for any period during which (1) a judicial proceeding brought by the church or its officials or agents against the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the church tax inquiry or examination is pending or being appealed (even though section 7611(e)(2) describes the exclusive remedy for a violation of the church tax inquiry and examination procedures; see Q and A-17); (2) a judicial proceeding brought by the Internal Revenue Service against the church (or any official or agent thereof) to compel compliance with any reasonable request for examination of church records or religious activities is pending or being appealed; or (3) the Internal Revenue Service is unable to take actions with respect to the church tax inquiry or examination by reason of an order issued in a suit under section 7609 involving access to records held by third-party recordkeepers. The two-year period is also
suspended for any period in excess of 20 days (but not in excess of 6 months) in which the church or its agents fail to comply with any reasonable request for church records or other information. The two-year period may be extended by mutual agreement of the church and the Internal Revenue Service.
In cases where the inquiry is not followed by an examination notice (second notice), the inquiry must be concluded and a final determination made within 90 days of the date of the notice of inquiry (first notice). This 90-day period is suspended during any period for which the two year period for duration of a church examination would be suspended; except that the 90-day period will not be suspended because of the church's failure to comply with requests for information made prior to the notice of examination (second notice).
Q-13a: When do the church tax inquiry and church tax examination periods commence and conclude?
A-13a: A church tax inquiry commences when the church tax inquiry notice (first notice) is mailed. A church tax inquiry must be concluded not later than 90 days after the church tax inquiry notice (first notice) date. The period is counted from the day after the inquiry notice (first notice) is mailed. A church tax inquiry is concluded when the results of the inquiry or the notice of examination, as appropriate, is mailed. For example, if the inquiry notice (first notice) is mailed on November 1, 1985, the church tax inquiry must be concluded, in the absence of a permissible suspension of the period (see Q and A-13), on or before January 30, 1986.
A church tax examination commences when the church tax examination notice (second notice) is mailed. A church tax examination must be concluded not later than the date which is 2 years after the examination notice (second notice) date. The period is counted from the day after the examination notice (second notice) is mailed. A church tax examination is concluded when the final determination is mailed. For example, if the examination notice is mailed November 16, 1985, the final determination must be made, in the absence of a permissible suspension of the period (see Q and A-13), on or before November 16, 1987.

# Examination of Records or Religious Activities
Q-14: To what extent may church records or religious activities of a church be examined?
A-14: In cases conducted under section 7611, an examination of church records may be made only after complying with the notice provisions of section 7611 (see Qs and As 9, 10 and 12) unless the church files a written waiver of the provisions of section 7611 or a part thereof. In cases conducted under section 7611 where no written waiver has been filed, church records may be examined only to the extent necessary to determine the liability for, and the amount of, any Federal tax. This includes examinations (1) to determine the initial or continuing qualification of the organization whose records are being examined as a tax-exempt church under section 501(c)(3); (2) to determine whether the organization qualifies to receive tax-deductible contributions under section 170(c); or (3) to determine the amount of tax (including unrelated business income tax), if any, which is to be imposed on the organization.
Church records include all regularly kept church corporate and financial records including (but not limited to) corporate minute books, contributor or membership lists, and any materials which qualified as church books of account under section 7605(c), as in effect on December 31, 1984. Church records include private correspondence between a church and its members that is in the possession of the church. However, church records do not include records previously filed with a public official or newspapers or newsletters distributed generally to church members.
The religious activities of an organization claiming to be a church (see Q and A-3 for a definition of the term “church” as used in section 7611 and in these questions and answers) may be examined only to the extent necessary to determine if the organization actually is a church exempt from tax. This
includes a determination of the organization's qualification as a church for any period.

# Limitations on Period of Assessment or Proceedings for Collection Without Assessment
Q-15: What are the special limitations on the period of assessment or proceedings for collection without assessment?
A-15: The special limitation periods for church tax liabilities are described below and are not be to construed to increase an otherwise applicable limitation period. Thus, a three-year limitation period would apply where a church filed a tax return before an examination was held and did not substantially understate income. No limitation period is to apply in any case of fraud, willful tax evasion, or knowing failure to file a return which should have been filed.
In the case of any church tax examination with respect to the revocation of tax-exempt status under section 501(a), any tax imposed by chapter 1 (other than section 511) may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, only for the three most recently completed taxable years preceding the examination notice date (
i.e.,
the date the notice of examination is mailed to the church). If an organization is not a church exempt from tax under section 501(a) for any of the three years described in the preceding sentence, then the period of assessment will apply to the six most recently completed taxable years ending before the examination notice date.
For examinations concerning qualification for tax-exempt status, the examination is limited initially to an examination of church records which are relevant to a determination of tax status or liability for the three most recently completed taxable years ending before the examination notice date. If it is determined that an organization is not a church exempt from tax for one or more of the three most recently completed taxable years and no return has been filed for the three years ending before the three most recently completed taxable years, an examination of relevant records may be made, as part of the same examination, for the six most recently completed taxable years ending before the examination notice date. (This assumes that no returns were filed for any of the three years to which the examination is to be extended. If a return was timely filed for any such year, the filing of that return determines the applicable statute of limitations for that year in the absence of other factors, for example, fraud, willful tax evasion or substantial understatement, which ordinarily would extend the statute of limitations.)
For purposes of section 7611(d)(2)(A) and this question and answer, an organization is determined not to be a church exempt from tax for one or more of the three most recently completed taxable years ending before the examination notice date, when the appropriate Regional Commissioner approves, in writing, the completed findings of the examining agent that the organization is not a church exempt from tax for one or more of such years. Such approval may not be delegated by the Regional Commissioner to a subordinate official. The completed findings of the examining agent, as approved by the appropriate Regional Commissioner for this purpose, do not constitute a final revenue agent's report under section 7611(g).
Church records of a year earlier than the third or sixth completed taxable year, as applicable, may be examined if material to a determination of tax-exempt status during the applicable three or six year period.
For examinations concerning unrelated business taxable income, where no return has been filed by the church, tax may be assessed or collected for the six most recently completed taxable years ending before the examination notice date. Church records of a year earlier than the sixth year may be examined if material to a determination of unrelated business income tax liability during the six year period.
For examinations involving issues other than revocation of exempt status or unrelated business income (e.g., examinations relating to social security or other employment taxes), no limitation period is to apply if no return has been filed.
The applicable limitation period may be extended by mutual agreement of the church and the Internal Revenue Service.

# Multiple Examinations
Q-16: What are the special multiple examination rules applicable to churches?
A-16: The Assistant Commissioner (Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations) is required to approve, in writing, any second inquiry or examination of a church, if the second inquiry or examination is to be undertaken within five years of an earlier inquiry or examination and if the earlier inquiry or examination did not result in either (1) revocation of tax exemption, notice of deficiency or an assessment of tax, or (2) a request for any significant changes in church operational practices (including the adequacy or sufficiency of records maintained to reflect income). The Assistant Commissioner's approval is required only if the second inquiry or examination involves the same or similar issues as the earlier inquiry or examination. The 5-year period is counted from the examination notice date of the earlier examination or, if no notice of examination was mailed, the inquiry notice date of the earlier examination. This 5-year period is to be suspended for periods during which the two-year period for completion of an examination is suspended (as described in Q and A-13) unless the prior examination was actually concluded within 2 years of the notice of examination.
In determining whether the second church tax inquiry or examination involves the same or similar issues as the preceding inquiry or examination, the substantive factual issues involved in the two examinations, rather than legal classifications, will govern. For example, where a prior examination and a current examination of unrelated business income involve income from different sources, the current examination involves different issues than the prior examination and the approval of the Assistant Commissioner (Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations) is not necessary.

# Remedy for Violations of Section 7611
Q-17: What remedy is available for a violation of the church inquiry and examination procedures?
A-17: The exclusive remedy for any Internal Revenue Service violation of the church tax inquiry and examination procedures is as follows: Failure to comply substantially with the requirements that (1) two notices be sent to the church; (2) the Regional Commissioner approve the commencement of a church tax inquiry; or (3) an offer of a conference with the church be made (and a conference held if timely requested), will result in a stay of proceedings in a summons proceeding to gain access to church records (but not in dismissal of such proceeding), until these requirements are satisfied. The two-year limitation on duration of a church tax examination will not be suspended during stays of summons proceedings resulting from violations described above; however, violations may be corrected without regard to the otherwise applicable time limits prescribed under the procedures of section 7611. In determining whether a stay is necessary, a court must consider the good faith effort of the Internal Revenue Service and the effect of any violation of the proper examination procedures.
Section 7611(e)(2) provides that no suit may be maintained and no defense may be raised, other than a stay in a summons enforcement proceeding, by reason of any noncompliance with the requirements of section 7611. Thus, failure to comply with any of these requirements may not be raised as a defense or affirmative ground for relief in any judicial proceeding including, but not limited to, a summons proceeding to gain access to church records; a declaratory judgment proceeding involving a determination of tax-exempt status under section 7428; a proceeding to collect unpaid tax; or a deficiency or refund proceeding. Additionally, failure to substantially comply with the requirements that two notices be sent, that the Regional Commissioner approve an inquiry, and that a conference be offered (and the conference held if requested) may not be raised as a defense or as an affirmative ground for
relief in a summons proceeding or any other judicial proceeding other than as specifically set forth above. Therefore, a church or its representatives will not be able to litigate the issue of the reasonableness of the appropriate Regional Commissioner's belief in approving the commencement of a church tax inquiry (
i.e.,
that the church may not be tax-exempt or may be engaged in taxable activities) in a summons proceeding or any other judicial proceeding. The church retains the right to raise any substantive or procedural argument which would be available to taxpayers generally in an appropriate proceeding.

# Effective Date
Q-18: What is the effective date of the church examination procedures?
A-18: The procedures set forth in section 7611 apply to all tax inquiries and examinations beginning after December 31, 1984. The procedures of section 7605 will apply to any examination commenced before January 1, 1985. Any activities commenced after December 31, 1984, that would constitute a new inquiry or new examination must comply with the procedures of section 7611.

# Application to Section 4958
Q-19: When do the church tax inquiry and examination procedures described in section 7611 apply to a determination of whether there was an excess benefit transaction described in section 4958?
A-19: See § 53.4958-8(b) of this chapter for rules governing the interaction between section 4958 excise taxes on excess benefit transactions and section 7611 church tax inquiry and examination procedures.

[T.D. 7359, 40 FR 23743, June 2, 1975]
§ 301.7623-1
General rules, submitting information on underpayments of tax or violations of the internal revenue laws, and filing claims for award.
(a)
In general.
In cases in which awards are not otherwise provided for by law, the Whistleblower Office may pay an award under section 7623(a), in a suitable amount, for information necessary for detecting underpayments of tax or detecting and bringing to trial and punishment persons guilty of violating the internal revenue laws or conniving at the same. In cases that satisfy the requirements of section 7623(b)(5) and (b)(6) and in which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proceeds with an administrative or judicial action based on information provided by an individual, the Whistleblower Office must determine and pay an award under section 7623(b)(1), (2), or (3). The awards provided for by section 7623 and this paragraph must be paid from collected proceeds, as defined in § 301.7623-2(d).
(b)
Eligibility to file claim for award.
(1)
In general.
Any individual, other than an individual described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is eligible to file a claim for award and to receive an award under section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4.
(2)
Ineligible whistleblowers.
The Whistleblower Office will reject any claim for award filed by an ineligible whistleblower and will provide written notice of the rejection to the whistleblower. The following individuals are not eligible to file a claim for award or receive an award under section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4—
(i) An individual who is an employee of the Department of Treasury or was an employee of the Department of Treasury when the individual obtained the information on which the claim is based;
(ii) An individual who obtained the information through the individual's official duties as an employee of the Federal Government, or who is acting within the scope of those official duties as an employee of the Federal Government;
(iii) An individual who is or was required by Federal law or regulation to disclose the information or who is or was precluded by Federal law or regulation from disclosing the information;
(iv) An individual who obtained or had access to the information based on a contract with the Federal Government; or
(v) An individual who filed a claim for award based on information obtained from an ineligible whistleblower for the purpose of avoiding the rejection of the claim that would have resulted if the claim was filed by the ineligible whistleblower.
(c)
Submission of information and claims for award.
(1)
Submitting information.
To be eligible to receive an award under section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, a whistleblower must submit to the IRS specific and credible information that the whistleblower believes will lead to collected proceeds from one or more persons whom the whistleblower believes have failed to comply with the internal revenue laws. In general, a whistleblower's submission should identify the person(s) believed to have failed to comply with the internal revenue laws and should provide substantive information, including all available documentation, that supports the whistleblower's allegations. Information that identifies a pass-through entity will be considered to also identify all persons with a direct or indirect interest in the entity. Information that identifies a member of a firm who promoted another identified person's participation in a transaction described and documented in the information provided will be considered to also identify the firm and all other members of the firm. Submissions that provide speculative information or that do not provide specific and credible information regarding tax underpayments or violations of internal revenue laws do not provide a basis for an award. If documents or supporting evidence are known to the whistleblower but are not in the whistleblower's control, then the whistleblower should describe the documents or supporting evidence and identify their location to the best of the whistleblower's ability. If all available information known to the whistleblower is not provided to the IRS by the whistleblower, then the whistleblower bears the risk that this information might not be considered by the Whistleblower Office for purposes of an award.
(2)
Filing claim for award.
To claim an award under section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4 for information provided to the IRS, a whistleblower must file a formal claim for award by completing and sending Form 211, “Application for Award for Original Information,” to the Internal Revenue Service, Whistleblower Office, at the address provided on the form, or by complying with other claim filing procedures as may be prescribed by the IRS in other published guidance. The Form 211 should be completed in its entirety and should include the following information—
(i) The date of the claim;
(ii) The whistleblower's name;
(iii) The whistleblower's address and telephone number;
(iv) The whistleblower's date of birth;
(v) The whistleblower's taxpayer identification number; and
(vi) An explanation of how the information on which the claim is based came to the attention and into the possession of the whistleblower, including, as available, the date(s) on which the whistleblower acquired the information and a complete description of the
whistleblower's present or former relationship (if any) to person(s) identified on the Form 211.
(3)
Under penalty of perjury.
No award may be made under section 7623(b) unless the information on which the award is based is submitted to the IRS under penalty of perjury. All claims for award under section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4 must be accompanied by an original signed declaration under penalty of perjury, as follows: “I declare under penalty of perjury that I have examined this application, my accompanying statement, and supporting documentation and aver that such application is true, correct, and complete, to the best of my knowledge.” This requirement precludes the filing of a claim for award by a person serving as a representative of, or in any way on behalf of, another individual. Claims filed by more than one whistleblower (joint claims) must be signed by each individual whistleblower under penalty of perjury.
(4)
Perfecting claim for award.
If a whistleblower files a claim for award that does not include information described under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, does not contain specific and credible information as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or is based on information that was not submitted under penalty of perjury as required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Whistleblower Office may reject the claim or notify the whistleblower of the deficiencies and provide the whistleblower an opportunity to perfect the claim for award. If a whistleblower does not perfect the claim for award within the time period specified by the Whistleblower Office, then the Whistleblower Office may reject the claim. If the Whistleblower Office rejects a claim, then the Whistleblower Office will provide notice of the rejection to the whistleblower pursuant to the rules of § 301.7623-3(b)(3) or (c)(7). If the Whistleblower Office rejects a claim for the reasons described in this paragraph, then the whistleblower may perfect and resubmit the claim.
(d)
Request for assistance.
(1)
In general.
The Whistleblower Office, the IRS, or IRS Office of Chief Counsel may request the assistance of a whistleblower or the whistleblower's legal representative. Any assistance shall be at the direction and control of the Whistleblower Office, the IRS, or the IRS Office of Chief Counsel assigned to the matter. See § 301.6103(n)-2 for rules regarding written contracts among the IRS, whistleblowers, and legal representatives of whistleblowers.
(2)
No agency relationship.
Submitting information, filing a claim for award, or responding to a request for assistance does not create an agency relationship between a whistleblower and the Federal Government, nor does a whistleblower or the whistleblower's legal representative act in any way on behalf of the Federal Government.
(e)
Confidentiality of whistleblowers.
Under the informant's privilege, the IRS will use its best efforts to protect the identity of whistleblowers. In some circumstances, the IRS may need to reveal a whistleblower's identity, for example, when it is determined that it is in the best interests of the Government to use a whistleblower as a witness in a judicial proceeding. In those circumstances, the IRS will make every effort to notify the whistleblower before revealing the whistleblower's identity.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This rule is effective on August 12, 2014. This rule applies to information submitted on or after August 12, 2014, and to claims for award under sections 7623(a) and 7623(b) that are open as of August 12, 2014.
[T.D. 9687, 79 FR 47264, Aug. 12, 2014]
§ 301.7623-2
Definitions.
(a)
Action.
(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 7623(b) and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term
action
means an administrative or judicial action.
(2)
Administrative action.
For purposes of section 7623(b) and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term
administrative action
means all or a portion of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) civil or criminal proceeding against any person that may result in collected proceeds, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, including, for example, an examination, a collection proceeding, a status determination proceeding, or a criminal investigation.
(3)
Judicial action.
For purposes of section 7623(b) and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term
judicial action
means all or a portion of a proceeding against any person in any court that may result in collected proceeds, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Proceeds based on.
(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 7623(b) and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the IRS
proceeds based on
information provided by a whistleblower when the information provided substantially contributes to an action against a person identified by the whistleblower. For example, the IRS proceeds based on the information provided when the IRS initiates a new action, expands the scope of an ongoing action, or continues to pursue an ongoing action, that the IRS would not have initiated, expanded the scope of, or continued to pursue, but for the information provided. The IRS does not proceed based on information when the IRS analyzes the information provided or investigates a matter raised by the information provided.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and § 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer, describes and documents specific facts relating to the taxpayer's foreign sales in Country A, and, based on those facts, alleges that the taxpayer was not entitled to a foreign tax credit relating to its foreign sales in Country A. The IRS receives the information after having already initiated an examination of the taxpayer. The IRS's audit plan includes foreign tax credit issues but focuses on taxpayer's foreign sales in Country B and does not specifically address the taxpayer's foreign sales in Country A. Based on the information provided, the IRS expands the examination of the foreign tax credit issue to include consideration of the amount of foreign tax credit relating to the taxpayer's foreign sales in Country A. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the portion of the IRS's examination of the taxpayer relating to the foreign tax credit issue with respect to Country A is an administrative action with which the IRS proceeds based on the information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided substantially contributed to the action by causing the expansion of the IRS's examination.

# Example 2.
Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and § 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer, describes and documents specific facts relating to the taxpayer's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges that the taxpayer owed additional taxes in Year 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of the taxpayer for Year 1 based on the information provided by the whistleblower. The IRS discovers that the taxpayer engaged in the same activities in Year 2 and expands the examination to Year 2. In the course of the examination, the IRS obtains, through the issuance of Information Document Requests (IDRs) and summonses, additional facts that are unrelated to the activities described in the information provided by the whistleblower. Based on these additional facts, the IRS expands the scope of the examination of the taxpayer for both Year 1 and Year 2. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the portion of the IRS's examination relating to the activities described and documented in the information provided is an administrative action with which the IRS proceeds based on information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided substantially contributed to the action by causing the expansion of the IRS's examination of Year 1 and Year 2. The portions of the IRS's examination of the taxpayer in both Year 1 and Year 2 relating to the additional facts obtained through the issuance of IDRs and summonses are not actions with which the IRS proceeds based on the information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided did not substantially contribute to the action.

# Example 3.
Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and § 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer, describes and documents specific facts relating to the taxpayer's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges that the taxpayer owed additional taxes in Year 1. The IRS receives the information after having already initiated an examination of the taxpayer for Year 1. During the examination, the information is provided to the Exam team and the Exam team uses the information provided to confirm the correctness of adjustments made based on other information. Although the whistleblower's information confirms the correctness of the IRS's adjustments, the IRS does not rely on the whistleblower's information when it makes the adjustments, nor does the information cause the IRS to expand the scope of its examination. The whistleblower's information merely supports information independently obtained by the IRS. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the IRS's examination is not an administrative action with which the IRS proceeds based on information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided did not substantially contribute to the action.

# Example 4.
Same facts as
Example 3.
During the examination, however, the Exam team identifies inconsistencies between the information provided by the whistleblower and other information already in the Exam team's possession. The Exam team uses the information provided by the whistleblower to make additional adjustments that it would not have made based solely on the other information. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the portion of the IRS's examination relating to the additional adjustments is an administrative action with which the IRS proceeds based on information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided substantially contributed to the action.
(c)
Related action.
(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 7623(b) and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term
related action
means an action against a person other than the person(s) identified in the information provided and subject to the original action(s), when—
(i) The facts relating to the underpayment of tax or violations of the internal revenue laws by the other person are substantially the same as the facts described and documented in the information provided (with respect to the person(s) subject to the original action);
(ii) The IRS proceeds with the action against the other person based on the specific facts described and documented in the information provided; and
(iii) The other, unidentified person is related to the person identified in the information provided. For purposes of this paragraph, an unidentified person is related to the person identified in the information provided if the IRS can identify the unidentified person using the information provided (without first having to use the information provided to identify any other person or having to independently obtain additional information).
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and § 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer (Taxpayer 1), describes and documents specific facts relating to Taxpayer 1's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges tax underpayments by Taxpayer 1. The information provided also identifies an accountant (CPA 1) and describes and documents specific facts relating to CPA 1's contribution to the activities of Taxpayer 1 that the whistleblower alleges resulted in tax underpayments. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 1 based on the information provided by the whistleblower. Using the information provided, the IRS obtains CPA 1's client list and identifies two taxpayer/clients of CPA 1 (Taxpayer 2 and Taxpayer 3) that appear to have engaged in activities similar to Taxpayer 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 2 and finds that Taxpayer 2 engaged in the same activities as those described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 3 and finds that Taxpayer 3 engaged in different activities from those described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the examination of Taxpayer 2 is a related action because it satisfies the conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The examination of Taxpayer 3 is not a related action because the relevant facts are not substantially the same as the facts relevant to the examination of Taxpayer 1.

# Example 2.
Same facts as
Example 1.
Using the information provided by the whistleblower, the IRS identifies a co-promoter of CPA 1 (CPA 2) that appears to have engaged in activities similar to CPA 1. CPA 2 is not a member of CPA 1's firm. The IRS subsequently obtains the client list of CPA 2 and identifies a taxpayer/client of CPA 2 (Taxpayer 4) that appears to have engaged in activities similar to Taxpayer 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 4 and finds that Taxpayer 4 engaged in the same activities as those described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1, and that CPA 2 contributed to the activities in the same way as described in the information provided with respect to CPA 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of CPA 2's liability for promoter penalties under section 6700 in connection with the activities described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1 and CPA 1. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the examination of CPA 2 is a related action because it satisfies the conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The examination of Taxpayer 4 is not a related action because Taxpayer 4 was not related to a person identified in the information provided. CPA 2 was not identified in the information provided and the IRS first had to identify CPA 2 before identifying Taxpayer 4 and proceeding with the examination of Taxpayer 4.

# Example 3.
Same facts as
Example 1.
An accountant (CPA 3) is a member of CPA 1's firm. Using the information provided by the whistleblower, the IRS obtains the client list of CPA 3 and identifies a taxpayer/client of
CPA 3 (Taxpayer 5) that appears to have engaged in activities similar to Taxpayer 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 5 and finds that Taxpayer 5 engaged in the same activities as those described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1, and that CPA 3 contributed to the activities in the same way as described in the information provided with respect to CPA 1. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the examination of Taxpayer 5 is a related action because Taxpayer 5 is related to CPA 3, a person considered to be identified in the information provided under § 301.7623-1(c)(1), and the facts relating to Taxpayer 5 are substantially the same as the facts described and documented in the information provided. An IRS examination of CPA 3's liability for promoter penalties under section 6700, based on the facts described and documented in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1 and CPA 1, is an administrative action based on the information provided.

# Example 4.
Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and § 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer (Taxpayer 1), describes and documents specific facts relating to Taxpayer 1's activities, and, in particular, Taxpayer 1's participation in a transaction. Based on those facts, the whistleblower alleges that Taxpayer 1 owed additional taxes. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 1 based on the information provided by the whistleblower. The IRS identifies the other parties to the transaction described in the information provided (Taxpayer 2 and Taxpayer 3). The IRS proceeds with examinations of Taxpayer 2 and Taxpayer 3 relating to their participation in the transaction described in the information provided. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the IRS's examinations of Taxpayer 2 and Taxpayer 3 relating to the activities described and documented in the information provided are related actions because they satisfy the conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Collected proceeds.
(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the terms
proceeds of amounts collected
and
collected proceeds
(collectively,
collected proceeds
) include: Tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts collected because of the information provided; amounts collected prior to receipt of the information if the information provided results in the denial of a claim for refund that otherwise would have been paid; and a reduction of an overpayment credit balance used to satisfy a tax liability incurred because of the information provided. Collected proceeds are limited to amounts collected under the provisions of title 26, United States Code.
(2)
Refund netting.
(i)
In general.
If any portion of a claim for refund that is substantively unrelated to the information provided is—
(A) Allowed, and
(B) Used to satisfy a tax liability attributable to the information provided instead of refunded to the taxpayer, then the allowed but non-refunded amount constitutes collected proceeds.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and § 301.7623-1, identifies a corporate taxpayer (Corporation), describes and documents specific facts relating to Corporation's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges that Corporation owed additional taxes. Based on the information provided by the whistleblower, the IRS proceeds with an examination of Corporation and determines adjustments that would result in an unpaid tax liability of $500,000. During the examination, Corporation informally claims a refund of $400,000 based on adjustments to items of income and expense that are wholly unrelated to the information provided by the whistleblower. The IRS agrees to the unrelated adjustments. The IRS nets the adjustments and determines a tax deficiency of $100,000. Thereafter, Corporation makes full payment of the $100,000 deficiency. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the collected proceeds include the $400,000 informally claimed as a refund and netted against the adjustments attributable to the information provided, as well as the $100,000 paid by Corporation.
(3)
Amended returns.
Amounts collected based on amended returns constitute collected proceeds if—
(i) The IRS proceeds based on the information provided;
(ii) As a result, the person subject to the action(s) with which the IRS proceeds files amended returns; and
(iii) The amounts collected based on the amended returns relate to the activities or facts described in the information provided.
(4)
Criminal fines.
Criminal fines deposited into the Crime Victims Fund are not collected proceeds and cannot be used for payment of awards.
(5)
Computation of collected proceeds.
(i)
In general.
Pursuant to § 301.7623-
4(d)(1), the IRS cannot make an award payment until there has been a final determination of tax. For purposes of determining the amount of an award under section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, after there has been a final determination of tax as defined in § 301.7623-4(d)(2), the IRS will compute the amount of collected proceeds based on all information known with respect to the taxpayer's account, including with respect to all tax attributes, as of the date the computation is made.
(ii)
Post-determination proceeds.
If, based on all information known with respect to the taxpayer's account as of the date of the computation described in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, there is a possibility that the IRS may collect additional proceeds, then the Whistleblower Office will continue to monitor the case. If the Whistleblower Office identifies additional collected proceeds, then the IRS will compute and pay accordingly.
(iii)
Partial collection.
If the IRS does not collect the full amount of taxes, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts assessed against the taxpayer, then any amounts that the IRS does collect will constitute collected proceeds in the same proportion that the adjustments attributable to the information provided bear to the total adjustments.
(e)
Amount in dispute and gross income.
(1)
In general.
Section 7623(b) applies with respect to any action against any taxpayer in which the tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts in dispute exceed $2,000,000 but, if the taxpayer is an individual, then only if the taxpayer's gross income exceeds $200,000 in at least one taxable year subject to the action.
(2)
Amount in dispute.
(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 7623(b)(5) and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term
amount in dispute
means the greater of the maximum total of tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts that resulted from the action(s) with which the IRS proceeded based on the information provided, or the maximum total of such amounts that were stated in formal positions taken by the IRS in the action(s). The IRS will compute the amount in dispute, for purposes of award determinations described in § 301.7623-3(c)(6), when there has been a final determination of tax as defined in § 301.7623-4(d)(2).
(ii)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and § 301.7623-1, identifies a corporate taxpayer, describes and documents specific facts relating to the taxpayer's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges that the taxpayer owed additional taxes. The IRS proceeds with an examination of the taxpayer based on the information provided by the whistleblower; makes adjustments to items of income and expense and allows certain credits; and, ultimately, determines a deficiency against the taxpayer of $1,900,000 and issues the taxpayer a statutory notice of deficiency. The taxpayer petitions the notice to the United States Tax Court. The Tax Court sustains the IRS's position resulting in a deficiency of $1,900,000. Following the final determination of tax, the IRS computes that the total of tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts that resulted from the action was $2,500,000. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the amount in dispute is $2,500,000.

# Example 2.
Same facts as
Example 1,
except the IRS determines a deficiency of $1,500,000; the Tax Court sustains the deficiency of $1,500,000; and, following the final determination of tax, the IRS computes that the total of tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts that resulted from the action was $1,750,000. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the amount in dispute is $1,750,000.

# Example 3.
Same facts as
Example 1,
except the IRS determines a deficiency of $2,100,000; the Tax Court redetermines a deficiency of $1,500,000; and, following the final determination of tax, the IRS computes that the total of tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts that resulted from the action was $1,750,000. For purposes of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the amount in dispute is $2,100,000.
(3)
Gross income.
For purposes of section 7623(b)(5) and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term
gross income
has the same meaning as provided under section 61(a). The IRS will compute the individual taxpayer's gross income, for purposes of award determinations described in § 301.7623-3(c)(6), when there has been a final determination of tax as defined in § 301.7623-4(d)(2).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This rule is effective on August 12, 2014. This rule applies to information submitted on or after August 12, 2014, and to claims for award under sections 7623(a) and 7623(b) that are open as of August 12, 2014.

§ 301.7623-3
Whistleblower administrative proceedings and appeals of award determinations.
(a)
In general.
The Whistleblower Office will pay awards under section 7623(a) and determine and pay awards under section 7623(b) in whistleblower administrative proceedings pursuant to the rules of this section. The whistleblower administrative proceedings described in this section are administrative proceedings pertaining to tax administration for purposes of section 6103(h)(4). See § 301.6103(h)(4)-1 for additional rules regarding disclosures of return information in whistleblower administrative proceedings. The Whistleblower Office may determine awards for claims involving multiple actions in a single whistleblower administrative proceeding. For purposes of the whistleblower administrative proceedings for rejections and denials, described in paragraphs (b)(3), (c)(7), and (c)(8) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may rely on the whistleblower's description of the amount owed by the taxpayer(s). The IRS may, however, rely on other information as necessary (for example, when the alleged amount in dispute is below the $2 million threshold of section 7623(b)(5)(B), but the actual amount in dispute is above the threshold).
(b)
Awards under section 7623(a).
(1)
Preliminary award recommendation.
In cases in which the Whistleblower Office recommends payment of an award under section 7623(a), the Whistleblower Office will communicate a preliminary award recommendation under section 7623(a) and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4 to the whistleblower by sending a preliminary award recommendation letter that states the Whistleblower Office's preliminary computation of the amount of collected proceeds, recommended award percentage, recommended award amount (even in cases when the application of § 301.7623-4 results in a reduction of the recommended award amount to zero), and a list of the factors that contributed to the recommended award percentage. The whistleblower administrative proceeding described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section begins on the date the Whistleblower Office sends the preliminary award recommendation letter. If the whistleblower believes that the Whistleblower Office erred in evaluating the information provided, the whistleblower has 30 days from the date the Whistleblower Office sends the preliminary award recommendation to submit comments to the Whistleblower Office (this period may be extended at the sole discretion of the Whistleblower Office). The Whistleblower Office will review all comments submitted timely by the whistleblower (or the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) and pay an award, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2)
Decision letter.
At the conclusion of the process described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and when there is a final determination of tax, as defined in § 301.7623-4(d)(2), the Whistleblower Office will pay an award under section 7623(a) and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4. The Whistleblower Office will communicate the amount of the award to the whistleblower in a decision letter.
(3)
Rejections and denials.
If the Whistleblower Office rejects a claim for award under section 7623(a), pursuant to § 301.7623-1(b) or (c), or if the IRS either did not proceed based on information provided by the whistleblower, as defined in § 301.7623-2(b), or did not collect proceeds, as defined in § 301.7623-2(d), then the Whistleblower Office will not apply the rules of paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section. The Whistleblower Office will provide written notice to the whistleblower of the rejection or denial of any award and, in the case of a rejection, the written notice will state the basis for the rejection.
(c)
Awards under section 7623(b).
(1)
Preliminary award recommendation.
For claims under section 7623(b) other than those described in paragraphs (c)(7) and (c)(8) of this section (rejections and denials), the Whistleblower Office will
prepare a preliminary award recommendation based on the Whistleblower Office's review of the administrative claim file and the application of the rules of section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4 to the facts of the case. See paragraph (e)(2) of this section for a description of the administrative claim file. The whistleblower administrative proceeding described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section begins on the date the Whistleblower Office sends the preliminary award recommendation letter. The preliminary award recommendation is not a determination letter within the meaning of paragraph (c)(6) of this section and cannot be appealed to Tax Court under section 7623(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section. The preliminary award recommendation will notify the whistleblower that the IRS cannot determine or pay any award until there is a final determination of tax, as defined in § 301.7623-4(d)(2).
(2)
Contents of preliminary award recommendation.
The Whistleblower Office will communicate the preliminary award recommendation under section 7623(b) to the whistleblower by sending—
(i) A preliminary award recommendation letter that describes the whistleblower's options for responding to the preliminary award recommendation;
(ii) A summary report that states a preliminary computation of the amount of collected proceeds, the recommended award percentage, the recommended award amount (even in cases when the application of section 7623(b)(2) or section 7623(b)(3) results in a reduction of the recommended award amount to zero), and a list of the factors that contributed to the recommended award percentage;
(iii) An award consent form; and
(iv) A confidentiality agreement.
(3)
Opportunity to respond to preliminary award recommendation.
The whistleblower will have 30 days (this period may be extended at the sole discretion of the Whistleblower Office) from the date the Whistleblower Office sends the preliminary award recommendation letter to respond to the preliminary award recommendation in one of the following ways—
(i) If the whistleblower takes no action, then the Whistleblower Office will make an award determination, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section;
(ii) If the whistleblower signs, dates, and returns the award consent form agreeing to the preliminary award recommendation and waiving any and all administrative and judicial appeal rights, then the Whistleblower Office will make an award determination, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section;
(iii) If the whistleblower signs, dates, and returns the confidentiality agreement, then the Whistleblower Office will provide the whistleblower with a detailed award report, and an opportunity to review documents supporting the report pursuant to paragraphs (c)(4) and (5) of this section, and any comments submitted by the whistleblower will be added to the administrative claim file; or
(iv) If the whistleblower submits comments on the preliminary award recommendation to the Whistleblower Office, but does not sign, date, and return the confidentiality agreement, then the comments will be added to the administrative claim file and reviewed by the Whistleblower Office in making an award determination, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
(4)
Detailed report.
(i)
Contents of detailed report.
If the whistleblower signs, dates, and returns the confidentiality agreement accompanying the preliminary award recommendation under section 7623(b), pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, then the Whistleblower Office will send the whistleblower—
(A) A detailed report that states a preliminary computation of the amount of collected proceeds, the recommended award percentage, and the recommended award amount, and provides a full explanation of the factors that contributed to the recommended award percentage;
(B) Instructions for scheduling an appointment for the whistleblower (and the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) to review information in the administrative claim file that is not protected by one or more common law or statutory privileges; and
(C) An award consent form.
(ii)
Opportunity to respond to detailed report.
The whistleblower will have 30 days (this period may be extended at the sole discretion of the Whistleblower Office) from the date the Whistleblower Office sends the detailed report to respond in one of the following ways—
(A) If the whistleblower takes no action, then the Whistleblower Office will make an award determination, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section;
(B) If the whistleblower requests an appointment to review information from the administrative claim file that is not protected from disclosure by one or more common law or statutory privileges, then a meeting will be arranged pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section;
(C) If the whistleblower does not request an appointment but does submit comments on the detailed report to the Whistleblower Office, then the comments will be added to the administrative claim file and reviewed by the Whistleblower Office in making an award determination pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section; or
(D) If the whistleblower signs, dates, and returns the award consent form agreeing to the preliminary award recommendation and waiving any and all administrative and judicial appeal rights, then the Whistleblower Office will make an award determination, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
(iii)
Additional rules.
The detailed report is not a determination letter within the meaning of paragraph (c)(6) of this section and cannot be appealed to Tax Court under section 7623(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section. The detailed report will notify the whistleblower that the IRS cannot determine or pay any award until there is a final determination of tax, as defined in § 301.7623-4(d)(2).
(5)
Opportunity to review documents supporting award report recommendations.
Appointments for the whistleblower (and the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) to review information from the administrative claim file that is not protected from disclosure by one or more common law or statutory privileges will be held at the Whistleblower Office in Washington, DC, unless the Whistleblower Office, in its sole discretion, decides to hold the meeting at another location. At the appointment, the Whistleblower Office will provide for viewing the information from the administrative claim file. The Whistleblower Office will supervise the whistleblower's review of the information and the whistleblower will not be permitted to make copies of any documents or other information. The whistleblower will have 30 days (this period may be extended at the sole discretion of the Whistleblower Office) from the date of the appointment to submit comments on the detailed report and the documents reviewed at the appointment to the Whistleblower Office. All comments will be added to the administrative claim file and reviewed by the Whistleblower Office in making an award determination, pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
(6)
Determination letter.
After the whistleblower's participation in the whistleblower administrative proceeding, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, has concluded, and there is a final determination of tax, as defined in § 301.7623-4(d)(2), a Whistleblower Office official will determine the amount of the award under section 7623(b)(1), (2), or (3), and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, based on the official's review of the administrative claim file. The Whistleblower Office will communicate the award to the whistleblower in a determination letter, stating the amount of the award. If, however, the whistleblower has executed an award consent form agreeing to the amount of the award and waiving the whistleblower's right to appeal the award determination, pursuant to section 7623(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section, then the Whistleblower Office will not send the whistleblower a determination letter and will make payment of the award as promptly as circumstances permit.
(7)
Rejections.
A rejection is a determination that relates solely to the whistleblower and the information on the face of the claim that pertains to the whistleblower. If the Whistleblower Office rejects a claim for award under section 7623(b), pursuant to § 301.7623-
1(b) or (c), then the Whistleblower Office will not apply the rules of paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section. The Whistleblower Office will send to the whistleblower a preliminary rejection letter that states the basis for the rejection of the claim. The whistleblower administrative proceeding described in this paragraph begins on the date the Whistleblower Office sends the preliminary rejection letter. If the whistleblower believes that the Whistleblower Office erred in evaluating the information provided, the whistleblower has 30 days from the date the Whistleblower Office sends the preliminary rejection letter to submit comments to the Whistleblower Office (this period may be extended at the sole discretion of the Whistleblower Office). The Whistleblower Office will review all comments submitted timely by the whistleblower (or the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) and, following that review, the Whistleblower Office will either provide written notice to the whistleblower of the rejection of the claim, including the basis for the rejection, or apply the rules of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section.
(8)
Denials.
A denial is a determination that relates to or implicates taxpayer information. If, with respect to a claim for award under section 7623(b), the IRS either did not proceed based on the information provided by the whistleblower, as defined in § 301.7623-2(b), or did not collect proceeds, as defined in § 301.7623-2(d), then the Whistleblower Office will not apply the rules of paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section. The Whistleblower Office will send to the whistleblower a preliminary denial letter that states the basis for the denial of the claim. The whistleblower administrative proceeding described in this paragraph begins on the date the Whistleblower Office sends the preliminary denial letter. If the whistleblower believes that the Whistleblower Office erred in evaluating the information provided, the whistleblower has 30 days from the date the Whistleblower Office sends the preliminary denial letter to submit comments to the Whistleblower Office (this period may be extended at the sole discretion of the Whistleblower Office). The Whistleblower Office will review all comments submitted timely by the whistleblower (or the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) and, following that review, the Whistleblower Office will either provide written notice to the whistleblower of the denial of any award, including the basis for the denial, or apply the rules of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section.
(d)
Appeal of award determination.
Any determination regarding an award under section 7623(b)(1), (2), or (3) may, within 30 days of such determination, be appealed to the Tax Court.
(e)
Administrative record.
(1)
In general.
The administrative record comprises all information contained in the administrative claim file that is relevant to the award determination and not protected by one or more common law or statutory privileges.
(2)
Administrative claim file.
The administrative claim file will include the following materials relating to the action(s) to which the determination relates—
(i) The Form 211, “Application for Award for Original Information,” filed by the whistleblower and all information provided by the whistleblower (whether provided with the whistleblower's original submission or through a subsequent contact with the IRS).
(ii) Copies of all debriefing notes and recorded interviews held with the whistleblower (and the whistleblower's legal representative, if any).
(iii) Form(s) 11369, “Confidential Evaluation Report on Claim for Award,” including narratives prepared by the relevant IRS office(s), explaining the whistleblower's contributions to the actions and documenting the actions taken by the IRS in the case(s). The Form 11369 will refer to and incorporate additional documents relating to the issues raised by the claim, as appropriate, including, for example, relevant portions of revenue agent reports, copies of agreements entered into with the taxpayer(s), tax returns, and activity records.
(iv) Copies of all contracts entered into among the IRS, the whistleblower, and the whistleblower's legal representative (if any), and an explanation of the cooperation provided by the
whistleblower (or the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) under the contract.
(v) Any information that reflects actions by the whistleblower that may have had a negative impact on the IRS's ability to examine the taxpayer(s).
(vi) All correspondence and documents sent by the Whistleblower Office to the whistleblower.
(vii) All notes, memoranda, and other documents made by officers and employees of the Whistleblower Office and considered by the official making the award determination.
(viii) All correspondence and documents received by the Whistleblower Office from the whistleblower (and the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) in the course of the whistleblower administrative proceeding.
(ix) All other information considered by the official making the award determination.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This rule is effective on August 12, 2014. This rule applies to information submitted on or after August 12, 2014, and to claims for award under sections 7623(a) and 7623(b) that are open as of August 12, 2014.
[T.D. 9687, 79 FR 47268, Aug. 12, 2014]
§ 301.7623-4
Amount and payment of award.
(a)
In general.
The Whistleblower Office will pay all awards under section 7623(a) and determine and pay all awards under section 7623(b). For all awards under section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the Whistleblower Office will—
(1) Analyze the claim by applying the rules provided in paragraph (c) of this section to the information contained in the administrative claim file to determine an award percentage; and
(2) Multiply the award percentage by the amount of collected proceeds. If the award determination arises out of a single whistleblower administrative proceeding involving multiple actions, the Whistleblower Office may determine separate award percentages on an action-by-action basis and apply the separate award percentages to the collected proceeds attributable to the corresponding actions. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will pay all awards in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph (d) of this section. All relevant factors will be taken into account by the Whistleblower Office in determining whether an award will be paid and, if so, the amount of the award. No person is authorized under this section to make any offer or promise or otherwise bind the Whistleblower Office with respect to the amount or payment of an award.
(b)
Factors used to determine award percentage.
(1)
Positive factors.
The application of the following non-exclusive factors may support increasing an award percentage under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section—
(i) The whistleblower acted promptly to inform the IRS or the taxpayer of the tax noncompliance.
(ii) The information provided identified an issue or transaction of a type previously unknown to the IRS.
(iii) The information provided identified taxpayer behavior that the IRS was unlikely to identify or that was particularly difficult to detect through the IRS's exercise of reasonable diligence.
(iv) The information provided thoroughly presented the factual details of tax noncompliance in a clear and organized manner, particularly if the manner of the presentation saved the IRS work and resources.
(v) The whistleblower (or the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) provided exceptional cooperation and assistance during the pendency of the action(s).
(vi) The information provided identified assets of the taxpayer that could be used to pay liabilities, particularly if the assets were not otherwise known to the IRS.
(vii) The information provided identified connections between transactions, or parties to transactions, that enabled the IRS to understand tax implications that might not otherwise have been understood by the IRS.
(viii) The information provided had an impact on the behavior of the taxpayer, for example by causing the taxpayer to promptly correct a previously-reported improper position.
(2)
Negative factors.
The application of the following non-exclusive factors
may support decreasing an award percentage under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section—
(i) The whistleblower delayed informing the IRS after learning the relevant facts, particularly if the delay adversely affected the IRS's ability to pursue an action or issue.
(ii) The whistleblower contributed to the underpayment of tax or tax noncompliance identified.
(iii) The whistleblower directly or indirectly profited from the underpayment of tax or tax noncompliance identified, but did not plan and initiate the actions that led to the underpayment of tax or actions described in section 7623(a)(2) .
(iv) The whistleblower (or the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) negatively affected the IRS's ability to pursue the action(s), for example by disclosing the existence or scope of an enforcement activity.
(v) The whistleblower (or the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) violated instructions provided by the IRS, particularly if the violation caused the IRS to expend additional resources.
(vi) The whistleblower (or the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) violated the terms of the confidentiality agreement described in § 301.7623-3(c)(2)(iv).
(vii) The whistleblower (or the whistleblower's legal representative, if any) violated the terms of a contract entered into with the IRS pursuant to § 301.6103(n)-2.
(viii) The whistleblower provided false or misleading information or otherwise violated the requirements of section 7623(b)(6)(C) or § 301.7623-1(c)(3).
(c)
Amount of award percentage.
(1)
Award for substantial contribution.
(i)
In general.
If the IRS proceeds with any administrative or judicial action based on information brought to the IRS's attention by a whistleblower, such whistleblower shall, subject to paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, receive as an award at least 15 percent but not more than 30 percent of the collected proceeds resulting from the action (including any related actions) or from any settlement in response to such action. The amount of any award under this paragraph depends on the extent of the whistleblower's substantial contribution to the action(s). See paragraph (c)(4) of this section for rules regarding multiple whistleblowers.
(ii)
Computational framework.
Starting the analysis at 15 percent, the Whistleblower Office will analyze the administrative claim file using the factors listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine whether the whistleblower merits an increased award percentage of 22 percent or 30 percent. The Whistleblower Office may increase the award percentage based on the presence and significance of positive factors. The Whistleblower Office will then analyze the contents of the administrative claim file using the factors listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to determine whether the whistleblower merits a decreased award percentage of 15 percent, 18 percent, 22 percent, or 26 percent. The Whistleblower Office may decrease the award percentage based on the presence and significance of negative factors. Although the factors listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are described as positive and negative factors, the Whistleblower Office's analysis cannot be reduced to a mathematical equation. The factors are not exclusive and are not weighted and, in a particular case, one factor may override several others. The presence and significance of positive factors may offset the presence and significance of negative factors. But the absence of negative factors does not constitute a positive factor.
(iii)
Examples.
The operation of the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. The examples are intended to illustrate the operation of the computational framework. The examples provide simplified descriptions of the facts relating to the claims for award, the information provided, and the facts relating to the underlying tax cases. The application of section 7623(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section will depend on the specific facts of each case.

# Example 1.
Facts. Whistleblower A, an employee in Corporation's sales department, submitted to the IRS a claim for award under section 7623 and information indicating that Corporation improperly claimed
a credit in tax year 2006. Whistleblower A's information consisted of numerous non-privileged documents relevant to Corporation's eligibility for the credit. Whistleblower A's original submission also included an analysis of the documents, as well as information about meetings in which the claim for credit was discussed. When interviewed by the IRS, Whistleblower A clarified ambiguities in the original submission, answered questions about Corporation's business and accounting practices, and identified potential sources to corroborate the information.
Some of the documents provided by Whistleblower A were not included in Corporation's general record-keeping system and their existence may not have been easily uncovered through normal IRS examination procedures. Corporation initially denied the facts revealed in the information provided by Whistleblower A, which were essential to establishing the impropriety of the claim for credit. IRS examination of Corporation's return confirmed that the credit was improperly claimed by Corporation in tax year 2006, as alleged by Whistleblower A. Corporation agreed to the ensuing assessments of tax and interest and paid the liabilities in full.
Analysis. In this case, Whistleblower A provided specific and credible information that formed the basis for action by the IRS. Whistleblower A provided information that was difficult to detect, provided useful assistance to the IRS, and helped the IRS sustain the assessment. Based on the presence and significance of these positive factors, viewed against all the specific facts relevant to Corporation's 2006 tax year, the Whistleblower Office could increase the award percentage to 22 percent of collected proceeds. If, however, Whistleblower A's claim reflected negative factors, for example Whistleblower A violated instructions provided by the IRS and the violation caused the IRS to expend additional resources, then the Whistleblower Office could, based on this negative factor, reduce the award percentage to 18 or 15 percent (but not to lower than 15 percent of collected proceeds).

# Example 2.
Facts. Whistleblower B, an employee of Financial Advisory Firm 1 (Firm 1), submitted to the IRS a claim for award under section 7623 and information indicating that Firm 1 helped clients engage in activities that were intended to, and did, result in substantial tax underpayments. The activities were designed to avoid detection by the IRS, and prior IRS audits of several clients of Firm 1 had failed to detect underpayments of tax. Whistleblower B learned of the activities after being reassigned to a new position with Firm 1. Whistleblower B provided the information to the IRS soon after he understood the scope, nature and impact of the activities. The information provided consisted of numerous documents containing client profiles and marketing strategies, as well as descriptions of the transactions and structures used by Firm 1 and its clients to obscure the clients' identities and to generate the substantial tax underpayments. Whistleblower B also provided an analysis of the documents, as well as information about meetings in which the transactions and structures were discussed. When interviewed by the IRS, Whistleblower B clarified ambiguities in the original submission, answered questions about Firm 1's execution of specific client transactions, and identified potential sources to corroborate the information provided. Whistleblower B also notified the IRS of steps taken by Firm 1 to limit the disclosure of information requested by the IRS, enabling the IRS to obtain full disclosure of the information through the targeted use of summonses.
Analysis. Ultimately, the IRS collected tax, penalties, and interest from Firm 1 and multiple clients. In addition, Treasury and the IRS issued a notice identifying the impropriety of the transactions and structures employed by Firm 1 and its clients. Whistleblower B provided specific and credible information that formed the basis for action by the IRS. The information provided identified transactions that were difficult to detect. Whistleblower B acted promptly after he understood the activities at issue and he provided useful assistance to the IRS. Whistleblower B's assistance, and the information he provided, helped the IRS overcome the efforts made to obscure the activities and the clients' identities. And the information provided by Whistleblower B contributed to the decision to issue the notice, which may have a positive effect on client behavior and save IRS resources. Based on the presence and significance of these positive factors, the Whistleblower Office could increase the award percentage to 30 percent of collected proceeds. If Whistleblower B directly or indirectly profited from Firm 1's and the clients' activities resulting in the tax underpayments, then the Whistleblower Office could, based on this negative factor, reduce the award percentage to 26, 22, 18 percent or 15 percent (but not to lower than 15 percent of collected proceeds).
(2)
Award for less substantial contribution.
(i)
In general.
If the Whistleblower Office determines that the action described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is based principally on disclosures of specific allegations resulting from a judicial or administrative hearing; a government report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or the news media, then the Whistleblower Office will determine an award of no more than 10 percent of the collected proceeds resulting from the action (including any related
actions) or from any settlement in response to such action. If the whistleblower is the original source of the information from which the disclosures of specific allegations resulted, however, then the award percentage will be determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Computational framework.
The Whistleblower Office will analyze the administrative claim file to determine—
(A) Whether the claim involves specific allegations regarding a tax underpayment or a violation of the internal revenue laws that reasonably may be inferred to have resulted from a judicial or administrative hearing; a government report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or the news media;
(B) Whether the action described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section was based principally on the disclosure of the specific allegations; and
(C) Whether the whistleblower was the original source of the information that gave rise to the specific allegations. If the Whistleblower Office determines that the action was based principally on disclosures of specific allegations, as stated in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, and that the whistleblower was not the original source of the information, then, starting at 1 percent, the Whistleblower Office will analyze the administrative claim file using the factors listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine whether the whistleblower merits an increased award percentage of 4 percent, 7 percent, or 10 percent. The Whistleblower Office will then determine whether the whistleblower merits a decreased award percentage of zero, 1 percent, 4 percent, or 7 percent using the factors listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The Whistleblower Office may increase the award percentage based on the presence and significance of positive factors and may decrease (to zero) the award percentage based on the presence and significance of negative factors. Like the analysis described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the Whistleblower Office's analysis cannot be reduced to a mathematical equation. The factors are not exclusive and are not weighted and, in a particular case, one factor may override several others. The presence and significance of positive factors may offset the presence and significance of negative factors. But the absence of negative factors does not constitute a positive factor.
(iii)
Example.
The operation of the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example. The example is intended to illustrate the operation of the computational framework. The example provides a simplified description of the facts relating to the claim for award, the information provided, and the facts relating to the underlying tax case(s). The application of section 7623(b)(2) and paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section will depend on the specific facts of each case.

# Example.
Facts. Whistleblower A submitted to the IRS a claim for award under section 7623 and information indicating that Taxpayer B was the defendant in a criminal prosecution for embezzlement. Whistleblower A's information further indicated that evidence presented at Taxpayer B's trial revealed Taxpayer B's efforts to conceal the embezzled funds by depositing them in bank accounts of entities controlled by Taxpayer B. Taxpayer B's failure to pay tax on the embezzled funds was not explicitly stated during the judicial hearing, but could be reasonably inferred from the facts and circumstances, including Taxpayer B's efforts to conceal the funds.
Analysis. In this case, Whistleblower A's information is based principally on disclosures of specific allegations resulting from a judicial hearing. Absent information demonstrating that the investigation leading to the embezzlement charge was based on information provided by Whistleblower A, section 7623(b)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply to the determination of Whistleblower A's award. In this case, there is no reason for the Whistleblower Office to increase the applicable award percentage above 1 percent, the starting point for its analysis, given the absence of positive factors. Accordingly, Whistleblower A may receive an award of 1 percent of collected proceeds.
(3)
Reduction in award and denial of award.
(i)
In general.
If the Whistleblower Office determines that a claim for award is brought by a whistleblower who planned and initiated the actions, transaction, or events (underlying acts) that led to the underpayment of tax or actions described in section 7623(a)(2), then the Whistleblower Office may appropriately reduce
the amount of the award percentage that would otherwise result under section 7623(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section or section 7623(b)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as applicable. The Whistleblower Office will deny an award if the whistleblower is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in planning and initiating the underlying acts.
(ii)
Threshold determination.
A whistleblower
planned and initiated
the underlying acts if the whistleblower—
(A) Designed, structured, drafted, arranged, formed the plan leading to, or otherwise planned, an underlying act,
(B) Took steps to start, introduce, originate, set into motion, promote or otherwise initiate an underlying act, and
(C) Knew or had reason to know that an underpayment of tax or actions described in section 7623(a)(2) could result from planning and initiating the underlying act.
(D) The whistleblower need not have been the sole person involved in planning and initiating the underlying acts. A whistleblower who merely furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance in implementing one or more underlying acts will not be treated as initiating any underlying act. A whistleblower who is a junior employee acting at the direction, and under the control, of a senior employee will not be treated as initiating any underlying act.
(E) If the Whistleblower Office determines that a whistleblower has satisfied this initial threshold of planning and initiating, the Whistleblower Office will then reduce the award amount based on the extent of the whistleblower's planning and initiating, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Computational framework.
After determining the award percentage that would otherwise result from the application of section 7623(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section or section 7623(b)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as applicable, the Whistleblower Office will analyze the administrative claim file to make the threshold determination described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. If the whistleblower is determined to have planned and initiated the underlying acts, then the Whistleblower Office will reduce the award based on the extent of the whistleblower's planning and initiating. The Whistleblower Office's analysis and the amount of the appropriate reduction determined in a particular case cannot be reduced to a mathematical equation. To determine the appropriate award reduction, the Whistleblower Office will—
(A) Categorize the whistleblower's role as a planner and initiator as primary, significant, or moderate; and
(B) Appropriately reduce the award percentage that would otherwise result from the application of section 7623(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section or section 7623(b)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as applicable, by 67 percent to 100 percent in the case of a primary planner and initiator, by 34 percent to 66 percent in the case of a significant planner and initiator, or by 0 percent to 33 percent in the case of a moderate planner and initiator. If the whistleblower is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in planning and initiating the underlying acts, then the Whistleblower Office will deny an award without regard to whether the Whistleblower Office categorized the whistleblower's role as a planner and initiator as primary, significant, or moderate.
(iv)
Factors demonstrating the extent of a whistleblower's planning and initiating.
The application of the following non-exclusive factors may support a determination of the extent of a whistleblower's planning and initiating of the underlying acts—
(A) The whistleblower's role as a planner and initiator. Was the whistleblower the sole decision-maker or one of several contributing planners and initiators? To what extent was the whistleblower acting under the direction and control of a supervisor?
(B) The nature of the whistleblower's planning and initiating activities. Was the whistleblower involved in legitimate tax planning activities? Did the whistleblower take steps to hide the actions at the planning stage? Did the whistleblower commit any identifiable misconduct (legal, ethical, etc.)?
(C) The extent to which the whistleblower knew or should have known
that tax noncompliance could result from the course of conduct.
(D) The extent to which the whistleblower acted in furtherance of the noncompliance, including, for example, efforts to conceal or disguise the transaction.
(E) The whistleblower's role in identifying and soliciting others to participate in the actions reported, whether as parties to a common transaction or as parties to separate transactions.
(v)
Examples.
The operation of the provisions of paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. These examples are intended to illustrate the operation of the computational framework. The examples provide simplified descriptions of the facts relating to the claim for award, the information provided, and the facts relating to the underlying tax case. The application of section 7623(b)(3) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section will depend on the specific facts of each case.

# Example 1.
Facts. Whistleblower A is employed as a junior associate in a law firm and is responsible for performing research and drafting activities for, and under the direction and control of, partners of the law firm. Whistleblower A performed research on financial products for Partner B that Partner B used in advising a client (Corporation 1) on a financial strategy. After Corporation 1 executed the strategy, Whistleblower A submitted a claim for award under section 7623 along with information about the strategy to the IRS. The IRS initiated an examination of Corporation 1 based on Whistleblower A's information, determined deficiencies in tax and penalties, and ultimately assessed and collected the tax and penalties as determined.
Analysis. Whistleblower A did nothing to design or set into motion Corporation 1's activities. Whistleblower A did not know or have reason to know that an underpayment of tax or actions described in section 7623(a)(2) could result from the research and drafting activities. Accordingly, as a threshold matter, Whistleblower A was not a planner and initiator of Corporation 1's strategy, and the award that would otherwise be determined based on the application of section 7623(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not subject to reduction under section 7623(b)(3) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

# Example 2.
Facts. Whistleblower C is employed in the human resources department of a corporation (Corporation 2). Corporation 2 tasked Whistleblower C with hiring a large number of temporary employees to meet Corporation 2's seasonal business demands. Whistleblower C organized, scheduled, and conducted job fairs and job interviews to hire the seasonal employees. Whistleblower C was not responsible for, had no knowledge of, and played no part in, classifying the seasonal employees for Federal income tax purposes. Whistleblower C later discovered, however, that Corporation 2 classified the seasonal employees as independent contractors. After discovering the misclassification, Whistleblower C submitted a claim for award under section 7623 along with non-privileged information describing the employee misclassification to the IRS. The IRS initiated an examination of Corporation 2 based on Whistleblower C's information, determined deficiencies in tax and penalties, and ultimately assessed and collected the tax and penalties as determined.
Analysis. The award that would otherwise be determined based on the application of section 7623(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section would not be subject to a reduction under section 7623(b)(3) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section because Whistleblower C did not satisfy the requirements of the threshold determination of a planner and initiator. Whistleblower C did not know and had no reason to know that her actions could result in an underpayment of tax or actions described in section 7623(a)(2) or that Corporation 2 would misclassify the employees as independent contractors.

# Example 3.
Facts. Whistleblower D is employed as a supervisor in the finance department of a corporation (Corporation 3) and is responsible for planning Corporation 3's overall financial strategy. Pursuant to the overall financial strategy, Whistleblower D and others at Corporation 3, in good faith but incorrectly, planned tax-advantaged transactions. Whistleblower D and others at Corporation 3 prepared documents needed to execute the transactions. After Corporation 3 executed the transactions, Whistleblower D reached the conclusion that the tax consequences claimed were incorrect and Whistleblower D submitted a claim for award under section 7623 along with non-privileged information about the transactions to the IRS. The IRS initiated an examination of Corporation 3 based on Whistleblower D's information, determined deficiencies in tax and penalties, and ultimately assessed and collected the tax and penalties as determined.
Analysis. The award that would otherwise be determined based on the application of section 7623(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section would be subject to an appropriate reduction under section 7623(b)(3) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section because Whistleblower D satisfies the requirements of the threshold determination of a planner and initiator. Whistleblower D planned the transactions, prepared the necessary documents,
and knew that an underpayment of tax could result from the transactions. Whistleblower D was not the sole planner and initiator of Corporation 3's transactions. Whistleblower D did nothing to conceal Corporation 3's activities. Corporation 3 had a good faith basis for claiming the disallowed tax benefits. On the basis of those facts, Whistleblower D was a moderate-level planner and initiator. Accordingly, the Whistleblower Office will exercise its discretion to reduce Whistleblower D's award by 0 to 33 percent.

# Example 4.
Facts. Same facts as
Example 3,
except that Whistleblower D independently planned a high-risk tax avoidance transaction and prepared draft documents to execute the transaction. Whistleblower D presented the transaction, along with the draft documents, to Corporation 3's Chief Financial Officer. Without the further involvement of Whistleblower D, Corporation 3's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer, and Board of Directors subsequently approved the execution of the transaction. After Corporation 3 executed the transaction, Whistleblower D submitted a claim for award under section 7623 along with non-privileged information about the transaction to the IRS. The IRS initiated an examination of Corporation 3 based on Whistleblower D's information, determined deficiencies in tax and penalties, and ultimately assessed and collected the tax and penalties as determined.
Analysis. The award that would otherwise be determined based on the application of section 7623(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section would be subject to an appropriate reduction under section 7623(b)(3) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section because Whistleblower D satisfies the requirements of the threshold determination of a planner and initiator. Whistleblower D planned the transaction, prepared the necessary documents, and knew that an underpayment of tax or actions described in section 7623(a)(2) could result from the transaction. Working independently, Whistleblower D designed and took steps to effectuate the transaction while knowing that the planning and initiating of the transaction was likely to result in tax noncompliance. Whistleblower D, however, did not approve the execution of the transaction by Corporation 3 and, therefore, was not a decision-maker. On the basis of these facts, Whistleblower D was a significant-level planner and initiator. Accordingly, the Whistleblower Office will exercise its discretion to reduce Whistleblower D's award by 34 to 66 percent.

# Example 5.
Facts. Whistleblower E is a financial planner. Whistleblower E designed a financial product that the IRS identified as an abusive tax avoidance transaction. Whistleblower E marketed the transaction to taxpayers, facilitated their participation in the transaction, and, initially, took steps to disguise the transaction. After several taxpayers had participated in the transaction, Whistleblower E submitted a claim for award under section 7623 along with non-privileged information to the IRS about the transaction and the participating taxpayers. The IRS initiated an examination of the identified taxpayers based on Whistleblower E's information, determined deficiencies in tax and penalties, and ultimately assessed and collected the tax and penalties as determined. Whistleblower E was not criminally prosecuted.
Analysis. The award that would otherwise be determined based on the application of section 7623(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section would be subject to an appropriate reduction under section 7623(b)(3) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section because Whistleblower E satisfies the requirements of the threshold determination of a planner and initiator. Whistleblower E designed the financial product, marketed and facilitated its use by taxpayers, and knew that an underpayment of tax or actions described in section 7623(a)(2) could result from the transaction. Whistleblower E was the sole designer of the transaction, solicited clients to participate in the transaction, and facilitated and attempted to conceal their participation in the transaction. Whistleblower E knew that the planning and initiating of the taxpayers' participation in the transaction was likely to result in an underpayment of tax or actions described in section 7623(a)(2). On the basis of these facts, Whistleblower E was a primary-level planner and initiator. Accordingly, the Whistleblower Office will exercise its discretion to reduce Whistleblower E's award by 67 to 100 percent.
(4)
Multiple whistleblowers.
If two or more independent claims relate to the same collected proceeds, then the Whistleblower Office may evaluate the contribution of each whistleblower to the action(s) that resulted in collected proceeds. The Whistleblower Office will determine whether the information submitted by each whistleblower would have been obtained by the IRS as a result of the information previously submitted by any other whistleblower. If the Whistleblower Office determines that multiple whistleblowers submitted information that would not have been obtained based on a prior submission, then the Whistleblower Office will determine the amount of each whistleblower's award based on the extent to which each whistleblower contributed to the action(s). The aggregate award amount in cases involving two or more independent claims that
relate to the same collected proceeds will not exceed the maximum award amount that could have resulted under section 7623(b)(1) or section 7623(b)(2), as applicable, subject to the award reduction provisions of section 7623(b)(3), if a single claim had been submitted.
(d)
Payment of Award.
(1)
In general.
The IRS will pay any award determined under section 7623 and §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4 to the whistleblower(s) that filed the corresponding claim for award. Payment of an award will be made as promptly as the circumstances permit, but not until there has been a final determination of tax with respect to the action(s), as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Whistleblower Office has determined the award, and all appeals of the Whistleblower Office's determination are final or the whistleblower has executed an award consent form agreeing to the amount of the award and waiving the whistleblower's right to appeal the determination.
(2)
Final determination of tax.
(i)
In general.
For purposes of §§ 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, a
final determination of tax
means that the proceeds resulting from the action(s) subject to the award determination have been collected and either the statutory period for filing a claim for refund has expired or the taxpayer(s) subject to the action(s) and the IRS have agreed with finality to the tax or other liabilities for the period(s) at issue and the taxpayer(s) have waived the right to file a claim for refund. A final determination of tax does not preclude a subsequent final determination of tax if the IRS proceeds based on the information provided following the payment, denial, or rejection of an award.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, regarding subsequent final determination of tax, may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and § 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer (Corporation 1), describes and documents specific facts relating to Corporation 1's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges that Corporation 1 owed additional taxes in Year 1. The Whistleblower Office processes the incoming claim and provides the information to an IRS Operating Division (Operating Division 1). Operating Division 1 reviews the claim and the allegations and ultimately decides not to proceed with an action against Corporation 1. Operating Division 1 conveys its determination not to proceed with an action against Corporation 1 to the Whistleblower Office on a Form 11369 along with all of the relevant supporting documents. The Whistleblower Office provides written notice to the whistleblower, denying any award pursuant to § 301.7623-3(c)(8), and the whistleblower does not appeal the notice to Tax Court within 30 days.
Two months after the Whistleblower Office denies the award, the Whistleblower Office recognizes a potential connection between the information provided and a recently-initiated, ongoing, examination of a second taxpayer by a second IRS Operating Division (Operating Division 2). The Whistleblower Office provides the information to Operating Division 2. Operating Division 2 evaluates the information and proceeds with an action against Taxpayer 2 based on the information provided. Ultimately, Operating Division 2 assesses and collects taxes resulting from the action and totaling $3 million. Following the conclusion of the whistleblower's participation in a whistleblower administrative proceeding described in § 301.7623-3(c) and the expiration of the statutory period for filing a claim for refund by Taxpayer 2, the Whistleblower Office determines the amount of the award and communicates the award to the whistleblower in a determination letter. The whistleblower may appeal the notice to the Tax Court within 30 days.
(3)
Joint Whistleblowers.
If multiple whistleblowers jointly submit a claim for award, the IRS will pay any award in equal shares to the joint whistleblowers unless the joint whistleblowers specify a different allocation in a written agreement, signed by all the joint whistleblowers and notarized, and submitted with the claim for award. The aggregate award payment in cases involving joint whistleblowers will be within the award percentage range of section 7623(b)(1) or section 7623(b)(2), as applicable, and subject to the award reduction provisions of section 7623(b)(3).
(4)
Deceased Whistleblower.
If a whistleblower dies before or during the whistleblower administrative proceeding, the Whistleblower Office may substitute an executor, administrator, or other legal representative on behalf of the deceased whistleblower for purposes of conducting the whistleblower administrative proceeding.
(5)
Tax treatment of award.
All awards are includible in gross income and subject to current Federal tax reporting and withholding requirements.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
This rule is effective on August 12, 2014. This rule applies to information submitted on or after August 12, 2014, and to claims for award under section 7623(b) that are open as of August 12, 2014.
[T.D. 9687, 79 FR 47270, Aug. 12, 2014]
§ 301.7624-1
Reimbursement to State and local law enforcement agencies.
(a)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Service may reimburse a State or local law enforcement agency for expenses, such as salaries, overtime pay, per diem, and similar reasonable expenses, incurred in an investigation in which information is furnished to the Service that substantially contributes to the recovery of Federal taxes imposed with respect to illegal drug or related money laundering activities. The amount of reimbursement that may be paid shall not exceed the limits specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section.
(b)
Information that substantially contributes to recovery of taxes
—(1)
Definition.
The Service generally will consider that information furnished by a State or local law enforcement agency substantially contributed to the recovery of taxes with respect to illegal drug or related money laundering activities provided the information was not already in the possession of the Service at the time the information is furnished by the State or local law enforcement agency, and
(i) Concerns a taxpayer who is not under examination or investigation by the Service at the time the information is furnished or has not already been selected by the Service for examination or investigation in the near future, or
(ii) Concerns a taxpayer who is under examination or has been selected for examination at the time the information is furnished but the information furnished would not normally have been discovered in the course of an ordinary investigation or examination by the Service. Also, information will generally be considered as substantially contributing to the recovery of taxes if it leads to the discovery of hidden assets owned by the taxpayer which are used to satisfy the taxpayer's assessed but otherwise uncollectible Federal tax liability with respect to illegal drug or related money laundering activities.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), information includes, but is not limited to, tax years of violations, aliases, addresses, social security numbers and/or employer identification numbers, financial data (bank accounts, assets, etc.) and their location, and any documentation that substantiates allegations concerning tax liability (books and records) and its location.
(2) Examples:

# Example 1.
A local police department's narcotics division has been gathering information on a suspected local drug dealer for approximately six months. Because this person is very cautious when handling narcotics, the local police have been unsuccessful in catching this person in possession of drugs. Rather than drop the case, the narcotics detective turns over to the local IRS Criminal Investigation Division (CID) office information concerning this person. At the time the information is furnished, the Service is unaware of this person's suspected involvement in drugs and has no reason to suspect that this person's Federal income tax returns are incorrect. Upon examination of this person's returns for three open years, the Service determines that additional Federal income taxes and civil penalties of approximately $20,000 per year are due because of unreported income from drug dealing. Because the taxpayer was not under examination and was not reasonably anticipated to have been examined prior to receipt of the information, the Service will consider that the information furnished by the local police department substantially contributed to the recovery of approximately $60,000 in taxes with respect to illegal drug activities.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as example 1 except that at the time the information is turned over to the Service, the Service was already aware of the extent of this person's involvement in drug dealing, either through information developed in the course of examinations of other taxpayers or through information received from other sources, and had already selected this person's returns for examination although the person had not yet been contacted by the Service. In this case, the information provided by the local police department did not substantially contribute to the recovery of taxes from this person because the information was already known to the Service.

# Example 3.
A state or local police officer is conducting ordinary traffic patrol. The officer stops a vehicle for speeding and reckless driving. The officer recognizes the driver as a known narcotics dealer. In the vehicle is a brief case containing $75,000 in cash, but no trace of narcotics is found. The driver claims the cash was won in a high stakes poker game. The officer arrests the driver for traffic violations and takes the briefcase into custody for safe keeping. The local police department cannot seize the money because they cannot tie it to a narcotics transaction. Instead, they immediately inform the local CID office of their find. At the time this information is furnished to the Service, there is an unpaid assessed liability of $300,000 in Federal taxes and penalties owed by the dealer with respect to illegal drug activities that the Service has been unable to collect. Therefore, the Service immediately seizes the $75,000 in cash in partial payment of the tax liability. The Service will consider that the information furnished by the police department substantially contributed to the recovery of $75,000 in taxes with respect to drug related activities.

# Example 4.
Through information furnished by a reliable informant, a local police department learns that a known racketeer and suspected drug dealer maintains a second set of books and records in a safe at home. The local police obtain a search warrant and find a set of books revealing that this person has been using a legitimate business operation to launder money derived from both prostitution and drug dealing. At the time these records are turned over to the local CID office, the taxpayer is already under examination for tax evasion. However, based on the information contained in this second set of books, the Service is able to collect additional taxes and civil penalties in the amount of $1 million in connection with these illegal activities. The Service will consider that this information substantially contributed to the recovery of $1 million in taxes with respect to money laundering in connection with illegal drug activities because, even though the taxpayer was already under examination, the information provided by the local police would normally not have been discovered by the Service in the course of an ordinary investigation.
(c)
Application for reimbursement.
An agency that intends to apply for reimbursement under the provisions of this section must indicate this intent to the Service at the time the information is first provided to the Service. A final application for reimbursement of expenses must be submitted on Form 211A, State or Local Law Enforcement Application for Reimbursement, to the Chief, Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service district in which the taxpayer is located. Copies of Forms 9061, DAG-71, or other claim for an equitable share of asset forfeitures in the case must also be furnished with Form 211A.
(d)
Time for filing application for reimbursement.
An application for reimbursement may be filed by an agency at the time the information is first provided or as soon as practicable after submitting information to the Service. However, it must be filed not later than 30 days after the Service notifies the agency pursuant to section 7624(b) of the amount of taxes collected as a result of the information provided. If an application for reimbursement is filed by more than one agency with respect to taxes recovered from a taxpayer, the Service will use discretion in determining an equitable amount of reimbursement allocated to each agency based on all relevant factors. In no event, however, shall the aggregate of the amounts paid by the Service to two or more agencies exceed the amount specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(e)
Amount and payment of reimbursement
—(1)
De minimis rule.
No reimbursement shall be paid under section 7624 or this section to a State or local law enforcement agency in any case where the taxes recovered total less than $50,000.
(2)
Taxes recovered.
For purposes of section 7624 and this section, the terms “taxes” recovered and “sum” recovered mean additional Federal taxes, civil penalties, and additions to tax collected (less any subsequent refund to the taxpayer) with respect to illegal drug or related money laundering activities, but not additional interest or criminal fines that may be collected.
(3)
Limitation on reimbursement.
The amount of reimbursement payable under section 7624 and this section shall not exceed 10 percent of any taxes recovered.
(4)
No duplicate reimbursement.
A State or local law emforcement agency shall not receive reimbursement under section 7624 or this section for any expenses incurred in the investigation of a taxpayer which have been or will be reimbursed under any other program or arrangement including, but not limited
to, Federal or State forfeiture programs, State revenue laws, or Federal and State equitable sharing arrangements.
(5)
Time of payment.
No payment of any reimbursement under this section will be made to a State or local law enforcement agency before the later of final expiration of the applicable period of limitations for filing a claim for refund by the taxpayer of the taxes recovered as provided in subchapter B of chapter 66 of the Code or the determination of the taxpayer's tax liability, as defined in section 1313(a). However, reimbursement may be made earlier but only if the agency provides adequate indemnification against loss by the Service due to a refund to the taxpayer of Federal taxes recovered.

§ 301.7654-1
Coordination of U.S. and Guam individual income taxes.
(a)
Application of section
—(1)
Scope.
Section 7654 and this section set forth the general procedures to be followed by the Government of the United States and the Government of Guam in the division between the two governments of revenue derived from collections of the income taxes imposed for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, with respect to any individual described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a), and paragraph (e) of this section. To the extent that section 7654 and this section are inconsistent with the provisions of section 30 of the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421h), relating to duties and taxes to be covered into the treasury of Guam and held in account for the Government of Guam, such section 30 is superseded.
(2)
Individuals covered.
Paragraph (b) of this section applies only to an individual who, for a taxable year, is described in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.935-1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) and has (or in the case of a joint return, such individual and his spouse have)—
(i) Adjusted gross income of $50,000 or more, and
(ii) Gross income of $5,000 or more from sources within the jurisdiction (either the United States or Guam) other than the jurisdiction with which the individual is required to file his income tax return under paragraph (b) of § 1.935-1 of this chapter.
For the determination of gross income and adjusted gross income see sections 61 and 62, and the regulations thereunder, or, when applicable, the corresponding provisions as made applicable in Guam by the Guam Territorial income tax (48 U.S.C. 1421i). For purposes of this paragraph, gross income consisting of compensation for military or naval service shall be taken into account notwithstanding section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 App. U.S.C. 574). However, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Allocation of tax.
(1) Net collections of income taxes imposed for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, with respect to each individual described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for such year shall be divided between the United States and Guam
by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Commissioner of Revenue and Taxation of Guam as follows:
(i) Net collections attributable to income from sources within the United States shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States.
(ii) Net collections attributable to income from sources within Guam shall be covered into the treasury of Guam, and
(iii) Net collections not described in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph (
i.e.
, net collections attributable to income from sources other than within the United States or Guam) shall be covered into the treasury of the jurisdiction (either the United States or Guam) with which the individual is required to file his return under paragraph (b) of § 1.935-1 of this chapter for such year.
(2) The amount of tax of any individual for a taxable year which shall be allocated to Guam for purposes of determining the portion of the net collections from such individual which shall be covered into the treasury of Guam by the United States for such year shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to such amount of tax as the adjusted gross income of that individual for such year which is allocable to sources in Guam bears to the total adjusted gross income of such individual for such year. For purposes of such allocation by the United States, the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer shall be determined by taking into account any compensation of any member of the Armed Forces for services performed in Guam the withheld tax on which is paid into the treasury of Guam pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The amount of tax of any individual for any taxable year which shall be allocated to the United States for purposes of determining the portion of the net collections from such individual which shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States by Guam for such year shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to such amount of tax as the adjusted gross income of that individual for such year which is allocable to sources in the United States bears to the total adjusted gross income of such individual for such year.
(c)
Definitions and special rules.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Net collections.
(i) In determining net collections for a taxable year, appropriate adjustment between the two jurisdictions shall be made on a proportionate basis for underpayments of income taxes for such taxable year, credits allowed against the income tax for such taxable year (other than the credit for taxes withheld under section 3402 on wages), and refunds made of income taxes paid with respect to such taxable year. Thus, if a net operating loss results in a carryback to an earlier taxable year which gives rise to a refund for that earlier year, an adjustment must be made based upon the proportion which the amount of tax covered by one jurisdiction into the treasury of the other jurisdiction for that earlier year bears to the total amount of tax paid for that earlier year, even though the loss may have resulted from activities in one jurisdiction and the income, against which the loss was offset, was earned in the other jurisdiction. Similar adjustments must be made for foreign tax credit carrybacks even though different jurisdictions are involved. If, for example, an individual pays income tax of $30,000 to the United States for 1974 and $10,000 of such tax is covered into the treasury of Guam, and if for 1975 such individual has a net operating loss attributable to a trade or business carried on in the United States which loss is carried back to 1974 and gives rise to a refund of $15,000 by the United States, Guam must cover into the Treasury of the United States the amount of $5,000 which is the adjustment based upon the refund ($15,000 × $10,000/$30,000 = $5,000).
(ii) Tax withheld from the compensation of any member of the Armed Forces described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section which is paid to Guam pursuant to section 7654(d) and paragraph (e) of this section shall be taken into account in determining the amount required to be covered into the treasury of Guam under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, any underpayment of tax is treated as attributable on a pro rata basis to income from sources within the United States, Guam, and sources
other than within the United States or Guam, respectively, and is divided between the United States and Guam under the rules in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Income taxes.
The term “income taxes” means—
(i) With respect to taxes imposed by the United States, the income taxes imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, and
(ii) With respect to taxes imposed by Guam, the Guam Territorial income tax (48 U.S.C. 1421i).
(3)
Source rules.
The determination of the source of income shall be based on the principles contained in sections 861 through 863, and the regulations thereunder, or, when applicable, in those sections as made applicable in Guam by the Guam Territorial income tax. For such purposes the provisions of section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 App. U.S.C. 574) relating to the determination of the source of income of members of the Armed Forces shall not be taken into account. For purposes of this subparagraph, the provisions in section 935(c) treating Guam as part of the United States, and vice versa, do not apply. For definition of the terms “United States” and “Guam” (see section 7701(a)(9) of the Code and section 2 of the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421).
(d)
Information return.
Each individual described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for a taxable year who is required by paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.935-1 of this chapter to file his return of income for such year with the United States shall timely file a properly executed Form 5074 (Allocation of Individual Income Tax to Guam) by attaching such form to his income tax return. Each individual described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for a taxable year who is required by paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.935-1 of this chapter to file his return of income for such year with Guam shall timely file such information as may be required by the Commissioner of Revenue and Taxation with respect to his income derived from sources within the United States. See section 6688 and § 301.6688-1 for the penalty for failure to comply with this paragraph.
(e)
Military personnel in Guam.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall arrange to pay to Guam the amount of the taxes deducted and withheld by the United States under section 3402 from wages paid to members of the Armed Forces who are stationed in Guam but who have no income tax liability to Guam with respect to such wages by reason of section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 App. U.S.C. 574). Section 514 of that Act provides in effect that for purposes of the taxation of income by Guam a person shall not be deemed to have lost a residence or domicile in the United States solely by reason of being absent therefrom in compliance with military or naval orders and the compensation for military or naval service of such a person who is not a resident of, or domiciled in, Guam shall not be deemed income for services performed within, or from sources within, Guam. Any amount paid to Guam under this paragraph in respect of a member of the Armed Forces described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be taken into account in determining the amount required to be covered into the treasury of Guam under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “Armed Forces of the United States” has the meaning provided by § 301.7701-8 of this chapter. This paragraph does not apply to wages for services performed in Guam by members of the Armed Forces of the United States which are not compensation for military or naval service. In determining the amount of tax to be covered into the treasury of Guam under this paragraph with respect to remuneration for services performed in Guam by members of the Armed Forces of the United States, the special procedure agreed upon with the Department of Defense in 1951 shall not apply to remuneration paid after December 31, 1974. Under that procedure the tax withheld under section 3402 upon such remuneration for services performed in Guam during April and October of each year was to be projected for the appropriate six-month period of which the base month is a part, thereby arriving at an estimated figure for semiannual withholding tax to be covered over.
(f)
Transfers of funds.
The transfers of funds between the United States and Guam required to effectuate the provisions of this section shall be made when convenient for the two governments, but not less frequently than once in each calendar year. In complying with paragraph (b) of this section, only net balances will be transferred between the two governments. Further, amounts transferred pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section may be determined on the basis of estimates rather than the actual amounts derived from information furnished by taxpayers, except that the net collections for 1973 and every third calendar year thereafter are to be transferred on the basis of the information furnished by taxpayers pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. In order to facilitate the transfer of funds pursuant to this section, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Commissioner of Revenue and Taxation of Guam shall exchange such information, including copies of income tax returns, as will ensure that the provisions of section 7654 and this section are being properly implemented.

# Definitions
§ 301.7701-1
Classification of organizations for federal tax purposes.
(a)
Organizations for federal tax purposes
—(1)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Code prescribes the classification of various organizations for federal tax purposes. Whether an organization is an entity separate from its owners for federal tax purposes is a matter of federal tax law and does not depend on whether the organization is recognized as an entity under local law.
(2)
Certain joint undertakings give rise to entities for federal tax purposes.
A joint venture or other contractual arrangement may create a separate entity for federal tax purposes if the participants carry on a trade, business, financial operation, or venture and divide the profits therefrom. For example, a separate entity exists for federal tax purposes if co- owners of an apartment building lease space and in addition provide services to the occupants either directly or through an agent. Nevertheless, a joint undertaking merely to share expenses does not create a separate entity for federal tax purposes. For example, if two or more persons jointly construct a ditch merely to drain surface water from their properties, they have not created a separate entity for federal tax purposes. Similarly, mere co-ownership of property that is maintained, kept in repair, and rented or leased does not constitute a separate entity for federal tax purposes. For example, if an individual owner, or tenants in common, of farm property lease it to a farmer for a cash rental or a share of the crops, they do not necessarily create a separate entity for federal tax purposes.
(3)
Certain local law entities not recognized.
An entity formed under local law is not always recognized as a separate entity for federal tax purposes. For example, an organization wholly owned by a State is not recognized as a separate entity for federal tax purposes if it is an integral part of the State. Similarly, tribes incorporated under section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 477, or under section 3 of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 503, are not recognized as separate entities for federal tax purposes.
(4)
Single owner organizations.
Under §§ 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3, certain organizations that have a single owner can choose to be recognized or disregarded as entities separate from their owners.
(b)
Classification of organizations.
The classification of organizations that are recognized as separate entities is determined under §§ 301.7701-2, 301.7701-3, and 301.7701-4 unless a provision of the Internal Revenue Code (such as section 860A addressing Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMICs)) provides for special treatment of that organization. For the classification of organizations as trusts, see § 301.7701-4. That section provides that trusts generally do not have associates or an objective to carry on business for profit. Sections 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3 provide rules for classifying organizations that are not classified as trusts.
(c)
Cost sharing arrangements.
A cost sharing arrangement that is described in § 1.482-7 of this chapter, including
any arrangement that the Commissioner treats as a CSA under § 1.482-7(b)(5) of this chapter, is not recognized as a separate entity for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. See § 1.482-7 of this chapter for the rules regarding CSAs.
(d)
Domestic and foreign business entities.
See § 301.7701-5 for the rules that determine whether a business entity is domestic or foreign.
(e)
State.
For purposes of this section and § 301.7701-2, the term
State
includes the District of Columbia.
(f)
Effective/applicability dates.
Except as provided in the following sentence, the rules of this section are applicable as of January 1, 1997. The rules of paragraph (c) of this section are applicable on January 5, 2009.
[T.D. 8697, 61 FR 66588, Dec. 18, 1996, as amended by T.D. 9153, 69 FR 49810, Aug. 12, 2004; T.D. 9246, 71 FR 4816, Jan. 30, 2006; T.D. 9441, 74 FR 390, Jan. 5, 2009; T.D. 9568, 76 FR 80136, Dec. 22, 2011]
§ 301.7701-2
Business entities; definitions.
(a)
Business entities.
For purposes of this section and § 301.7701-3, a
business entity
is any entity recognized for federal tax purposes (including an entity with a single owner that may be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under § 301.7701-3) that is not properly classified as a trust under § 301.7701-4 or otherwise subject to special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. A business entity with two or more members is classified for federal tax purposes as either a corporation or a partnership. A business entity with only one owner is classified as a corporation or is disregarded; if the entity is disregarded, its activities are treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship, branch, or division of the owner. But see paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) through (vii) of this section for special rules that apply to an eligible entity that is otherwise disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.
(b)
Corporations.
For federal tax purposes, the term
corporation
means—
(1) A business entity organized under a Federal or State statute, or under a statute of a federally recognized Indian tribe, if the statute describes or refers to the entity as incorporated or as a corporation, body corporate, or body politic;
(2) An association (as determined under § 301.7701-3);
(3) A business entity organized under a State statute, if the statute describes or refers to the entity as a joint-stock company or joint-stock association;
(4) An insurance company;
(5) A State-chartered business entity conducting banking activities, if any of its deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1811
et seq.,
or a similar federal statute;
(6) A business entity wholly owned by a State or any political subdivision thereof, or a business entity wholly owned by a foreign government or any other entity described in § 1.892-2T;
(7) A business entity that is taxable as a corporation under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 7701(a)(3); and

Clarification of list of corporations in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section
—(A)
Exceptions in certain cases.
The following entities will not be treated as corporations under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section:
(
1
) With regard to Canada, a Nova Scotia Unlimited Liability Company (or any other company or corporation all of whose owners have unlimited liability pursuant to federal or provincial law).
(
2
) With regard to India, a company deemed to be a public limited company solely by operation of section 43A(1) (relating to corporate ownership of the company), section 43A(1A) (relating to annual average turnover), or section 43A(1B) (relating to ownership interests in other companies) of the Companies Act, 1956 (or any combination of these), provided that the organizational documents of such deemed public limited company continue to meet the requirements of section 3(1)(iii) of the Companies Act, 1956.
(
3
) With regard to Malaysia, a Sendirian Berhad.
(B)
Inclusions in certain cases.
With regard to Mexico, the term Sociedad Anonima includes a Sociedad Anonima that chooses to apply the variable capital provision of Mexican corporate law (Sociedad Anonima de Capital Variable).
(iii)
Public companies.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, with regard to Cyprus, Hong Kong, and Jamaica, the term Public Limited Company includes any Limited Company that is not defined as a private company under the corporate laws of those jurisdictions. In all other cases, where the term Public Limited Company is not defined, that term shall include any Limited Company defined as a public company under the corporate laws of the relevant jurisdiction.
(iv)
Limited companies.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(8), any reference to a Limited Company includes, as the case may be, companies limited by shares and companies limited by guarantee.
(v)
Multilingual countries.
Different linguistic renderings of the name of an entity listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section shall be disregarded. For example, an entity formed under the laws of Switzerland as a Societe Anonyme will be a corporation and treated in the same manner as an Aktiengesellschaft.
(b)(9)
Business entities with multiple charters.
(i) An entity created or organized under the laws of more than one jurisdiction if the rules of this section would treat it as a corporation with reference to any one of the jurisdictions in which it is created or organized. Such an entity may elect its classification under § 301.7701-3, subject to the limitations of those provisions, only if it is created or organized in each jurisdiction in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in § 301.7701-3(a). The determination of a business entity's corporate or non-corporate classification is made independently from the determination of whether the entity is domestic or foreign. See § 301.7701-5 for the rules that determine whether a business entity is domestic or foreign.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rule of this paragraph (b)(9):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
X is an entity with a single owner organized under the laws of Country A as an entity that is listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section. Under the rules of this section, such an entity is a corporation for Federal tax purposes and under § 301.7701-3(a) is unable to elect its classification. Several years after its formation, X files a certificate of domestication in State B as a limited liability company (LLC). Under the laws of State B, X is considered to be created or organized in State B as an LLC upon the filing of the certificate of domestication and is therefore subject to the laws of State B. Under the rules of this section and § 301.7701-3, an LLC with a single owner organized only in State B is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for Federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). Neither Country A nor State B law requires X to terminate its charter in Country A as a result of the domestication, and in fact X does not terminate its Country A charter. Consequently, X is now organized in more than one jurisdiction.
(ii)
Result.
X remains organized under the laws of Country A as an entity that is listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, and as such, it is an entity that is treated as a corporation under the rules of this section. Therefore, X is a corporation for Federal tax purposes because the rules of this section would treat X as a corporation with reference to one of the jurisdictions in which it is created or organized. Because X is organized in Country A in a manner that does not meet the definition of an eligible entity in § 301.7701-3(a), it is unable to elect its classification.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
Y is an entity that is incorporated under the laws of State A and has two shareholders. Under the rules of this section, an entity incorporated under the laws of State A is a corporation for Federal tax purposes and under § 301.7701-3(a) is unable to elect its classification. Several years after its formation, Y files a certificate of continuance in Country B as an unlimited company. Under the laws of Country B, upon filing a certificate of continuance, Y is treated as organized in Country B. Under the rules of this section and § 301.7701-3, an unlimited company organized only in Country B that has more than one owner is treated as a partnership for Federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). Neither State A nor Country B law requires Y to terminate its charter in State A as a result of the continuance, and in fact Y does not terminate its State A charter. Consequently, Y is now organized in more than one jurisdiction.
(ii)
Result.
Y remains organized in State A as a corporation, an entity that is treated as a corporation under the rules of this section. Therefore, Y is a corporation for Federal tax purposes because the rules of this section would treat Y as a corporation with reference to one of the jurisdictions in which it is created or organized. Because Y is organized in State A in a manner that does not meet the definition of an eligible entity in § 301.7701-3(a), it is unable to elect its classification.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
Z is an entity that has more than one owner and that is recognized under the laws of Country A as an unlimited company organized in Country A. Z is organized in Country A in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in § 301.7701-3(a). Under the rules of this section and § 301.7701-3, an unlimited company organized only in Country A with more than one owner is treated as a partnership for Federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). At the time Z was formed, it was also organized as a private limited company under the laws of Country B. Z is organized in Country B in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in § 301.7701-3(a). Under the rules of this section and § 301.7701-3, a private limited company organized only in Country B is treated as a corporation for Federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as a partnership). Thus, Z is organized in more than one jurisdiction. Z has not made any entity classification elections under § 301.7701-3.
(ii)
Result.
Z is organized in Country B as a private limited company, an entity that is treated (absent an election to the contrary) as a corporation under the rules of this section. However, because Z is organized in each jurisdiction in a manner that meets the definition of an eligible entity in § 301.7701-3(a),
it may elect its classification under § 301.7701-3, subject to the limitations of those provisions.

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
P is an entity with more than one owner organized in Country A as a general partnership. Under the rules of this section and § 301.7701-3, an eligible entity with more than one owner in Country A is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). P files a certificate of continuance in Country B as an unlimited company. Under the rules of this section and § 301.7701-3, an unlimited company in Country B with more than one owner is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes (absent an election to be treated as an association). P is not required under either the laws of Country A or Country B to terminate the general partnership in Country A, and in fact P does not terminate its Country A partnership. P is now organized in more than one jurisdiction. P has not made any entity classification elections under § 301.7701-3.
(ii)
Result.
P's organization in both Country A and Country B would result in P being classified as a partnership. Therefore, since the rules of this section would not treat P as a corporation with reference to any jurisdiction in which it is created or organized, it is not a corporation for federal tax purposes.
(c)
Other business entities.
For federal tax purposes—
(1) The term
partnership
means a business entity that is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this section and that has at least two members.
(2)
Wholly owned entities
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this section is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.
(ii)
Special rule for certain business entities.
If the single owner of a business entity is a bank (as defined in section 581, or, in the case of a foreign bank, as defined in section 585(a)(2)(B) without regard to the second sentence thereof), then the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code will continue to apply to the single owner as if the wholly owned entity were a separate entity. For this purpose, the special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code do not include the rules under sections 864(c), 882(c), and 884.
(iii)
Tax liabilities of certain disregarded entities
—(A)
In general.
An entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as an entity separate from its owner for purposes of—
(
1
) Federal tax liabilities of the entity with respect to any taxable period for which the entity was not disregarded;
(
2
) Federal tax liabilities of any other entity for which the entity is liable; and
(
3
) Refunds or credits of Federal tax.
(B)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section:

# Example 1.
In 2006, X, a domestic corporation that reports its taxes on a calendar year basis, merges into Z, a domestic LLC wholly owned by Y that is disregarded as an entity separate from Y, in a state law merger. X was not a member of a consolidated group at any time during its taxable year ending in December 2005. Under the applicable state law, Z is the successor to X and is liable for all of X's debts. In 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment for X's 2005 taxable year. Because Z is the successor to X and is liable for X's 2005 taxes that remain unpaid, Z is the proper party to sign the consent to extend the period of limitations.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that in 2007, the IRS determines that X miscalculated and underreported its income tax liability for 2005. Because Z is the successor to X and is liable for X's 2005 taxes that remain unpaid, the deficiency may be assessed against Z and, in the event that Z fails to pay the liability after notice and demand, a general tax lien will arise against all of Z's property and rights to property.
(iv)
Special rule for employment tax purposes
—
(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (relating to certain wholly owned entities) does not apply to taxes imposed under Subtitle C—Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax (Chapters 21, 22, 23, 23A, 24, and 25 of the Internal Revenue Code).
(B)
Treatment of entity.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as a corporation with respect to taxes imposed under Subtitle C—Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax (Chapters 21, 22, 23, 23A, 24,
and 25 of the Internal Revenue Code). For special rules regarding the application of certain employment tax exceptions, see §§ 31.3121(b)(3)-1(d), 31.3127-1(b), and 31.3306(c)(5)-1(d) of this chapter.
(C)
Special rules.
(
1
) Paragraphs (c)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section do not apply to withholding requirements imposed by section 3406 (backup withholding). Thus, in the case of an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section, the owner is subject to the withholding requirements imposed by section 3406 (backup withholding).
(
2
) Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section applies to taxes imposed under subtitle A of the Code, including Chapter 2—Tax on Self-Employment Income. Thus, an entity that is treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship under paragraph (a) of this section is not treated as a corporation for purposes of employing its owner; instead, the entity is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for this purpose and is not the employer of its owner. The owner will be subject to self-employment tax on self-employment income with respect to the entity's activities. Also, if a partnership is the owner of an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section, the entity is not treated as a corporation for purposes of employing a partner of the partnership that owns the entity; instead, the entity is disregarded as an entity separate from the partnership for this purpose and is not the employer of any partner of the partnership that owns the entity. A partner of a partnership that owns an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is subject to the same self-employment tax rules as a partner of a partnership that does not own an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section.
(D)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section:

# Example.
(i) LLCA is an eligible entity owned by individual A and is generally disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for Federal tax purposes. However, LLCA is treated as an entity separate from its owner for purposes of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code. LLCA has employees and pays wages as defined in sections 3121(a), 3306(b), and 3401(a).
(ii) LLCA is subject to the provisions of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code and related provisions under 26 CFR subchapter C, Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax at Source, parts 31 through 39. Accordingly, LLCA is required to perform such acts as are required of an employer under those provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder that apply. All provisions of law (including penalties) and the regulations prescribed in pursuance of law applicable to employers in respect of such acts are applicable to LLCA. Thus, for example, LLCA is liable for income tax withholding, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) taxes. See sections 3402 and 3403 (relating to income tax withholding); 3102(b) and 3111 (relating to FICA taxes), and 3301 (relating to FUTA taxes). In addition, LLCA must file under its name and EIN the applicable Forms in the 94X series, for example, Form 941, “Employer's Quarterly Employment Tax Return,” Form 940, “Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment Tax Return;” file with the Social Security Administration and furnish to LLCA's employees statements on Forms W-2, “Wage and Tax Statement;” and make timely employment tax deposits. See §§ 31.6011(a)-1, 31.6011(a)-3, 31.6051-1, 31.6051-2, and 31.6302-1 of this chapter.
(iii) A is self-employed for purposes of subtitle A, chapter 2, Tax on Self-Employment Income, of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, A is subject to tax under section 1401 on A's net earnings from self-employment with respect to LLCA's activities. A is not an employee of LLCA for purposes of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code. Because LLCA is treated as a sole proprietorship of A for income tax purposes, A is entitled to deduct trade or business expenses paid or incurred with respect to activities carried on through LLCA, including the employer's share of employment taxes imposed under sections 3111 and 3301, on A's Form 1040, Schedule C, “Profit or Loss for Business (Sole Proprietorship).”
(v)
Special rule for certain excise tax purposes
—(A)
In general.
Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (relating to certain wholly owned entities) does not apply for purposes of—
(
1
) Federal tax liabilities imposed by Chapters 31, 32 (other than section 4181), 33, 34, 35, 36 (other than section 4461), 38, and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any floor stocks tax imposed
on articles subject to any of these taxes;
(
2
) Collection of tax imposed by Chapters 33 and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code;
(
3
) Registration under sections 4101, 4222, 4412;
(
4
) Claims of a credit (other than a credit under section 34), refund, or payment related to a tax described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section or under section 6426 or 6427; and
(
5
) Assessment and collection of an assessable payment imposed by section 4980H and reporting required by section 6056.
(B)
Treatment of entity.
An entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as a corporation with respect to items described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section.
(C)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (c)(2)(v):

# Example.
(i) LLCB is an eligible entity that has a single owner, B. LLCB is generally disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. However, under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, LLCB is treated as an entity separate from its owner for certain purposes relating to excise taxes.
(ii) LLCB mines coal from a coal mine located in the United States. Section 4121 of chapter 32 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on the producer's sale of such coal. Section 48.4121-1(a) of this chapter defines a “producer” generally as the person in whom is vested ownership of the coal under state law immediately after the coal is severed from the ground. LLCB is the person that owns the coal under state law immediately after it is severed from the ground. Under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section, LLCB is the producer of the coal and is liable for tax on its sale of such coal under chapter 32 of the Internal Revenue Code. LLCB must report and pay tax on Form 720, “Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return,” under its own name and taxpayer identification number.
(iii) LLCB uses undyed diesel fuel in an earthmover that is not registered or required to be registered for highway use. Such use is an off-highway business use of the fuel. Under section 6427(l), the ultimate purchaser is allowed to claim an income tax credit or payment related to the tax imposed on diesel fuel used in an off-highway business use. Under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, for purposes of the credit or payment allowed under section 6427(l), LLCB is the person that could claim the amount on its Form 720 or on a Form 8849, “Claim for Refund of Excise Taxes.” Alternatively, if LLCB did not claim a payment during the time prescribed in section 6427(i)(2) for making a claim under section 6427, § 1.34-1 of this chapter provides that B, the owner of LLCB, could claim the income tax credit allowed under section 34 for the nontaxable use of diesel fuel by LLCB.
(iv) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C)
Example
(i) and (ii) of this section. If LLCB does not pay the tax on its sale of coal under chapter 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, any notice of lien the Internal Revenue Service files will be filed as if LLCB were a corporation.
(vi)
Special rule for reporting under section 6038A
—(A)
In general.
An entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under this section is treated as an entity separate from its owner and classified as a corporation for purposes of section 6038A if—
(
1
) The entity is a domestic entity; and
(
2
) One foreign person has direct or indirect sole ownership of the entity.
(B)
Definitions
—(
1
)
Indirect sole ownership.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(A)(
2
) of this section, indirect sole ownership means ownership by one person entirely through one or more other entities disregarded as entities separate from their owners or through one or more grantor trusts, regardless of whether any such disregarded entity or grantor trust is domestic or foreign.
(
2
)
Entity disregarded as separate from its owner.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(B)(
1
) of this section, an entity disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is an entity described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(
3
)
Grantor trust.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(B)(
1
) of this section, a grantor trust is any portion of a trust that is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under subpart E of subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code.
(C)
Taxable year.
The taxable year of an entity classified as a corporation for section 6038A purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(A) of this section is—
(
1
) The same as the taxable year of the foreign person described in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(A)(
2
) of this section, if that foreign person has a U.S. income
tax or information return filing obligation for its taxable year; or
(
2
) The calendar year, if paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(C)(
1
) of this section does not apply, unless otherwise provided in forms, instructions, or published guidance.
(vii)
Special rules for certain disregarded payments
—(A)
Disregarded payment loss rules.
To the extent provided in § 1.1503(d)-1(d) of this chapter, certain payments involving a business entity that, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is otherwise disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, are in effect taken into account as if the entity were regarded and the deduction was denied, and therefore give rise to an income inclusion, and corresponding suspended deduction, to the entity's owner.
(B)
Non-application of the sixty-month limitation.
If an eligible entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner would become a disregarded payment entity (within the meaning of § 1.1503(d)-1(d)(5)(i)(A) of this chapter) when this paragraph (c)(2)(vii) applies, the sixty-month limitation under § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv) does not apply with respect to an election by such eligible entity to change its classification to an association effective before January 1, 2026 (such that it would not become a disregarded payment entity).
(d)
Special rule for certain foreign business entities
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a foreign business entity described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section will not be treated as a corporation under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section if—
(i) The entity was in existence on May 8, 1996;
(ii) The entity's classification was relevant (as defined in § 301.7701-3(d)) on May 8, 1996;
(iii) No person (including the entity) for whom the entity's classification was relevant on May 8, 1996, treats the entity as a corporation for purposes of filing such person's federal income tax returns, information returns, and withholding documents for the taxable year including May 8, 1996;
(iv) Any change in the entity's claimed classification within the sixty months prior to May 8, 1996, occurred solely as a result of a change in the organizational documents of the entity, and the entity and all members of the entity recognized the federal tax consequences of any change in the entity's classification within the sixty months prior to May 8, 1996;
(v) A reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) existed on May 8, 1996, for treating the entity as other than a corporation; and
(vi) Neither the entity nor any member was notified in writing on or before May 8, 1996, that the classification of the entity was under examination (in which case the entity's classification will be determined in the examination).
(2)
Binding contract rule.
If a foreign business entity described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section is formed after May 8, 1996, pursuant to a written binding contract (including an accepted bid to develop a project) in effect on May 8, 1996, and all times thereafter, in which the parties agreed to engage (directly or indirectly) in an active and substantial business operation in the jurisdiction in which the entity is formed, paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be applied to that entity by substituting the date of the entity's formation for May 8, 1996.
(3)
Termination of grandfather status
—(i)
In general.
An entity that is not treated as a corporation under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section by reason of paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section will be treated permanently as a corporation under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section from the earliest of:
(A) The effective date of an election to be treated as an association under § 301.7701-3;
(B) A termination of the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) (regarding sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of the total interest in an entity's capital or profits within a twelve month period);
(C) A division of the partnership under section 708(b)(2)(B); or
(D) The date any person or persons, who were not owners of the entity as of November 29, 1999, own in the aggregate a 50 percent or greater interest in the entity.
(ii)
Special rule for certain entities.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section shall not apply if the sale or exchange of interests in the entity is to a related person (within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)) and occurs no later than twelve months after the date of the formation of the entity.
(e)

However, paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section applies on or after October 22, 2003.

§ 301.7701-3
Classification of certain business entities.
(a)
In general.
A business entity that is not classified as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(b) (1), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), or (8) (an
eligible entity
) can elect its classification for federal tax purposes as provided in this section. An eligible entity with at least two members can elect to be classified as either an association (and thus a corporation under § 301.7701-2(b)(2)) or a partnership, and an eligible entity with a single owner can elect to be classified as an association or to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. Paragraph (b) of this section provides a default classification for an eligible entity that does not make an election. Thus, elections are necessary only when an eligible entity chooses to be classified initially as other than the default classification or when an eligible entity chooses to change its classification. An entity whose classification is determined under the default classification retains that classification (regardless of any changes in the members' liability that occurs at any time during the time that the entity's classification is relevant as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) until the entity makes an election to change that classification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for making express elections, including a rule under which a domestic
eligible entity that elects to be classified as an association consents to be subject to the dual consolidated loss rules of section 1503(d). Paragraph (d) of this section provides special rules for foreign eligible entities. Paragraph (e) of this section provides special rules for classifying entities resulting from partnership terminations and divisions under section 708(b). Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth the effective date of this section and a special rule relating to prior periods.
(b)
Classification of eligible entities that do not file an election
—(1)
Domestic eligible entities.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless the entity elects otherwise, a domestic eligible entity is—
(i) A partnership if it has two or more members; or
(ii) Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner.
(2)
Foreign eligible entities
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless the entity elects otherwise, a foreign eligible entity is—
(A) A partnership if it has two or more members and at least one member does not have limited liability;
(B) An association if all members have limited liability; or
(C) Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner that does not have limited liability.
(ii)
Definition of limited liability.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a member of a foreign eligible entity has limited liability if the member has no personal liability for the debts of or claims against the entity by reason of being a member. This determination is based solely on the statute or law pursuant to which the entity is organized, except that if the underlying statute or law allows the entity to specify in its organizational documents whether the members will have limited liability, the organizational documents may also be relevant. For purposes of this section, a member has personal liability if the creditors of the entity may seek satisfaction of all or any portion of the debts or claims against the entity from the member as such. A member has personal liability for purposes of this paragraph even if the member makes an agreement under which another person (whether or not a member of the entity) assumes such liability or agrees to indemnify that member for any such liability.
(3)
Existing eligible entities
—(i)
In general.
Unless the entity elects otherwise, an eligible entity in existence prior to the effective date of this section will have the same classification that the entity claimed under §§ 301.7701-1 through 301.7701-3 as in effect on the date prior to the effective date of this section; except that if an eligible entity with a single owner claimed to be a partnership under those regulations, the entity will be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under this paragraph (b)(3)(i). For special rules regarding the classification of such entities prior to the effective date of this section, see paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(ii)
Special rules.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, a foreign eligible entity is treated as being in existence prior to the effective date of this section only if the entity's classification was relevant (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) at any time during the sixty months prior to the effective date of this section. If an entity claimed different classifications prior to the effective date of this section, the entity's classification for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is the last classification claimed by the entity. If a foreign eligible entity's classification is relevant prior to the effective date of this section, but no federal tax or information return is filed or the federal tax or information return does not indicate the classification of the entity, the entity's classification for the period prior to the effective date of this section is determined under the regulations in effect on the date prior to the effective date of this section.
(c)
Elections
—(1)
Time and place for filing
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section, an eligible entity may elect to be classified other than as provided under paragraph (b) of this section, or to change its classification, by filing Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, with the service center designated on Form 8832. An election will not be accepted unless all of the information
required by the form and instructions, including the taxpayer identifying number of the entity, is provided on Form 8832. See § 301.6109-1 for rules on applying for and displaying Employer Identification Numbers.
(ii)
Further notification of elections.
An eligible entity required to file a Federal tax or information return for the taxable year for which an election is made under § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i) must attach a copy of its Form 8832 to its Federal tax or information return for that year. If the entity is not required to file a return for that year, a copy of its Form 8832 (“Entity Classification Election”) must be attached to the Federal income tax or information return of any direct or indirect owner of the entity for the taxable year of the owner that includes the date on which the election was effective. An indirect owner of the entity does not have to attach a copy of the Form 8832 to its return if an entity in which it has an interest is already filing a copy of the Form 8832 with its return. If an entity, or one of its direct or indirect owners, fails to attach a copy of a Form 8832 to its return as directed in this section, an otherwise valid election under § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i) will not be invalidated, but the non-filing party may be subject to penalties, including any applicable penalties if the Federal tax or information returns are inconsistent with the entity's election under § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i). In the case of returns for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, the copy of Form 8832 attached to a return pursuant to this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) is not required to be a signed copy.
(iii)
Effective date of election.
An election made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section will be effective on the date specified by the entity on Form 8832 or on the date filed if no such date is specified on the election form. The effective date specified on Form 8832 can not be more than 75 days prior to the date on which the election is filed and can not be more than 12 months after the date on which the election is filed. If an election specifies an effective date more than 75 days prior to the date on which the election is filed, it will be effective 75 days prior to the date it was filed. If an election specifies an effective date more than 12 months from the date on which the election is filed, it will be effective 12 months after the date it was filed. If an election specifies an effective date before January 1, 1997, it will be effective as of January 1, 1997. If a purchasing corporation makes an election under section 338 regarding an acquired subsidiary, an election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for the acquired subsidiary can be effective no earlier than the day after the acquisition date (within the meaning of section 338(h)(2)).
(iv)
Limitation.
If an eligible entity makes an election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to change its classification (other than an election made by an existing entity to change its classification as of the effective date of this section), the entity cannot change its classification by election again during the sixty months succeeding the effective date of the election. However, the Commissioner may permit the entity to change its classification by election within the sixty months if more than fifty percent of the ownership interests in the entity as of the effective date of the subsequent election are owned by persons that did not own any interests in the entity on the filing date or on the effective date of the entity's prior election. An election by a newly formed eligible entity that is effective on the date of formation is not considered a change for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(iv).
(v)
Deemed elections
—(A)
Exempt organizations.
An eligible entity that has been determined to be, or claims to be, exempt from taxation under section 501(a) is treated as having made an election under this section to be classified as an association. Such election will be effective as of the first day for which exemption is claimed or determined to apply, regardless of when the claim or determination is made, and will remain in effect unless an election is made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section after the date the claim for exempt status is withdrawn or rejected or the date the determination of exempt status is revoked.
(B)
Real estate investment trusts.
An eligible entity that files an election under section 856(c)(1) to be treated as
a real estate investment trust is treated as having made an election under this section to be classified as an association. Such election will be effective as of the first day the entity is treated as a real estate investment trust.
(C)
S corporations.
An eligible entity that timely elects to be an S corporation under section 1362(a)(1) is treated as having made an election under this section to be classified as an association, provided that (as of the effective date of the election under section 1362(a)(1)) the entity meets all other requirements to qualify as a small business corporation under section 1361(b). Subject to § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv), the deemed election to be classified as an association will apply as of the effective date of the S corporation election and will remain in effect until the entity makes a valid election, under § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i), to be classified as other than an association.
(vi)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c)(1):

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1998, X, a domestic corporation, purchases a 10% interest in Y, an eligible entity formed under Country A law in 1990. The entity's classification was not relevant to any person for federal tax or information purposes prior to X's acquisition of an interest in Y. Thus, Y is not considered to be in existence on the effective date of this section for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Under the applicable Country A statute, all members of Y have limited liability as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, Y is classified as an association under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section unless it elects under this paragraph (c) to be classified as a partnership. To be classified as a partnership as of July 1, 1998, Y must file a Form 8832 by September 14, 1998. See paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Because an election cannot be effective more than 75 days prior to the date on which it is filed, if Y files its Form 8832 after September 14, 1998, it will be classified as an association from July 1, 1998, until the effective date of the election. In that case, it could not change its classification by election under this paragraph (c) during the sixty months succeeding the effective date of the election.

# Example 2.
(i) Z is an eligible entity formed under Country B law and is in existence on the effective date of this section within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Prior to the effective date of this section, Z claimed to be classified as an association. Unless Z files an election under this paragraph (c), it will continue to be classified as an association under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(ii) Z files a Form 8832 pursuant to this paragraph (c) to be classified as a partnership, effective as of the effective date of this section. Z can file an election to be classified as an association at any time thereafter, but then would not be permitted to change its classification by election during the sixty months succeeding the effective date of that subsequent election.
(2)
Authorized signatures
—(i)
In general.
An election made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must be signed by—
(A) Each member of the electing entity who is an owner at the time the election is filed; or
(B) Any officer, manager, or member of the electing entity who is authorized (under local law or the entity's organizational documents) to make the election and who represents to having such authorization under penalties of perjury.
(ii)
Retroactive elections.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, if an election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is to be effective for any period prior to the time that it is filed, each person who was an owner between the date the election is to be effective and the date the election is filed, and who is not an owner at the time the election is filed, must also sign the election.
(iii)
Changes in classification.
For paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, if an election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is made to change the classification of an entity, each person who was an owner on the date that any transactions under paragraph (g) of this section are deemed to occur, and who is not an owner at the time the election is filed, must also sign the election. This paragraph (c)(2)(iii) applies to elections filed on or after November 29, 1999.
(3)
Consent to be subject to section 1503(d)
—(i)
Rule.
A domestic eligible entity that elects to be classified as an association consents to be treated as a dual resident corporation for purposes of section 1503(d) (such an entity, a
domestic consenting corporation
), for any taxable year for which it is classified as an association and the condition set
forth in § 1.1503(d)-1(c)(1) of this chapter is satisfied.
(ii)
Transition rule—deemed consent.
If, as a result of the applicability date (see paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section) relating to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a domestic eligible entity that is classified as an association has not consented to be treated as a domestic consenting corporation pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, then the domestic eligible entity is deemed to consent to be so treated as of its first taxable year beginning on or after December 20, 2019. The first sentence of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) does not apply if the domestic eligible entity elects, on or after December 20, 2018 and effective before its first taxable year beginning on or after December 20, 2019, to be classified as a partnership or disregarded entity such that it ceases to be a domestic eligible entity that is classified as an association. For purposes of the election described in the second sentence of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), the sixty month limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section is waived.
(iii)
Applicability date.
The sixth sentence of paragraph (a) of this section and paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section apply to a domestic eligible entity that on or after December 20, 2018 files an election to be classified as an association (regardless of whether the election is effective before December 20, 2018). Paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section applies as of December 20, 2018.
(d)
Special rules for foreign eligible entities
—(1)
Definition of relevance
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of this section, a foreign eligible entity's classification is relevant when its classification affects the liability of any person for federal tax or information purposes. For example, a foreign entity's classification would be relevant if U.S. income was paid to the entity and the determination by the withholding agent of the amount to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (if any) would vary depending upon whether the entity is classified as a partnership or as an association. Thus, the classification might affect the documentation that the withholding agent must receive from the entity, the type of tax or information return to file, or how the return must be prepared. The date that the classification of a foreign eligible entity is relevant is the date an event occurs that creates an obligation to file a federal tax return, information return, or statement for which the classification of the entity must be determined. Thus, the classification of a foreign entity is relevant, for example, on the date that an interest in the entity is acquired which will require a U.S. person to file an information return on Form 5471.
(ii)
Deemed relevance
—(A)
General rule.
For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the classification for Federal tax purposes of a foreign eligible entity that files Form 8832, “Entity Classification Election”, shall be deemed to be relevant only on the date the entity classification election is effective.
(B)
Exception.
If the classification of a foreign eligible entity is relevant within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, then the rule in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall not apply.
(2)
Entities the classification of which has never been relevant.
If the classification of a foreign eligible entity has never been relevant (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section), then the entity's classification will initially be determined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section when the classification of the entity first becomes relevant (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section).
(3)
Special rule when classification is no longer relevant.
If the classification of a foreign eligible entity is not relevant (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) for 60 consecutive months, then the entity's classification will initially be determined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section when the classification of the foreign eligible entity becomes relevant (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section). The date that the classification of a foreign entity is not relevant is the date an event occurs that causes the classification to no longer be relevant, or, if no event occurs in a taxable year that causes the classification to be relevant, then the date is the first day of that taxable year.
(4)
Effective date.
Paragraphs (d)(1)(ii), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section apply on or after October 22, 2003.
(e)
Coordination with section 708(b).
Except as provided in § 301.7701-2(d)(3) (regarding termination of grandfather status for certain foreign business entities), an entity resulting from a transaction described in section 708(b)(1)(B) (partnership termination due to sales or exchanges) or section 708(b)(2)(B) (partnership division) is a partnership.
(f)
Changes in number of members of an entity
—(1)
Associations.
The classification of an eligible entity as an association is not affected by any change in the number of members of the entity.
(2)
Partnerships and single member entities.
An eligible entity classified as a partnership becomes disregarded as an entity separate from its owner when the entity's membership is reduced to one member. A single member entity disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is classified as a partnership when the entity has more than one member. If an elective classification change under paragraph (c) of this section is effective at the same time as a membership change described in this paragraph (f)(2), the deemed transactions in paragraph (g) of this section resulting from the elective change preempt the transactions that would result from the change in membership.
(3)
Effect on sixty month limitation.
A change in the number of members of an entity does not result in the creation of a new entity for purposes of the sixty month limitation on elections under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f):

# Example 1. A,
a U.S. person, owns a domestic eligible entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. On January 1, 1998,
B,
a U.S. person, buys a 50 percent interest in the entity from
A.
Under this paragraph (f), the entity is classified as a partnership when
B
acquires an interest in the entity. However,
A
and
B
elect to have the entity classified as an association effective on January 1, 1998. Thus,
B
is treated as buying shares of stock on January 1, 1998. (Under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, this election is treated as a change in classification so that the entity generally cannot change its classification by election again during the sixty months succeeding the effective date of the election.) Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section,
A
is treated as contributing the assets and liabilities of the entity to the newly formed association immediately before the close of December 31, 1997. Because
A
does not retain control of the association as required by section 351,
A
's contribution will be a taxable event. Therefore, under section 1012, the association will take a fair market value basis in the assets contributed by
A,
and
A
will have a fair market value basis in the stock received.
A
will have no additional gain upon the sale of stock to
B,
and
B
will have a cost basis in the stock purchased from
A.

# Example 2.
(i) On April 1, 1998,
A
and
B,
U.S. persons, form
X,
a foreign eligible entity.
X
is treated as an association under the default provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and
X
does not make an election to be classified as a partnership.
A
subsequently purchases all of
B
's interest in
X.
(ii) Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section,
X
continues to be classified as an association.
X,
however, can subsequently elect to be disregarded as an entity separate from
A.
The sixty month limitation of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section does not prevent
X
from making an election because
X
has not made a prior election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

# Example 3.
(i) On April 1, 1998,
A
and
B,
U.S. persons, form
X,
a foreign eligible entity.
X
is treated as an association under the default provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and
X
does not make an election to be classified as a partnership. On January 1, 1999,
X
elects to be classified as a partnership effective on that date. Under the sixty month limitation of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section,
X
cannot elect to be classified as an association until January 1, 2004 (
i.e.
, sixty months after the effective date of the election to be classified as a partnership).
(ii) On June 1, 2000,
A
purchases all of
B
's interest in
X.
After
A
's purchase of
B
's interest,
X
can no longer be classified as a partnership because
X
has only one member. Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section,
X
is disregarded as an entity separate from
A
when
A
becomes the only member of
X. X,
however, is not treated as a new entity for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. As a result, the sixty month limitation of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section continues to apply to
X,
and
X
cannot elect to be classified as an association until January 1, 2004 (
i.e.
, sixty months after January 1, 1999, the effective date of the election by
X
to be classified as a partnership).
(5)
Effective date.
This paragraph (f) applies as of November 29, 1999.
(g)
Elective changes in classification
—(1)
Deemed treatment of elective change
—
(i)
Partnership to association.
If an eligible entity classified as a partnership elects under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to be classified as an association, the following is deemed to occur: The partnership contributes all of its assets and liabilities to the association in exchange for stock in the association, and immediately thereafter, the partnership liquidates by distributing the stock of the association to its partners.
(ii)
Association to partnership.
If an eligible entity classified as an association elects under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to be classified as a partnership, the following is deemed to occur: The association distributes all of its assets and liabilities to its shareholders in liquidation of the association, and immediately thereafter, the shareholders contribute all of the distributed assets and liabilities to a newly formed partnership.
(iii)
Association to disregarded entity.
If an eligible entity classified as an association elects under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, the following is deemed to occur: The association distributes all of its assets and liabilities to its single owner in liquidation of the association.
(iv)
Disregarded entity to an association.
If an eligible entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner elects under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to be classified as an association, the following is deemed to occur: The owner of the eligible entity contributes all of the assets and liabilities of the entity to the association in exchange for stock of the association.
(2)
Effect of elective changes
—(i)
In general.
The tax treatment of a change in the classification of an entity for federal tax purposes by election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is determined under all relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and general principles of tax law, including the step transaction doctrine.
(ii)
Adoption of plan of liquidation.
For purposes of satisfying the requirement of adoption of a plan of liquidation under section 332, unless a formal plan of liquidation that contemplates the election to be classified as a partnership or to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is adopted on an earlier date, the making, by an association, of an election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to be classified as a partnership or to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is considered to be the adoption of a plan of liquidation immediately before the deemed liquidation described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section. This paragraph (g)(2)(ii) applies to elections filed on or after December 17, 2001. Taxpayers may apply this paragraph (g)(2)(ii) retroactively to elections filed before December 17, 2001, if the corporate owner claiming treatment under section 332 and its subsidiary making the election take consistent positions with respect to the federal tax consequences of the election.
(3)
Timing of election
—(i)
In general.
An election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section that changes the classification of an eligible entity for federal tax purposes is treated as occurring at the start of the day for which the election is effective. Any transactions that are deemed to occur under this paragraph (g) as a result of a change in classification are treated as occurring immediately before the close of the day before the election is effective. For example, if an election is made to change the classification of an entity from an association to a partnership effective on January 1, the deemed transactions specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section (including the liquidation of the association) are treated as occurring immediately before the close of December 31 and must be reported by the owners of the entity on December 31. Thus, the last day of the association's taxable year will be December 31 and the first day of the partnership's taxable year will be January 1.
(ii)
Coordination with section 338 election.
A purchasing corporation that makes a qualified stock purchase of an eligible entity taxed as a corporation may make an election under section 338 regarding the acquisition if it satisfies the requirements for the election, and may also make an election to change the classification of the target corporation. If a taxpayer makes an election under section 338 regarding its acquisition of another entity taxable
as a corporation and makes an election under paragraph (c) of this section for the acquired corporation (effective at the earliest possible date as provided by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section), the transactions under paragraph (g) of this section are deemed to occur immediately after the deemed asset purchase by the new target corporation under section 338.
(iii)
Application to successive elections in tiered situations.
When elections under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for a series of tiered entities are effective on the same date, the eligible entities may specify the order of the elections on Form 8832. If no order is specified for the elections, any transactions that are deemed to occur in this paragraph (g) as a result of the classification change will be treated as occurring first for the highest tier entity's classification change, then for the next highest tier entity's classification change, and so forth down the chain of entities until all the transactions under this paragraph (g) have occurred. For example, Parent, a corporation, wholly owns all of the interest of an eligible entity classified as an association (S1), which wholly owns another eligible entity classified as an association (S2), which wholly owns another eligible entity classified as an association (S3). Elections under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section are filed to classify S1, S2, and S3 each as disregarded as an entity separate from its owner effective on the same day. If no order is specified for the elections, the following transactions are deemed to occur under this paragraph (g) as a result of the elections, with each successive transaction occurring on the same day immediately after the preceding transaction S1 is treated as liquidating into Parent, then S2 is treated as liquidating into Parent, and finally S3 is treated as liquidating into Parent.
(4)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, this paragraph (g) applies to elections that are filed on or after November 29, 1999. Taxpayers may apply this paragraph (g) retroactively to elections filed before November 29, 1999 if all taxpayers affected by the deemed transactions file consistently with this paragraph (g).
(h)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rules of this section are applicable as of January 1, 1997.
(2)
Prior treatment of existing entities.
In the case of a business entity that is not described in § 301.7701-2(b) (1), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7), and that was in existence prior to January 1, 1997, the entity's claimed classification(s) will be respected for all peri0ods prior to January 1, 1997, if—
(i) The entity had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) for its claimed classification;
(ii) The entity and all members of the entity recognized the federal tax consequences of any change in the entity's classification within the sixty months prior to January 1, 1997; and
(iii) Neither the entity nor any member was notified in writing on or before May 8, 1996, that the classification of the entity was under examination (in which case the entity's classification will be determined in the examination).
(3)
Deemed elections for S corporations.
Paragraph (c)(1)(v)(C) of this section applies to timely S corporation elections under section 1362(a) filed on or after July 20, 2004. Eligible entities that filed timely S elections before July 20, 2004 may also rely on the provisions of the regulation.

§ 301.7701-4
Trusts.
(a)
Ordinary trusts.
In general, the term “trust” as used in the Internal Revenue Code refers to an arrangement created either by a will or by an inter vivos declaration whereby trustees take title to property for the purpose of protecting or conserving it for the beneficiaries under the ordinary rules applied in chancery or probate courts. Usually the beneficiaries of such a trust do no more than accept the benefits thereof and are not the voluntary planners or creators of the trust arrangement. However, the beneficiaries of such a trust may be the persons who create it and it will be recognized as a trust under the Internal Revenue Code
if it was created for the purpose of protecting or conserving the trust property for beneficiaries who stand in the same relation to the trust as they would if the trust had been created by others for them. Generally speaking, an arrangement will be treated as a trust under the Internal Revenue Code if it can be shown that the purpose of the arrangement is to vest in trustees responsibility for the protection and conservation of property for beneficiaries who cannot share in the discharge of this responsibility and, therefore, are not associates in a joint enterprise for the conduct of business for profit.
(b)
Business trusts.
There are other arrangements which are known as trusts because the legal title to property is conveyed to trustees for the benefit of beneficiaries, but which are not classified as trusts for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code because they are not simply arrangements to protect or conserve the property for the beneficiaries. These trusts, which are often known as business or commercial trusts, generally are created by the beneficiaries simply as a device to carry on a profit-making business which normally would have been carried on through business organizations that are classified as corporations or partnerships under the Internal Revenue Code. However, the fact that the corpus of the trust is not supplied by the beneficiaries is not sufficient reason in itself for classifying the arrangement as an ordinary trust rather than as an association or partnership. The fact that any organization is technically cast in the trust form, by conveying title to property to trustees for the benefit of persons designated as beneficiaries, will not change the real character of the organization if the organization is more properly classified as a business entity under § 301.7701-2.
(c)
Certain investment trusts
—(1) An “investment” trust will not be classified as a trust if there is a power under the trust agreement to vary the investment of the certificate holders.
See Commissioner v. North American Bond Trust,
122 F. 2d 545 (2d Cir. 1941),
cert. denied,
314 U.S. 701 (1942). An investment trust with a single class of ownership interests, representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trust, will be classified as a trust if there is no power under the trust agreement to vary the investment of the certificate holders. An investment trust with multiple classes of ownership interests ordinarily will be classified as a business entity under § 301.7701-2; however, an investment trust with multiple classes of ownership interests, in which there is no power under the trust agreement to vary the investment of the certificate holders, will be classified as a trust if the trust is formed to facilitate direct investment in the assets of the trust and the existence of multiple classes of ownership interests is incidental to that purpose. See § 1.1001-6(f) of this chapter for additional rules that may apply to an investment trust that holds one or more contracts that provide for a rate referencing a discontinued IBOR, as defined in § 1.1001-6(h)(4) of this chapter, and for additional rules that may apply to an investment trust with one or more ownership interests that reference a discontinued IBOR.
(2) The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be illustated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A corporation purchases a portfolio of residential mortgages and transfers the mortgages to a bank under a trust agreement. At the same time, the bank as trustee delivers to the corporation certificates evidencing rights to payments from the pooled mortgages; the corporation sells the certificates to the public. The trustee holds legal title to the mortgages in the pool for the benefit of the certificate holders but has no power to reinvest proceeds attributable to the mortgages in the pool or to vary investments in the pool in any other manner. There are two classes of certificates. Holders of class A certificates are entitled to all payments of mortgage principal, both scheduled and prepaid, until their certificates are retired; holders of class B certificates receive payments of principal only after all class A certificates have been retired. The different rights of the class A and class B certificates serve to shift to the holders of the class A certificates, in addition to the earlier scheduled payments of principal, the risk that mortgages in the pool will be prepaid so that the holders of the class B certificates will have “call protection” (freedom from premature termination of their interests on account of prepayments). The trust thus serves to create investment interests with respect to the mortgages held by the trust that differ significantly from direct investment in
the mortgages. As a consequence, the existence of multiple classes of trust ownership is not incidental to any purpose of the trust to facilitate direct investment, and, accordingly, the trust is classified as a business entity under § 301.7701-2.

# Example 2.
Corporation M is the originator of a portfolio of residential mortgages and transfers the mortgages to a bank under a trust agreement. At the same time, the bank as trustee delivers to M certificates evidencing rights to payments from the pooled mortgages. The trustee holds legal title to the mortgages in the pool for the benefit of the certificate holders, but has no power to reinvest proceeds attributable to the mortgages in the pool or to vary investments in the pool in any other manner. There are two classes of certificates. Holders of class C certificates are entitled to receive 90 percent of the payments of principal and interest on the mortgages; class D certificate holders are entitled to receive the other ten percent. The two classes of certificates are identical except that, in the event of a default on the underlying mortgages, the payment rights of class D certificate holders are subordinated to the rights of class C certificate holders. M sells the class C certificates to investors and retains the class D certificates. The trust has multiple classes of ownership interests, given the greater security provided to holders of class C certificates. The interests of certificate holders, however, are substantially equivalent to undivided interests in the pool of mortgages, coupled with a limited recourse guarantee running from M to the holders of class C certificates. In such circumstances, the existence of multiple classes of ownership interests is incidental to the trust's purpose of facilitating direct investment in the assets of the trust. Accordingly, the trust is classified as a trust.

# Example 3.
A promoter forms a trust in which shareholders of a publicly traded corporation can deposit their stock. For each share of stock deposited with the trust, the participant receives two certificates that are initially attached, but may be separated and traded independently of each other. One certificate represents the right to dividends and the value of the underlying stock up to a specified amount; the other certificate represents the right to appreciation in the stock's value above the specified amount. The separate certificates represent two different classes of ownership interest in the trust, which effectively separate dividend rights on the stock held by the trust from a portion of the right to appreciation in the value of such stock. The multiple classes of ownership interests are designed to permit investors, by transferring one of the certificates and retaining the other, to fulfill their varying investment objectives of seeking primarily either dividend income or capital appreciation from the stock held by the trust. Given that the trust serves to create investment interests with respect to the stock held by the trust that differ significantly from direct investment in such stock, the trust is not formed to facilitate direct investment in the assets of the trust. Accordingly, the trust is classified as a business entity under § 301.7701-2.

# Example 4.
Corporation N purchases a portfolio of bonds and transfers the bonds to a bank under a trust agreement. At the same time, the trustee delivers to N certificates evidencing interests in the bonds. These certificates are sold to public investors. Each certificate represents the right to receive a particular payment with respect to a specific bond. Under section 1286, stripped coupons and stripped bonds are treated as separate bonds for federal income tax purposes. Although the interest of each certificate holder is different from that of each other certificate holder, and the trust thus has multiple classes of ownership, the multiple classes simply provide each certificate holder with a direct interest in what is treated under section 1286 as a separate bond. Given the similarity of the interests acquired by the certificate holders to the interests that could be acquired by direct investment, the multiple classes of trust interests merely facilitate direct investment in the assets held by the trust. Accordingly, the trust is classified as a trust.
(d)
Liquidating trusts.
Certain organizations which are commonly known as liquidating trusts are treated as trusts for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. An organization will be considered a liquidating trust if it is organized for the primary purpose of liquidating and distributing the assets transferred to it, and if its activities are all reasonably necessary to, and consistent with, the accomplishment of that purpose. A liquidating trust is treated as a trust for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code because it is formed with the objective of liquidating particular assets and not as an organization having as its purpose the carrying on of a profit-making business which normally would be conducted through business organizations classified as corporations or partnerships. However, if the liquidation is unreasonably prolonged or if the liquidation purpose becomes so obscured by business activities that the declared purpose of liquidation can be said to be lost or abandoned, the status of the organization will no longer be that of a
liquidating trust. Bondholders' protective committees, voting trusts, and other agencies formed to protect the interests of security holders during insolvency, bankruptcy, or corporate reorganization proceedings are analogous to liquidating trusts but if subsequently utilized to further the control or profitable operation of a going business on a permanent continuing basis, they will lose their classification as trusts for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
(e)
Environmental remediation trusts.
(1) An environmental remediation trust is considered a trust for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this paragraph (e), an organization is an environmental remediation trust if the organization is organized under state law as a trust; the primary purpose of the trust is collecting and disbursing amounts for environmental remediation of an existing waste site to resolve, satisfy, mitigate, address, or prevent the liability or potential liability of persons imposed by federal, state, or local environmental laws; all contributors to the trust have (at the time of contribution and thereafter) actual or potential liability or a reasonable expectation of liability under federal, state, or local environmental laws for environmental remediation of the waste site; and the trust is not a qualified settlement fund within the meaning of § 1.468B-1(a) of this chapter. An environmental remediation trust is classified as a trust because its primary purpose is environmental remediation of an existing waste site and not the carrying on of a profit-making business that normally would be conducted through business organizations classified as corporations or partnerships. However, if the remedial purpose is altered or becomes so obscured by business or investment activities that the declared remedial purpose is no longer controlling, the organization will no longer be classified as a trust. For purposes of this paragraph (e), environmental remediation includes the costs of assessing environmental conditions, remedying and removing environmental contamination, monitoring remedial activities and the release of substances, preventing future releases of substances, and collecting amounts from persons liable or potentially liable for the costs of these activities. For purposes of this paragraph (e), persons have potential liability or a reasonable expectation of liability under federal, state, or local environmental laws for remediation of the existing waste site if there is authority under a federal, state, or local law that requires or could reasonably be expected to require such persons to satisfy all or a portion of the costs of the environmental remediation.
(2) Each contributor (grantor) to the trust is treated as the owner of the portion of the trust contributed by that grantor under rules provided in section 677 and § 1.677(a)-1(d) of this chapter. Section 677 and § 1.677(a)-1(d) of this chapter provide rules regarding the treatment of a grantor as the owner of a portion of a trust applied in discharge of the grantor's legal obligation. Items of income, deduction, and credit attributable to an environmental remediation trust are not reported by the trust on Form 1041, but are shown on a separate statement to be attached to that form. See § 1.671-4(a) of this chapter. The trustee must also furnish to each grantor a statement that shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust for the grantor's taxable year attributable to the portion of the trust treated as owned by the grantor. The statement must provide the grantor with the information necessary to take the items into account in computing the grantor's taxable income, including information necessary to determine the federal tax treatment of the items (for example, whether an item is a deductible expense under section 162(a) or a capital expenditure under section 263(a)) and how the item should be taken into account under the economic performance rules of section 461(h) and the regulations thereunder. See § 1.461-4 of this chapter for rules relating to economic performance.
(3) All amounts contributed to an environmental remediation trust by a grantor (cash-out grantor) who, pursuant to an agreement with the other grantors, contributes a fixed amount to the trust and is relieved by the other grantors of any further obligation to make contributions to the trust, but
remains liable or potentially liable under the applicable environmental laws, will be considered amounts contributed for remediation. An environmental remediation trust agreement may direct the trustee to expend amounts contributed by a cash-out grantor (and the earnings thereon) before expending amounts contributed by other grantors (and the earnings thereon). A cash-out grantor will cease to be treated as an owner of a portion of the trust when the grantor's portion is fully expended by the trust.
(4) The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(a)
X, Y,
and
Z
are calendar year corporations that are liable for the remediation of an existing waste site under applicable federal environmental laws. On June 1, 1996, pursuant to an agreement with the governing federal agency,
X, Y,
and
Z
create an environmental remediation trust within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section to collect funds contributed to the trust by
X, Y,
and
Z
and to carry out the remediation of the waste site to the satisfaction of the federal agency.
X, Y,
and
Z
are jointly and severally liable under the federal environmental laws for the remediation of the waste site, and the federal agency will not release
X, Y,
or
Z
from liability until the waste site is remediated to the satisfaction of the agency.
(b) The estimated cost of the remediation is $20,000,000.
X, Y,
and
Z
agree that, if
Z
contributes $1,000,000 to the trust,
Z
will not be required to make any additional contributions to the trust, and
X
and
Y
will complete the remediation of the waste site and make additional contributions if necessary.
(c) On June 1, 1996,
X, Y,
and
Z
each contribute $1,000,000 to the trust. The trust agreement directs the trustee to spend
Z
's contributions to the trust and the income allocable to
Z
's portion before spending
X
's and
Y
's portions. On November 30, 1996, the trustee disburses $2,000,000 for remediation work performed from June 1, 1996, through September 30, 1996. For the six-month period ending November 30, 1996, the interest earned on the funds in the trust was $75,000, which is allocated in equal shares of $25,000 to
X
's,
Y
's, and
Z
's portions of the trust.
(d)
Z
made no further contributions to the trust. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee expended
Z
's portion of the trust before expending
X
's and
Y
's portion. Therefore,
Z
's share of the remediation disbursement made in 1996 is $1,025,000 ($1,000,000 contribution by
Z
plus $25,000 of interest allocated to
Z
's portion of the trust).
Z
takes the $1,025,000 disbursement into account under the appropriate federal tax accounting rules. In addition,
X
's share of the remediation disbursement made in 1996 is $487,500, and
Y
's share of the remediation disbursement made in 1996 is $487,500.
X
and
Y
take their respective shares of the disbursement into account under the appropriate federal tax accounting rules.
(e) The trustee made no further remediation disbursements in 1996, and
X
and
Y
made no further contributions in 1996. From December 1, 1996, to December 31, 1996, the interest earned on the funds remaining in the trust was $5,000, which is allocated $2,500 to
X
's portion and $2,500 to
Y
's portion. Accordingly, for 1996,
X
and
Y
each had interest income of $27,500 from the trust and
Z
had interest income of $25,000 from the trust.
(5) This paragraph (e) is applicable to trusts meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section that are formed on or after May 1, 1996. This paragraph (e) may be relied on by trusts formed before May 1, 1996, if the trust has at all times met all requirements of this paragraph (e) and the grantors have reported items of ,income and deduction consistent with this paragraph (e) on original or amended returns. For trusts formed before May 1, 1996, that are not described in the preceding sentence, the Commissioner may permit by letter ruling, in appropriate circumstances, this paragraph (e) to be applied subject to appropriate terms and conditions.
(f)
Effective date.
The rules of this section generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1960. Paragraph (e)(5) of this section contains rules of applicability for paragraph (e) of this section. In addition, the last sentences of paragraphs (b), (c)(1), and (c)(2)
Example 1
and
Example 3
of this section are effective as of January 1, 1997.

§ 301.7701-5
Domestic and foreign business entities.
(a)
Domestic and foreign business entities.
A business entity (including an entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner under § 301.7701-2(c)) is domestic if it is created or organized as any type of entity (including, but not limited to, a corporation, unincorporated association, general partnership, limited partnership, and limited
liability company) in the United States, or under the law of the United States or of any State. Accordingly, a business entity that is created or organized both in the United States and in a foreign jurisdiction is a domestic entity. A business entity (including an entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner under § 301.7701-2(c)) is foreign if it is not domestic. The determination of whether an entity is domestic or foreign is made independently from the determination of its corporate or non-corporate classification. See §§ 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3 for the rules governing the classification of entities.
(b)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
Y is an entity that is created or organized under the laws of Country A as a public limited company. It is also an entity that is organized as a limited liability company (LLC) under the laws of State B. Y is classified as a corporation for Federal tax purposes under the rules of §§ 301.7701-2, and 301.7701-3.
(ii)
Result.
Y is a domestic corporation because it is an entity that is classified as a corporation and it is organized as an entity under the laws of State B.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
P is an entity with more than one owner organized under the laws of Country A as an unlimited company. It is also an entity that is organized as a general partnership under the laws of State B. P is classified as a partnership for Federal tax purposes under the rules of §§ 301.7701-2, and 301.7701-3.
(ii)
Result.
P is a domestic partnership because it is an entity that is classified as a partnership and it is organized as an entity under the laws of State B.
(c)
Effective date
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the rules of this section apply as of August 12, 2004, to all business entities existing on or after that date.
(2)
Transition rule.
For business entities created or organized under the laws of more than one jurisdiction as of August 12, 2004, the rules of this section apply as of May 1, 2006. These entities, however, may rely on the rules of this section as of August 12, 2004.
[T.D. 9246, 71 FR 4817, Jan. 30, 2006]
§ 301.7701-6
Definitions; person, fiduciary.
(a)
Person.
The term
person
includes an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a trust or estate, a joint-stock company, an association, or a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization or group. The term also includes a guardian, committee, trustee, executor, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, conservator, or any person acting in a fiduciary capacity.
(b)
Fiduciary
—(1)
In general.
Fiduciary is a term that applies to persons who occupy positions of peculiar confidence toward others, such as trustees, executors, and administrators. A fiduciary is a person who holds in trust an estate to which another has a beneficial interest, or receives and controls income of another, as in the case of receivers. A committee or guardian of the property of an incompetent person is a fiduciary.
(2)
Fiduciary distinguished from agent.
There may be a fiduciary relationship between an agent and a principal, but the word agent does not denote a fiduciary. An agent having entire charge of property, with authority to effect and execute leases with tenants entirely on his own responsibility and without consulting his principal, merely turning over the net profits from the property periodically to his principal by virtue of authority conferred upon him by a power of attorney, is not a fiduciary within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. In cases when no legal trust has been created in the estate controlled by the agent and attorney, the liability to make a return rests with the principal.
(c)
Effective date.
The rules of this section are effective as of January 1, 1997.
[T.D. 8697, 61 FR 66593, Dec. 18, 1996]
§ 301.7701-7
Trusts—domestic and foreign.
(a)
In general.
(1) A trust is a United States person if—
(i) A court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust (court test); and
(ii) One or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust (control test).
(2) A trust is a United States person for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) on any day that the trust meets both the court test and the control test. For purposes of the regulations in this chapter, the term
domestic trust
means a trust that is a United States person. The term
foreign trust
means any trust other than a domestic trust.
(3) Except as otherwise provided in part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code, the taxable income of a foreign trust is computed in the same manner as the taxable income of a nonresident alien individual who is not present in the United States at any time. Section 641(b). Section 7701(b) is not applicable to trusts because it only applies to individuals. In addition, a foreign trust is not considered to be present in the United States at any time for purposes of section 871(a)(2), which deals with capital gains of nonresident aliens present in the United States for 183 days or more.
(b)
Applicable law.
The terms of the trust instrument and applicable law must be applied to determine whether the court test and the control test are met.
(c)
The court test
—(1)
Safe harbor.
A trust satisfies the court test if—
(i) The trust instrument does not direct that the trust be administered outside of the United States;
(ii) The trust in fact is administered exclusively in the United States; and
(iii) The trust is not subject to an automatic migration provision described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

# Example. A
creates a trust for the equal benefit of
A
's two children,
B
and
C.
The trust instrument provides that
DC,
a State
Y
corporation, is the trustee of the trust. State
Y
is a state within the United States.
DC
administers the trust exclusively in State
Y
and the trust instrument is silent as to where the trust is to be administered. The trust is not subject to an automatic migration provision described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The trust satisfies the safe harbor of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the court test.
(3)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:
(i)
Court.
The term
court
includes any federal, state, or local court.
(ii)
The United States.
The term
the United States
is used in this section in a geographical sense. Thus, for purposes of the court test, the United States includes only the States and the District of Columbia. See section 7701(a)(9). Accordingly, a court within a territory or possession of the United States or within a foreign country is not a court within the United States.
(iii)
Is able to exercise.
The term
is able to exercise
means that a court has or would have the authority under applicable law to render orders or judgments resolving issues concerning administration of the trust.
(iv)
Primary supervision.
The term
primary supervision
means that a court has or would have the authority to determine substantially all issues regarding the administration of the entire trust. A court may have primary supervision under this paragraph (c)(3)(iv) notwithstanding the fact that another court has jurisdiction over a trustee, a beneficiary, or trust property.
(v)
Administration.
The term
administration
of the trust means the carrying out of the duties imposed by the terms of the trust instrument and applicable law, including maintaining the books and records of the trust, filing tax returns, managing and investing the assets of the trust, defending the trust from suits by creditors, and determining the amount and timing of distributions.
(4)
Situations that cause a trust to satisfy or fail to satisfy the court test.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (A) through (D) of this section set forth some specific situations in which a trust satisfies the court test. The four situations described are not intended to be an exclusive list.
(A)
Uniform Probate Code.
A trust meets the court test if the trust is registered by an authorized fiduciary or fiduciaries of the trust in a court within the United States pursuant to a state
statute that has provisions substantially similar to Article VII,
Trust Administration,
of the Uniform Probate Code, 8 Uniform Laws Annotated 1 (West Supp. 1998), available from the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, 676 North St. Clair Street, Suite 1700, Chicago, Illinois 60611.
(B)
Testamentary trust.
In the case of a trust created pursuant to the terms of a will probated within the United States (other than an ancillary probate), if all fiduciaries of the trust have been qualified as trustees of the trust by a court within the United States, the trust meets the court test.
(C)
Inter vivos trust.
In the case of a trust other than a testamentary trust, if the fiduciaries and/or beneficiaries take steps with a court within the United States that cause the administration of the trust to be subject to the primary supervision of the court, the trust meets the court test.
(D)
A United States court and a foreign court are able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust.
If both a United States court and a foreign court are able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust, the trust meets the court test.
(ii)
Automatic migration provisions.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, a court within the United States is not considered to have primary supervision over the administration of the trust if the trust instrument provides that a United States court's attempt to assert jurisdiction or otherwise supervise the administration of the trust directly or indirectly would cause the trust to migrate from the United States. However, this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) will not apply if the trust instrument provides that the trust will migrate from the United States only in the case of foreign invasion of the United States or widespread confiscation or nationalization of property in the United States.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1. A,
a United States citizen, creates a trust for the equal benefit of
A
's two children, both of whom are United States citizens. The trust instrument provides that
DC,
a domestic corporation, is to act as trustee of the trust and that the trust is to be administered in Country
X,
a foreign country.
DC
maintains a branch office in Country
X
with personnel authorized to act as trustees in Country
X.
The trust instrument provides that the law of State
Y,
a state within the United States, is to govern the interpretation of the trust. Under the law of Country
X,
a court within Country
X
is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust. Pursuant to the trust instrument, the Country
X
court applies the law of State
Y
to the trust. Under the terms of the trust instrument the trust is administered in Country
X.
No court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust. The trust fails to satisfy the court test and therefore is a foreign trust.

# Example 2. A,
a United States citizen, creates a trust for
A
's own benefit and the benefit of
A
's spouse,
B,
a United States citizen. The trust instrument provides that the trust is to be administered in State
Y,
a state within the United States, by
DC,
a State
Y
corporation. The trust instrument further provides that in the event that a creditor sues the trustee in a United States court, the trust will automatically migrate from State
Y
to Country
Z,
a foreign country, so that no United States court will have jurisdiction over the trust. A court within the United States is not able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust because the United States court's jurisdiction over the administration of the trust is automatically terminated in the event the court attempts to assert jurisdiction. Therefore, the trust fails to satisfy the court test from the time of its creation and is a foreign trust.
(d)
Control test
—(1)
Definitions
—(i)
United States person.
The term
United States person
means a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30). For example, a domestic corporation is a United States person, regardless of whether its shareholders are United States persons.
(ii)
Substantial decisions.
The term
substantial decisions
means those decisions that persons are authorized or required to make under the terms of the trust instrument and applicable law and that are not ministerial. Decisions that are ministerial include decisions regarding details such as the bookkeeping, the collection of rents, and the execution of investment decisions. Substantial decisions include, but are not limited to, decisions concerning—
(A) Whether and when to distribute income or corpus;
(B) The amount of any distributions;
(C) The selection of a beneficiary;
(D) Whether a receipt is allocable to income or principal;
(E) Whether to terminate the trust;
(F) Whether to compromise, arbitrate, or abandon claims of the trust;
(G) Whether to sue on behalf of the trust or to defend suits against the trust;
(H) Whether to remove, add, or replace a trustee;
(I) Whether to appoint a successor trustee to succeed a trustee who has died, resigned, or otherwise ceased to act as a trustee, even if the power to make such a decision is not accompanied by an unrestricted power to remove a trustee, unless the power to make such a decision is limited such that it cannot be exercised in a manner that would change the trust's residency from foreign to domestic, or vice versa; and
(J) Investment decisions; however, if a United States person under section 7701(a)(30) hires an investment advisor for the trust, investment decisions made by the investment advisor will be considered substantial decisions controlled by the United States person if the United States person can terminate the investment advisor's power to make investment decisions at will.
(iii)
Control.
The term
control
means having the power, by vote or otherwise, to make all of the substantial decisions of the trust, with no other person having the power to veto any of the substantial decisions. To determine whether United States persons have control, it is necessary to consider all persons who have authority to make a substantial decision of the trust, not only the trust fiduciaries.
(iv)
Safe harbor for certain employee benefit trusts and investment trusts.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), the trusts listed in this paragraph (d)(1)(iv) are deemed to satisfy the control test set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, provided that United States trustees control all of the substantial decisions made by the trustees of the trust—
(A) A qualified trust described in section 401(a);
(B) A trust described in section 457(g);
(C) A trust that is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a);
(D) A trust that is an individual retirement account described in section 408(k) or 408(p);
(E) A trust that is a Roth IRA described in section 408A;
(F) A trust that is an education individual retirement account described in section 530;
(G) A trust that is a voluntary employees' beneficiary association described in section 501(c)(9);
(H) A group trust described in Rev. Rul. 81-100 (1981-1 C.B. 326) (
See
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter);
(I) An investment trust classified as a trust under § 301.7701-4(c), provided that the following conditions are satisfied—
(
1
) All trustees are United States persons and at least one of the trustees is a bank, as defined in section 581, or a United States Government-owned agency or United States Government-sponsored enterprise;
(
2
) All sponsors (persons who exchange investment assets for beneficial interests with a view to selling the beneficial interests) are United States persons; and
(
3
) The beneficial interests are widely offered for sale primarily in the United States to United States persons;
(J) Such additional categories of trusts as the Commissioner may designate in revenue procedures, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
)).
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section:

# Example 1.
Trust is a testamentary trust with three fiduciaries,
A, B,
and
C. A
and
B
are United States citizens, and
C
is a nonresident alien. No persons except the fiduciaries have authority to make any decisions of the trust. The trust instrument provides that no substantial decisions of the trust can be made unless there is unanimity among the fiduciaries. The control test is not satisfied because United States persons do not control all the substantial decisions of the trust. No substantial decisions can be made without
C
's agreement.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the trust instrument provides that all substantial decisions of the trust are to be decided by a majority vote among the fiduciaries. The control test is satisfied because a majority of the fiduciaries are United States persons and therefore United States persons control all the substantial decisions of the trust.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2,
except that the trust instrument directs that
C
is to make all of the trust's investment decisions, but that
A
and
B
may veto
C
's investment decisions.
A
and
B
cannot act to make the investment decisions on their own. The control test is not satisfied because the United States persons,
A
and
B,
do not have the power to make all of the substantial decisions of the trust.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except
A
and
B
may accept or veto
C
's investment decisions and can make investments that
C
has not recommended. The control test is satisfied because the United States persons control all substantial decisions of the trust.

# Example 5. X,
a foreign corporation, conducts business in the United States through various branch operations.
X
has United States employees and has established a trust as part of a qualified employee benefit plan under section 401(a) for these employees. The trust is established under the laws of State
A,
and the trustee of the trust is
B,
a United States bank governed by the laws of State
A. B
holds legal title to the trust assets for the benefit of the trust beneficiaries. A plan committee makes decisions with respect to the plan and the trust. The plan committee can direct
B
's actions with regard to those decisions and under the governing documents
B
is not liable for those decisions. Members of the plan committee consist of United States persons and nonresident aliens, but nonresident aliens make up a majority of the plan committee. Decisions of the plan committee are made by majority vote. In addition,
X
retains the power to terminate the trust and to replace the United States trustee or to appoint additional trustees. This trust is deemed to satisfy the control test under paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section because
B,
a United States person, is the trust's only trustee. Any powers held by the plan committee or
X
are not considered under the safe harbor of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. In the event that
X
appoints additional trustees including foreign trustees, any powers held by such trustees must be considered in determining whether United States trustees control all substantial decisions made by the trustees of the trust.
(2)
Replacement of any person who had authority to make a substantial decision of the trust
—(i)
Replacement within 12 months.
In the event of an inadvertent change in any person that has the power to make a substantial decision of the trust that would cause the domestic or foreign residency of the trust to change, the trust is allowed 12 months from the date of the change to make necessary changes either with respect to the persons who control the substantial decisions or with respect to the residence of such persons to avoid a change in the trust's residency. For purposes of this section, an inadvertent change means the death, incapacity, resignation, change in residency or other change with respect to a person that has a power to make a substantial decision of the trust that would cause a change to the residency of the trust but that was not intended to change the residency of the trust. If the necessary change is made within 12 months, the trust is treated as retaining its pre-change residency during the 12-month period. If the necessary change is not made within 12 months, the trust's residency changes as of the date of the inadvertent change.
(ii)
Request for extension of time.
If reasonable actions have been taken to make the necessary change to prevent a change in trust residency, but due to circumstances beyond the trust's control the trust is unable to make the modification within 12 months, the trust may provide a written statement to the district director having jurisdiction over the trust's return setting forth the reasons for failing to make the necessary change within the required time period. If the district director determines that the failure was due to reasonable cause, the district director may grant the trust an extension of time to make the necessary change. Whether an extension of time is granted is in the sole discretion of the district director and, if granted, may contain such terms with respect to assessment as may be necessary to ensure that the correct amount of tax will be collected from the trust, its owners, and its beneficiaries. If the district director does not grant an extension, the trust's residency changes as of the date of the inadvertent change.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:

# Example 1.
A trust that satisfies the court test has three fiduciaries,
A, B,
and
C. A
and
B
are United States citizens and
C
is a nonresident alien. All decisions of the trust are made by majority vote of the fiduciaries. The trust instrument provides that upon the death or resignation of any of the fiduciaries,
D,
is the successor fiduciary.
A
dies and
D
automatically becomes a fiduciary of the trust. When
D
becomes a fiduciary of the trust,
D
is a nonresident alien. Two months after
A
dies,
B
replaces
D
with
E,
a United States person. Because
D
was replaced with
E
within 12 months after the date of
A
's death, during the period after
A
's death and before
E
begins to serve, the trust satisfies the control test and remains a domestic trust.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that at the end of the 12-month period after
A
's death,
D
has not been replaced and remains a fiduciary of the trust. The trust becomes a foreign trust on the date
A
died unless the district director grants an extension of the time period to make the necessary change.
(3)
Automatic migration provisions.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, United States persons are not considered to control all substantial decisions of the trust if an attempt by any governmental agency or creditor to collect information from or assert a claim against the trust would cause one or more substantial decisions of the trust to no longer be controlled by United States persons.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d):

# Example 1. A,
a nonresident alien individual, is the grantor and, during
A
's lifetime, the sole beneficiary of a trust that qualifies as an individual retirement account (IRA).
A
has the exclusive power to make decisions regarding withdrawals from the IRA and to direct its investments. The IRA's sole trustee is a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30). The control test is satisfied with respect to this trust because the special rule of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section applies.

# Example 2. A,
a nonresident alien individual, is the grantor of a trust and has the power to revoke the trust, in whole or in part, and revest assets in
A. A
is treated as the owner of the trust under sections 672(f) and 676.
A
is not a fiduciary of the trust. The trust has one trustee,
B,
a United States person, and the trust has one beneficiary,
C. B
has the discretion to distribute corpus or income to
C.
In this case, decisions exercisable by
A
to have trust assets distributed to
A
are substantial decisions. Therefore, the trust is a foreign trust because
B
does not control all substantial decisions of the trust.

# Example 3.
A trust, Trust T, has two fiduciaries,
A
and
B.
Both
A
and
B
are United States persons.
A
and
B
hire
C,
an investment advisor who is a foreign person, and may terminate
C
's employment at will. The investment advisor makes the investment decisions for the trust.
A
and
B
control all other decisions of the trust. Although
C
has the power to make investment decisions,
A
and
B
are treated as controlling these decisions. Therefore, the control test is satisfied.

# Example 4. G,
a United States citizen, creates a trust. The trust provides for income to
A
and
B
for life, remainder to
A
's and
B
's descendants.
A
is a nonresident alien and
B
is a United States person. The trustee of the trust is a United States person. The trust instrument authorizes
A
to replace the trustee. The power to replace the trustee is a substantial decision. Because
A,
a nonresident alien, controls a substantial decision, the control test is not satisfied.
(e)
Effective date
—(1)
General rule.
Except for the election to remain a domestic trust provided in paragraph (f) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, this section is applicable to taxable years ending after February 2, 1999. This section may be relied on by trusts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996, and also may be relied on by trusts whose trustees have elected to apply sections 7701(a)(30) and (31) to the trusts for taxable years ending after August 20, 1996, under section 1907(a)(3)(B) of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, (the SBJP Act) Public Law 104-188, 110 Stat. 1755 (26 U.S.C. 7701 note).
(2)
Trusts created after August 19, 1996.
If a trust is created after August 19, 1996, and before April 5, 1999, and the trust satisfies the control test set forth in the regulations project REG-251703-96 published under section 7701(a)(30) and (31) (1997-1 C.B. 795) (See § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), but does not satisfy the control test set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, the trust may be modified to satisfy the control test of paragraph (d) by December 31, 1999. If the modification is completed by December 31, 1999, the trust will be treated as satisfying the control test of paragraph (d) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996, (and for taxable years ending after August 20, 1996, if the election under section
1907(a)(3)(B) of the SBJP Act has been made for the trust).
(3)
Effective date of safe harbor for certain employee benefit trusts and investment trusts.
Paragraphs (d)(1)(iv) and (v)
Examples 1
and
5
of this section apply to trusts for taxable years ending on or after August 9, 2001. Paragraphs (d)(1)(iv) and (v)
Examples 1
and
5
of this section may be relied on by trusts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996, and also may be relied on by trusts whose trustees have elected to apply sections 7701(a)(30) and (31) to the trusts for taxable years ending after August 20, 1996, under section 1907(a)(3)(B) of the SBJP Act.
(f)
Election to remain a domestic trust
—(1)
Trusts eligible to make the election to remain domestic.
A trust that was in existence on August 20, 1996, and that was treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, may elect to continue treatment as a domestic trust notwithstanding section 7701(a)(30)(E). This election is not available to a trust that was wholly-owned by its grantor under subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1, of the Code on August 20, 1996. The election is available to a trust if only a portion of the trust was treated as owned by the grantor under subpart E on August 20, 1996. If a partially-owned grantor trust makes the election, the election is effective for the entire trust. Also, a trust may not make the election if the trust has made an election pursuant to section 1907(a)(3)(B) of the SBJP Act to apply the new trust criteria to the first taxable year of the trust ending after August 20, 1996, because that election, once made, is irrevocable.
(2)
Determining whether a trust was treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996
—(i)
Trusts filing Form 1041 for the taxable year that includes August 19, 1996.
For purposes of the election, a trust is considered to have been treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, if: the trustee filed a Form 1041, “U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts,” for the trust for the period that includes August 19, 1996 (and did not file a Form 1040NR, “U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return,” for that year); and the trust had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) under section 7701(a)(30) prior to amendment by the SBJP Act (prior law) for reporting as a domestic trust for that period.
(ii)
Trusts not filing a Form 1041.
Some domestic trusts are not required to file Form 1041. For example, certain group trusts described in Rev. Rul. 81-100 (1981-1 C.B. 326) (See § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) consisting of trusts that are parts of qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts are not required to file Form 1041. Also, a domestic trust whose gross income for the taxable year is less than the amount required for filing an income tax return and that has no taxable income is not required to file a Form 1041. Section 6012(a)(4). For purposes of the election, a trust that filed neither a Form 1041 nor a Form 1040NR for the period that includes August 19, 1996, will be considered to have been treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, if the trust had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) under prior law for being treated as a domestic trust for that period and for filing neither a Form 1041 nor a Form 1040NR for that period.
(3)
Procedure for making the election to remain domestic
—(i)
Required Statement.
To make the election, a statement must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in the manner and time described in this section. The statement must be entitled “Election to Remain a Domestic Trust under Section 1161 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,” be signed under penalties of perjury by at least one trustee of the trust, and contain the following information—
(A) A statement that the trust is electing to continue to be treated as a domestic trust under section 1161 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997;
(B) A statement that the trustee had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) under prior law for treating the trust as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996. (The trustee need not explain the reasonable basis on the election statement.);
(C) A statement either that the trust filed a Form 1041 treating the trust as a domestic trust for the period that includes August 19, 1996, (and that the trust did not file a Form 1040NR for
that period), or that the trust was not required to file a Form 1041 or a Form 1040NR for the period that includes August 19, 1996, with an accompanying brief explanation as to why a Form 1041 was not required to be filed; and
(D) The name, address, and employer identification number of the trust.
(ii)
Filing the required statement with the Internal Revenue Service.
(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(E) through (G) of this section, the trust must attach the statement to a Form 1041. The statement may be attached to either the Form 1041 that is filed for the first taxable year of the trust beginning after December 31, 1996 (1997 taxable year), or to the Form 1041 filed for the first taxable year of the trust beginning after December 31, 1997 (1998 taxable year). The statement, however, must be filed no later than the due date for filing a Form 1041 for the 1998 taxable year, plus extensions. The election will be effective for the 1997 taxable year, and thereafter, until revoked or terminated. If the trust filed a Form 1041 for the 1997 taxable year without the statement attached, the statement should be attached to the Form 1041 filed for the 1998 taxable year.
(B) If the trust has insufficient gross income and no taxable income for its 1997 or 1998 taxable year, or both, and therefore is not required to file a Form 1041 for either or both years, the trust must make the election by filing a Form 1041 for either the 1997 or 1998 taxable year with the statement attached (even though not otherwise required to file a Form 1041 for that year). The trust should only provide on the Form 1041 the trust's name, name and title of fiduciary, address, employer identification number, date created, and type of entity. The statement must be attached to a Form 1041 that is filed no later than October 15, 1999.
(C) If the trust files a Form 1040NR for the 1997 taxable year based on application of new section 7701(a)(30)(E) to the trust, and satisfies paragraph (f)(1) of this section, in order for the trust to make the election the trust must file an amended Form 1040NR return for the 1997 taxable year. The trust must note on the amended Form 1040NR that it is making an election under section 1161 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The trust must attach to the amended Form 1040NR the statement required by paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section and a completed Form 1041 for the 1997 taxable year. The items of income, deduction and credit of the trust must be excluded from the amended Form 1040NR and reported on the Form 1041. The amended Form 1040NR for the 1997 taxable year, with the statement and the Form 1041 attached, must be filed with the Philadelphia Service Center no later than the due date, plus extensions, for filing a Form 1041 for the 1998 taxable year.
(D) If a trust has made estimated tax payments as a foreign trust based on application of section 7701(a)(30)(E) to the trust, but has not yet filed a Form 1040NR for the 1997 taxable year, when the trust files its Form 1041 for the 1997 taxable year it must note on its Form 1041 that it made estimated tax payments based on treatment as a foreign trust. The Form 1041 must be filed with the Philadelphia Service Center (and not with the service center where the trust ordinarily would file its Form 1041).
(E) If a trust forms part of a qualified stock bonus, pension, or profit sharing plan, the election provided by this paragraph (f) must be made by attaching the statement to the plan's annual return required under section 6058 (information return) for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1996, or to the plan's information return for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1997. The statement must be attached to the plan's information return that is filed no later than the due date for filing the plan's information return for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1997, plus extensions. The election will be effective for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1996, and thereafter, until revoked or terminated.
(F) Any other type of trust that is not required to file a Form 1041 for the taxable year, but that is required to file an information return (for example, Form 5227) for the 1997 or 1998 taxable year must attach the statement to the trust's information return for the 1997 or 1998 taxable year. However, the statement must be attached to an information return that is filed no later
than the due date for filing the trust's information return for the 1998 taxable year, plus extensions. The election will be effective for the 1997 taxable year, and thereafter, until revoked or terminated.
(G) A group trust described in Rev. Rul. 81-100 consisting of trusts that are parts of qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts (and any other trust that is not described above and that is not required to file a Form 1041 or an information return) need not attach the statement to any return and should file the statement with the Philadelphia Service Center. The trust must make the election provided by this paragraph (f) by filing the statement by October 15, 1999. The election will be effective for the 1997 taxable year, and thereafter, until revoked or terminated.
(iii)
Failure to file the statement in the required manner and time.
If a trust fails to file the statement in the manner or time provided in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, the trustee may provide a written statement to the district director having jurisdiction over the trust setting forth the reasons for failing to file the statement in the required manner or time. If the district director determines that the failure to file the statement in the required manner or time was due to reasonable cause, the district director may grant the trust an extension of time to file the statement. Whether an extension of time is granted shall be in the sole discretion of the district director. However, the relief provided by this paragraph (f)(3)(iii) is not ordinarily available if the statute of limitations for the trust's 1997 taxable year has expired. Additionally, if the district director grants an extension of time, it may contain terms with respect to assessment as may be necessary to ensure that the correct amount of tax will be collected from the trust, its owners, and its beneficiaries.
(4)
Revocation or termination of the election
—(i)
Revocation of election.
The election provided by this paragraph (f) to be treated as a domestic trust may only be revoked with the consent of the Commissioner. See sections 684, 6048, and 6677 for the federal tax consequences and reporting requirements related to the change in trust residence.
(ii)
Termination of the election.
An election under this paragraph (f) to remain a domestic trust terminates if changes are made to the trust subsequent to the effective date of the election that result in the trust no longer having any reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) for being treated as a domestic trust under section 7701(a)(30) prior to its amendment by the SBJP Act. The termination of the election will result in the trust changing its residency from a domestic trust to a foreign trust on the effective date of the termination of the election. See sections 684, 6048, and 6677 for the federal tax consequences and reporting requirements related to the change in trust residence.
(5)
Effective date.
This paragraph (f) is applicable beginning on February 2, 1999.
[T.D. 8813, 64 FR 4970, Feb. 2, 1999, as amended by T.D. 8962, 66 FR 41779, Aug. 9, 2001]
§ 301.7701-8
Military or naval forces and Armed Forces of the United States.
The term “military or naval forces of the United States” and the term “Armed Forces of the United States” each includes all regular and reserve components of the uniformed services which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, or the Secretary of the Air Force. The terms also include the Coast Guard. The members of such forces include commissioned officers and the personnel below the grade of commissioned officer in such forces.
§ 301.7701-9
Secretary or his delegate.
(a) The term
Secretary or his delegate
means the Secretary of the Treasury, or any officer, employee, or agency of the Treasury Department duly authorized by the Secretary (directly, or indirectly by one or more redelegations of authority) to perform the function mentioned or described in the context, and the term “or his delegate” when used in connection with any other official of the United States shall be similarly construed.
(b) In any case in which a function is vested by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or any other statute in the Secretary or his delegate, and Treasury regulations or Treasury decisions approved by the Secretary or his delegate provide that such function may be performed by the Commissioner, assistant commissioner, regional commissioner, assistant regional commissioner, district director, director of a regional service center, or by a designated officer or employee in the office of any such officer, such provision in the regulations or Treasury decision shall constitute a delegation by the Secretary of the authority to perform such function to the designated officer or employee. If such authority is delegated to any officer or employee performing services under the supervision and control of the Commissioner, such provision in the regulations or Treasury decision shall constitute a delegation by the Secretary to the Commissioner of the authority to perform such function and a redelegation thereof by the Commissioner to the designated officer or employee.
(c) An officer or employee, including the Commissioner, authorized by regulations or Treasury decision to perform a function shall have authority to redelegate the performance of such function to any officer or employee performing services under his supervision and control, unless such power to so redelegate is prohibited or restricted by proper order or directive. The Commissioner may also redelegate authority to perform such function to other officers or employees under his supervision and control and, to the extent he deems proper, may authorize further redelegation of such authority.
(d) The Commissioner may prescribe such limitations as he deems proper on the extent to which any officer or employee under his supervision and control shall perform any such function, but, in the case of an officer or employee designated in regulations or Treasury decision as authorized to perform such function, such limitations shall not render invalid any performance by such officer or employee of the function which, except for such limitations, such officer or employee is authorized to perform by such regulations or Treasury decision in effect at the time the function is performed.

For purposes of this chapter, the term
social security number
means the taxpayer identifying number of an individual or estate which is assigned pursuant to section 6011(b) or corresponding provisions of prior law, or pursuant to section 6109, and in which nine digits are separated by hyphens as follows: 000-00-0000. Such term does not include a number with a letter as a suffix which is used to identify an auxiliary beneficiary under the social security program. The terms “account number” and “social security number” refer to the same number.

[T.D. 7306, 39 FR 9947, Mar. 15, 1974]
§ 301.7701-13
Pre-1970 domestic building and loan association.
(a)
In general.
For taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, and before July 12, 1969, the term “domestic building and loan association” means a domestic building and loan association,
a domestic savings and loan association, a Federal savings and loan association, and any other savings institution chartered and supervised as a savings and loan or similar association under Federal or State law which meets supervisory test (described in paragraph (b) of this section), the business operations test (described in paragraph (c) of this section), and each of the various assets tests (described in paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this section). For the definition of the term “domestic building and loan association”, for taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, see § 301.7701-13A.
(b)
Supervisory test.
A domestic building and loan association must be either (1) an insured institution within the meaning of section 401(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1724 (a)) or (2) subject by law to supervision and examination by State or Federal authority having supervision over such associations. An “insured institution” is one the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
(c)
Business operations test
—(1)
In general.
An association must utilize its assets so that substantially all of its business consists of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the loans described in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section. The requirement of this paragraph is referred to in this section as the business operations test. The business of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the prescribed loans includes ancillary or incidental activities which are directly and primarily related to such acquisition and investment, such as advertising for savings, appraising property on which loans are to be made by the association, and inspecting the progress of construction in connection with construction loans. Even though an association meets the supervisory test in paragraph (b) and all the assets tests described in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section, it will nevertheless not qualify as a domestic building and loan association if any substantial part of its business consists of activities which are not directly and primarily related to such acquisition and investment, such as brokering mortgage paper, selling insurance, or subdividing real estate. However, an association will meet the business operations test for a taxable year if it meets the requirements of both subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (c), relating respectively to acquiring the savings of the public, and investing in loans.
(2)
Acquiring the savings of the public.
The requirement that substantially all of an association's business (other than investing in loans) must consist of acquiring the savings of the public ordinarily will be considered to be met if savings are acquired in all material respects in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or substantially equivalent rules of a State law or supervisory authority. In addition, such requirement will be considered to be met if more than 85 percent of the dollar amount of the total deposits and withdrawable shares of the association are held during the taxable year by the general public as opposed to amounts deposited by family or related business groups or persons who are officers or directors of the association. The percentage specified in this subparagraph shall be computed as of the close of the taxable year, or at the option of the taxpayer, on the basis of the average of the amounts of deposits held during the year. Such average shall be determined by computing the percentage specified either as of the close of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual percentages obtained.
(3)
Investing in loans
—(i)
In general.
The requirement that substantially all of an association's business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) must consist of investing in the loans described in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section ordinarily will be considered to be met for a taxable year if the association meets both the gross income test described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, and the sales activity test described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. However, if an association does not meet the requirements of both subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, it will nevertheless meet
the investing in loans requirement if it is able to demonstrate that substantially all its business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) consisted of investing in the prescribed loans. Transactions which are necessitated by exceptional circumstances and which are not undertaken as recurring business activities for profit will not be considered a substantial part of an association's business. Thus, for example, an association would meet the investing in loans requirement if it can establish that it failed to meet the gross income test because of receipt of a non-recurring item of income due to exceptional circumstances, or it failed to meet the sales activity test because of sales made to achieve necessary liquidity to meet abnormal withdrawals from savings accounts. For the purposes of this subparagraph, however, the acquisition of loans in anticipation of their sale to other financial institutions does not constitute “investing” in loans, even though such acquisition and sale resulted from an excess of demand for loans over savings capital in the association's area.
(ii)
Gross income test.
The gross income test is met if more than 85 percent of the gross income of an association consists of:
(
a
) Interest or dividends on assets defined in subparagraph (2), (3), or (4) of paragraph (d) of this section,
(
b
) Interest on loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section,
(
c
) Income attributable to the portion of property used in the association's business as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section,
(
d
) Premiums, discounts, commissions, or fees (including late charges and penalties) on loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section which have at some time been held by the association, or for which firm commitments have been issued,
(
e
) Gain or loss on the sale of governmental obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, or
(
f
) Income, gain, or loss attributable to foreclosed property (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section), but not including such income, gain, or loss which, pursuant to section 595 and the regulations thereunder, is not included in gross income.
For the purposes of this subparagraph, gross income shall be computed without regard to gains or losses on the sale of the portion of property used in the association's business (described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section), without regard to gains or losses on the rented portion of property used as the principal or branch office of the association (described in such paragraph), and without regard to gains or losses on the sale of participations and loans (other than governmental obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section). Examples of types of income which would cause an association to fail to meet the gross income test, if in the aggregate they exceed 15 percent of gross income, are the excess of gains over losses on sale of real estate (other than foreclosed property); rental income (other than on foreclosed property and the portion of property used in the association's business); premiums, commissions, and fees (other than commitment fees) on loans which have never been held by the association; and insurance brokerage fees.
(iii)
Sales activity test: in general.
The sales activity test is met for a taxable year if the association meets both the sales of whole loans test described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, and the sales of whole loans and participations test described in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph. For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions (iv), (v), and (vi) of this subparagraph:
(
a
) The term
loan
means loan as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, other than foreclosed property defined in such paragraph and governmental obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(
b
) The amount of a loan shall be determined in accordance with the rules contained in paragraph (l) (1) and (2)(ii) of this section.
(
c
) The term
loans acquired for investment during the taxable year
means the amount of loans outstanding as of the close of the taxable year, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of loans outstanding as of the beginning of such year, and increased by the lesser of (
1
) the amount of repayments made on
loans during the taxable year or (
2
) an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of loans outstanding as of the beginning of the taxable year. For this purpose, repayments do not include repayments on loans to the extent such loans are refinanced by the association.
(
d
) The term
sales of participations
means sales by an association of interests in loans, which sales meet the requirements of the regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board relating to sales of participations, or which meet substantially equivalent requirements of State law or regulations relating to sales of participations.
(
e
) The term
sales of whole loans
means sales of loans other than sales of participations as defined in subdivision (
d
) of this subdivision, but in determining the amount of sales of whole loans, the following sales shall be disregarded: Sales of loans made to other financial institutions pursuant to an arrangement whereunder the association simultaneously enters in a bona fide agreement to repurchase such loans within a period of 18 months from the time of sale if such arrangement conforms to the rules and regulations of applicable supervisory authorities; sales made to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or to a corporation defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section (relating to deposit insurance company securities); and sales made in the course of liquidation of the association pursuant to Federal or State law.
(iv)
Sales of whole loans test.
The sales of whole loans test is met for a taxable year if the amount of sales of whole loans during the taxable year does not exceed the greater of (
a
) 15 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment during the taxable year, or (
b
) 20 percent of the amount of loans outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year. However, the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in subdivision (
b
) of the previous sentence shall be reduced by the number of percentage points (rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a percentage point) which is equal to the sum of the 2 percentages obtained by dividing, for each of the 2 preceding taxable years, the amount of sales of whole loans during each such taxable year by the amount of loans outstanding at the beginning of such taxable year. For example, if the amounts of sales of whole loans made by a calendar year association in 1965 and 1966 were 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, of loans outstanding at the beginning of each such year, the amount of sales of whole loans allowed under such subdivision (
b
) for 1967 would be an amount equal to 13 percent (20 percent minus 7 percentage points) of loans outstanding at the beginning of 1967. In computing the reduction to the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in such subdivision (
b),
sales of whole loans made before January 1, 1964, shall not be taken into account.
(v)
Sales of whole loans and participations test.
The sales of whole loans and participations test is met if the sum of the amount of sales of whole loans and the amount of sales of participations during the taxable year does not exceed 100 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment during the taxable year.
(vi)
Sales activity tests: special rules
—(
a
)
Carryover of sales.
The amount specified in subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph as the maximum amount of sales of whole loans shall be increased by the amount by which 15 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment by the association during the 2 preceding taxable years exceeds the amount of sales of whole loans made during such preceding taxable years; and the amount specified in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph as the maximum amount of sales of whole loans and participations shall be increased by the amount by which the amount of loans acquired for investment by the association during the 2 preceding taxable years exceeds the sum of the amount of sales of whole loans and participations made during such preceding taxable years. For example, if 15 percent of the amount of loans acquired for investment in 1965 and 1966 exceeded the amount of sales of whole loans during such years by $250,000, the amount of sales of whole loans permitted in 1967 under subdivision (iv)(
a
) of this subparagraph would be increased by $250,000.
(
b
)
Use of preceding year's base.
If the amount of loans acquired for investment by the association during the preceding taxable year exceeds such amount for the current taxable year, the 15 percent limitation provided in subdivision (iv)(
a
) of this subparagraph and the 100 percent limitation provided in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph shall be based upon such preceding taxable year's amount. However, the maximum amount of sales of whole loans permitted under subdivision (iv)(
a
) and the maximum amount of sales of whole loans and participations permitted under subdivision (v) in any taxable year shall be reduced by the amount of the increase in such sales allowed for the preceding taxable year solely by reason of the application of the provisions of the previous sentence. For example, assuming no carryover of sales under subdivision (
a
) of this subdivision, if the amount of loans acquired for investment by a calendar year association was $1,000,000 in 1965, under subdivision (iv)(
a
) of this subparagraph the association could make sales of whole loans in 1966 of $150,000 (15 percent of $1,000,000) even though the amount of its loans acquired for investment during 1966 was only $800,000. However, the amount of sales of whole loans permitted in 1967 under subdivision (iv)(
a
) of this subparagraph would be reduced to the extent that the amount of the sales of whole loans made by the association during 1966 exceeded $120,000 (15 percent of $800,000).
(vii)
Examples illustrating sales activity test.
The provisions of subdivisions (iii) through (vi) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that the association is a calendar year taxpayer which is operated in all material respects in conformity with applicable rules and regulations of Federal or State supervisory authorities.

# Example 1.
X Association made sales of whole loans in 1964 and 1965 which were 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of the amounts of loans outstanding at the beginning of each such year, and which were 25 percent and 17 percent, respectively, of the amounts of loans acquired for investment in each such year. The amount of X's loans outstanding at the beginning of 1966 was $1 million, and the amount of its loans acquired for investment for such year was $300,000. The maximum amount of sales of whole loans which X may make under the percentage of beginning loans limitation for 1966 is $30,000, which is 3 percent (20 percent reduced by the sum of 10 percent and 7 percent) of $1 million. The maximum amount of sales of whole loans permitted under the percentage of loans acquired for investment limitation for 1966 is $45,000 (15 percent of $300,000). X may therefore sell whole loans in an amount up to $45,000 in 1966 and meet the sales of whole loans test. It is assumed that the amount of loans acquired for investment in 1965 did not exceed $300,000, so that the preceding year's base cannot be used to increase the amount of sales permitted in 1966.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in the previous example, except that the amount of loans acquired for investment in the preceding year (1965) was $320,000. Since such amount is greater than the $300,000 amount of loans acquired for investment in 1966, X may base its 15 percent limitation for 1966 on the $320,000 amount and sell whole loans in an amount up to $48,000 (15 percent of $320,000) and still meet the sales of whole loans test. However, to the extent that the amount of sales of whole loans exceeds $45,000 (15 percent of the $300,000 amount of loans acquired for investment in 1966), the maximum amount of sales computed under the percentage of loans acquired for investment limitation (but not the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation) for 1967 must be reduced.

# Example 3.
Y Association made no sales of whole loans in 1964 and 1965, and made sales of participations in the 2 years in amounts which, in the aggregate, were $50,000 less than the amounts of loans acquired for investment for such years. At the beginning of 1966 the amount of Y's loans outstanding was $1 million, and the amount of its loans acquired for investment in such year was $100,000. Although the maximum amount of sales of whole loans which Y could make under the sales of whole loans test is $200,000 (20 percent of $1 million), nevertheless, in order to meet the sales of whole loans and participations test, the sum of the amounts of sales of whole loans and sales of participations may not exceed $150,000 (100 percent of the $100,000 amount of loans acquired for investment in 1966 plus a carryover of sales from the previous two years of $50,000). It is assumed that the amount of loans acquired for investment in 1965 did not exceed $100,000, so that the preceding year's base cannot be used to increase the amount of sales permitted in 1966.
(viii)
Reporting requirements.
In the case of income tax returns for taxable years ending after October 31, 1964, there shall be filed with the return a statement showing the amount of gross
income for the taxable year in each of the categories described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph; and, for the taxable year and the two preceding taxable years, the amount of loans (described in subdivision (iii)(
a
) of this subparagraph) outstanding at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year, the amount of repayments on loans (not including repayments on loans to the extent such loans are refinanced by the association), the amount of sales of whole loans, and the amount of sales of participations.
(4)
Effective date.
The provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph (c), are applicable to taxable years ending after October 31, 1964. However, at the option of the taxpayer, for a taxable year beginning before November 1, 1964, and ending after October 31, 1964, the provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph (except the 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in subdivision (iv)(
b
) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c)) shall apply only to the part year falling after October 31, 1964, as if such part year constituted a taxable year. In such case, the following rules shall apply:
(i) The amount of the “loans acquired for investment” for such part year shall be equal to the loans acquired for investment during the entire taxable year within which falls such part year, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in such part year and the denominator of which is the number of days in such entire taxable year.
(ii) The increase in sales of whole loans and participations permitted by subdivision (vi) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c), (relating to carryover of sales and use of preceding year's base) shall be the amount of such increase computed under such subdivision, multiplied by the fraction specified in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
If, treating the part year as a taxable year, the association meets all the requirements of this paragraph for such part year it will be considered to have met the business operations test for the entire taxable year, providing it operated in all material respects in conformity with applicable rules and regulations of Federal or State supervisory authorities for the entire taxable year. The 20 percent of beginning loans limitation specified in subdivision (iv)(
b
) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (c), shall be applied only on the basis of a taxable year and not the part year. For taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, and ending before November 1, 1964, an association will be considered to have met the business operations test if it operated in all material respects in conformity with applicable rules and regulations of Federal or State supervisory authorities.
(d)
90 percent of assets test
—(1)
In general.
At least 90 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association must consist of the assets defined in subparagraphs (2) through (10) of this paragraph (d). For purposes of this paragraph, it is immaterial whether the association originated the loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of this paragraph (d), or purchased or otherwise acquired them in whole or in part from another. See paragraph (j) of this section for definition of certain terms used in this paragraph, and paragraph (k) of this section for the determination of amount and character of loans.
(2)
Cash.
The term “cash” means cash on hand, and time or demand deposits with, or withdrawable accounts in, other financial institutions.
(3)
Governmental obligations.
The term “governmental obligations” means obligations of the United States, a State or political subdivision of a State, and stock or obligations of a corporation which is an instrumentality of the United States, a State, or political subdivision of a State.
(4)
Deposit insurance company securities.
The term “deposit insurance company securities” means certificates of deposit in, or obligations of, a corporation organized under a State law which specifically authorizes such corporation to insure the deposits or share accounts of member associations.
(5)
Property used in the association's business
—(i)
In general.
The term “property used in the association's business” means land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, equipment, leasehold interests, leasehold improvements, and
other assets used by the association in the conduct of its business of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in the loans defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of this paragraph (d). Real property held for the purpose of being used primarily as the principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used in the association's business so long as it is reasonably anticipated that such property will be occupied for such use by the association, or that construction work preparatory to such occupancy will be commenced thereon, within 2 years after acquisition of the property. Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has as its exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more than 50 percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used in such business. Real property held by an association for investment or sale, even for the purpose of obtaining mortgage loans thereon, does not constitute property used in the association's business.
(ii)
Property rented to others.
Except as provided in the second sentence of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, property or a portion thereof rented by the association to others does not constitute property used in the association's business. However, if the fair rental value of the rented portion of a single piece of real property (including appurtenant parcels) used as the principal or branch office of the association constitutes less than 50 percent of the fair rental value of such piece of property, or if such property has an adjusted basis of not more than $150,000, the entire property shall be considered used in such business. If such rented portion constitutes 50 percent or more of the fair rental value of such piece of property, and such property has an adjusted basis of more than $150,000, an allocation of its adjusted basis is required. The portion of the total adjusted basis of such piece of property which is deemed to be property used in the association's business shall be equal to an amount which bears the same ratio to such total adjusted basis as the amount of the fair rental value of the portion used as the principal or branch office of the association bears to the total fair rental value of such property. In the case of all property other than real property used or to be used as the principal or branch office of the association, if the fair rental value of the rented portion thereof constitutes less than 15 percent of the fair rental value of such property, the entire property shall be considered used in the association's business. If such rented portion constitutes 15 percent or more of the fair rental value of such property, an allocation of its adjusted basis (in the same manner as required for real property used as the principal or branch office) is required.
(6)
Passbook loan.
The term “passbook loan” means a loan to the extent secured by a deposit, withdrawable share, or savings account in the association, or share of a member of the association, with respect to which a distribution is allowable as a deduction under section 591.
(7)
Home loan.
The term “home loan” means a loan secured by an interest in—
(i) Improved residential real property consisting of a structure or structures containing, in the aggregate, no more than 4 family units.
(ii) An individually owned family unit in a multiple-unit structure, the owner of which unit owns an undivided interest in the underlying real estate and the common elements of such structure (so-called condominium type).
Or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property. A construction loan made for the purpose of financing more than one structure (so-called tract financing) constitutes a home loan, providing no individual structure contains more than 4 family units and it is contemplated that, as soon as possible after completion of construction, the structures will become property described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. A construction loan secured by a structure containing more than 4 family units constitutes a home loan only if the structure has been committed to a plan of individual apartment ownership described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph and such plan is held out and advertised as such.
A loan secured by a cooperative apartment building containing more than 4 family units does not constitute a home loan.
(8)
Church loan.
The term “church loan” means a loan secured by an interest in real property which is used primarily for church purposes, or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term “church purposes” means the ministration of sacerdotal functions, the conduct of religious worship and closely associated activities designed primarily to provide fellowship among members of the congregation, or the instruction of religion. Thus, a parish hall would normally qualify as property used primarily for church purposes, whereas a building used primarily to furnish education, other than the instruction of religion, would not.
(9)
Multifamily loan.
The term “multifamily loan” means a loan, other than one defined in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph (d), (relating to a home loan), secured by an interest in improved residential real property or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property.
(10)
Nonresidential real property loan.
The term “nonresidential real property loan” means a loan, other than one defined in subparagraph (7), (8), or (9) of this paragraph (d), (relating respectively to a home loan, church loan, and multifamily loan) secured by an interest in real property, or a construction loan or improvement loan for such property.
(e)
18 percent of assets test.
Not more than 18 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may consist of assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (9) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, the sum of the amounts of the nonresidential real property loans and the assets other than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 18 percent of total assets.
(f)
36 or 41 percent of assets test
—(1)
36 percent test.
Unless subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), applies, not more than 36 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may consist of assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, unless subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), applies, the sum of the amounts of multifamily loans, nonresidential real property loans, and assets other than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 36 percent of total assets.
(2)
41 percent test.
If this subparagraph applies, not more than 41 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may consist of assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, if this subparagraph applies, the sum of the amounts of multifamily loans, nonresidential real property loans, and assets other than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section may not exceed 41 percent of total assets. See section 593(b)(5) and the regulations thereunder for the effect of application of this subparagraph on the allowable addition to the reserves for bad debts.
(g)
Taxable years for which 41 percent of assets test applies
—(1)
First taxable year.
For an association's first taxable year beginning after October 16, 1962, subparagraph (2) of paragraph (f) applies.
(2)
Second taxable year.
For an association's second taxable year beginning after October 16, 1962, subparagraph (2) of paragraph (f) applies if such association met all the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (h), and either subparagraph (1) or (2) of paragraph (f) for its first taxable year.
(3)
Years other than first and second taxable years.
For any taxable year of an association beginning after October 16, 1962, other than its first and second taxable years beginning after such date, subparagraph (2) of paragraph (f) applies if such association met either—
(i) The requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(1), and (h) of this section for the immediately preceding taxable year, or
(ii) The requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(2), and (h) of this section for the immediately preceding taxable year, and the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e), (f)(1), and (h) of this section for the second preceding taxable year.
Thus, in years other than its first and second taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, an association may apply the 41 percent of assets test for 2 consecutive years, but only if it met the 36 percent test (and all other tests) for the year previous to the 2 consecutive years.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (f) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that the association at all times meets all the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) and (h) of this section and files its returns on a calendar year basis.

# Example 1.
An association has 41 percent of its assets invested in assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section as of the close of 1963 and 1964. Because 1963 is its first taxable year beginning after October 16, 1962, the 41 percent of assets test applies, and the association therefore qualifies as a domestic building and loan association for 1963. Because 1964 is its second taxable year beginning after such date and the 41 percent of assets test applied for its first taxable year, the 41 percent of assets test applies for 1964 and it therefor qualifies for such year.

# Example 2.
An association has 36 percent of its assets invested in assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section as of the close of 1964, and 41 percent as of the close of 1965, 1966, and 1967. The association qualifies in 1965 because, as a result of having met the 36 percent of assets test for the immediately preceding taxable year (1964), the 41 percent of assets test applies to 1965. It qualifies in 1966 because as a result of having met the 41 percent of assets test in the immediately preceding taxable year (1965) and the 36 percent of assets test in the second preceding taxable year (1964), the 41 percent of assets test applies to 1966. The association would not qualify in 1967, however, because, although it met the 41 percent of assets test for the immediately preceding taxable year (1966), it did not meet the 36 percent of assets test in the second preceding taxable year (1965), and therefore the 41 percent of assets test does not apply to 1967.

# Example 3.
An association has more than 41 percent of its assets invested in assets other than those defined in subparagraphs (2) through (8) of paragraph (d) of this section as of the close of 1963, and 41 percent invested in such assets as of the close of 1964. The association does not qualify in either year. It does not qualify in 1963 because it exceeded the 41 percent limitation, and it does not qualify in 1964 because the 41 percent of assets test does not apply to 1964 since the association did not meet either the 41 percent of assets test or the 36 percent of assets test in the prior year (1963).
(h)
3 percent of assets test.
Not more than 3 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association may consist of stock of any corporation, unless such stock is property which is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The stock which constitutes property defined in such paragraph (d) is:
(1) Stock representing a withdrawable account in another financial institution;
(2) Stock of a corporation which is an instrumentality of the United States or of a State or political subdivision thereof;
(3) Stock which was security for a loan and which, by reason of having been bid in at foreclosure or otherwise having been reduced to ownership or possession of the association, is a loan within the definition of such term in paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and
(4) Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has as its exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more than 50 percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the principal or branch office of the association.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Definition of certain terms.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Loan.
The term “loan” means debt, as the term “debt” is used in section 166 and the regulations thereunder. The term “loan” also includes a redeemable ground rent (as defined in section 1055(c)) which is owned by the taxpayer, and any property (referred to in this section as “foreclosed property”) which was security for the payment of any indebtedness and which has been bid in at foreclosure, or otherwise been reduced to ownership or possession of the association by agreement or process of law, whether or not such property was acquired subsequent to December 31, 1962.
(2)
Secured.
A loan will be considered as “secured” only if the loan is on the security of any instrument (such as a mortgage, deed of trust, or land contract) which makes the interest of the debtor in the property described therein specific security for the payment of
the loan, provided that such instrument is of such a nature that, in the event of default, the interest of the debtor in such property could be subjected to the satisfaction of the loan with the same priority as a mortgage or deed of trust in the jurisdiction in which the property is situated.
(3)
Interest.
The word “interest” means an interest in real property which, under the law of the jurisdiction in which such property is situated, constitutes either (i) an interest in fee in such property, (ii) a leasehold interest in such property extending or renewable automatically for a period of at least 30 years, or at least 10 years beyond the date scheduled for the final payment on a loan secured by an interest in such property, (iii) a leasehold interest in property described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section (relating to certain home loans) extending for a period of at least 2 years beyond the date scheduled for the final payment on a loan secured by an interest in such property or (iv) a leasehold interest in such property held subject to a redeemable ground rent defined in section 1055(c).
(4)
Real property.
The term “real property” means any property which, under the law of the jurisdiction in which such property is situated, constitutes real property.
(5)
Improved real property.
The term “improved real property” means—
(i) Land on which is located any building of a permanent nature (such as a house, apartment house, office building, hospital, shopping center, warehouse, garage, or other similar permanent structure), provided that the value of such building is substantial in relation to the value of such land;
(ii) Any building lot or site which, by reason of installations and improvements that have been completed in keeping with applicable governmental requirements and with general practice in the community, is a building lot or site ready for the construction of any building of a permanent nature within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph; or
(iii) Real property which, because of its state of improvement, produces sufficient income to maintain such real property and retire the loan in accordance with the terms thereof.
(6)
Construction loan.
The term “construction loan” means a loan, the proceeds of which are to be disbursed to the borrower (either by the association or a third party) as construction work progresses on real property which is security for the loan, which property is, or from the proceeds of such loan will become, improved real property.
(7)
Improvement loan.
The term “improvement loan” means a loan which, by its terms and conditions, requires that the proceeds of the loan be used for altering, repairing, or improving real property. If more than 85 percent of the proceeds of a single loan are to be used for such purposes, the entire loan will qualify. If 85 percent or less of the proceeds of a loan are to be used for such purposes, an allocation of its adjusted basis is required. Examples of loans which constitute improvement loans are loans made for the purpose of painting a house, adding a new room to a house, remodeling the lobby of an apartment building, and purchasing and installing storm windows, storm doors, and awnings. Examples of loans which do not constitute improvement loans are loans made for the purpose of purchasing draperies, and removable appliances, such as refrigerators, ranges, and washing machines. It is not necessary that a loan be secured by the real property which is altered, repaired, or improved.
(8)
Residential real property.
The term “residential real property” means real property which consists of one or more family units. A family unit is a building or portion thereof which contains complete living facilities which are to be used on other than a transient basis by only one family consisting of one or more persons. Thus, an apartment which is to be used on other than a transient basis by one family, which contains complete facilities for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation constitutes a family unit. Hotels, motels, dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, rooming houses, hospitals, sanitariums, rest homes, and parks and courts for mobile homes do not normally constitute residential real property.
(k)
Amount and character of loans
—(1)
Treatment at time of determination
—(i)
In general.
The amount of a loan, as of the time the determination required by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (k), is made, shall be treated for the purposes of this section as being secured:
(
a
) First by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph (6), (7), or (8) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value thereof;
(
b
) Next by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph (9) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value thereof; and
(
c
) Next by the portion of property, if any, defined in subparagraph (10) of paragraph (d) of this section to the extent of the loan value thereof.
To the extent that the amount of a loan exceeds the amount treated as being secured by property defined in subparagraphs (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section, such loan shall be treated as property not defined in paragraph (d) of this section. If the loan value of any one category of property defined in paragraph (d) of this section exceeds 85 percent of the amount of the loan for which it is security then the entire loan shall be treated as a loan secured by such property.
(ii)
Loans of $40,000 or less.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, in the case of loans amounting to $40,000 or less as of the time of a determination, made on the security of property which is a combination of two or more categories or property defined in subparagraph (6) through (10) of paragraph (d) of this section, all such loans for any taxable year may, at the option of the association, be treated for the purposes of this section as being secured by the category of property the loan value of which constitutes the largest percentage of the total loan value of the property except to the extent that the loan is treated as property not defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
(iii)
Home loans of $20,000 or less.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, if a loan amounting to $20,000 or less as of the time of a determination, is secured partly by property of a category described in subparagraph (7) of paragraph (d) of this section (relating to a home loan), the amount of the loan shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a loan described in such subparagraph except to the extent that the loan is treated as property not defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Treatment subsequent to time of determination.
The amount of a loan outstanding as of any time subsequent to the time of a determination shall be treated, for the purposes of this section, as being secured by each of the categories of property in the same ratio that the amount which was treated as being secured by each category bore to the total amount of the loan at the time as of which the determination was last made with respect to such loan.
(3)
Time of determination
—(i)
In general.
The determination of the amount of a loan which is treated as being secured by each of the categories of property shall be made:
(
a
) As of the time a loan is made;
(
b
) As of the time a loan is increased;
(
c
) As of the time any portion of the property which was security for the loan is released; and
(
d
) As of any time required by applicable Federal or State regulatory authorities for reappraisal or reanalysis of such loans.
(ii)
Special rule.
In the case of loans outstanding with respect to which no event described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph has occurred in a taxable year beginning on or after October 17, 1962, the determination of the amounts of such loans which are treated as being secured by each of the categories of property may be made, at the option of the association, as of the close of the first taxable year beginning on or after such date, providing the determinations with respect to all such loans are made as of such date.
(4)
Loan value.
The loan value of property which is security for a loan is the maximum amount at the time as of which the determination is made which the association is permitted to lend on such property under the rules and regulations of applicable Federal and State regulatory authorities. Such loan value shall not exceed the fair market value of such property at such time as determined under such rules and regulations. However, in the case of loans
made incidentally with and as a part of a bona fide salvage operation, the loan value of the security property shall be considered to be the face amount of the loan where the loan can be shown by the association to have been made for the primary purpose of recovering the investment of the association, and where such salvage operation is in conformity with rules and regulations of applicable Federal or State regulatory authorities.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples, in each of which it is assumed that X Savings and Loan Association files its return on a calendar year basis, illustrate the application of the rules in this paragraph:

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1963, X makes a single loan of $1 million to M Corporation which loan is secured by real property which is a combination of homes, apartments, and stores. As of the time the loan is made X determines that the loan values of the categories of property are as follows:
Category of property
Loan value
Home
$400,000
Multifamily
420,000
Nonresidential real property
240,000
Total
1,060,000
As of the time the loan is made, therefore, the $1,000,000 loan is treated under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph as being secured as follows:
Category of loan
Amount of loan
Percentage of total
Home loan
$400,000
40
Multifamily loan
420,000
42
Nonresidential real property loan
180,000
18
Total
1,000,000
100
Assuming that the $1 million loan to M was reduced to $900,000 as of the close of 1963, that there were no increases in the amount of the loan and no releases of property which was security for the loan, and that there was no regulatory requirement to reappraise or reanalyze the loan, such loan will be considered under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to be secured, as of the close of 1963, as follows:
Category
Percentage as of last determination July 1, 1963
Amount as of Dec. 31, 1963
Home
40
$360,000
(40% × $900,000)
Multifamily
42
378,000
(42% × $900,000)
Nonresidential real property
18
162,000
(18% × $900,000)
Total
900,000

# Example 2.
X makes a loan of $40,000 secured by a building which contains a store on the first floor and four family units on the upper floors. The loan value of the part of the building used as a store is $21,000 and the loan value of the residential portion is $23,000. The loan will be treated under subdivision (i) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph as a loan secured by residential real property containing four or fewer family units to the extent of $23,000, and by nonresidential property to the extent of $17,000, as of the time the loan is made. However, if X exercises the option to treat all loans of $40,000 or less in accordance with subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, this loan would be treated as a home loan to the extent of the full $40,000 because the loan value of the residential portion is larger than the loan value of the nonresidential part.
(l)
Computation of percentages
—(1)
In general.
The percentages specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section shall, except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (l), be computed by comparing the amount of the assets described in each paragraph as of the close of the taxable year with the total amount of assets as of the close of the taxable year. The amount of the assets in any category and the total amount of assets shall be determined with reference to their adjusted basis under § 1.1011-1, or by such other method as is in accordance with sound accounting principles, provided such method is used in valuing all the assets in a taxable year.
(2)
Treatment of certain assets and reserves.
For purposes of this paragraph (l):
(i) Reserves for bad debts established pursuant to section 593, or corresponding provisions of prior law, and
the regulations thereunder shall not constitute a reduction of total assets, but shall be treated as a surplus or net worth item.
(ii) The adjusted basis of a “loan in process” does not include the unadvanced portion of such loan.
(iii) Advances made by the association for taxes, insurance, etc., on loans shall be treated as being in the same category as the loan with respect to which the advances are made (irrespective of whether the advances are secured by the property securing the loan).
(iv) Interest receivable included in gross income shall be treated as being in the same category as the loan or asset with respect to which it is earned.
(v) The unamortized portion of premiums paid on mortgage loans acquired by the association shall be considered part of the acquisition cost of such loans.
(vi) Prepaid Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation premiums shall be treated as being governmental obligations defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(vii) Accounts receivable (other than accrued interest receivable), and prepaid expenses and deferred charges other than those referred to in subdivision (v) or (vi) of this subparagraph, shall be disregarded both as separate categories and in the computation of total assets.
(viii) Foreclosed property (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) shall be treated as having the same character as the loan for which it was given as security.
(3)
Alternative method.
At the option of the taxpayer, the percentages specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section may be computed on the basis of the average assets outstanding during the taxable year. Such average shall be determined by making the computation provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (l), either as of the close of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual percentages obtained for each category. The method selected must be applied uniformly for the taxable year to all categories of assets, but the method may be changed from year to year.
(4)
Acquisition of certain assets.
For the purpose of the annual computation of percentages under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (l)—
(i) Assets which, within a 60-day period beginning in one taxable year of the taxpayer and ending in the next year, are acquired directly or indirectly through borrowing and then repaid or disposed of within such period, shall be considered assets other than those defined in paragraph (d) of this section, unless both the acquisition and disposition are established to the satisfaction of the district director to have been for bona fide purposes; and
(ii) The amount of cash shall not include amounts received directly or indirectly from another financial institution (other than a Federal Home Loan Bank or a similar institution organized under State law) to the extent of the amount of cash which an association has on deposit or holds as a withdrawable account in such other financial institution.
(5)
Reporting requirements.
In the case of income tax returns for taxable years ending after October 31, 1964, there shall be filed with the return a statement showing the amount of assets as of the close of the taxable year in each of the categories defined in paragraph (d), and in the category described in paragraph (h) of this section, and a brief description and amount of all other assets. If the alternative method of computing percentages under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (l) is selected, such statement shall show such information as of the end of each month, each quarter, or semiannually and the manner of calculating the averages. With respect to taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, and ending before November 1, 1964, taxpayers shall maintain adequate records to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that it meets the various assets tests specified in this section.
(6)
Example.
The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example in which a description of the assets, the subparagraph of paragraph (d) in which the assets are
defined, the amount of the assets, and the percentage of the total assets included in the calculation are set forth.

The computation of the percentages of assets in the various categories for the purpose of determining whether the percentage of assets tests in the paragraphs in this section are met as of the close of the year are as follows:
Test and paragraph
Items considered

90 percent test (d)
the sum of items 1 through 8 and 10 item—13 (total included assets)

18 percent test (e)
the sum of items 7, 9, 11, and 12—item 13 (total included assets)
= 8 percent
36 percent test (f)
the sum of items 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12—item 13 (total included assets)
= 28 percent
3 percent test (h)
0—item 13 (total included assets)
= 0 percent
At the option of the association, the computations listed above could have been made as of the close of each month, each quarter, or semiannually, and averaged for the entire year.
(m)
Taxable years beginning before October 17, 1962.
For taxable years beginning before October 17, 1962, the term “domestic building and loan association” means a domestic building and loan association, a domestic savings and loan association, and a Federal savings and loan association substantially all the business of which is confined to making loans to members.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7622, 44 FR 28661, May 16, 1979]
§ 301.7701-13A
Post-1969 domestic building and loan association.
(a)
In general.
For taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, the term “domestic building and loan association” means a domestic building and loan association, a domestic savings and loan association, a Federal savings and loan association, and any other savings institution chartered and supervised as a savings and loan or similar association under Federal or State law which meets the supervisory test (described in paragraph (b) of this section), the business operations test (described in paragraph (c) of this section), and the assets test (described in paragraph (d) of this section). For the definition of the term “domestic building and loan association” for taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, and before July 12, 1969, see § 301.7701-13.
(b)
Supervisory test.
A domestic building and loan association must be either (1) an insured institution within the
meaning of section 401(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1724(a)) or (2) subject by law to supervision and examination by State or Federal authority having supervision over such associations. An “insured institution” is one the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
(c)
Business operations test
—(1)
In general.
An association must utilize its assets so that its business consists principally of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans. The requirement of this paragraph is referred to in this section as the business operations test. The business of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans includes ancillary or incidental activities which are directly and primarily related to such acquisition and investment, such as advertising for savings, appraising property on which loans are to be made by the association, and inspecting the progress of construction in connection with construction loans. Even though an association meets the supervisory test described in paragraph (b) of this section and the assets test described in paragraph (d) of this section, it will nevertheless not qualify as a domestic building and loan association if it does not meet the requirements of both paragraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (c), relating, respectively, to acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans.
(2)
Acquiring the savings of the public.
The requirement that an association's business (other than investing in loans) must consist principally of acquiring the savings of the public ordinarily will be considered to be met if savings are acquired in all material respects in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or substantially equivalent rules of a State law or supervisory authority. Alternatively, such requirement will be considered to be met if more than 75 percent of the dollar amount of the total deposits, withdrawable shares, and other obligations of the association are held during the taxable year by the general public, as opposed to amounts deposited or held by family or related business groups or persons who are officers or directors of the association. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply if the dollar amount of other obligations of the association outstanding during the taxable year exceeds 25 percent of the dollar amount of the total deposits, withdrawable shares, and other obligations of the association outstanding during such year. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “other obligations” means notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations, or other securities (except capital stock), issued by an association in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or substantially equivalent rules of a State law or supervisory authority. The term “other obligations” does not include an advance made by a Federal Home Loan Bank under the authority of section 10 or 10b of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430, 1430b) as amended and supplemented. Both percentages specified in this paragraph shall be computed either as of the close of the taxable year or, at the option of the taxpayer, on the basis of the average of the dollar amounts of the total deposits, withdrawable shares, and other obligations of the association held during the taxable year. Such averages shall be determined by computing each percentage specified either as of the close of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual percentages obtained. The method selected must be applied uniformly for the taxable year to both percentages, but the method may be changed from year to year.
(3)
Investing in loans
—(i)
In general.
The requirement that an association's business (other than acquiring the savings of the public) must consist principally of investing in loans will be considered to be met for a taxable year only if more than 75 percent of the gross income of the association consists of—
(
a
) Interest or dividends on assets defined in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of paragraph (e) of this section,
(
b
) Interest on loans,
(
c
) Income attributable to the portion of property used in the association's business, as defined in paragraph (e)(11) of this section,
(
d
) So much of the amount of premiums, discounts, commissions, or fees (including late charges and penalties) on loans which have at some time been held by the association, or for which firm commitments have been issued, as is not in excess of 20 percent of the gross income of the association,
(
e
) Net gain from sales and exchanges of governmental obligations, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or
(
f
) Income, gain or loss attributable to foreclosed property, as defined in paragraph (e)(9) of this section, but not including such income, gain or loss which, pursuant to section 595 and the regulations thereunder, is not included in gross income.
Examples of types of income which would cause an association to fail to meet the requirements of this paragraph if, in the aggregate, they equal or exceed 25 percent of gross income, are: The excess of gains over losses from sales of real property (other than foreclosed property); rental income (other than on foreclosed property and the portion of property used in the association's business); premiums, commissions, and fees (other than commitment fees) on loans which have never been held by the association; and insurance brokerage fees.
(ii)
Computation of gross income.
For purposes of this paragraph, gross income is computed without regard to—
(
a
) Gain or loss on the sale or exchange of the portion of property used in the association's business as defined in paragraph (e)(11) of this section.
(
b
) Gain or loss on the sale or exchange of the rented portion of property used as the principal or branch office of the association, as defined in paragraph (e)(11) of this section, and
(
c
) Gains or losses on sales of participations, and loans, other than governmental obligations defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
For purposes of this paragraph, gross income is also computed without regard to items of income which an association establishes arise out of transactions which are necessitated by exceptional circumstances and which are not undertaken as recurring business activities for profit. Thus, for example, an association would meet the investing in loans requirement if it can establish that it would otherwise fail to meet that requirement solely because of the receipt of a nonrecurring item of income due to exceptional circumstances. For this purpose, transactions necessitated by an excess of demand for loans over savings capital in the association's area are not to be deemed to be necessitated by exceptional circumstances. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(
c
) of this section, the term “sales of participations” means sales by an association of interests in loans, which sales meet the requirements of the regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board relating to sales of participations, or which meet substantially equivalent requirements of State law or regulations relating to sales of participations.
(iii)
Reporting requirement.
In the case of income tax returns for taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, there is required to be filed with the return a statement showing the amount of gross income for the taxable year in each of the categories described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
(d)
60 percent of assets test.
At least 60 percent of the amount of the total assets of a domestic building and loan association must consist of the assets defined in paragraph (e) of this section. The percentage specified in this paragraph is computed as of the close of the taxable year or, at the option of the taxpayer, may be computed on the basis of the average assets outstanding during the taxable year. Such average is determined by making the appropriate computation described in this section either as of the close of each month, as of the close of each quarter, or semiannually during the taxable year and by using the yearly average of the monthly, quarterly, or semiannual percentage obtained for each category of assets defined in paragraph (e) of this section. The method selected must be applied uniformly for the taxable year to all categories of assets, but the method may be changed from year to year. For purposes of this paragraph, it is immaterial whether the association
originated the loans defined in paragraphs (4) through (8) and (10) of paragraph (e) of this section or purchased or otherwise acquired them in whole or in part from another. See paragraph (f) of this section for definition of certain terms used in this paragraph and in paragraph (e) of this section, and for the determination of amount and character of loans.
(e)
Assets defined.
The assets defined in this paragraph are—
(1)
Cash.
The term “cash” means cash on hand, and time or demand deposits with, or withdrawable accounts in, other financial institutions.
(2)
Governmental obligations.
The term “governmental obligations” means—
(i) Obligations of the United States,
(ii) Obligations of a State or political subdivision of a State, and
(iii) Stock or obligations of a corporation which is an instrumentality of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State,
other than obligations the interest on which is excludable from gross income under section 103 and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Deposit insurance company securities.
The term “deposit insurance company securities” means certificates of deposit in, or obligations of, a corporation organized under a State law which specifically authorizes such corporation to insure the deposits or share accounts of member associations.
(4)
Passbook loan.
The term “passbook loan” means a loan to the extent secured by a deposit, withdrawable share, or savings account in the association, or share of a member of the association, with respect to which a distribution is allowable as a deduction under section 591.
(5)
Residential real property loan.

(11)
Property used in the association's business
—(i)
In general.
The term “property used in the association's business” means land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, equipment, leasehold interests, leasehold improvements, and other assets used by the association in the conduct of its business of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans. Real property held for the purpose of being used primarily as the principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used in the association's business so long as it is reasonably anticipated that such property will be occupied for such use by the association, or that construction work preparatory to such occupancy will be commenced thereon, within 2 years after acquisition of the property. Stock of a wholly owned subsidiary corporation which has as its exclusive activity the ownership and management of property more than 50 percent of the fair rental value of which is used as the principal or branch office of the association constitutes property used in such business. Real property held by an association for investment or sale, even for the purpose of obtaining mortgage loans thereon, does not constitute property used in the association's business.
(ii)
Property rented to others.
Except as provided in the second sentence of paragraph (11)(i) of this paragraph (e), property or a portion thereof rented by the association to others does not constitute property used in the association's business. However, if the fair rental value of the rented portion of a single piece of real property (including appurtenant parcels) used as the principal or branch office of the association constitutes less than 50 percent of the fair rental value of such piece of property, or if such property has an adjusted basis of not more than $150,000, the entire property shall be considered used in such business. If such rented portion constitutes 50 percent or more of the fair rental value of such piece of property, and such property has an adjusted basis of more than $150,000, an allocation of its adjusted basis is required. The portion of the total adjusted basis of such piece of property which is deemed to be property used in the association's business shall be equal to an amount which bears the same ratio to such total adjusted basis as the amount of the fair rental value of the portion used as the principal or branch office of the association bears to the total fair rental value of such property. In the case of all property
other than real property used or to be used as the principal or branch office of the association, if the fair rental value of the rented portion thereof constitutes less than 15 percent of the fair rental value of such property, the entire property shall be considered used in the association's business. If such rented portion constitutes 15 percent or more of the fair rental value of such property, an allocation of its adjusted basis (in the same manner as required for real property used as the principal or branch office) is required.
(12)
Regular or residual interest in a REMIC
—(i)
In general.
If for any calendar quarter at least 95 percent of a REMIC's assets (as determined in accordance with § 1.860F-4(e)(1)(ii) or § 1.6049-7(f)(3) of this chapter) are assets defined in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this section, then for that calendar quarter all the regular and residual interests in that REMIC are treated as assets defined in this paragraph (e). If less than 95 percent of a REMIC's assets are assets defined in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this section, the percentage of each REMIC regular or residual interest treated as an asset defined in this paragraph (e) is equal to the percentage of the REMIC's assets that are assets defined in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this section. See §§ 1.860F-4(e)(1)(ii)(B) and 1.6049-7(f)(3) of this chapter for information required to be provided to regular and residual interest holders if the 95 percent test is not met.
(ii)
Loans secured by manufactured housing.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(12)(i) of this section, a loan secured by manufactured housing treated as a single family residence under section 25(e)(10) is an asset defined in paragraph (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this section.

For taxable years beginning after October 16, 1962, the term “cooperative bank” means an institution without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes without profit which meets the supervisory test, the business operations test, and the various assets tests specified in paragraphs (d) through (h) of § 301.7701-13, employing the rules and definitions of paragraphs (j) through (l) of that section. In applying paragraphs (b) through (l) of such section any references to an “association” or to a “domestic building and loan association” shall be deemed to be a reference to a cooperative bank.
§ 301.7701-15
Tax return preparer.
(a)
In general.
A
tax return preparer
is any person who prepares for compensation, or who employs one or more persons to prepare for compensation, all or a substantial portion of any return of tax or any claim for refund of tax under the Internal Revenue Code (Code).
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Signing tax return preparer.
A
signing tax return preparer
is the individual tax return preparer who has the primary responsibility for the overall substantive accuracy of the preparation of such return or claim for refund.
(2)
Nonsigning tax return preparer
—(i)
In general.
A
nonsigning tax return preparer
is any tax return preparer who is not a signing tax return preparer but who prepares all or a substantial portion of a return or claim for refund within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section with respect to events that have occurred at the time the advice is rendered. In determining whether an individual is a nonsigning tax return preparer, time spent on advice that is given after events have occurred that represents less than 5 percent of the aggregate time incurred by such individual with respect to the position(s) giving rise to the understatement shall not be taken into account. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, time spent on advice before the events have occurred will be taken into account if all facts and circumstances show that the position(s) giving rise to the understatement is primarily attributable to the advice, the advice was substantially given before events occurred primarily to avoid treating the person giving the advice as a tax return preparer, and the advice given before events occurred was confirmed after events had occurred for purposes
of preparing a tax return. Examples of nonsigning tax return preparers are tax return preparers who provide advice (written or oral) to a taxpayer (or to another tax return preparer) when that advice leads to a position or entry that constitutes a substantial portion of the return within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Attorney A, an attorney in a law firm, provides legal advice to a large corporate taxpayer regarding a completed corporate transaction. The advice provided by A is directly relevant to the determination of an entry on the taxpayer's return, and this advice leads to a position(s) or entry that constitutes a substantial portion of the return. A, however, does not prepare any other portion of the taxpayer's return and is not the signing tax return preparer of this return. A is considered a nonsigning tax return preparer.

# Example 2.
Attorney B, an attorney in a law firm, provides legal advice to a large corporate taxpayer regarding the tax consequences of a proposed corporate transaction. Based upon this advice, the corporate taxpayer enters into the transaction. Once the transaction is completed, the corporate taxpayer does not receive any additional advice from B with respect to the transaction. B did not provide advice with respect to events that have occurred and is not considered a tax return preparer.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as Example 2, except that Attorney B provides supplemental advice to the corporate taxpayer on a phone call after the transaction is completed. Attorney B did not provide advice before the corporate transaction occurred with the primary intent to avoid being treated as a tax return preparer. The time incurred on this supplemental advice by B represented less than 5 percent of the aggregate amount of time spent by B providing tax advice on the position. B is not considered a tax return preparer.
(3)
Substantial portion.
(i) Only a person who prepares all or a substantial portion of a return or claim for refund shall be considered to be a tax return preparer of the return or claim for refund. A person who renders tax advice on a position that is directly relevant to the determination of the existence, characterization, or amount of an entry on a return or claim for refund will be regarded as having prepared that entry. Whether a schedule, entry, or other portion of a return or claim for refund is a substantial portion is determined based upon whether the person knows or reasonably should know that the tax attributable to the schedule, entry, or other portion of a return or claim for refund is a substantial portion of the tax required to be shown on the return or claim for refund. A single tax entry may constitute a substantial portion of the tax required to be shown on a return. Factors to consider in determining whether a schedule, entry, or other portion of a return or claim for refund is a substantial portion include but are not limited to—
(A) the size and complexity of the item relative to the taxpayer's gross income; and
(B) the size of the understatement attributable to the item compared to the taxpayer's reported tax liability.
(ii)(A) For purposes of applying the rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section to a nonsigning tax return preparer within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section only, the schedule or other portion is not considered to be a substantial portion if the schedule, entry, or other portion of the return or claim for refund involves amounts of gross income, amounts of deductions, or amounts on the basis of which credits are determined that are—
(
1
) Less than $10,000; or
(
2
) Less than $400,000 and also less than 20 percent of the gross income as shown on the return or claim for refund (or, for an individual, the individual's adjusted gross income).
(B) If more than one schedule, entry or other portion is involved, all schedules, entries or other portions shall be aggregated in applying the de minimis rule in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(C) The de minimis rule in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section shall not apply to a signing tax return preparer within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iii) A tax return preparer with respect to one return is not considered to be a tax return preparer of another return merely because an entry or entries reported on the first return may affect an entry reported on the other
return, unless the entry or entries reported on the first return are directly reflected on the other return and constitute a substantial portion of the other return. For example, the sole preparer of a partnership return of income or small business corporation income tax return is considered a tax return preparer of a partner's or a shareholder's return if the entry or entries on the partnership or small business corporation return reportable on the partner's or shareholder's return constitute a substantial portion of the partner's or shareholder's return.
(iv)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Accountant C prepares a Form 8886, “Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement”, that is used to disclose reportable transactions. C does not prepare the tax return or advise the taxpayer regarding the tax return reporting position of the transaction to which the Form 8886 relates. The preparation of the Form 8886 is not directly relevant to the determination of the existence, characterization, or amount of an entry on a tax return or claim for refund. Rather, the Form 8886 is prepared by C to disclose a reportable transaction. C has not prepared a substantial portion of the tax return and is not considered a tax return preparer under section 6694.

# Example 2.
Accountant D prepares a schedule for an individual taxpayer's Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return”, reporting $4,000 in dividend income and gives oral or written advice about Schedule A, which results in a claim of a medical expense deduction totaling $5,000, but does not sign the tax return. D is not a nonsigning tax return preparer because the total aggregate amount of the deductions is less than $10,000.
(4)
Return and claim for refund
—(i)
Return.
For purposes of this section, a return of tax is a return (including an amended or adjusted return) filed by or on behalf of a taxpayer reporting the liability of the taxpayer for tax under the Code, if the type of return is identified in published guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. A return of tax also includes any information return or other document identified in published guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin and that reports information that is or may be reported on another taxpayer's return under the Code if the information reported on the information return or other document constitutes a substantial portion of the taxpayer's return within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Claim for refund.
For purposes of this section, a claim for refund of tax includes a claim for credit against any tax that is included in published guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. A claim for refund also includes a claim for payment under section 6420, 6421, or 6427.
(c)
Mechanical or clerical assistance.
A person who furnishes to a taxpayer or other tax return preparer sufficient information and advice so that completion of the return or claim for refund is largely a mechanical or clerical matter is considered a tax return preparer, even though that person does not actually place or review placement of information on the return or claim for refund. See also paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(d)
Qualifications.
A person may be a tax return preparer without regard to educational qualifications and professional status requirements.
(e)
Outside the United States.
A person who prepares a return or claim for refund outside the United States is a tax return preparer, regardless of the person's nationality, residence, or the location of the person's place of business, if the person otherwise satisfies the definition of
tax return preparer.
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 301.6109-1(g), the person shall secure an employer identification number if the person is an employer of another tax return preparer, is a partnership in which one or more of the general partners is a tax return preparer, is a firm in which one or more of the equity holders is a tax return preparer, or is an individual not employed by another tax return preparer.
(f)
Persons who are not tax return preparers.
(1) The following persons are not tax return preparers:
(i) An official or employee of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) performing official duties.
(ii) Any individual who provides tax assistance under a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program established by the IRS, but only with respect to those returns prepared as part of the VITA program.
(iii) Any organization sponsoring or administering a VITA program established by the IRS, but only with respect to that sponsorship or administration.
(iv) Any individual who provides tax counseling for the elderly under a program established pursuant to section 163 of the Revenue Act of 1978, but only with respect to those returns prepared as part of that program.
(v) Any organization sponsoring or administering a program to provide tax counseling for the elderly established pursuant to section 163 of the Revenue Act of 1978, but only with respect to that sponsorship or administration.
(vi) Any individual who provides tax assistance as part of a qualified Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC), as defined by section 7526, subject to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, but only with respect to those returns and claims for refund prepared as part of the LITC program.
(vii) Any organization that is a qualified LITC, as defined by section 7526, subject to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section.
(viii) An individual providing only typing, reproduction, or other mechanical assistance in the preparation of a return or claim for refund.
(ix) An individual preparing a return or claim for refund of a taxpayer, or an officer, a general partner, member, shareholder, or employee of a taxpayer, by whom the individual is regularly and continuously employed or compensated or in which the individual is a general partner.
(x) An individual preparing a return or claim for refund for a trust, estate, or other entity of which the individual either is a fiduciary or is an officer, general partner, or employee of the fiduciary.
(xi) An individual preparing a claim for refund for a taxpayer in response to—
(A) A notice of deficiency issued to the taxpayer; or
(B) A waiver of restriction on assessment after initiation of an audit of the taxpayer or another taxpayer if a determination in the audit of the other taxpayer affects, directly or indirectly, the liability of the taxpayer for tax.
(xii) A person who prepares a return or claim for refund for a taxpayer with no explicit or implicit agreement for compensation, even if the person receives an insubstantial gift, return service, or favor.
(2) Paragraphs (f)(1)(vi) and (vii) of this section apply only if any assistance with a return of tax or claim for refund is directly related to a controversy with the IRS for which the qualified LITC is providing assistance or is an ancillary part of an LITC program to inform individuals for whom English is a second language about their rights and responsibilities under the Code.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(2) of this section, paragraphs (f)(1)(vi) and (f)(1)(vii) of this section do not apply if an LITC charges a separate fee or varies a fee based on whether the LITC provides assistance with a return of tax or claim for refund under the Code or if the LITC charges more than a nominal fee for its services.
(4) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ix) of this section, the employee of a corporation owning more than 50 percent of the voting power of another corporation, or the employee of a corporation more than 50 percent of the voting power of which is owned by another corporation, is considered the employee of the other corporation as well.
(5) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(x) of this section, an estate, guardianship, conservatorship, committee, or any similar arrangement for a taxpayer under a legal disability (such as a minor, an incompetent, or an infirm individual) is considered a trust or estate.
(6)
Examples.
The mechanical assistance exception described in paragraph (f)(1)(viii) of this section is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A reporting agent received employment tax information from a client from the client's business records. The reporting agent did not render any tax advice to the client or exercise any discretion or independent judgment on the client's underlying tax positions. The reporting agent processed the client's information, signed the return as authorized by the client pursuant to Form 8655, Reporting Agent Authorization, and
filed the client's return using the information supplied by the client. The reporting agent is not a tax return preparer.

# Example 2.
A reporting agent rendered tax advice to a client on determining whether its workers are employees or independent contractors for Federal tax purposes. For compensation, the reporting agent received employment tax information from the client, processed the client's information and filed the client's return using the information supplied by the client. The reporting agent is a tax return preparer.

Other terms.
For a definition of the term “withholding agent” see § 1.1441-7(a). Any other terms that are defined in section 7701 and that are not defined in §§ 301.7701-1 to 301.7701-15, inclusive, shall, when used in this chapter, have the meanings assigned to them in section 7701.
(Secs. 1441(c)(4) (80 Stat. 1553; 26 U.S.C. 1441(c)(4)), 3401(a)(6) (80 Stat. 1554; 26 U.S.C. 3401(a)(6)), and 7805 (68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 7805), Internal Revenue Code of 1954)
[T.D. 7977, 49 FR 36836, Sept. 20, 1984]
§ 301.7701-17T
Collective-bargaining plans and agreements (temporary).
Q-1: How did the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA of 1984) change the laws with respect to plans that are maintained pursuant to collective bargaining agreements?
A-1: (a) Many of the requirements and rules applicable to deferred compensation and welfare benefit plans are different for plans maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Prior to the TRA of 1984, the Internal Revenue Code provided no clear definition of an employee representative or whether there is a collective bargaining agreement between such employee representative and one or more employers.
(b) Section 526(c) of the TRA of 1984 added a new condition under a new section 7701(a)(46) that must be satisfied in order for a plan to be considered to be a plan maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers for purposes of the Code after March 31, 1984. If more than one-half of the membership of an organization is comprised of owners, officers, and executives of employers covered by the plan, then such organization is not an employee representative for purposes of determining whether a plan is to be treated as maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers. Whether an individual is an owner, officer or executive is to be determined separately with respect to each employer. Additionally, section 7701(a)(46) provides that the Internal Revenue Service shall make the determination for purposes of the Code as to whether there is a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers.
Q-2: If an organization does not fail to be an employee representative under the 50 percent or less test of section 7701(a)(46), is a plan maintained pursuant to an agreement between such organization and one or more employers necessarily treated, under the Code, as a plan maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between an employee representative and one or more employers?
A-2: (a) No.
(b) Specific Code provisions generally require other conditions than that in section 7701(a)(46) to be satisfied in order for a plan to be considered to be collectively-bargained. For example, in order for a plan to be described in section 413(a), the Secretary of Labor must find that the plan is maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers.
(c) Even if (1) the finding in the example in the preceding paragraph (b) is made by the Secretary of Labor, (2) the union has been recognized as exempt under section 501(c)(5), and (3) the percentage condition in section 7701(a)(46) is satisfied, the Internal Revenue Service has the authority, pursuant to section 7701(a)(46), to determine whether
there is a collective bargaining agreement under the Code.

§ 301.7701(b)-1
Resident alien.
(a)
Scope.
Section 301.7701(b)-1(b) provides rules for determining whether an alien individual is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. Section 301.7701(b)-1(c) provides rules for determining if an alien individual satisfies the substantial presence test. Section 301.7701(b)-2 provides rules for determining when an alien individual will be considered to maintain a tax home in a foreign country and to have a closer connection to that foreign country. Section 301.7701(b)-3 provides rules for determining if an individual is an exempt individual because of his or her status as a foreign government-related
individual, teacher, trainee, student, or professional athlete. Section 301.7701(b)-3 also provides rules for determining whether an individual may exclude days of presence in the United States because the individual was unable to leave the United States because of a medical condition. Section 301.7701(b)-4 provides rules for determining an individual's residency starting and termination dates. Section 301.7701(b)-5 provides rules for applying section 877 to a nonresident alien individual. Section 301.7701(b)-6 provides rules for determining the taxable year of an alien. Section 301.7701(b)-7 provides rules for determining the effect of these regulations on rules in tax conventions to which the United States is a party. Section 301.7701(b)-8 provides procedural rules for establishing that an individual is a nonresident alien. Section 301.7701(b)-9 provides the effective dates of section 7701(b) and the regulations under that section. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the regulations under §§ 301.7701(b)-1 through 301.7701(b)-9 apply for purposes of determining whether a United States citizen is also a resident of the United States. (This determination may be relevant, for example, to the application of section 861(a)(1) which treats income from interest-bearing obligations of residents as income from sources within the United States.) The regulations do not apply and §§ 1.871-2 and 1.871-5 of this chapter continue to apply for purposes of the bona fide residence test of section 911. See § 1.911-2(c) of this chapter. For purposes of determining whether an individual is a resident of the United States for estate and gift tax purposes, see § 20.0-1(b)(1) and (2) and § 25.2501-1(b) of this chapter, respectively.
(b)
Lawful permanent resident
—(1)
Green card test.
An alien is a resident alien with respect to a calendar year if the individual is a lawful permanent resident at any time during the calendar year. A lawful permanent resident is an individual who has been lawfully granted the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws. Resident status is deemed to continue unless it is rescinded or administratively or judicially determined to have been abandoned.
(2)
Rescission of resident status.
Resident status is considered to be rescinded if a final administrative or judicial order of exclusion or deportation is issued regarding the alien individual. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “final judicial order” means an order that is no longer subject to appeal to a higher court of competent jurisdiction.
(3)
Administrative or judicial determination of abandonment of resident status.
An administrative or judicial determination of abandonment of resident status may be initiated by the alien individual, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), or a consular officer. If the alien initiates this determination, resident status is considered to be abandoned when the individual's application for abandonment (INS Form I-407) or a letter stating the alien's intent to abandon his or her resident status, with the Alien Registration Receipt Card (INS Form I-151 or Form I-551) enclosed, is filed with the INS or a consular officer. If INS replaces any of the form numbers referred to in this paragraph or § 301.7701(b)-2(f), refer to the comparable INS replacement form number. For purposes of this paragraph, an alien individual shall be considered to have filed a letter stating the intent to abandon resident status with the INS or a consular office if such letter is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested (or a foreign country's equivalent thereof). A copy of the letter, along with proof that the letter was mailed and received, should be retained by the alien individual. If the INS or a consular officer initiates this determination, resident status will be considered to be abandoned upon the issuance of a final administrative order of abandonment. If an individual is granted an appeal to a federal court of competent jurisdiction, a final judicial order is required.
(c)
Substantial presence test
—(1)
In general.
An alien individual is a resident alien if the individual meets the substantial presence test. An individual satisfies this test if he or she has been present in the United States on at least 183 days during a three year
period that includes the current year. For purposes of this test, each day of presence in the current year is counted as a full day. Each day of presence in the first preceding year is counted as one-third of a day and each day of presence in the second preceding year is counted as one-sixth of a day. For purposes of this paragraph, any fractional days resulting from the above calculations will not be rounded to the nearest whole number. (See § 301.7701(b)-9(b)(2) for transitional rules for calendar years 1985 and 1986.)
(2)
Determination of presence
—(i)
Physical presence.
For purposes of the substantial presence test, an individual shall be treated as present in the United States on any day that he or she is physically present in the United States at any time during the day. (But see § 301.7701(b)-3 relating to days of presence that may be excluded.)
(ii)
United States.
For purposes of section 7701(b) and the regulations thereunder, the term
United States
when used in a geographical sense includes the states and the District of Columbia. It also includes the territorial waters of the United States and the seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent to the territorial waters of the United States and over which the United States has exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources. It does not include the possessions and territories of the United States or the air space over the United States.
(3)
Current year.
The term
current year
means any calendar year for which an alien individual is determining his or her resident status.
(4)
Thirty-one day minimum.
If an individual is not physically present for more than 30 days during the current year, the substantial presence test will not be applied for that year even if the three-year total is 183 or more days. For purposes of the substantial presence test, it is irrelevant that an individual was not present for more than 30 days in the first or second year preceding the current year.
(d)
Application of section 7701(b) to the possessions and territories
—(1)
Application to aliens for purposes of mirror systems.
Section 7701(b) provides the basis for determining whether an alien individual is a resident of a United States possession or territory that administers income tax laws that are identical (except for the substitution of the name of the possession or territory for the term “United States” where appropriate) to those in force in the United States, for purposes of applying such laws with respect to income tax liability incurred to such possession or territory.
(2)
Non-application for bona fide resident determination.
Section 7701(b) does not provide the basis for determining whether an individual (including an alien individual) is a bona fide resident of a United States possession or territory for Federal income tax purposes. For the applicable rules for making this determination, see section 937(a) and § 1.937-1 of this chapter.
(e)
Examples.
This section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
B, an alien individual, is present in the United States for 122 days in the current year. He was present in the United States for 122 days in the first preceding calendar year and for 122 days in the second preceding calendar year. In determining his status for the current year, B counts all 122 days in the United States in the current year plus
1/3
of the 122 days in the United States in the first preceding calendar year (40
2/3
days) and
1/6
of the 122 days in the United States during the second preceding calendar year (20
1/3
days). The total of 122 + 40
2/3
+ 20
1/3
equals 183 days. B meets the substantial presence test and is a resident alien for the current year.

# Example 2.
C, an alien individual, is present in the United States for 25 days during the current year. She was present in the United States for 365 days during the first preceding year and 365 days during the second preceding year. The substantial presence test does not apply because C is present in the United States for fewer than 31 days during the current year.

# Example 3.
D, an alien individual, is present in the United States for 170 days during the current year. He was present in the United States for 30 days during the first preceding year and 30 days during the second preceding year. In determining his status for the current year, D counts all 170 days in the United States in the current year plus
1/3
of the 30 days in the United States in the first preceding calendar year (10 days) and
1/6
of the 30 days in the United States during the second preceding calendar year (5 days). The total of 170 + 10 + 5 equals 185 days. D meets
the substantial presence test and is a resident alien for the current year notwithstanding the fact that he was present in the United States for fewer than 31 days in each of the two preceding years.
[T.D. 8411, 57 FR 15242, Apr. 27, 1992; 57 FR 28612, June 26, 1992; 57 FR 37190, Aug. 18, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9194, 70 FR 18947, Apr. 11, 2005; T.D. 9391, 73 FR 19377, Apr. 9, 2008]
§ 301.7701(b)-2
Closer connection exception.
(a)
In general.
An alien individual who meets the substantial presence test may nevertheless be considered a nonresident alien for the current year if the following conditions are satisfied—
(1) The individual is present in the United States for fewer than 183 days in the current year;
(2) The individual maintains a tax home in a foreign country during the current year; and
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the individual has a closer connection during the current year to a single foreign country in which he or she maintains a tax home than to the United States.
(b)
Foreign country.
For purposes of section 7701(b) and the regulations thereunder, the term “foreign country” when used in a geographical sense includes any territory under the sovereignty of the United Nations or a government other than that of the United States. It includes the territorial waters of the foreign country (determined in accordance with the laws of the United States), and the seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent to the territorial waters of the foreign country and over which the foreign country has exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources. It also includes the possessions and territories of the United States.
(c)
Tax home
—(1)
Definition.
For purposes of section 7701 (b) and the regulations under that section, the term “tax home” has the same meaning that it has for purposes of section 162(a)(2) (relating to travel expenses while away from home). Thus, an individual's tax home is considered to be located at the individual's regular or principal (if more than one regular) place of business. If the individual has no regular or principal place of business because of the nature of the business, or because the individual is not engaged in carrying on any trade or business within the meaning of section 162(a), then the individual's tax home is the individual's regular place of abode in a real and substantial sense.
(2)
Duration and nature of tax home.
The tax home maintained by the alien individual must be in existence for the entire current year. The tax home must be located in the same foreign country for which the individual is claiming to have the closer connection described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Closer connection to a foreign country
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 7701(b) and the regulations under that section, an alien individual will be considered to have a closer connection to a foreign country than the United States if the individual or the Commissioner establishes that the individual has maintained more significant contacts with the foreign country than with the United States. In determining whether an individual has maintained more significant contacts with a foreign country than the United States, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following—
(i) The location of the individual's permanent home;
(ii) The location of the individual's family;
(iii) The location of personal belongings, such as automobiles, furniture, clothing and jewelry owned by the individual and his or her family;
(iv) The location of social, political, cultural or religious organizations with which the individual has a current relationship;
(v) The location where the individual conducts his or her routine personal banking activities;
(vi) The location where the individual conducts business activities (other than those that constitute the individual's tax home);
(vii) The location of the jurisdiction in which the individual holds a driver's license;
(viii) The location of the jurisdiction in which the individual votes;
(ix) The country of residence designated by the individual on forms and documents; and
(x) The types of official forms and documents filed by the individual, such as Form 1078 (Certificate of Alien Claiming Residence in the United States), Form W-8 (Certificate of Foreign Status) or Form W-9 (Payer's Request for Taxpayer ldentification Number).
(2)
Permanent home.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, it is immaterial whether a permanent home is a house, an apartment, or a furnished room. It is also immaterial whether the home is owned or rented by the alien individual. It is material, however, that the dwelling be available at all times, continuously, and not solely for stays of short duration.
(e)
Special Rule.
An alien individual may demonstrate in one year that he or she has a closer connection to two foreign countries (but no more than two) if he or she satisfies all of the following conditions—
(1) The individual maintains a tax home beginning on the first day of the current year in one foreign country;
(2) The individual changes his or her tax home during the current year to a second foreign country;
(3) The individual continues to maintain his or her tax home in the second foreign country for the remainder of the current year;
(4) The individual has a closer connection to each foreign country than to the United States for the period during which the individual maintains a tax home in that foreign country; and
(5) The individual is subject to taxation as a resident pursuant to the internal laws of either foreign country for the entire year or subject to taxation as a resident in both foreign countries for the period during which the individual maintains a tax home in each foreign country.
(f)
Closer connection exception unavailable.
An alien individual who has personally applied, or taken other affirmative steps, to change his or her status to that of a permanent resident during the current year or has an application pending for adjustment of status during the current year will not be eligible for the closer connection exception. Affirmative steps to change status to that of a permanent resident include, but are not limited to, the following—
(1) The filing of Immigration and Naturalization Form I-508 (Waiver of Immunities) by the alien;
(2) The filing of Immigration and Naturalization Form I-485 (Application for Status as Permanent Resident) by the alien;
(3) The filing of Immigration and Naturalization Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) on behalf of the alien;
(4) The filing of Immigration and Naturalization Form I-140 (Petition for Prospective Immigrant Employee) on behalf of the alien;
(5) The filing of Department of Labor Form ETA-750 (Application for Alien Employment Certification) on behalf of the alien; or
(6) The filing of Department of State Form OF-230 (Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration) by the alien.
(g)
Filing requirements.
See § 3O1.7701(b)-8 with regard to the statement that must be filed by an alien individual claiming the closer connection exception.
[T.D. 8411, 57 FR 15244, Apr. 27, 1992; 57 FR 28612, June 26, 1992; 57 FR 37190, Aug. 18, 1992; 58 FR 17516, Apr. 5, 1993]
§ 301.7701(b)-3
Days of presence in the United States that are excluded for purposes of section 7701(b).
(a)
In general.
In computing days of presence in the United States, an alien is considered to be present if the individual is physically present in the United States at any time during the day (see § 301.7701(b)-1(c)(2)(i)). However, for purposes of section 7701(b) and the regulations under that section, the following days shall be excluded and will not count as days of presence in the United States—
(1) Any day that an individual is present in the United States as an exempt individual;
(2) Any day that an individual is prevented from leaving the United States because of a medical condition that arose while the individual was present in the United States;
(3) Any day that an individual is in transit between two points outside the United States; and
(4) Any day on which a regular commuter residing in Canada or Mexico commutes to and from employment in the United States.
(b)
Exempt individuals
—(1)
In general.
An exempt individual is an individual who is either a—
(i) Foreign government-related individual as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
(ii) Teacher or trainee as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
(iii) Student as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; or
(iv) Professional athlete as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(2)
Foreign government-related individual
—(i)
In general.
A foreign government-related individual is an individual (and that individual's immediate family) who is temporarily present in the United States—
(A) As a full-time employee of an international organization;
(B) By reason of diplomatic status; or
(C) By reason of a visa that the Secretary of the Treasury or his or her delegate (after consultation with the Secretary of State when appropriate) determines represents full-time diplomatic or consular status. An individual described in this paragraph shall be considered to be temporarily present in the United States if the individual is not a lawful permanent resident as described in § 301.7701(b)-1(b)(1), regardless of the actual amount of time that the individual is present in the United States.
(ii)
Definition of international organization.
The term “international organization” means any public international organization that has been designated by the President by Executive Order as being entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided for in the International Organizations Act (22 U.S.C. 288). An individual described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section will be a full-time employee of an international organization if that individual's employment with the organization is consistent with an employment schedule of a person with a standard full-time work schedule with the organization.
(iii)
Full-time diplomatic or consular status.
An individual is considered to have full-time diplomatic or consular status if—
(A) The individual has been accredited by a foreign government recognized de jure or de facto by the United States;
(B) The individual intends to engage primarily in official activities for that foreign government while in the United States; and
(C) The individual has been recognized by the President, or by the Secretary of State, or by a consular officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, as being entitled to such status.
(3)
Teacher or trainee.
A teacher or trainee includes any individual (and that individual's immediate family), other than a student, who is admitted temporarily to the United States as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15) (J) (relating to the admission of teachers and trainees into the United States) or section 101(a)(15)(Q) (relating to the admission of participants in international cultural exchange programs) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15) (J), (Q)) and who substantially complies with the requirements of being admitted.
(4)
Student.
A student is any individual (and that individual's immediate family) who is admitted temporarily to the United States as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(F) or (M) (relating to the admission of students into the United States) or as a student under section 101(a)(15)(J) (relating to the admission of teachers and trainees into the United States) or section 101(a)(15)(Q) (relating to the admission of participants in international cultural exchange programs) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15) (F), (J), (M), (Q)) who substantially complies with the requirements of being admitted. For rules concerning taxation of certain nonresident students or trainees, see section 871(c) and § 1.871-9(a) of this chapter.
(5)
Professional athlete.
A professional athlete is an individual who is temporarily present in the United States to compete in a charitable sports event described in section 274(l)(1)(B). For
purposes of computing the days of presence in the United States, only days on which the athlete actually competes in a charitable sports event described in section 274(l)(1)(B) shall be excluded. Thus, days on which the individual is present to practice for the event, to perform promotional or other activities related to the event, or to travel between events shall be included for purposes of the substantial presence test.
(6)
Substantial compliance.
An individual described in paragraph (b) (3) or (4) of this section will be deemed to comply substantially with the visa requirements relevant to residence for tax purposes if the individual has not engaged in activities that are prohibited by the Immigration and Nationality Act and the regulations thereunder and could result in the loss of F, J or M visa status. An individual will not be deemed to comply substantially with the visa requirements relevant to residence for tax purposes merely by showing that the individual's visa has not been revoked. An independent determination of substantial compliance may be made by the Internal Revenue Service for any individual claiming to be an exempt individual under paragraph (b) (3) or (4) of this section. For example, if an individual with an F visa (student visa) is found to have accepted unauthorized employment or to have maintained a course of study that is not considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be full-time, the individual will not be considered to comply substantially with the individual's visa requirements regardless of whether the individual's visa has been revoked.
(7)
Limitation on teacher or trainee and student exemptions
—(i)
Teacher or trainee limitation in general.
Except as otherwise provided, an individual shall not exclude days of presence as a teacher or trainee if the individual has been exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of two of the six preceding calendar years.
(ii)
Special teacher or trainee limitation for section 872(b)(3) compensation.
If—
(A) A teacher or trainee receives compensation in the current year and all of that compensation is described in section 872(b)(3);
(B) That individual was present in the United States as a teacher or trainee in any prior year within the last 6 years; and
(C) During each prior year (within the 6 year period) in which the individual was present as a teacher or trainee, the individual received compensation all of which was described in section 872(b)(3);
Then that individual shall include days of presence as a teacher or trainee in the current year only if the individual has been exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of four of the six preceding calendar years.
(iii)
Limitation on student exemption.
An individual will not be able to exclude days of presence as a student if the individual has been exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of more than five calendar years, unless it is established to the satisfaction of the district director that the individual does not intend to reside permanently in the United States and has substantially complied with the requirements of the student visa providing for the individual's temporary presence in the United States. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(7), the facts and circumstances to be considered in determining if an individual has demonstrated an intent to reside permanently in the United States include (but are not limited to)—
(A) Whether the individual has maintained a closer connection with a foreign country as described in § 301.7701(b)-2; and
(B) Whether the individual has taken affirmative steps within the meaning of paragraph (f) of § 301.7701(b)-2 to adjust the individual's status from nonimmigrant to lawful permanent resident.
(iv)
Transition rule.
The rules in this paragraph (b)(7) relating to stated periods of exempt status apply only for those stated periods that occur after 1984. Thus, for example, an alien who is present as a student during the calendar years 1982-1990 will not be subject to the five year rule for students until 1990.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (b)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section:

# Example 1.
B is temporarily present in the United States during the current year as a teacher, within the meaning of section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. B does not receive compensation described in section 872(b)(3) in the current year. B has been treated as an exempt student for the past three years. Although this is the first year that B is seeking to be exempt as a teacher, he will not be considered an exempt individual for the year because he has been exempt as a student for at least two of the past six years.

# Example 2.
C is temporarily present in the United States during the current year as a teacher and receives compensation described in section 872(b)(3) in the current year. C has been treated as an exempt teacher for the past two years but C's compensation for those years was not described in section 872(b)(3). C will not be considered an exempt individual for the current year because she has been exempt as a teacher for at least two of the past six years.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that all of C's compensation for the two preceding years was described in section 872(b)(3). C will be considered to be an exempt individual for the current year because she has not been exempt as a student, teacher or trainee for four of the six preceding calendar years.

# Example 4.
D is temporarily present in the United States during the current year as a teacher, within the meaning of section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. D does not receive compensation described in section 872(b)(3) in the current year. D entered the United States in December of the second preceding year and intends to remain in the United States until June of the current year. D will not be considered an exempt individual for the current year because he has been exempt as a teacher for at least two of the past six years.
(8)
Immediate family.
The immediate family of an exempt individual includes the individual's spouse and unmarried children (whether by blood or adoption) but only if the spouse's or unmarried children's visa status are derived from and dependent on the visa classification of the exempt individual. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term
unmarried children
means those children who are under 21 years of age, who reside regularly in the household of the exempt individual, and who are not members of some other household. The immediate family of an exempt individual does not include the attendants, servants, and personal employees of that individual.
(c)
Medical condition
—(1)
In general.
An individual will not be considered present on any day that the individual intends to leave and is unable to leave the United States because of a medical condition or medical problem that arose while the individual was present in the United States. A day of presence will not be excluded if the individual, who was initially prevented from leaving, is subsequently able to leave the United States and then remains in the United States beyond a reasonable period for making arrangements to leave the United States. A day will also not be excluded if the medical condition arose during a prior stay in the United States (whether or not days of presence during the prior stay were excluded) and the alien returns to the United States for treatment of the medical condition or medical problem that arose during the prior stay.
(2)
Intent to leave the United States.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, whether an individual intends to leave the United States on a particular day will be determined based on all the facts and circumstances. Thus, if at the time an individual's medical condition or medical problem arose, the individual was present in the United States for a definite purpose which by its nature could be accomplished within the United States during a period of time that would not cause the individual to be a resident under the substantial presence test, the individual may be able to establish that he or she intended to leave the United States. However, if the individual's purpose is of such a nature that an extended period of time would be required for its accomplishment (sufficient to cause the individual to be a resident under the substanial presence test), the individual would not be able to establish the requisite intent to leave the United States. If the individual is present in the United States for no particular purpose or a purpose by its nature that does not require a specific period of time to accomplish, the determination of whether the individual has the requisite intent to leave the United States will depend on all
the surrounding facts and circumstances. In the case of an individual adjudicated mentally incompetent, proof of intent to leave the United States may be determined by analyzing the incompetent's pattern of behavior prior to the adjudication of incompetence. Generally, an individual will be presumed to have intended to leave during a period of illness if the individual leaves the United States within a reasonable period of time (time to make arrangements to leave) after becoming physically able to leave.
(3)
Pre-existing medical condition.
A medical condition or problem will not be considered to arise while the individual is present in the United States, if the condition or problem existed prior to the individual's arrival in the United States, and the individual was aware of the condition or problem, regardless of whether the individual required treatment for the condition or problem when the individual entered the United States.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1.
B is in a serious automobile accident in the United States on March 25. B intended to leave the United States on March 31 (as evidenced by an airline ticket), but was unable to leave on that date as a result of the injuries suffered in the accident. B recovered from the injuries and was able to leave and did leave the United States on May 31. B's presence in the United States during the period from April 1 through May 31 will not be counted as days of presence in the United States.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that B's return flight (as evidenced by an airline ticket) was scheduled for May 31. Because B did not intend to leave the United States until May 31, B may not exclude any days of presence in the United States.
(d)
Days in transit.
An alien individual may exclude days of presence in the United States if the individual is in transit between two foreign points, and is physically present in the United States for fewer than 24 hours. For purposes of this paragraph, an individual will be considered to be in transit if the individual pursues activities that are substantially related to completing his or her travel to a foreign point of destination. For example, an alien who travels between airports in the United States in order to change planes en route to the individual's destination will be considered to be in transit. However, if the individual attends a business meeting while he or she is present in the United States, whether or not that meeting is within the confines of the airport, the individual will not be considered to be in transit. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “foreign point” means any areas that are not included within the definition of the term “United States” provided in § 301.7701(b)-1(c)(2)(ii).
(e)
Regular commuters from Mexico or Canada
—(1)
General rule.
An alien individual will not be considered to be present in the United States on days that the individual commutes to the United States from the individual's residence in Mexico or Canada if the individual regularly commutes from Mexico or Canada. An alien individual will be considered to commute regularly if the individual commutes to the individual's location of employment or self-employment in the United States from his or her residence in Mexico or Canada on more than 75% of the workdays during the working period.
(2)
Definitions.
(i) The term
commutes
means to travel to employment or self-employment and to return to one's residence within a 24-hour period.
(ii) The term
workdays
means days on which the individual works in the United States or Canada or Mexico.
(iii) The term
working period
means the period beginning with the first day in the current year on which the individual is physically present in the United States for purposes of engaging in employment or self-employment and ending on the last day in the current year on which the individual is physically present in the United States for purposes of engaging in that employment or self-employment. If the nature of the employment or self-employment is such that it requires the individual to be present in the United States only on a seasonal or cyclical basis, the working period will begin with the first day of the season or cycle on which the individual is present in the United States for purposes of engaging in that employment or self-employment and
end on the last day of the season or cycle on which the individual is present in the United States for the purpose of engaging in that employment or self-employment. Thus, there may be more than one working period in a calendar year and a working period may begin in one calendar year and end in the following calendar year.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1.
B lives in Mexico and is employed by Corporation X in its office in Mexico. B was temporarily assigned to X's office in the United States. B's employment in the United States office began on February 1, 1988, and continued through June 1, 1988. On June 2, B resumed his employment in Mexico. On 59 days in the period beginning on February 1, 1988, and ending on June 1, 1988, B travelled each morning from his residence in Mexico to X Corporation's United States office for the purpose of engaging in his employment with X Corporation. B returned to his residence in Mexico on each of those evenings. On seven days in the period from February 1, 1988, through June 1, 1988, B worked in X's Mexico office. B is not considered to have been present in the United States on any of the days that he travelled to X's United States office for the purpose of engaging in employment with Corporation X because he commuted to his place of employment within the United States on more than 75% of the workdays during the working period (59 workdays in the United States/66 workdays in the working period = 89.4%).

# Example 2.
C, who lives in Canada, contracted with a resort located in the United States to provide snow-skiing instructions for the resort's customers for two skiing seasons, the first beginning on November 15, 1987, and ending on March 15, 1988, and the second beginning on November 15, 1988, and ending on March 15, 1989. On 90 days in each of the two skiing seasons, C travelled in the morning from Canada to the resort to provide skiing instructions pursuant to the contract. C returned to Canada on each of those evenings. On 20 days during each of the two skiing seasons, C worked in Canada. C is not considered to have been present in the United States on any of the days that she travelled to the United States to provide ski instructions in either the first working period beginning on November 15, 1987, and ending on March 15, 1988, or the second working period beginning on November 15, 1988, and ending on March 15, 1989, because she commuted to her employment within the United States on more than 75% of the workdays during each of the working periods (90 workdays in the United States/110 workdays in the working period = 81.8%).

# Example 3.
D, who lives in Canada, is the sole proprietor of a wholesale lumber business with offices in both the United States and Canada. Beginning on January 4, 1988, and ending on February 12, 1988, D commuted to work in his United States office on 30 days. Beginning on February 15, 1988, and ending on March 25, 1988, D commuted to work in his Canadian office on 30 days. Beginning on March 28, 1988, and ending on May 27, 1988, D commuted to work in his United States office on 45 days. Subsequent to May 27, D did not commute to the United States on any other days in 1988. D is considered to have been present in the United States on each day that he travelled to his office in the United States because D did not commute to the United States office on more than 75% of the workdays during the working period beginning on January 4, 1988, and ending on May 27, 1988 (75 workdays in the United States/105 workdays in the working period = 71.4%).
(f)
Determination of excluded days applies beyond year of determination.
If a day of presence is excluded under this section, then that day shall not be taken into account in the current year or the first or second preceding year.

§ 301.7701(b)-4
Residency time periods.
(a)
First year of residency.
An alien individual who was not a United States resident during the preceding calendar year and who is a United States resident for the current year will begin to be a resident for tax purposes on the alien's residency starting date. The residency starting date for an alien who meets the substantial presence test is the first day during the calendar year on which the individual is present in the United States. The residency starting date for an alien who meets the lawful permanent resident test (green card test), described in paragraph (b)(1) of § 301.7701(b)-1, is the first day during the calendar year in which the individual is physically present in the United States as a lawful permanent resident. The residency starting date for an alien who satisfies both the substantial presence test and the green card test will be the earlier of the first day the individual is physically present in the United States as a lawful permanent resident of the United States or
the first day during the year that the individual is present for purposes of the substantial presence test. (See § 301.7701(b)-9(b)(1) for the transitional rule relating to the residency starting date of an alien individual who was a lawful permanent resident in 1984. See also § 301.7701(b)-3 for days that may be excluded.)
(b)
Last year of residency
—(1)
General rule.
An alien individual who is a United States resident during the current year but who is not a United States resident at any time during the following calendar year will cease to be a resident for tax purposes on the individual's residency termination date. Generally, the residency termination date will be the last day of the calendar year.
(2)
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the residency termination date for an alien individual who meets the substantial presence test is the last day during the calendar year that the individual is physically present in the United States if the individual establishes that, for the remainder of the calendar year, the individual's tax home was in a foreign country and he or she maintained a closer connection (within the meaning of § 301.7701(b)-2(d)) to that foreign country than to the United States. Similarly, the residency termination date for an alien who meets the green card test is the first day during the calendar year that the alien is no longer a lawful permanent resident if the individual establishes that, for the remainder of the calendar year, his or her tax home was in a foreign country and he or she maintained a closer connection to that foreign country than to the United States. The residency termination date for an alien who satisfies both the substantial presence test and the green card test for the current year, will be the later of the first day the individual is no longer a lawful permanent resident of the United States or the last day the individual was physically present in the United States if the alien establishes that, for the remainder of the calendar year, his or her tax home was in a foreign country and he or she maintained a closer connection to that foreign country than to the United States. It is immaterial whether the individual's tax home was in the United States, or that the individual had a closer connection to the United States than to the foreign country, prior to the date of his or her departure from the United States or the date on which the individual was no longer a lawful permanent resident, whichever is applicable.
(c)
Rules relating to residency starting date and residency termination date
—(1)
De minimis presence.
An alien individual may be present in the United States for up to 10 days without triggering the residency starting date (for purposes of the substantial presence test) or extending the residency termination date (for purposes of the substantial presence test) if the individual is able to establish that, during that period, the individual's tax home was in a foreign country and he or she maintained a closer connection to that foreign country than to the United States. Days from more than one period of presence may be disregarded for purposes of determining an individual's residency starting date or termination date so long as the total is not more than 10 days. However, an individual may not disregard any days that occur in a period of consecutive days of presence, if all the days that occur during that period cannot be excluded. An individual must include days of presence for purposes of determining whether the individual meets the substantial presence test even though the days may be disregarded for purposes of determining the individual's residency starting date or residency termination date.
(2)
Proration.
If an individual's residency starting date does not fall on the first day of the tax year, or the individual's residency termination date does not fall on the last day of the tax year, the individual's income tax liability should be calculated in accordance with § 1.871-13 of this chapter dealing with the taxation of individuals who change residence status during the taxable year.
(3)
Residency starting date for certain individuals
—(i)
In general.
If an alien individual (who otherwise does not meet the substantial presence test or the green card test for the current year) is physically present in the United States for at least 31 consecutive days during
the current year, and also for a period of continuous presence beginning with the first day of that thirty-one day period (see paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section), then the individual may elect to be treated as a resident during the current year. The individual's residency starting date shall be the first day of that thirty-one day period, if—
(A) The individual was not a resident of the United States under the substantial presence test or the green card test in the year preceding the current year; and
(B) The individual is a resident of the United States in the subsequent year under the substantial presence test (whether or not the individual is also a resident of the United States under the green card test).
(ii)
Determination of presence.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, an individual shall be treated as present in the United States on any day that the individual is physically present in the United States at any time during the day.
(iii)
Thirty-one day period.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), the term
thirty-one day period
means any period of 31 consecutive days during which an individual is physically present in the United States during each day of the period.
(iv)
Period of continuous presence.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), the term
continuous presence
means a period of presence in the United States that includes 75 percent of the days in the current year beginning with (and including) the first day of the individual's thirty-one day period of presence. Only for purposes of the continuous presence requirement, an individual will be deemed to be present in the United States for up to 5 days on which the individual is absent from the United States. These days will not be deemed to be days of presence for purposes of the thirty-one day period of presence requirement. If an individual is present for more than one thirty-one day period of presence and satisfies the continuous presence requirement with regard to each period, the individual's residency starting date shall be the first day of the first thirty-one day period of presence. If an individual is present for more than one thirty-one day period of presence but satisfies the continuous presence requirement only for a later thirty-one day period, the individual's residency starting date shall be the first day of the later thirty-one day period of presence. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), days of presence that are otherwise excluded under section 7701(b)(3)(D)(i) and § 301.7701(b)-3(a)(1) (exempt individual), (a)(2) (medical condition), (a)(3) (in transit between two foreign points), and (a)(4) (regular commuter) shall not be counted as days of presence for purposes of either the thirty-one day period or continuous presence requirement.
(v)
Election procedure
—(A)
Filing requirements.
An alien individual shall make an election to be treated as a resident under paragraph (c)(3) of this section by attaching a statement (described in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(C) of this section) to the individual's income tax return (Form 1040) for the taxable year for which the election is to be in effect (the election year). The alien individual may not make this election until such time as he has satisfied the substantial presence test for the year following the election year. If an alien individual has not satisfied the substantial presence test for the year following the election year as of the due date (not including extensions) of the tax return for the election year, the alien individual may request an extension of time for filing the return until a reasonable period after he or she has satisfied such test, provided that the individual pays with his or her extension application the amount of tax he or she expects to owe for the election year computed as if he or she were a nonresident alien throughout the election year. An election made under paragraph (c)(3) of this section may not be revoked without the approval of the Commissioner or his delegate.
(B)
Election on behalf of a dependent child.
An individual may make an election on behalf of a dependent child (as defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 152(a), without regard to section 152(b)(3)) if the individual is qualified to make an election on his or her own behalf, the child qualifies to make an election under this paragraph (c)(3),
and the child is not required by section 6012 to file a United States income tax return for the year for which the election is to be effective.
(C)
Statement.
The statement required by paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A) of this section shall include the name and address of the alien individual and contain a signed declaration that the election is being made. If the individual is also making an election on behalf of any dependent children, then the statement must include the required information with respect to those children. The statement must specify—
(
1
) That the alien individual was not a resident in the year immediately preceding the election year;
(
2
) That the alien individual is a resident under the substantial presence test in the year following the election year;
(
3
) The individual's number of days of presence in the United States during the year following the election year;
(
4
) The date or dates of the alien individual's thirty-one day period of presence and period of continuous presence in the United States during the election year; and
(
5
) The date or dates of absence from the United States during the election year that are deemed to be days of presence.
(vi)
Penalty for failure to comply with filing requirements
—(A)
General rule.
If an individual fails to comply with the election procedure of paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section, the individual must file his or her income tax return for the current year as a nonresident alien.
(B)
Exception.
The penalty described in paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(A) of this section shall not apply if the individual can show by clear and convincing evidence that he or she took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant affirmative steps to comply with the requirements. An individual who requests an extension of time to file his or her income tax return pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section will be considered to have taken significant affirmative steps to comply with the requirement that the individual pay his or her tax determined as if the individual were a nonresident alien if the individual paid with his or her extension application at least 90 percent of the amount of the tax the individual actually owed for the election year computed as if he or she were a nonresident alien throughout the election year.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of this section:

# Example 1.
B, a citizen of foreign country X, is an alien who has never before been a United States resident for tax purposes. B comes to the United States on January 6, 1985, to attend a business meeting and returns to country X on January 10, 1985. B is able to establish a closer connection to country X for the period January 6-10. On March 1, 1985, B moves to the United States and resides here until August 20, 1985, when he returns to country X. On December 12, 1985, B comes to the United States for pleasure and stays here until December 16, 1985 when he returns to country X. B is able to establish a closer connection to country X for the period December 12-16. B is not a United States resident for tax purposes during the following year and can establish a closer connection to country X for the remainder of calendar year 1985. B is a resident of the United States under the substantial presence test because B is present in the United States for 183 days (5 days in January plus 173 days for the period March 1-August 20 plus 5 days in December). B's residency starting date is March 1, 1985, and his residency termination date is August 20, 1985.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that B remains in the United States until December 17, 1985, and is able to establish a closer connection to country X for the period December 18 through 31. B's residency termination date is December 17, 1985.

# Example 3.
C, a citizen of foreign country Y, is an alien who has never before been a United States resident for tax purposes. C comes to the United States for the first time on February 10, 1985, and attends a business conference until February 24, 1985, when she returns to country Y. On April 20, 1985, C enters the United States as a lawful permanent resident. On November 10, 1985, C ceases to be a lawful permanent resident but stays on in the United States until November 20, 1985 when she returns to country Y. On December 8, 1985, C comes to the United States and stays here until December 17, 1985 when she returns to country Y. She can establish a closer connection to country Y for that period. C is not a resident of the United States during the following calendar year and can establish a closer connection to country Y for the remainder of calendar year 1985. C qualifies as a United States resident under both the green card test and the substantial presence test. C's residency starting date
under the green card test is April 20, 1985. Under the substantial presence test, C's residency starting date is February 10, 1985, because she is present for more than ten days in February and cannot take advantage of the de minimis presence rule. Therefore, C's residency starting date is February 10, 1985. C's residency termination date under the green card test is November 10, 1985. Her residency termination date under the substantial presence test is November 20, because B can disregard ten days of presence in December. Thus, her residency termination date is November 20, 1985, the later of her residency termination date under the substantial presence test or the green card test.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that C is initially present in the United States on business from February 5 to February 9, 1985. C is able to establish a closer connection to country Y for that period. C may take advantage of only ten days of de minimis presence and may exclude days from a continuous period of presence only if she can exclude all the days that occur during that period. Thus, C may choose either of the following periods of residency: residency starting date February 5, 1985, and residency termination date November 20, 1985, or residency starting date April 20, 1985, and residency termination date December 17, 1985.

# Example 5.
D, a citizen of foreign country Z, is an alien who has never before been a United States resident for tax purposes. D comes to the United States on November 1, 1985 and is present in the United States on 31 consecutive days (from November 1 through December 1, 1985). D returns to country Z on December 1 and does not come back to the United States until December 17, 1985. He remains in the United States for the rest of the year. During 1986, D is a resident of the United States under the substantial presence test. D may elect to be treated as a resident of the United States for 1985 because he was present in the United States in 1985 for a 31 consecutive day period of presence (November 1 through December 1, 1985) and for at least 75 percent of the days following (and including) the first day of D's 31 consecutive day period of presence (46 total days of presence in the United States/61 days in the period from November 1 through December 31 = 75.4%). If D makes the election to be treated as a resident, his residency starting date will be November 1, 1985.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5,
except that D is absent from the United States on December 24, 25, 29, 30 and 31. D may make the election to be treated as a resident for 1985 because up to five days of absence will be deemed to be days of presence for purposes of the continuous presence requirement.

# Example 7.
F, a citizen of foreign country M, is an alien individual who has never before been a United States resident for tax purposes. F comes to the United States on January 1, 1985 and remains in the United States through January 31, 1985, when she returns to country M. F comes back to the United States on October 1, 1985 and is present in the United States through November 1, 1985. From November 1, 1985 through December 31, 1985, F is present in the United States for 38 days. Although F satisfies two 31 consecutive day periods of presence, (January 1 through January 31 and October 1 through November 1), she satisfies the continuous presence requirement only with regard to the later period of presence (69 total days of presence/92 days in the period from October 1 through December 31 = 75%). Thus, if F makes the election to be treated as a resident, his residency starting date is October 1, 1985.
(e)
No lapse
—(1)
Residency in prior year.
An alien individual who was a United States resident during any part of the preceding calendar year and who is a United States resident for any part of the current year will be considered to be taxable as a resident at the beginning of the current year. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1), it is immaterial whether an individual is considered to be a resident under the substantial presence test or the green card test.
(2)
Residency in following year.
An alien individual who is a United States resident for any part of the current year and who is also a United States resident for any part of the following year (regardless of whether the individual has a closer connection to a foreign country than the United States during the current year) will be taxable as a resident through the end of the current year. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2), it is immaterial whether an individual is considered to be a resident under the substantial presence test or the green card test.
(3)
Special rule.
If an individual meets the green card test for the current year but is not physically present in the United States during the current year, then the individual's residency starting date shall be the first day of the following year.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e).

# Example.
B, an alien individual who is a citizen of foreign country M, comes to the United States for the first time on May 1, 1985, and remains in the United States until November 5, 1985, when he returns to country
M. B comes back to the United States on March 5, 1986 as a lawful permanent resident and remains in the United States until September 10, 1986, when he ceases to be a lawful permanent resident and returns to country M. B is not a resident in calendar year 1987. B's United States residency in calendar year 1985 continues through December 31, 1985, because he is a United States resident in the following calendar year. In calendar year 1986, B's United States residency is deemed to begin on January 1, 1986 because B qualified as a resident in the preceding calendar year. Thus, B's residency period in the United States begins on May 1, 1985, and ends on September 10, 1986.

§ 301.7701(b)-5
Coordination with section 877.
(a)
General rule.
An alien individual will be subject to United States income tax in the manner provided by section 877, regardless of whether the individual has a tax avoidance motive, if—
(1) The alien individual is a resident alien of the United States for at least three consecutive calendar years (the initial residency period) beginning after December 31, 1984;
(2) The period of residence for each of the three consecutive calendar years includes at least 183 days;
(3) The alien is once again taxed as a nonresident (including an individual taxed as a nonresident) under § 301.7701(b)-7(a)(1); and
(4) The alien then becomes a resident of the United States before the close of the third calendar year beginning after the individual's residency termination date in the initial residency period.
(b)
Tax imposed.
The tax provided for under paragraph (a) of this section will be imposed for the intervening period of nonresidency only if the amount of tax would exceed the amount of tax that would be imposed under section 871, relating to the taxation of nonresident aliens.
(c)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this section.

# Example.
B, a citizen of foreign country F, enters the United States on April 1, 1985, as a lawful permanent resident. On August 1, 1987, B ceases to be a lawful permanent resident and returns to country F. B meets the initial residency period requirement because he is a resident of the United States for at least 183 days in each of three consecutive years (1985, 1986 and 1987). B returns to the United States on October 5, 1990, as a lawful permanent resident. Because B became a resident of the United States before the close of the third calendar year (1990) beginning after the close of the initial residency period (August 1, 1987), he is subject to tax under section 877(b) for the intervening period of nonresidency, August 2, 1987 through October 4, 1990, if the amount of the tax imposed under section 877 is more than the tax imposed under section 871.
[T.D. 8411, 57 FR 15250, Apr. 27, 1992]
§ 301.7701(b)-6
Taxable year.
(a)
In general.
An alien individual who has not established a fiscal year as his or her taxable year prior to the period that the individual is subject to United States income tax as a resident or a nonresident shall adopt the calendar year as his or her taxable year. An alien who has established a fiscal year in a foreign country prior to the period that the individual is subject to United States income tax may adopt the calendar year as his or her taxable year for United States income tax purposes without requesting a change in accounting period. An individual will be considered to have established a fiscal year (whether in the United States or a foreign country) if the annual accounting period on which the individual computes his or her income is a fiscal year, the individual keeps his or her books in accordance with that fiscal year, and the requirements of section 441 and § 1.441-1(b) of this chapter are otherwise satisfied. An alien who has established a fiscal year and is a resident alien during the calendar year will be treated as a resident alien with respect to any portion of his or her taxable year (beginning with the individual's residency starting date and ending with the individual's residency termination date) that falls within such calendar year. Once the individual has established either a fiscal or calendar year taxable year for any period for which the individual is subject to United States income tax, the individual may not change that taxable year without the approval of the Secretary. See section 442.
(b)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of this section:

# Example 1.
B, a citizen and resident of foreign country F, was engaged in a United States business during 1982 and filed a return on a fiscal year basis. B's fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30. B comes to the United States on March 8, 1985 and remains in the United States until October 10, 1985, when he returns to country F. B maintains a closer connection to and his tax home in Country F for the remainder of calendar year 1985. B, who is not a United States resident at any time in 1986, is a United States resident for the period that begins on March 8, 1985, and ends on October 10, 1985. B has adopted a fiscal year taxable year for purposes of computing his United States income tax liability. For his fiscal year that ends on September 30, 1985, B will be taxed as a United States resident for the period that begins on March 8, 1985 and ends on September 30, 1985. For his fiscal year that ends on September 30, 1986, B will only be taxed as a United States resident for the period that begins on October 1, 1985 and ends on October 10, 1985.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that B's 1982 business was a country F business established on a fiscal year basis and at no time prior to 1985 was B subject to United States income tax. B may adopt a calendar year as his taxable year for United States income tax purposes without requesting a change of accounting period. B continues to use a fiscal year as his taxable year. For his fiscal year that ends on September 30, 1985, B will be taxed as a United States resident for the period that begins on March 8, 1985 and ends September 30, 1985. For his fiscal year that ends on September 30, 1986, B will be taxed as a United States resident for the period that begins on October 1, 1985 and ends on October 10, 1985.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that B's 1982 business was a country F business established on a fiscal year basis and at no time prior to 1985 was B subject to United States income tax. B may adopt a calendar year as his taxable year for United States income tax purposes without requesting a change of accounting period. B adopts a calendar year as his taxable year for 1985. For his calendar year taxable year ending on December 31, 1985, B will be taxed as a United States resident for the period that begins on March 8, 1985, and ends on October 10, 1985.
[T.D. 8411, 57 FR 15250, Apr. 27, 1992; 57 FR 28612, June 26, 1992, as amended by T.D. 8996, 67 FR 35012, May 17, 2002]
§ 301.7701(b)-7
Coordination with income tax treaties.
(a)
Consistency requirement
—(1)
Application.
The application of this section shall be limited to an alien individual who is a dual resident taxpayer pursuant to a provision of a treaty that provides for resolution of conflicting claims of residence by the United States and its treaty partner. A “dual resident taxpayer” is an individual who is considered a resident of the United States pursuant to the internal laws of the United States and also a resident of a treaty country pursuant to the treaty partner's internal laws. If the alien individual determines that he or she is a resident of the foreign country for treaty purposes, and the alien individual claims a treaty benefit (as a nonresident of the United States) so as to reduce the individual's United States income tax liability with respect to any item of income covered by an applicable tax convention during a taxable year in which the individual was considered a dual resident taxpayer, then that individual shall be treated as a nonresident alien of the United States for purposes of computing that individual's United States income tax liability under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder (including the withholding provisions of section 1441 and the regulations under that section in cases in which the dual resident taxpayer is the recipient of income subject to withholding) with respect to that portion of the taxable year the individual was considered a dual resident taxpayer.
(2)
Computation of tax liability.
If an alien individual is a dual resident taxpayer, then the rules on residency provided in the convention shall apply for purposes of determining the individual's residence for all purposes of that treaty.
(3)
Other Code purposes.
Generally, for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code other than the computation of the individual's United States income tax liability, the individual shall be treated as a United States resident. Therefore, for example, the individual shall be treated as a United States resident for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation under section 957 or whether a foreign corporation is a foreign personal holding company under section 552. In addition, the application of paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not
affect the determination of the individual's residency time periods under § 301.7701(b)-4.
(4)
Special rules for S corporations.
[Reserved]
(b)
Filing requirements.
An alien individual described in paragraph (a) of this section who determines his or her U.S. tax liability as if he or she were a nonresident alien shall make a return on Form 1040NR on or before the date prescribed by law (including extensions) for making an income tax return as a nonresident. The individual shall prepare a return and compute his or her tax liability as a nonresident alien. The individual shall attach a statement (in the form required in paragraph (c) of this section) to the Form 1040NR. The Form 1040NR and the attached statement, shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255. The filing of a Form 1040NR by an individual described in paragraph (a) of this section may affect the determination by the Immigration and Naturalization Service as to whether the individual qualifies to maintain a residency permit.

For returns relating to taxable years for which the due date for filing returns (without extensions) is on or before December 15, 1997, the statement filed by the individual described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must contain the information in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section in effect prior to December 15, 1997 (see § 301.7701(b)-7(c)(1) as contained in 26 CFR part 301, revised April 1, 1997).
(2)
Controlled foreign corporation shareholders.
If the taxpayer who claims a treaty benefit as a nonresident of the United States is a United States shareholder in a controlled foreign corporation (CFC), as defined in section 957 or section 953(c), and there are no other United States shareholders in that CFC, then for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the approximate amount of subpart F income (as defined in section 952) that would have been included in the taxpayer's income may be determined based on the audited foreign financial statements of the CFC.
(3)
S corporation shareholders.
[Reserved]
(d)
Relationship to section 6114(a) treaty-based return positions.
The statement required by paragraph (b) of this section will be considered disclosure for purposes of section 6114 and § 301.6114-1(a), but only if the statement is in the form required by paragraph (c) of this section. If the taxpayer fails to file the statement required by paragraph (b) of this section on or before the date prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, the taxpayer will be subject to the penalties imposed by section 6712. See section 6712 and § 301.6712-1.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
B, an alien individual, is a resident of foreign country X, under X's internal law. Country X is a party to an income tax convention with the United States. B is also a resident of the United States under the Internal Revenue Code. B is considered to be a resident of country X under the convention. The convention does not specifically deal with characterization of foreign corporations as controlled foreign corporations or the taxability of United States shareholders on inclusions of subpart F income, but it provides, in an “Other Income” article similar to Article 21 of the 1981 draft of the United States Model Income Tax Convention (U.S. Model), that items of income of a resident of country X that are not specifically dealt with in the convention shall be taxable only in country X. B owns 80% of the one class of stock of foreign corporation R. The remaining 20% is owned by C, a United States citizen who is unrelated to B. In 1985, corporation R's only income is interest that is foreign personal holding company income under § 1.954A-2 of this chapter. Because the United States-X income tax convention does not deal with characterization of foreign corporations as controlled foreign corporations, United States internal income tax law applies.
Therefore, B and C are United States shareholders within the meaning of § 1.951-1(g) of this chapter, corporation R is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of § 1.957-1 of this chapter, and corporation R's income is included in C's income as subpart F income under § 1.951-1 of this chapter. B may avoid current taxation on his share of the subpart F inclusion by filing as a nonresident (
i.e.,
by following the procedure in § 301.7701(b)-7(b)).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that B also earns United States source dividend income. The United States-X income tax convention provides that the rate of United States tax on United States source dividends paid to residents of country X shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. B's United States tax liability with respect to the dividends would be smaller if he were treated as a resident alien, subject to tax on a net basis (
i.e.,
after the allowance of deductions) than if he were treated as a nonresident alien. If, however, B chooses to file as a nonresident in order to claim treaty benefits with respect to his share of R's subpart F income, his overall United States tax liability, including the portion attributable to the dividends, must be determined as if he were a nonresident alien.

# Example 3.
C, a married alien individual with three children, is a resident of foreign country Y, under Y's internal law. Country Y is a party to an income tax convention with the United States. C is also a resident of the United States under the Internal Revenue Code. C is considered to be a resident of country Y under the convention. The convention specifically covers, among other items of income, personal services income, dividends and interest. C is sent by her country Y employer to work in the United States from January 1, 1985 until December 31, 1985. During 1985, C also earns United States source dividends and interest and incurs mortgage interest expenses on her personal residence. The United States-Y treaty provides that remuneration for personal services performed in the United States by a country Y resident is exempt from United States tax if, among other things, the individual performing such services is present in the United States for a period that is not in excess of 183 days. The treaty provides that the rate of United States tax on United States source dividends paid to residents of Y shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends and it exempts residents of Y from United States tax on United States source interest. In filing her 1985 tax return, C may choose to file either as a resident alien without claiming any treaty benefits or as a nonresident alien if she desires to claim any treaty benefit. C files as a nonresident (
i.e.
by following the procedure described in § 301.7701(b)-7(b)). Because C does not satisfy the requirements of the United States-Y treaty with regard to exempting personal services income from United States tax, C will be taxed on her personal services income at graduated rates under section 1 of the Code pursuant to section 871(b) of the Code. She will not be entitled to deduct her mortgage interest expenses or to claim more than one personal exemption because she is taxed as a nonresident alien under the Code by virtue of her decision to claim treaty benefits, and section 873 of the Code denies nonresidents the deduction for personal residence mortgage interest expense and generally limits them to only one personal exemption. C will be subject to a tax of 15 percent of the gross amount of her dividend income under section 871(a) of the Code as modified by the treaty, and she will be exempt from tax on her interest income. C is not entitled to file a joint return with her spouse even if he is a resident alien under the Code for 1985.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that C does not choose to claim treaty benefits with respect to any items of income covered by the treaty (
i.e.,
she files as a resident). Therefore, she is taxed as a resident under the Code and pays tax at graduated rates on her personal services income, dividends, and interest. In addition, she is entitled to deduct her mortgage interest expenses and to take personal exemptions for her spouse and three children. C will be entitled to file a joint return with her spouse if he is a resident alien for 1985 or, if he is a nonresident alien, C and her spouse may elect to file a joint return pursuant to section 6013.

§ 301.7701(i)-1
Definition of a taxable mortgage pool.
(a)
Purpose.
This section provides rules for applying section 7701(i), which defines taxable mortgage pools. The purpose of section 7701(i) is to prevent income generated by a pool of real estate mortgages from escaping Federal
income taxation when the pool is used to issue multiple class mortgage-backed securities. The regulations in this section and in §§ 301.7701(i)-2 through 301.7701(i)-4 are to be applied in accordance with this purpose. The taxable mortgage pool provisions apply to entities or portions of entities that qualify for REMIC status but do not elect to be taxed as REMICs as well as to certain entities or portions of entities that do not qualify for REMIC status.
(b)
In general.
(1) A taxable mortgage pool is any entity or portion of an entity (as defined in § 301.7701(i)-2) that satisfies the requirements of section 7701(i)(2)(A) and this section as of any testing day (as defined in § 301.7701(i)-3(c)(2)). An entity or portion of an entity satisfies the requirements of section 7701(i)(2)(A) and this section if substantially all of its assets are debt obligations, more than 50 percent of those debt obligations are real estate mortgages, the entity is the obligor under debt obligations with two or more maturities, and payments on the debt obligations under which the entity is obligor bear a relationship to payments on the debt obligations that the entity holds as assets.
(2) Paragraph (c) of this section provides the tests for determining whether substantially all of an entity's assets are debt obligations and for determining whether more than 50 percent of its debt obligations are real estate mortgages. Paragraph (d) of this section defines real estate mortgages for purposes of the 50 percent test. Paragraph (e) of this section defines two or more maturities and paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining whether debt obligations bear a relationship to the assets held by an entity. Paragraph (g) of this section provides anti-avoidance rules. Section 301.7701(i)-2 provides rules for applying section 7701(i) to portions of entities and § 301.7701(i)-3 provides effective dates. Section 301.7701(i)-4 provides special rules for certain entities. For purposes of the regulations under section 7701(i), the term entity includes a portion of an entity (within the meaning of section 7701(i)(2)(B)), unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
(c)
Asset composition tests
—(1)
Determination of amount of assets.
An entity must use the Federal income tax basis of an asset for purposes of determining whether substantially all of its assets consist of debt obligations (or interests therein) and whether more than 50 percent of those debt obligations (or interests) consist of real estate mortgages (or interests therein). For purposes of this paragraph, an entity determines the basis of an asset with the assumption that the entity is not a taxable mortgage pool.
(2)
Substantially all
—(i)
In general.
Whether substantially all of the assets of an entity consist of debt obligations (or interests therein) is based on all the facts and circumstances.
(ii)
Safe harbor.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, if less than 80 percent of the assets of an entity consist of debt obligations (or interests therein), then less than substantially all of the assets of the entity consist of debt obligations (or interests therein).
(3)
Equity interests in pass-through arrangements.
The equity interest of an entity in a partnership, S corporation, trust, REIT, or other pass-through arrangement is deemed to have the same composition as the entity's share of the assets of the pass-through arrangement. For example, if an entity's stock interest in a REIT has an adjusted basis of $20,000, and the assets of the REIT consist of equal portions of real estate mortgages and other real estate assets, then the entity is treated as holding $10,000 of real estate mortgages and $10,000 of other real estate assets.
(4)
Treatment of certain credit enhancement contracts
—(i)
In general.
A credit enhancement contract (as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section) is not treated as a separate asset of an entity for purposes of the asset composition tests set forth in section 7701(i)(2)(A)(i), but instead is treated as part of the asset to which it relates. Furthermore, any collateral supporting a credit enhancement contract is not treated as an asset of an entity solely because it supports the guarantee represented by that contract.
(ii)
Credit enhancement contract defined.
For purposes of this section, a
credit enhancement contract is any arrangement whereby a person agrees to guarantee full or partial payment of the principal or interest payable on a debt obligation (or interest therein) or on a pool of such obligations (or interests), or full or partial payment on one or more classes of debt obligations under which an entity is the obligor, in the event of defaults or delinquencies on debt obligations, unanticipated losses or expenses incurred by the entity, or lower than expected returns on investments. Types of credit enhancement contracts may include, but are not limited to, pool insurance contracts, certificate guarantee insurance contracts, letters of credit, guarantees, or agreements whereby an entity, a mortgage servicer, or other third party agrees to make advances (regardless of whether, under the terms of the agreement, the payor is obligated, or merely permitted, to make those advances). An agreement by a debt servicer to advance to an entity out of its own funds an amount to make up for delinquent payments on debt obligations is a credit enhancement contract. An agreement by a debt servicer to pay taxes and hazard insurance premiums on property securing a debt obligation, or other expenses incurred to protect an entity's security interests in the collateral in the event that the debtor fails to pay such taxes, insurance premiums, or other expenses, is a credit enhancement contract.
(5)
Certain assets not treated as debt obligations
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A), real estate mortgages that are seriously impaired are not treated as debt obligations. Whether a mortgage is seriously impaired is based on all the facts and circumstances including, but not limited to: the number of days delinquent, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt service coverage (based upon the operating income from the property), and the debtor's financial position and stake in the property. However, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, no single factor in and of itself is determinative of whether a loan is seriously impaired.
(ii)
Safe harbor
—(A)
In general.
Unless an entity is receiving or anticipates receiving payments with respect to a mortgage, a single family residential real estate mortgage is seriously impaired if payments on the mortgage are more than 89 days delinquent, and a multi-family residential or commercial real estate mortgage is seriously impaired if payments on the mortgage are more than 59 days delinquent. Whether an entity anticipates receiving payments with respect to a mortgage is based on all the facts and circumstances.
(B)
Payments with respect to a mortgage defined.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, payments with respect to a mortgage mean any payments on the mortgage as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section if those payments are substantial and relatively certain as to amount and any payments on the mortgage as defined in paragraph (f)(2) (ii) or (iii) of this section.
(C)
Entity treated as not anticipating payments.
With respect to any testing day (as defined in § 301.7701(i)-3(c)(2)), an entity is treated as not having anticipated receiving payments on the mortgage as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section if 180 days after the testing day, and despite making reasonable efforts to resolve the mortgage, the entity is not receiving such payments and has not entered into any agreement to receive such payments.
(d)
Real estate mortgages or interests therein defined
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(i), the term real estate mortgages (or interests therein) includes all—
(i) Obligations (including participations or certificates of beneficial ownership therein) that are principally secured by an interest in real property (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section);
(ii) Regular and residual interests in a REMIC; and
(iii) Stripped bonds and stripped coupons (as defined in section 1286(e) (2) and (3)) if the bonds (as defined in section 1286(e)(1)) from which such stripped bonds or stripped coupons arose would have qualified as real estate mortgages or interests therein.
(2)
Interests in real property and real property defined
—(i)
In general.
The definition of interests in real property set forth in § 1.856-3(c) of this chapter and
the definition of real property set forth in § 1.856-3(d) of this chapter apply to define those terms for purposes of paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii)
Manufactured housing.
For purposes of this section, the definition of real property includes manufactured housing, provided the properties qualify as single family residences under section 25(e)(10) and without regard to the treatment of the properties under state law.
(3)
Principally secured by an interest in real property
—(i)
Tests for determining whether an obligation is principally secured.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an obligation is principally secured by an interest in real property only if it satisfies either the test set out in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section or the test set out in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
(A)
The 80 percent test.
An obligation is principally secured by an interest in real property if the fair market value of the interest in real property (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) securing the obligation was at least equal to 80 percent of the adjusted issue price of the obligation at the time the obligation was originated (that is, the issue date). For purposes of this test, the fair market value of the real property interest is first reduced by the amount of any lien on the real property interest that is senior to the obligation being tested, and is reduced further by a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the obligation being tested.
(B)
Alternative test.
An obligation is principally secured by an interest in real property if substantially all of the proceeds of the obligation were used to acquire, improve, or protect an interest in real property that, at the origination date, is the only security for the obligation. For purposes of this test, loan guarantees made by Federal, state, local governments or agencies, or other third party credit enhancement, are not viewed as additional security for a loan. An obligation is not considered to be secured by property other than real property solely because the obligor is personally liable on the obligation.
(ii)
Obligations secured by real estate mortgages (or interests therein), or by combinations of real estate mortgages (or interests therein) and other assets
—(A)
In general.
An obligation secured only by real estate mortgages (or interests therein), as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, is treated as an obligation secured by an interest in real property to the extent of the value of the real estate mortgages (or interests therein). An obligation secured by both real estate mortgages (or interests therein) and other assets is treated as an obligation secured by an interest in real property to the extent of both the value of the real estate mortgages (or interests therein) and the value of so much of the other assets that constitute real property. Thus, under this paragraph, a collateralized mortgage obligation may be an obligation principally secured by an interest in real property. This section is applicable only to obligations issued after December 31, 1991.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii):

# Example.
At the time it is originated, an obligation has an adjusted issue price of $300,000 and is secured by a $70,000 loan principally secured by an interest in a single family home, a fifty percent co-ownership interest in a $400,000 parcel of land, and $80,000 of stock. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the obligation is treated as secured by interests in real property and under paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the obligation is treated as principally secured by interests in real property.
(e)
Two or more maturities
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(ii), debt obligations have two or more maturities if they have different stated maturities or if the holders of the obligations possess different rights concerning the acceleration of or delay in the maturities of the obligations.
(2)
Obligations that are allocated credit risk unequally.
Debt obligations that are allocated credit risk unequally do not have, by that reason alone, two or more maturities. Credit risk is the risk that payments of principal or interest will be reduced or delayed because of a default on an asset that supports the debt obligations.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1.
(i) Corporation M transfers a pool of real estate mortgages to a trustee in exchange for Class A bonds and a certificate representing the residual beneficial ownership of the pool. All Class A bonds have a stated maturity of March 1, 2002, but if cash flows from the real estate mortgages and investments are sufficient, the trustee may select one or more bonds at random and redeem them earlier.
(ii) The Class A bonds do not have different maturities. Each outstanding Class A bond has an equal chance of being redeemed because the selection process is random. The holders of the Class A bonds, therefore, have identical rights concerning the maturities of their obligations.

# Example 2.
(i) Corporation N transfers a pool of real estate mortgages to a trustee in exchange for Class C bonds, Class D bonds, and a certificate representing the residual beneficial ownership of the pool. The Class D bonds are subordinate to the Class C bonds so that cash flow shortfalls due to defaults or delinquencies on the real estate mortgages are borne first by the Class D bond holders. The terms of the bonds are otherwise identical in all relevant aspects except that the Class D bonds carry a higher coupon rate because of the subordination feature.
(ii) The Class C bonds and the Class D bonds share credit risk unequally because of the subordination feature. However, neither this difference, nor the difference in interest rates, causes the bonds to have different maturities. The result is the same if, in addition to the other terms described in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2,
the Class C bonds are accelerated as a result of the issuer becoming unable to make payments on the Class C bonds as they become due.
(f)
Relationship test
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(iii), payments on debt obligations under which an entity is the obligor (liability obligations) bear a relationship to payments (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) on debt obligations an entity holds as assets (asset obligations) if under the terms of the liability obligations (or underlying arrangement) the timing and amount of payments on the liability obligations are in large part determined by the timing and amount of payments or projected payments on the asset obligations. For purposes of the relationship test, any payment arrangement, including a swap or other hedge, that achieves a substantially similar result is treated as satisfying the test. For example, any arrangement where the timing and amount of payments on liability obligations are determined by reference to a group of assets (or an index or other type of model) that has an expected payment experience similar to that of the asset obligations is treated as satisfying the relationship test.
(2)
Payments on asset obligations defined.
For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(iii) and this section, payments on asset obligations include—
(i) A payment of principal or interest on an asset obligation, including a prepayment of principal, a payment under a credit enhancement contract (as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section) and a payment from a settlement at a discount (other than a substantial discount);
(ii) A payment from a settlement at a substantial discount, but only if the settlement is arranged, whether in writing or otherwise, prior to the issuance of the liability obligations; and
(iii) A payment from the foreclosure on or sale of an asset obligation, but only if the foreclosure or sale is arranged, whether in writing or otherwise, prior to the issuance of the liability obligations.
(3)
Safe harbor for entities formed to liquidate assets.
Payments on liability obligations of an entity do not bear a relationship to payments on asset obligations of the entity if—
(i) The entity's organizational documents manifest clearly that the entity is formed for the primary purpose of liquidating its assets and distributing proceeds of liquidation;
(ii) The entity's activities are all reasonably necessary to and consistent with the accomplishment of liquidating assets;
(iii) The entity plans to satisfy at least 50 percent of the total issue price of each of its liability obligations having a different maturity with proceeds from liquidation and not with scheduled payments on its asset obligations; and
(iv) The terms of the entity's liability obligations (or underlying arrangement) provide that within three years of the time it first acquires assets to be liquidated the entity either—
(A) Liquidates; or
(B) Begins to pass through without delay all payments it receives on its asset obligations (less reasonable allowances for expenses) as principal payments on its liability obligations in proportion to the adjusted issue prices of the liability obligations.
(g)
Anti-avoidance rules
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining whether an entity meets the definition of a taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can disregard or make other adjustments to a transaction (or series of transactions) if the transaction (or series) is entered into with a view to achieving the same economic effect as that of an arrangement subject to section 7701(i) while avoiding the application of that section. The Commissioner's authority includes treating equity interests issued by a non-REMIC as debt if the entity issues equity interests that correspond to maturity classes of debt.
(2)
Certain investment trusts.
Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this section, an ownership interest in an entity that is classified as a trust under § 301.7701-4(c) will not be treated as a debt obligation of the trust.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (g):

# Example 1.
(i) Partnership P, in addition to its other investments, owns $10,000,000 of mortgage pass-through certificates guaranteed by FNMA (FNMA Certificates). On May 15, 1997, Partnership P transfers the FNMA Certificates to Trust 1 in exchange for 100 Class A bonds and Certificate 1. The Class A bonds, under which Trust 1 is the obligor, have a stated principal amount of $5,000,000 and bear a relationship to the FNMA Certificates (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-1(f)). Certificate 1 represents the residual beneficial ownership of the FNMA Certificates.
(ii) On July 5, 1997, with a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i), Partnership P transfers Certificate 1 to Trust 2 in exchange for 100 Class B bonds and Certificate 2. The Class B bonds, under which Trust 2 is the obligor, have a stated principal amount of $5,000,000, bear a relationship to the FNMA Certificates (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-1(f)), and have a different maturity than the Class A bonds (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-1(e)). Certificate 2 represents the residual beneficial ownership of Certificate 1.
(iii) For purposes of determining whether Trust 1 is classified as a taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can disregard the separate existence of Trust 2 and treat Trust 1 and Trust 2 as a single trust.

# Example 2.
(i) Corporation Q files a consolidated return with its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Corporation R and Corporation S. Corporation R is in the business of building and selling single family homes. Corporation S is in the business of financing sales of those homes.
(ii) On August 10, 1998, Corporation S transfers a pool of its real estate mortgages to Trust 3, taking back Certificate 3 which represents beneficial ownership of the pool. On September 25, 1998, with a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i), Corporation R issues bonds that have different maturities (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-1(e)) and that bear a relationship (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-1(f)) to the real estate mortgages in Trust 3. The holders of the bonds have an interest in a credit enhancement contract that is written by Corporation S and collateralized with Certificate 3.
(iii) For purposes of determining whether Trust 3 is classified as a taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat Trust 3 as the obligor of the bonds issued by Corporation R.

# Example 3.
(i) Corporation X, in addition to its other assets, owns $110,000,000 in Treasury securities. From time to time, Corporation X acquires pools of real estate mortgages, which it immediately uses to issue multiple-class debt obligations.
(ii) On October 1, 1996, Corporation X transfers $20,000,000 in Treasury securities to Trust 4 in exchange for Class C bonds, Class D bonds, Class E bonds, and Certificate 4. Trust 4 is the obligor of the bonds. The different classes of bonds have the same stated maturity date, but if cash flows from the Trust 4 assets exceed the amounts needed to make interest payments, the trustee uses the excess to retire the classes of bonds in alphabetical order. Certificate 4 represents the residual beneficial ownership of the Treasury securities.
(iii) With a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i), Corporation X reserves the right to replace any Trust 4 asset with real estate mortgages or guaranteed mortgage pass-through certificates. In the event the right is exercised, cash flows on the real estate mortgages and guaranteed pass-through certificates will be used in the same manner as cash flows on the Treasury securities. Corporation X exercises this right of replacement on February 1, 1997.
(iv) For purposes of determining whether Trust 4 is classified as a taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat February 1, 1997, as a testing day (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-3(c)(2)). The result is the same if Corporation X has an obligation, rather than a right, to replace the Trust 4 assets
with real estate mortgages and guaranteed pass-through certificates.

# Example 4.
(i) Corporation Y, in addition to its other assets, owns $1,900,000 in obligations secured by personal property. On November 1, 1995, Corporation Y begins negotiating a $2,000,000 loan to individual A. As security for the loan, A offers a first deed of trust on land worth $1,700,000.
(ii) With a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i), Corporation Y induces A to place the land in a partnership in which A will have a 95 percent interest and agrees to accept the partnership interest as security for the $2,000,000 loan. Thereafter, the loan to A, together with the $1,900,000 in obligations secured by personal property, are transferred to Trust 5 and used to issue bonds that have different maturities (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-1(e)) and that bear a relationship (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-1(f)) to the $1,900,000 in obligations secured by personal property and the loan to A.
(iii) For purposes of determining whether Trust 5 is a taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat the loan to A as an obligation secured by an interest in real property rather than as an obligation secured by an interest in a partnership.

# Example 5.
(i) Corporation Z, in addition to its other assets, owns $3,000,000 in notes secured by interests in retail shopping centers. Partnership L, in addition to its other assets, owns $20,000,000 in notes that are principally secured by interests in single family homes and $3,500,000 in notes that are principally secured by interests in personal property.
(ii) On December 1, 1995, Partnership L asks Corporation Z for two separate loans, one in the amount of $9,375,000 and another in the amount of $625,000. Partnership L offers to collateralize the $9,375,000 loan with $10,312,500 of notes secured by interests in single family homes and the $625,000 loan with $750,000 of notes secured by interests in personal property. Corporation Z has made similar loans to Partnership L in the past.
(iii) With a view to avoiding the application of section 7701(i), Corporation Z induces Partnership L to accept a single $10,000,000 loan and to post as collateral $7,500,000 of the notes secured by interests in single family homes and all $3,500,000 of the notes secured by interests in personal property. Ordinarily, Corporation Z would not make a loan on these terms. Thereafter, the loan to Partnership L, together with the $3,000,000 in notes secured by interests in retail shopping centers, are transferred to Trust 6 and used to issue bonds that have different maturities (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-1(e)) and that bear a relationship (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-1(f)) to the loans secured by interests in retail shopping centers and the loan to Partnership L.
(iv) For purposes of determining whether Trust 6 is a taxable mortgage pool, the Commissioner can treat the $10,000,000 loan to Partnership L as consisting of a $9,375,000 obligation secured by interests in real property and a $625,000 obligation secured by interests in personal property. Under § 301.7701(i)-1(d)(3)(ii)(A), the notes secured by single family homes are treated as $7,500,000 of interests in real property. Under § 301.7701(i)-1(d)(3)(i)(A), $7,500,000 of interests in real property are sufficient to treat a $9,375,000 obligation as principally secured by an interest in real property ($7,500,000 equals 80 percent of $9,375,000).

§ 301.7701(i)-2
Special rules for portions of entities.
(a)
Portion defined.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and § 301.7701(i)-1, a portion of an entity includes all assets that support one or more of the same issues of debt obligations. For this purpose, an asset supports a debt obligation if, under the terms of the debt obligation (or underlying arrangement), the timing and amount of payments on the debt obligation are in large part determined, either directly or indirectly, by the timing and amount of payments or projected payments on the asset or a group of assets that includes the asset. Indirect payment arrangements include, for example, a swap or other hedge, or arrangements where the timing and amount of payments on the debt obligations are determined by reference to a group of assets (or an index or other type of model) that has an expected payment experience similar to that of the assets. For purposes of this paragraph, the term payments includes all proceeds and receipts from an asset.
(b)
Certain assets and rights to assets disregarded
—(1)
Credit enhancement assets.
An asset that qualifies as a credit enhancement contract (as defined in § 301.7701(i)-1(c)(4)(ii)) is not included in a portion as a separate asset, but is treated as part of the assets in the portion to which it relates under § 301.7701(i)-1(c)(4)(i). An asset that does not qualify as a credit enhancement contract (as defined in § 301.7701(i)-1(c)(4)(ii)), but that nevertheless serves the same function as a credit enhancement contract, is not included in a portion as a separate asset or otherwise.
(2)
Assets unlikely to service obligations.
A portion does not include assets that are unlikely to produce any significant cash flows for the holders of the debt obligations. This paragraph applies even if the holders of the debt obligations are legally entitled to cash flows from the assets. Thus, for example, even if the sale of a building would cause a series of debt obligations to be redeemed, the building is not included in a portion if it is not likely to be sold.
(3)
Recourse.
An asset is not included in a portion solely because the holders of the debt obligations have recourse to the holder of that asset.
(c)
Portion as obligor
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(ii), a portion of an entity is treated as the obligor of all debt obligations supported by the assets in that portion.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this section:

# Example.
(i) Corporation Z owns $1,000,000,000 in assets including an office complex and $90,000,000 of real estate mortgages.
(ii) On November 30, 1998, Corporation Z issues eight classes of bonds, Class A through Class H. Each class is secured by a separate letter of credit and by a lien on the office complex. One group of the real estate mortgages supports Class A through Class D, another group supports Class E through Class G, and a third group supports Class H. It is anticipated that the cash flows from each group of mortgages will service its related bonds.
(iii) Each of the following constitutes a separate portion of Corporation Z: the group of mortgages supporting Class A through Class D; the group of mortgages supporting Class E through Class G; and the group of mortgages supporting Class H. No other asset is included in any of the three portions notwithstanding the lien of the bonds on the office complex and the fact that Corporation Z is the issuer of the bonds. The letters of credit are treated as incidents of the mortgages to which they relate.
(iv) For purposes of section 7701(i)(2)(A)(ii), each portion described above is treated as the obligor of the bonds of that portion, notwithstanding the fact that Corporation Z is the legal obligor with respect to the bonds.
[T.D. 8610, 60 FR 40091, Aug. 7, 1995]
§ 301.7701(i)-3
Effective dates and duration of taxable mortgage pool classification.

Effective dates.
Except as otherwise provided, the regulations under section 7701(i) are effective and applicable September 6, 1995.
(b)
Entities in existence on December 31, 1991
—(1)
In general.
For transitional rules concerning the application of section 7701(i) to entities in existence on December 31, 1991, see section 675(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
(2)
Special rule for certain transfers.
A transfer made to an entity on or after September 6, 1995, is a substantial transfer for purposes of section 675(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 only if—
(i) The transfer is significant in amount; and
(ii) The transfer is connected to the entity's issuance of related debt obligations (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) that have different maturities (within the meaning of § 301.7701-1(e)).
(3)
Related debt obligation.
A related debt obligation is a debt obligation whose payments bear a relationship (within the meaning of § 301.7701-1(f)) to payments on debt obligations that the entity holds as assets.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b):

# Example.
On December 31, 1991, Partnership Q holds a pool of real estate mortgages that it acquired through retail sales of single family homes. Partnership Q raises $10,000,000 on October 25, 1996, by using this pool to issue related debt obligations with multiple maturities. The transfer of the $10,000,000 to Partnership Q is a substantial transfer (within the meaning of § 301.7701(i)-3(b)(2)).
(c)
Duration of taxable mortgage pool classification
—(1)
Commencement and duration.
An entity is classified as a taxable mortgage pool on the first testing day that it meets the definition of a taxable mortgage pool. Once an entity is classified as a taxable mortgage pool, that classification continues through the day the entity retires its last related debt obligation.
(2)
Testing day defined.
A testing day is any day on or after September 6, 1995, on which an entity issues a related debt obligation (as defined in
paragraph (b)(3) of this section) that is significant in amount.
[T.D. 8610, 60 FR 40092, Aug. 7, 1995]
§ 301.7701(i)-4
Special rules for certain entities.
(a)
States and municipalities
—(1)
In general.
Regardless of whether an entity satisfies any of the requirements of section 7701(i)(2)(A), an entity is not classified as a taxable mortgage pool if—
(i) The entity is a State, territory, a possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision thereof (within the meaning of § 1.103-1(b) of this chapter), or is empowered to issue obligations on behalf of one of the foregoing;
(ii) The entity issues the debt obligations in the performance of a governmental purpose; and
(iii) The entity holds the remaining interests in all assets that support those debt obligations until the debt obligations issued by the entity are retired.
(2)
Governmental purpose.
The term governmental purpose means an essential governmental function within the meaning of section 115. A governmental purpose does not include the mere packaging of debt obligations for re-sale on the secondary market even if any profits from the sale are used in the performance of an essential governmental function.
(3)
Determinations by the Commissioner.
If an entity is not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but has a similar purpose, then the Commissioner may determine that the entity is not classified as a taxable mortgage pool.
(b)
REITs.
[Reserved]
(c)
Subchapter S corporations
—(1)
In general.
An entity that is classified as a taxable mortgage pool may not elect to be an S corporation under section 1362(a) or maintain S corporation status.
(2)
Portion of an S corporation treated as a separate corporation.
An S corporation is not treated as a member of an affiliated group under section 1361(b)(2)(A) solely because a portion of the S corporation is treated as a separate corporation under section 7701(i).

(i) The person is a member of a controlled group of which the CPEO applicant or CPEO is also a member. Additionally, CPEO applicants and CPEOs that, but for their status as disregarded entities would separately be members of a controlled group, are treated as members of a controlled group for purposes of this paragraph (b)(12)(i). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(12)(i), controlled group has the meaning given to such term by sections 414(b) and (c) and §§ 1.414(b)-1 and 1.414(c)-1 through 1.414(c)-6 of this chapter, except that—
(A) With respect to a person that is not a provider of payroll services “more than 50 percent” will be substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a) (which is cross-referenced in section 414(b) and § 1.414(c)-2 of this chapter); and
(B) With respect to a person that is a provider of payroll services, “more than 5 percent” will be substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a) and § 1.414(c)-2 of this chapter; or
(ii) The person is a provider of payroll services and—
(A) A majority of the directors or a majority of the officers (as described in paragraph (b)(13)(ii) of this section) of the CPEO applicant or CPEO are directors or officers (as described in paragraph (b)(13)(ii) of this section), respectively, of the provider of payroll services; or
(B) An individual is a responsible individual of both the provider of payroll services and the CPEO applicant or CPEO by reason of paragraph (b)(13)(i) of this section.

(i) Any individual who owns, directly or indirectly, applying the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) with respect to stock ownership and substituting the term “interest” for the term “stock” and the term “partnership” for the term “corporation” used in that section, as appropriate for purposes of determining whether an interest in a partnership is indirectly owned by any person, 33 percent or more of—
(A) In the case of a corporation, the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such corporation or the total value of shares of all classes of stock of such corporation; or
(B) In the case of a partnership, the capital interest or profits interest of such partnership.
(ii) Any individual who is a director or an officer. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(13)(ii), a director is a voting member of the governing body (that is, the board of directors or equivalent controlling body authorized under state law to make governance decisions on behalf of the organization), and the officers are determined by reference to the organizing document, bylaws, or resolutions of the governing body, or otherwise designated consistent with state law. Officers may include individuals such as a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer.
(iii) Any individual who, regardless of title, has ultimate responsibility for implementing the decisions of the organization's governing body. An individual who serves with the title of chief executive officer, executive director, and/or president has this ultimate responsibility. An individual with this ultimate responsibility may include an individual who is not treated as an employee of the organization. If this ultimate responsibility resides with two or more individuals (for example, co-presidents), who may exercise such responsibility in concert or individually, then each such individual is a responsible individual.
(iv) Any individual who, regardless of title, has ultimate responsibility for supervising the management, administration, or operation of the organization. An individual who serves with the title of chief operating officer has this ultimate responsibility. An individual with this ultimate responsibility may include an individual who is not treated as an employee of the organization. If this ultimate responsibility resides with two or more individuals, who may exercise such responsibility in concert or individually, then each such individual is a responsible individual.
(v) Any individual who, regardless of title, has ultimate responsibility for managing the organization's finances. An individual who serves with the title of chief financial officer or treasurer has this ultimate responsibility. An individual with this ultimate responsibility may include an individual who is not treated as an employee of the organization.

(vi) In the case of a partnership, any individual who is a managing member or general partner.
(vii) In the case of a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor.

(14)
Self-employed individual
means an individual with net earnings from self-employment (as defined in section 1402(a) without regard to the exceptions thereunder) derived from providing services covered by a CPEO contract, whether such net earnings from self-employment are derived from providing services as a non-employee to a customer of the CPEO, from the individual's own trade or business as a sole proprietor customer of the CPEO, or as an individual who is a partner in a partnership that is a customer of the CPEO, but only with regard to such net earnings.
(15)
Substantial asset transfer
means any transfer of 35 percent or more of the value of the operating assets of the person making the transfer, whether through one or a series of transactions and whether accomplished through sale, lease, gift, assignment, succession, merger, consolidation, corporate separation, or any other means. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(15), operating assets include both tangible and intangible resources related to the conduct of the person's trade or business, including, but not limited to, such intangible assets as contracts, agreements, receivables, employees, and goodwill (which includes the value of a trade or business based on expected continued customer patronage due to its name, reputation, or any other factors). In the case of a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) or a service agreement described in § 31.3504-2(b)(2) of this chapter entered into by a provider of payroll services, even if the contract or agreement is not sold, gifted, assigned, or otherwise formally transferred to a CPEO applicant, it will be considered transferred from the provider of payroll services to the CPEO applicant if the CPEO applicant reports, withholds, or pays, under its employer identification number (EIN), any applicable federal employment taxes with respect to the wages of any individuals covered by the contract or agreement.
(16)
Work site
means a physical location at which an individual regularly
performs services for a customer of a CPEO or, if there is no such location, the location from which the customer assigns work to the individual. A work site may not be the individual's residence or a telework site unless the customer requires the individual to work at that site. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(16), work sites that are contiguous locations will be treated as a single physical location and thus a single work site, and noncontiguous locations will be treated as separate physical locations and thus separate work sites, except as provided in the next sentence. A CPEO customer may treat noncontiguous locations as a single physical location and thus a single work site if each of the locations is separated by less than 35 miles from every other location in the single work site and all locations in the single work site operate in the same industry. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the determination of the industry of a work site is based on the nature of the CPEO customer's work at that work site, irrespective of work performed by other entities at the same site. When treating noncontiguous locations as a single physical location and thus a single work site, one noncontiguous location cannot be included in more than one work site. For example, assume there are three noncontiguous locations, A, B, and C, operating in the same industry and that B is 20 miles east from A and C is 20 miles east from B. A CPEO customer would not be permitted to treat these three locations as a single work site but would be permitted to treat either A and B as a single work site or B and C as a single work site.
(17)
Work site employee
—(i)
In general.
A work site employee means, with respect to a customer, a covered employee who performs services for such customer at a work site where at least 85 percent of the individuals performing services for the customer are covered employees of the customer.
(ii)
Self-employed individuals.
Solely for purposes of determining whether the 85 percent threshold described in paragraph (b)(17)(i) of this section is met, a self-employed individual described in paragraph (b)(14) of this section is treated as a covered employee if such individual would be a covered employee but for the exclusion of self-employed individuals from the definition of covered employee in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(iii)
Excluded employees.
In determining whether the 85 percent threshold described in paragraph (b)(17)(i) of this section is met, an individual who is an excluded employee described in section 414(q)(5) is not treated as either an individual providing services or a covered employee.
(iv)
Treatment for calendar quarter.
A covered employee will be considered a work site employee for the entirety of a calendar quarter if the employee qualifies as a work site employee at any time during that quarter.C
(v)
Separate determination for each work site.
The determination of whether a covered employee is a work site employee is made separately with regard to each work site at which the covered employee regularly provides services and for each customer for which the covered employee is providing services. A covered employee may be determined to be a work site employee of more than one work site during a calendar quarter.
(vi)
Good faith determination respected.
A CPEO's determination that a covered employee is a work site employee will be respected if the CPEO has made a good faith determination that the covered employee meets the requirements of section 7705(e), this paragraph (b)(17), and any further guidance related to work site employee determinations.
(c)
Applicability date.
The rules in this section apply on and after May 3, 2019.

A CPEO applicant will be notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) whether its application for certification has been approved or denied, and, if approved, the effective date of certification. If the IRS denies the application, the IRS will inform the CPEO applicant of the reason(s) for denial. If the IRS denies an application for certification, or if the CPEO applicant withdraws an application for certification, the CPEO applicant may reapply for certification in such time and manner, and must include such information, as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance.
(3)
Public disclosure of certification.
If the IRS approves a CPEO applicant's application for certification, the IRS will make available to the public the name and address of the CPEO, as well as the effective date of its certification, in the time and manner described in further guidance.

The IRS may deny an application for certification or revoke or suspend a CPEO's certification if a CPEO applicant or CPEO, or one or more of its precursor entities, related entities, or responsible individuals, fails to meet any applicable requirement described in this section or other applicable guidance, and the IRS will do so if the IRS determines, in its sole discretion, that such failure presents a material risk to the IRS's collection of federal employment taxes. In determining whether one or more failures to meet the requirements described in this section presents a material risk to the IRS's collection of federal employment taxes, the IRS generally will consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the size, scope, nature, significance, recurrence, and timing of and reason for the failure and, in the case of a CPEO, any prior failures of the CPEO to meet the requirements of this section.

(3)
Authorization to investigate suitability.
A CPEO applicant or CPEO, and each of its responsible individuals, must take such actions as are necessary to authorize the IRS to investigate the accuracy of statements and submissions, including waiving confidentiality and privilege when necessary (
i.e.,

(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Immaterial failures.
A CPEO will not fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section if the CPA examination level attestation indicates that the CPEO has failed to withhold or make deposits in certain immaterial respects, provided that—
(A) The attestation provides a summary of the immaterial failures that were found;
(B) The attestation states that the failures were immaterial and isolated and do not reflect a meaningful lapse in compliance with federal employment tax withholding and deposit requirements; and
(C) The IRS determines, in its sole discretion, that the isolated and immaterial failures identified by the CPA do not present a material risk to the IRS's collection of federal employment taxes.
(ii)
Negative working capital.
A CPEO with negative working capital at the end of a fiscal quarter will not fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section if—
(A) The CPEO does not have negative working capital at the end of the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding such fiscal quarter, as demonstrated by the annual audited financial statements described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if available, or the statements described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section;

(3)
CPEO applicants
—(i)
In general.
By the last day of the second month after the end of each calendar quarter, beginning with the most recently completed calendar quarter as of the date of a CPEO applicant's application for certification and ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter as of the effective date of certification (if applicable), a CPEO applicant must provide to the IRS the assertion, examination level attestation, and working capital statement described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, subject to the exceptions described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (though substituting “CPEO applicant” for “CPEO”).
(ii)
Newly established CPEO applicants.
A CPEO applicant that was not operating as a provider of payroll services during the most recently completed calendar quarter as of the date of its application for certification or during any calendar quarter that ends while its application for certification is pending must provide to the IRS the assertion, examination level attestation, and working capital statement described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section with respect to any precursor entity, if applicable, in such time and manner as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance, as well as such additional information as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance.
(g)
Bond
—(1)
In general.
A CPEO must post a bond (or bonds, as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) from a qualified surety (as described in paragraph (g)(6) of this section) for the payment of federal employment taxes, issued in the form and containing the terms prescribed by the Commissioner in this paragraph (g) and in further guidance and in an amount described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(2)
Bond amount
—(i)
In general.
The amount of the bond (or bonds, as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) must be, for each period beginning on April 1 of any calendar year and ending on March 31 of the following calendar year (or, in the case of a newly certified CPEO, beginning with the effective date of certification and ending on the subsequent March 31) (the bond period), at least equal to the greater of—
(A) Five percent of the CPEO's liability under section 3511 (or, if applicable, the liability described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section) during the calendar year preceding the beginning of the bond period, but not more than $1,000,000; or
(B) $50,000.
(ii)
Amount of bond in first and second year as a CPEO.
If a CPEO does not have any liability under section 3511 for all or a portion of a preceding calendar year because the CPEO was not certified as a CPEO for all or a portion of that preceding calendar year, the liability applied for purposes of paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section for the entirety or portion of the preceding calendar year during which the CPEO was not certified will be the federal employment tax liability of the CPEO, and of any precursor entity of the CPEO described in § 301.7705-1(b)(10)(i)(A), that results from one or more service agreements described in § 31.3504-2(b)(2) of this chapter. With respect to the federal employment tax liability of such precursor entity during a preceding calendar year, for purposes of paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the liability will be applied only to the extent it results from service agreements that have been transferred or are intended to be transferred by the precursor entity to the CPEO at the time the bond amount is determined. For purposes of this paragraph
(g)(2)(ii), an entity is considered a precursor entity of a CPEO described in § 301.7705-1(b)(10)(i)(A) if it was determined to be its precursor entity under that section at the time it was a CPEO applicant.
(iii)
One continuous obligation.
The bond, any riders thereto, and any strengthening bonds posted to satisfy the requirements of this section are considered one continuous obligation of the surety for unpaid tax liabilities accrued by the CPEO under subtitle C from the effective date of the bond until the bond is superseded or cancelled.
(3)
Increase in bond amount
—(i)
In general.
A CPEO must determine if an increase in the bond amount is necessary for each new bond period. If a CPEO's liability under section 3511 (or, if applicable, the liability described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section) for the preceding calendar year results in a minimum required bond amount specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section that exceeds the current amount of the bond, the CPEO must increase the amount of its bond with respect to the new bond period in order to meet the minimum required bond amount specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. To increase the bond amount, a CPEO may amend an existing bond through the use of a rider, or post a strengthening, superseding, or new bond, where applicable, and in such time and manner as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance.
(ii)
To reflect adjustment or assessment.
Subject to the limit in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section, if, during the bond period, the CPEO or the IRS determines that the applicable federal employment tax liability for the preceding calendar year was higher than the amount reported and paid and on which the bond amount for the bond period was based (and the applicable party makes an adjustment or assessment reflecting such determination), a CPEO must increase the amount of its bond to meet the minimum required bond amount specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section through the use of a rider, or by posting a strengthening, superseding, or new bond in such time and manner as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance.
(4)
Cancellation
—(i)
Notice.
A bond required under this paragraph (g) must provide that it may be cancelled by the surety only after the surety gives written notice of such cancellation to the IRS and the CPEO in such time and manner as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance.
(ii)
New or superseding bond required.
If a CPEO either receives notice of cancellation from the surety provider of its bond, or gives notice to the IRS of the CPEO's intent to cancel the bond, the CPEO must post a new or superseding bond for the minimum required bond amount specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section in such time and manner as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance.
(iii)
Ongoing liability.
A bond required under this paragraph (g) must provide that, if a surety cancels the bond without issuing a superseding bond to the CPEO, the surety will, notwithstanding the cancellation, remain liable for all federal employment tax liability accrued by the CPEO during the period beginning with the effective date of the first bond issued by the surety to the CPEO in any consecutive series of bonds issued by that surety prior to cancellation and ending with the cancellation of the bond (the total bond period), up to the penal amount of the bond at the time of the cancellation. A cancelling surety will remain liable as described in this paragraph (g)(4)(iii) for federal employment tax liability accrued during the total bond period up to the penal amount of the bond for as long as the Commissioner may assess and collect taxes for such period under sections 6501 and 6502.
(5)
No posting of collateral
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iii) of this section, a CPEO must meet the bond requirements of this paragraph (g) without posting collateral.
(ii)
Surety's retention of the right to seek collateral by itself not a violation of paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section.
A surety's retention of the right to seek collateral, as long as no collateral is actually required by the surety or posted by the CPEO, does not violate the rule in paragraph (g)(5)(i).
(iii)
Exceptions to no collateral requirement.
The Commissioner may provide
exceptions to the rule in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section in further guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(6)
Requirements for surety.
Any surety that issues a bond required by this paragraph (g) to a CPEO must be a surety company that holds a certificate of authority from the Secretary as an acceptable surety on federal bonds and meets such other requirements as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance.
(7)
Bond definitions
—(i)
Rider.
A rider is an amendment to an existing bond that increases the bond amount. The rider must apply to liabilities that arise on or after the effective date of the bond that the rider amends. The surety remains liable under the existing bond, as amended by the rider, for the assessment and collection periods applicable to the CPEO under sections 6501 and 6502, respectively, with respect to any taxable period that occurs during the term of the bond unless and until the bond is superseded.
(ii)
Strengthening bond.
A strengthening bond is an additional bond posted in the incremental amount of the increase so that the strengthening bond together with the existing bond equal the total minimum required bond amount specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The strengthening bond must apply to liabilities that arise on or after the effective date of the bond it strengthens. Both the strengthening bond and the bond it strengthens must remain in effect, and the surety remains liable under both bonds for the assessment and collection periods applicable to the CPEO under sections 6501 and 6502, respectively, with respect to any taxable period that occurs during the term of the bonds, unless and until the bonds are superseded.
(iii)
New bond.
A new bond is a bond posted for the total required bond amount, and a new bond may only be posted upon the CPEO's initial certification or immediately following cancellation of an existing bond. In the case of a cancellation of an existing bond, the effective date of the new bond must be no later than the effective date of the cancellation of the existing bond, and the surety providing the existing (now cancelled) bond remains liable for liabilities that accrued during the term of the cancelled bond for the assessment and collection periods applicable to the CPEO under sections 6501 and 6502, respectively, with respect to any taxable period that occurred during the term of that bond.
(iv)
Superseding bond.
A superseding bond is a bond posted for the total minimum required bond amount specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, not just for an incremental increase. Upon execution of the superseding bond, the superseded bond is no longer in effect, and the surety that provided the superseded bond is no longer liable under the superseded bond. The superseding bond must apply to liabilities that arise on or after the effective date of the superseded bond.
(h)
Controlled group.
All CPEO applicants and CPEOs that are members of a controlled group within the meaning of sections 414(b) and (c), and §§ 1.414(b)-1 and 1.414(c)-1 through 1.414(c)-6 of this chapter, will be treated as a single CPEO applicant or CPEO for purposes of paragraphs (e) (other than (e)(1)(iii)), (f) (other than (f)(1)(ii)), and (g) of this section.
(i)
Consents to disclose.
To receive and maintain certification, a CPEO applicant or CPEO must provide such consents for the IRS to disclose confidential tax information to its customers, and to other persons as necessary to carry out the purposes of these regulations, that relates to its certification and obligations to report, deposit, and pay federal employment taxes as the Commissioner may require in further guidance.
(j)
Periodic verification.
A CPEO must periodically verify that it continues to meet the requirements of this section in the time and manner prescribed by the Commissioner in further guidance.
(k)
Notification of material changes.
A CPEO applicant or CPEO must notify the IRS, in the time and manner prescribed by the Commissioner in further guidance, of any change that materially affects the continuing accuracy of any agreement or information that was previously made or provided to the IRS.
(l)
Accrual method of accounting.
A CPEO must compute its taxable income using an accrual method of accounting or, if applicable, another method that the Commissioner provides for in further guidance.
(m)
Compliance with reporting obligations
—(1)
In general.
A CPEO must agree to make reports to the IRS and to its clients as provided in section 3511(g) and § 31.3511-1 of this chapter, including filing all federal employment tax returns and information returns as required.
(2)
Filing on magnetic media.
A CPEO must file all returns, schedules, reports, and other forms and documents on magnetic media when required by section 3511(g) and § 31.3511-1 of this chapter, other Treasury regulations, or other guidance.
(n)
Suspension and revocation
—(1)
In general.
The IRS may suspend or revoke the certification of any CPEO, in the time and manner and under the circumstances prescribed by the Commissioner in this section and in further guidance, as a result of one or more failures to meet any of the requirements for CPEOs described in this section, section 3511(g), § 31.3511-1 of this chapter, and any further guidance and will suspend or revoke certification if the IRS determines, in its sole discretion, that such failure(s) present a material risk to the IRS's collection of federal employment taxes. See paragraph (b) of this section for the factors the IRS will consider in determining whether one or more failures to meet any of the requirements described in this section presents a material risk to the IRS's collection of federal employment taxes.
(2)
Suspension.
Section 3511 will not apply to any contract described in section 7705(e)(2) into which the CPEO enters while its certification is suspended.
(3)
Revocation.
If an organization's certification as a CPEO is revoked, the organization will not be considered a CPEO for purposes of section 3511 unless and until it again applies to be certified as a CPEO in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and is again certified by the IRS as meeting the requirements of this section. An organization whose certification as a CPEO has been revoked may not reapply to be certified as a CPEO until one year has passed after the effective date of its revocation.
(4)
Disclosure of suspension and revocation
—(i)
Notification by the CPEO.
An organization whose certification as a CPEO has been suspended or revoked must notify its customers of such suspension or revocation in the time and manner prescribed by the Commissioner in further guidance.
(ii)
Disclosure by the IRS.
If the IRS suspends or revokes an organization's certification as a CPEO, the IRS will make available to the public the fact of such suspension or revocation in the time and manner described in further guidance. The IRS may also separately notify the organization's customers of such suspension or revocation.
(o)
Applicability date.
The rules in this section apply on and after May 3, 2019.

§ 301.7811-1
Taxpayer assistance orders.
(a)
Authority To Issue
—(1)
In general.
When an application for a taxpayer assistance order (TAO) is filed by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative in the form, manner and time specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA) may issue a TAO if, in the determination of the NTA, the taxpayer is suffering or is about to suffer a significant hardship as a result of the manner in which the internal revenue laws are being administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), including action or inaction on the part of the IRS.
(2)
The National Taxpayer Advocate defined.
The term
National Taxpayer Advocate
includes any designee of the NTA, such as a Local Taxpayer Advocate.
(3)
Issuance without a written application.
The NTA may issue a TAO in the absence of a written application by the taxpayer under section 7811(a).
(4)
Significant hardship
—(i)
Determination required.
Before a TAO may be issued, the NTA is required to make a determination regarding significant hardship.
(ii)
Term defined.
The term
significant hardship
means a serious privation caused or about to be caused to the taxpayer as the result of the particular manner in which the revenue laws are being administered by the IRS. Significant hardship includes situations in which a system or procedure fails to operate as intended or fails to resolve the taxpayer's problem or dispute with the IRS. A significant hardship also includes, but is not limited to:
(A) An immediate threat of adverse action;
(B) A delay of more than 30 days in resolving taxpayer account problems;
(C) The incurring by the taxpayer of significant costs (including fees for professional representation) if relief is not granted; or
(D) Irreparable injury to, or a long-term adverse impact on, the taxpayer if relief is not granted.
(iii)
A delay of more than 30 days in resolving taxpayer account problems is further defined.
A delay of more than 30 days in resolving taxpayer account problems exists under the following conditions:
(A) When a taxpayer does not receive a response by the date promised by the IRS; or
(B) When the IRS has established a normal processing time for taking an action and the taxpayer experiences a delay of more than 30 days beyond the normal processing time.
(iv)
Examples of significant hardship.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Immediate threat of adverse action.
The IRS serves a levy on A's bank account. A needs the bank funds to pay for a medically necessary surgical procedure that is scheduled to take place in one week. If the levy is not released, A will lack the funds necessary to have the procedure. A is experiencing an immediate threat of adverse action.

# Example 2. Delay of more than 30 days.
B files a Form 4506, “Request for a Copy of Tax Return.” B does not receive the photocopy of the tax return after waiting more than 30 days beyond the normal time for processing. B is experiencing a delay of more than 30 days.

# Example 3. Significant costs.
The IRS sends XYZ, Inc. a notice requesting payment of the outstanding employment taxes and penalties owed by XYZ, Inc. The notice indicates that XYZ, Inc. has small employment tax balances with respect to 12 employment tax quarters totaling $10X. XYZ, Inc. provides documentation to the IRS which it contends shows that if all payments were applied to each quarter correctly, there would be no balance due. The IRS requests additional records and documentation. Because there are 12 quarters involved, to comply with this request XYZ, Inc. asserts that it will need to hire an accountant, who estimates he will
charge at least $5X to organize all the records and provide a detailed analysis of how to apply the deposits and payments. XYZ, Inc. is facing significant costs.

# Example 4. Irreparable injury.
D has arranged with a bank to refinance his mortgage to lower his monthly payment. D is unable to make the current monthly payment. Unless the monthly payment amount is lowered, D will lose his residence to foreclosure. The IRS refuses to subordinate the Federal tax lien, as permitted by section 6325(d), or discharge the property subject to the lien, as permitted by section 6325(b). As a result, the bank will not allow D to refinance. D is facing an irreparable injury if relief is not granted.
(5)
Distinction between significant hardship and the issuance of a TAO.
A finding that a taxpayer is suffering or about to suffer a significant hardship as a result of the manner in which the internal revenue laws are being administered by the IRS will not automatically result in the issuance of a TAO. After making a determination of significant hardship, the NTA must determine whether the facts and the law support relief for the taxpayer. In cases where any IRS employee is not following applicable published administrative guidance (including the Internal Revenue Manual), the NTA shall construe the factors taken into account in determining whether to issue a TAO in the manner most favorable to the taxpayer.
(b)
Generally.
A TAO is an order by the NTA to the IRS. The IRS will comply with a TAO unless it is appealed and then modified or rescinded by the NTA, the Commissioner, or the Deputy Commissioner. If a TAO is modified or rescinded by the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner, a written explanation of the reasons for the modification or rescission must be provided to the NTA. The NTA may not make a substantive determination of any tax liability. A TAO is also not intended to be a substitute for an established administrative or judicial review procedure, but rather is intended to supplement existing procedures if a taxpayer is about to suffer or is suffering a significant hardship. A request for a TAO shall be made on a Form 911, “Request for Taxpayer Advocate Service Assistance (And Application for Taxpayer Assistance Order)” (or other specified form) or in a written statement that provides sufficient information for the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) to determine the nature of the harm or the need for assistance. A taxpayer's right to administrative or judicial review will not be diminished or expanded in any way as a result of the taxpayer's seeking assistance from TAS.
(c)
Contents of taxpayer assistance orders.
After establishing that the taxpayer is facing significant hardship and determining that the facts and law support relief to the taxpayer, the NTA may issue a TAO ordering the IRS within a specified time to—
(1)
Release a levy.
Release levied property (to the extent that the IRS may by law release such property); or
(2)
Take certain other actions.
Cease any action, take any action as permitted by law, or refrain from taking any action with respect to a taxpayer pursuant to—
(i) Chapter 64 (relating to collection);
(ii) Chapter 70, subchapter B (relating to bankruptcy and receiverships);
(iii) Chapter 78 (relating to discovery of liability and enforcement of title); or
(iv) Any other provision of the internal revenue laws specifically described by the NTA in the TAO.
(3)
Expedite, review, or reconsider an action at a higher level.
Although the NTA may not make the substantive determination, a TAO may be issued to require the IRS to expedite, reconsider, or review at a higher level an action taken with respect to a determination or collection of a tax liability.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples assume the existence of significant hardship:

# Example 1.
J contacts a Local Taxpayer Advocate because a wage levy is causing financial difficulties. The NTA determines that the levy should be released as it is causing economic hardship (within the meaning of section 6343(a)(1)(D) and § 301.6343-1(b)(4)). The NTA may issue a TAO ordering the IRS to release the levy in whole or in part by a specified date.

# Example 2.
The IRS rejects K's offer in compromise. K files a Form 911, “Request for Taxpayer Advocate Service Assistance (And Application for Taxpayer Assistance Order).” The NTA discovers facts that support acceptance of the offer in compromise. The NTA may issue a TAO ordering the IRS to reconsider its rejection of the offer or to review
the rejection of the offer at a higher level. The TAO may include the NTA's analysis of and recommendation for resolving the case.

# Example 3.
L files a protest requesting Appeals consideration of IRS's proposed denial of L's request for innocent spouse relief. Appeals advises L that it is going to issue a Final Determination denying the request for innocent spouse relief. L files a Form 911, “Request for Taxpayer Advocate Service Assistance (And Application for Taxpayer Assistance Order).” The NTA reviews the administrative record and concludes that the facts support granting innocent spouse relief. The NTA may issue a TAO ordering Appeals to refrain from issuing a Final Determination and reconsider or review at a higher level its decision to deny innocent spouse relief. The TAO may include the NTA's analysis of and recommendation for resolving the case.
(d)
Issuance.
A TAO may be issued to any office, operating division, or function of the IRS. A TAO shall apply to persons performing services under a qualified tax collection contract (as defined in section 6306(b)) to the same extent and in the same manner as the order applies to IRS employees. A TAO will not be issued to IRS Criminal Investigation division (CI), or any successor IRS division responsible for the criminal investigation function, if the action ordered in the TAO could reasonably be expected to impede a criminal investigation. CI will determine whether the action ordered in the TAO could reasonably be expected to impede an investigation. Generally, a TAO may not be issued to the Office of Chief Counsel.
(e)
Suspension of statutes of limitations
—(1)
In general.
The running of the applicable period of limitations for any action which is the subject of a taxpayer assistance order shall be suspended for the period beginning on the date the Ombudsman receives an application for a taxpayer assistance order in the form, manner, and time specified in paragraph (b) of this section and ending on the date on which the Ombudsman makes a determination with respect to the application, and for any additional period specified by the Ombudsman in an order issued pursuant to a taxpayer's application. For the purpose of computing the period suspended, all calendar days except the date of receipt of the application shall be included.
(2)
Date of decision.
The “date on which the Ombudsman makes a decision with respect to the application” is the date on which the taxpayer's request for a taxpayer assistance order is denied, or agreement is reached with the involved function of the Service, or a taxpayer assistance order is issued (except that when the taxpayer assistance order is reviewed by an official who may modify or rescind the taxpayer assistance order as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the decision date is the date on which such review is completed).
(3)
Periods suspended.
The periods of limitations which are suspended under section 7811(d) are those which apply to the taxable periods to which the application for a taxpayer assistance order relate or the taxable periods specifically indicated in the terms of a taxpayer assistance order.

# Example 1.
On August 31, 1989, the Internal Revenue Service levies on funds in the taxpayer's checking account. On September 1, 1989 (at which time 7 months remain before the period of limitations on collection after assessment will expire on April 1, 1990) the Ombudsman receives the taxpayer's written application for a taxpayer assistance order. Subsequently, on September 6, 1989, the Ombudsman determines that the levy has caused a significant hardship and the Internal Revenue Service function which served the levy agrees to release the levy. The levy is released. As a result of the application and the decision by the Ombudsman and the involved function of the Service resolving the hardship, the statute of limitations on collection after assessment is suspended from the date the Ombudsman received the application, September 1, 1989, until the date on which the decision was made to release the levy, September 6, 1989. Therefore, the statute of limitations on collection after assessment will not expire until after April 6, 1990, which is 7 months plus 5 days after the date on which the application for a taxpayer assistance order was received by the Ombudsman.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that the Internal Revenue Service function which served the levy does not agree to release the levy, and the Ombudsman, having made a determination that the levy is causing a significant hardship, issues a taxpayer assistance order on September 6, 1989, in which the levy is ordered to be released and specifies that the statute of limitations on collection after assessment is
suspended for an additional 15 days. The period of limitations on collection after assessment will therefore not expire until after April 21, 1990, which is 7 months and 20 days (5 days plus 15 days) after the application for the taxpayer assistance order was received by the Ombudsman.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 2 except that the Ombudsman does not specifically suspend the statute of limitations on collection after assessment for an additional number of days in the taxpayer assistance order, but rather the function seeks modification or rescission of the taxpayer assistance order and the appropriate official charged with that responsibility completes his consideration of the assistance order on September 8, 1989. The period of limitations on collection after assessment will therefore not expire until after April 8, 1990, which is 7 months and 7 days after the application for the taxpayer assistance order was received by the Ombudsman.
(4)
Absence of a written application.
The statute of limitations is not suspended in cases where the Ombudsman issues an order in the absence of a written application for relief by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized representative.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
These regulations are applicable for TAOs issued on or after April 1, 2011, except that paragraph (e) of this section is applicable beginning March 20, 1992.
[T.D. 8246, 54 FR 11700, Mar. 22, 1989, as amended by T.D. 8403, 56 FR 9977, Mar. 23, 1992; T.D. 9519, 76 FR 18060, Apr. 1, 2011]
§ 301.7803-2
Internal Revenue Service Independent Office of Appeals resolution of Federal tax controversies without litigation.
(a)
Function of the Internal Revenue Service Independent Office of Appeals.
The Internal Revenue Service Independent Office of Appeals (Appeals) resolves Federal tax controversies without litigation on a basis that is fair and impartial to both the Government and the taxpayer, promotes a consistent application and interpretation of, and voluntary compliance with, the Federal tax laws, and enhances public confidence in the integrity and efficiency of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
(b)
Consideration of a Federal tax controversy by Appeals
—(1)
In general.
The Appeals resolution process is generally available to all taxpayers to resolve Federal tax controversies.
(2)
Definition of Federal tax controversy.
For purposes of this section, a
Federal tax controversy
is defined as a dispute over an administrative determination with respect to a particular taxpayer made by the IRS in administering or enforcing the internal revenue laws, related Federal tax statutes, and tax conventions to which the United States is a party (collectively referred to as internal revenue laws) that arises out of the examination, collection, or execution of other activities concerning the amount or legality of the taxpayer's income, employment, excise, or estate and gift tax liability; a penalty; or an addition to tax under the internal revenue laws. For purposes of this section, a Federal tax controversy includes, for example, a dispute over an administrative determination made by the IRS concerning a taxpayer's proposed deficiency, a taxpayer's claim for credit or refund, the tax-exempt nature of a particular organization, private foundation, or qualified employee plan under the internal revenue laws, or the status of a tax-exempt or other tax-advantaged bond.
(3)
Other administrative determinations treated as Federal tax controversies.
Notwithstanding the definition of a Federal tax controversy in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, disputes over administrative determinations made by the IRS with respect to a particular person regarding the following topics are treated as Federal tax controversies for purposes of this section:
(i) Liabilities and penalties administered by the IRS that are outside the Internal Revenue Code (Code), such as a liability or penalty pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 5321 (relating to Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts or Bank Secrecy Act civil penalties);
(ii) A request under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);
(iii) Application to become, or the sanction of, an Electronic Return Originator or Authorized IRS e-file Provider;
(iv) An IRS-proposed determination to a bond issuer that denies a claim for recovery of an asserted overpayment of arbitrage rebate, yield reduction payment, or penalty in lieu of rebate under
section 148 of the Code (relating to arbitrage) with respect to tax-exempt bonds or under section 148 as modified by relevant provisions of the Code with respect to other tax-advantaged bonds;
(v) Administrative costs under section 7430 of the Code (relating to awarding of costs and certain fees); or
(vi) Any other topic that the IRS has determined may be considered by Appeals.
(c)
Exceptions to consideration by Appeals.
The following are Federal tax controversies that are excepted from consideration by Appeals or matters or issues that are otherwise ineligible for consideration by Appeals because they are neither a Federal tax controversy nor treated as a Federal tax controversy under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. If a matter or issue not eligible for consideration by Appeals is present in a case that otherwise is eligible for consideration by Appeals, the ineligible matter or issue will not be considered by Appeals during resolution of the case. The exceptions are:
(1) Any administrative determination made by the IRS rejecting a position of a taxpayer that the IRS has identified as frivolous for purposes of section 6702(c) of the Code (regarding listing of frivolous positions) and any case solely involving the taxpayer's failure or refusal to comply with the internal revenue laws because of frivolous moral, religious, political, constitutional, conscientious, or similar grounds.
(2) Penalties assessed by the IRS under section 6702 (relating to frivolous tax submissions) or section 6682 of the Code (relating to false information with respect to withholding) or any other penalty imposed for a frivolous position or false information. Appeals, however, may obtain verification that the assessment of the penalties complied with sections 6203 (relating to method of assessment) and 6751(b) (relating to supervisory approval of assessment) of the Code in a collection due process (CDP) hearing under sections 6320 (relating to a hearing upon filing of a notice of lien) and 6330 (relating to a hearing before levy) of the Code. Appeals also may consider a non-frivolous substantive challenge to a section 6702 or section 6682 penalty in a CDP hearing.
(3) Any administrative determination made by the IRS under section 7623 of the Code (relating to awards to whistleblowers).
(4) Any administrative determination issued by an agency other than the IRS, such as a determination by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) concerning an excise tax administered by and within the jurisdiction of TTB.
(5) Any decision made by the IRS not to issue a Taxpayer Assistance Order (TAO) under section 7811 of the Code (relating to TAOs).
(6) Any decision made by the IRS concerning material to be deleted from the text of a written determination pursuant to section 6110 of the Code (relating to public inspection of written determinations) unless the written determination is otherwise being considered by Appeals.
(7) Any denial of access under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)).
(8) Any issue resolved in an agreement described in section 7121 of the Code (regarding closing agreements) that the taxpayer entered into with the IRS, and any decision made by the IRS to enter into or not enter into such agreement. Appeals may consider the question of whether an item or items are covered, and how the item or items are covered, in a closing agreement.
(9) Any case in which the IRS erroneously returns or rejects an offer in compromise (OIC) submitted under section 7122 of the Code (relating to compromises) as nonprocessable or no longer processable and the taxpayer requests Appeals consideration to assert that the OIC should be deemed to be accepted under section 7122(f).
(10) Any case in which a criminal prosecution, or a recommendation for criminal prosecution, is pending against the taxpayer for a tax-related offense, except with the concurrence of the Office of Chief Counsel or the Department of Justice, as applicable.
(11) Any issues relating to allocation among different fee payers of the branded prescription drug and health insurance providers fees in section 9008 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Public Law 111-148 (124 Stat. 119 (2010)), as amended by section 1404 of the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA), Public Law 111-152 (124 Stat. 1029 (2010)), and section 9010 of PPACA, as amended by section 10905 of PPACA, and as further amended by section 1406 of HCERA.
(12) Any certification or issuance of a notice of certification of a seriously delinquent Federal tax debt to the Department of State under section 7345 of the Code (relating to the revocation or denial of a passport in the case of serious tax delinquencies).
(13) Any issue barred from consideration under section 6320 or section 6330, §§ 301.6320-1 and 301.6330-1, or any other administrative guidance related to CDP hearings or equivalent hearings.
(14) Any case, determination, matter, decision, request, or issue that Appeals lacks the authority to settle. The following is a non-exclusive list of examples:
(i) Any case or issue in a case that has been referred to the Department of Justice.
(ii) Any competent authority case (including a competent authority resolution previously accepted by the taxpayer) under a United States tax treaty that is within the exclusive authority of the United States Competent Authority.
(iii) Any decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Commissioner's delegate to not rescind a penalty under section 6707A of the Code for a non-listed reportable transaction.
(iv) Any request for relief under section 6015 of the Code (relating to relief from joint and several liability on a joint return) when the nonrequesting spouse is a party to a docketed case in the United States Tax Court (Tax Court) and does not agree to granting full or partial relief under section 6015 to the requesting spouse.
(v) Any criminal restitution-based assessment under section 6201(a)(4) of the Code (relating to certain orders of criminal restitution and restriction on challenge of assessment).
(15) Any adverse action related to the initial or continuing recognition of tax-exempt status, an entity's classification as a foundation, the initial or continuing determination of employee plan qualification, or a determination involving an obligation and the issuer of an obligation under section 103 of the Code. The exception in this paragraph (c)(15) applies only if the tax-exempt recognition, classification, determination of employee plan qualification, or determination involving an obligation and the issuer of an obligation under section 103 is based upon a technical advice memorandum issued by an Office of Associate Chief Counsel before an appeal is requested.
(16) Any case docketed in the Tax Court if the notice of deficiency, notice of liability, or final adverse determination letter is based upon a technical advice memorandum issued by an Office of Associate Chief Counsel in that case involving an adverse action described in paragraph (c)(15) of this section.
(17) Any decision by an Office of Associate Chief Counsel regarding whether to issue a letter ruling or the content of a letter ruling. This includes decisions regarding requests for relief under §§ 301.9100-1 through 301.9100-22 and requests for a change in method of accounting. The subject of the letter ruling may be considered by Appeals if all other requirements in this section are met. For example, if an Office of Associate Chief Counsel issues an adverse letter ruling to a taxpayer, the taxpayer cannot immediately appeal the issuance of the adverse letter ruling. If the taxpayer subsequently files a return taking a position that is contrary to the letter ruling and that position is audited by the IRS, Appeals may consider that Federal tax controversy if all other requirements in this section are met.
(18) Any issue based on a taxpayer's argument that a statute violates the United States Constitution unless there is an unreviewable decision from a Federal court holding that the cited statute is unconstitutional. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(18), an argument that a statute violates the United States Constitution includes any argument that a statute is unconstitutional on its face or as applied to a particular person. The exception in this paragraph (c)(18) does not preclude Appeals from considering a Federal tax controversy based on arguments other than the constitutionality of a statute, such as whether the statute applies to
the taxpayer's facts and circumstances. For purposes of this section, the phrase
unreviewable decision
is a decision of any Federal court regardless of where the taxpayer resides that can no longer be appealed to any Federal court because all appeals in a case have been exhausted or the time to appeal has expired and no appeal was filed.
(19) Any issue based on a taxpayer's argument that a Treasury regulation is invalid unless there is an unreviewable decision from a Federal court invalidating the regulation as a whole or the provision in the regulation that the taxpayer is challenging. The exception in this paragraph (c)(19) does not preclude Appeals from considering a Federal tax controversy based on arguments other than the validity of a Treasury regulation, such as whether the Treasury regulation applies to the taxpayer's facts and circumstances. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(19), the term
invalid
means any challenge to validity, whether substantively invalid or procedurally invalid in scope.
See
paragraph (c)(20) of this section for definition of the term
procedurally invalid.
(20) Any issue based on a taxpayer's argument that a notice or revenue procedure published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin is procedurally invalid unless there is an unreviewable decision from a Federal court holding it to be invalid. This exception does not preclude Appeals from considering a Federal tax controversy based on arguments other than the procedural validity of a notice or revenue procedure, such as whether the notice or revenue procedure applies to the taxpayer's facts and circumstances. For purposes of this section, the term
procedurally invalid
is defined as any determination regarding whether a notice or revenue procedure failed to comply with administrative law requirements, such as notice and comment under 5 U.S.C. 553.
(21) Any case or issue designated for litigation, or withheld from Appeals consideration in a Tax Court case, in accordance with guidance regarding designating or withholding a case or issue. For purposes of this section,
designated for litigation
means that the Federal tax controversy, comprising an issue or issues in a case, will not be resolved without a full concession by the taxpayer or by decision of the court.
(22) Any case docketed in the Tax Court if the notice of deficiency, notice of liability, or other determination was issued by Appeals unless the exception in paragraph (f)(1) of this section (regarding when the Tax Court remands a CDP case for reconsideration) applies.
(23) Any case in which timely Appeals consideration must be requested before a petition is filed in the Tax Court because exhaustion of administrative review, including consideration by Appeals, is a prerequisite for the Tax Court to have jurisdiction, and the taxpayer failed to timely request Appeals consideration. For example, Appeals consideration must be requested before a petition is filed in the Tax Court regarding a declaratory judgment request under section 7428 (relating to declaratory judgment on the classification of specified organizations), section 7476 (relating to declaratory judgment on qualification of certain retirement plans), or section 7477 (relating to declaratory judgment on the value of certain gifts) of the Code.
(24) Any administrative determination made by the IRS to deny or revoke a Certified Professional Employer Organization certification.
(d)
Originating office has completed its review
—(1)
In general.
Appeals consideration of a matter or issue is appropriate only after the originating IRS office has completed its action on the Federal tax controversy and issued an administrative determination or a proposed administrative determination accompanied by an offer for consideration by Appeals. If the originating office has not completed its action regarding the Federal tax controversy, the request for Appeals consideration is premature. Appeals may consider the Federal tax controversy if the taxpayer requests consideration after the originating office's action is complete and if all requirements in this section are met.
(2)
Exception for early consideration programs.
If administrative guidance permits the originating office to engage Appeals prior to completing its action regarding the Federal tax controversy, Appeals may consider the Federal tax controversy under the
terms of that administrative guidance, such as mediation under a fast track settlement program or early consideration of some issues under an early referral program.
(e)
Procedural and timing requirements are followed
—(1)
In general.
A request for Appeals consideration of a Federal tax controversy must be submitted in the time and manner prescribed in applicable forms, instructions, or other administrative guidance. All procedural requirements must be complied with before Appeals will consider a Federal tax controversy. In addition, there must be sufficient time remaining on the appropriate limitations period for Appeals to consider the Federal tax controversy, as provided in administrative guidance. In a case docketed in the Tax Court, if the Office of Chief Counsel has recalled the case from Appeals or, if not recalled, Appeals has returned the case to the Office of Chief Counsel so that it is received by the Office of Chief Counsel prior to the date of the calendar call for the trial session, further consideration by Appeals will not be available if there is insufficient time for such consideration.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of the rule of insufficient time remaining on the limitations periods for Appeals consideration: The IRS examines Taxpayer X's Form 1040,
U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,
and determines a deficiency in income tax due to the IRS disallowing some of the deductions reported on the return. Because the expiration date of the assessment period of limitations with respect to the proposed deficiency is imminent, there is insufficient time for Appeals to receive the case and determine whether the case is susceptible to settlement. Consequently, the IRS issues a notice of deficiency under section 6212 of the Code to Taxpayer X. Under section 6213(a) of the Code, the issuance of this notice suspends the running of the assessment period while a taxpayer seeks judicial review of the notice. Taxpayer X timely files a petition with the Tax Court. After the case is docketed in the Tax Court, Taxpayer X generally would have the opportunity to have Appeals consider the case.
(f)
One opportunity for consideration by Appeals
—(1)
In general.
If a Federal tax controversy is eligible for consideration by Appeals and the procedural and timing requirements are followed, a taxpayer generally has one opportunity for Appeals to consider such matter or issue in the same case for the same period or in any type of future case for the same period, unless the Tax Court remands for reconsideration in a CDP case. Appeals has considered a Federal tax controversy if the Federal tax controversy was before Appeals for consideration and Appeals issued a determination or made a settlement offer, Appeals decided the Federal tax controversy was not susceptible to settlement, or the person who requested consideration was issued and failed to respond to Appeals' communications and as a result of that failure Appeals issued or made a determination. Appeals also has considered a Federal tax controversy if the taxpayer notified the Office of Chief Counsel or the IRS that the taxpayer wanted to discontinue settlement consideration by Appeals or requested to transfer from Appeals to the Office of Chief Counsel settlement consideration of a Federal tax controversy that is currently before the Tax Court.
(2)
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1) of this section, taxpayers retain the opportunity for a traditional appeal after participating in an early consideration program as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section if no agreement was reached between the taxpayer and the IRS originating office. Taxpayers may be able to request post-Appeals mediation under the terms of administrative guidance after a traditional appeal if no agreement was reached between the taxpayer and Appeals. Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1), taxpayers who provide new factual information to the IRS and who meet the conditions and requirements for audit reconsideration or for reconsideration of issues previously considered by Appeals may have an opportunity for Appeals consideration, as provided in administrative guidance.
(g)
Special rules.
The following special rules apply to this section:
(1)
Appeals reconsideration.
Notwithstanding the exception in paragraph
(c)(22) of this section, if Appeals issued a notice of deficiency, notice of liability, or other determination without having fully considered one or more issues because of an impending expiration of the statute of limitations on assessment, Appeals may choose to have the Office of Chief Counsel return the case to Appeals for full consideration of the issue or issues once the case is docketed in the Tax Court.
(2)
Coordination between Office of Chief Counsel and Appeals.
Appeals and the Office of Chief Counsel may determine how settlement authority in a Federal tax controversy that is before the Tax Court is transferred between the two offices.
(h)
Applicability date.
This section is applicable to requests for consideration by Appeals made on or after February 14, 2025.
[T.D. 10030, 90 FR 3662, Jan. 15, 2025]
§ 301.7803-3
Requests for referral to the Internal Revenue Service Independent Office of Appeals following the issuance of a notice of deficiency.
(a)
Notice and protest.
If any taxpayer requests consideration by the Internal Revenue Service Independent Office of Appeals (Appeals) of any matter or issue under section 7803(e)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) (relating to limitation on designation of cases as not eligible for referral to Appeals) and the request is denied, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) or the Commissioner's delegate must provide the taxpayer a written notice that provides a detailed description of the facts involved, the basis for the decision to deny the request, a detailed explanation of how the basis for the decision applies to such facts, and the procedures for protesting the decision to deny the request, but only if the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section are met:
(1)
Notice of deficiency.
The taxpayer received a notice of deficiency authorized under section 6212 of the Code (relating to notice of deficiency) before the taxpayer requested consideration by Appeals.
(2)
Frivolous positions.
The issue involved is not a frivolous position within the meaning of section 6702(c) of the Code (regarding listing of frivolous positions).
(3)
Multiple requests for referral to Appeals.
The taxpayer has not previously requested consideration by Appeals, pursuant to section 7803(e)(5), of the same matter or issue in a taxable year or period.
(4)
Previous Appeals consideration.
Appeals has not previously considered the matter or issue in a taxable year or period that is the subject of the request and determined that the matter or issue could not be settled or a settlement offer was rejected, except as provided in § 301.7803-2(f)(2) with respect to a taxpayer participating in an early consideration program.
(5)
Notice of deficiency with more than one matter or issue.
If the notice of deficiency for which the taxpayer requests Appeals consideration includes more than one matter or issue in a taxable year or period, the taxpayer must request referral for Appeals consideration and submit all such matters or issues at the same time.
(b)
Applicability date.
This section is applicable to relevant requests for consideration by Appeals made on or after February 14, 2025.
[T.D. 10030, 90 FR 3662, Jan. 15, 2025]

[T.D. 9178, 70 FR 7397, Feb. 14, 2005]
§ 301.9000-3
Testimony authorizations.
(a)
Prohibition on disclosure of IRS records or information without testimony authorization.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, when a request or demand for IRS records or information is made, no IRS officer, employee or contractor shall testify or disclose IRS records or information to any court, administrative agency or other authority, or to the Congress, or to a committee or subcommittee of the Congress without a testimony authorization. However, an IRS officer, employee or contractor may appear in person to advise that he or she is
awaiting instructions from an authorizing official with respect to the request or demand.

(4) If a more specific procedure established by the Commissioner governs the disclosure of IRS records or information. These procedures include, but are not limited to, those relating to: procedures pursuant to § 601.702(d) of this chapter; Freedom of Information Act requests pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552; Privacy Act of 1974 requests pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a; disclosures to state tax agencies pursuant to section 6103(d) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code); and disclosures to the United States Department of Justice pursuant to an ex parte order under section 6103(i)(1) of the Code.

If tax convention information (as defined under section 6105) may be disclosed, in deciding whether the disclosure is authorized, the authorizing official must coordinate the disclosure with the U.S. Competent Authority.
[T.D. 9178, 70 FR 7397, Feb. 14, 2005]

If the authorizing official denies authorization in whole or in part, the government attorney or other representative of the government shall inform the court, administrative agency or other authority of the reasons the authorizing official gives for not authorizing the testimony or the disclosure of the IRS records or information or take other action in opposition as may be appropriate (including, but not limited to, filing a motion to quash or a motion to remove to Federal court).

Nothing in §§ 301.9000-1 through 301.9000-3, this section, and §§ 301.9000-5 and 301.9000-6, creates, is intended to create, or may be relied upon to create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States. Nothing in these regulations
creates a separate privilege or basis to withhold IRS records or information.

(5) Whether a declaration of an IRS officer, employee or contractor under penalties of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746 would suffice in lieu of deposition or trial testimony;

[T.D. 9178, 70 FR 7397, Feb. 14, 2005]
§ 301.9000-6
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of §§ 301.9000-1 through 301.9000-5:

# Example 1.
A taxpayer sues a practitioner in state court for malpractice in connection with the practitioner's preparation of a Federal income tax return. The taxpayer subpoenas an IRS employee to testify concerning the IRS employee's examination of the taxpayer's Federal income tax return. The taxpayer provides the statement required by § 301.9000-5. This is a non-IRS matter. A testimony authorization would be required for the IRS employee to testify. (In addition, the taxpayer would be required to execute an appropriate consent under section 6103(c) of the Code). The IRS would oppose the IRS employee's appearance in this case because the IRS is a disinterested party with respect to the dispute and would consider the commitment of resources to comply with the subpoena inappropriate.

# Example 2.
In a state judicial proceeding concerning child support, the child's custodial parent subpoenas for a deposition an IRS agent who is examining certain post-divorce Federal income tax returns of the non-custodial parent. This is a non-IRS matter. The custodial parent submits with the subpoena the statement required by § 301.9000-5 stating as the reason for the lack of taxpayer consent to disclosure that the non-custodial parent has refused to provide the consent (both a consent from the taxpayer complying with section 6103(c) and a testimony authorization would be required prior to the IRS agent testifying at the deposition). If taxpayer consent is obtained, the IRS may provide a declaration or certified return information of the taxpayer. A deposition would be unnecessary under the circumstances.

# Example 3.
The chairperson of a congressional committee requests the appearance of an IRS employee before the committee and committee staff to submit to questioning by committee staff concerning the procedures for processing Federal employment tax returns. This is an IRS congressional matter. Even though questioning would not involve the disclosure of returns or return information, the questioning would involve the disclosure of IRS records or information; therefore, a testimony authorization would be required. The IRS employee must contact the IRS Office of Legislative Affairs for instructions before appearing.

# Example 4.
The IRS opens a criminal investigation as to the tax liabilities of a taxpayer. This is an IRS matter. During the criminal investigation, the IRS refers the matter to the United States Department of Justice, requesting the institution of a Federal grand jury to investigate further potential criminal tax violations. The United
States Department of Justice approves the request and initiates a grand jury investigation. The grand jury indicts the taxpayer. During the taxpayer's trial, the taxpayer subpoenas an IRS special agent for testimony regarding the investigation. The records and information collected during the administrative stage of the investigation, including the taxpayer's tax returns from IRS files, are IRS records and information. A testimony authorization is required for the IRS special agent to testify regarding this information. However, no IRS testimony authorization is required regarding the information collected by the IRS special agent when the IRS special agent was acting under the direction and control of the United States Attorney's Office in the Federal grand jury investigation. That information is not IRS records or information within the meaning of § 301.9000-1(a). Disclosure of that information should be coordinated with the United States Attorney's Office.

# Example 5.
The United States Department of Justice attorney representing the IRS in a suit for refund requests testimony from an IRS revenue agent. This is an IRS matter. A testimony authorization would not be required for the IRS revenue agent to testify because the testimony was requested by the government attorney.

# Example 6.
In response to a request by the taxpayer's counsel to interview an IRS revenue agent who was involved in a case at the administrative level, the United States Department of Justice attorney representing the IRS in a suit for refund asks that the IRS revenue agent be made available to be interviewed. This is an IRS matter. A testimony authorization would be required for the IRS revenue agent to testify because the testimony was first requested by taxpayer's counsel.

# Example 7.
A state assistant attorney general, acting in accordance with a recommendation from his state's department of revenue, is prosecuting a taxpayer under a state criminal law proscribing the intentional failure to file a state income tax return. The assistant attorney general serves an IRS employee with a subpoena to testify concerning the taxpayer's Federal income tax return filing history. This is a non-IRS matter. This is also a state judicial proceeding pertaining to tax administration within the meaning of section 6103(h)(4) and (b)(4). As such, the requirements of section 6103(h)(4) apply. A testimony authorization would be required for the testimony demand in the subpoena.

# Example 8.
A former IRS revenue agent is requested to testify in a divorce proceeding. The request seeks testimony explaining the meaning of entries appearing on one party's transcript of account, which is already in the possession of the parties. This is a non-IRS matter. No testimony authorization is required because the testimony requested from the former IRS employee involves general knowledge gained while the former IRS revenue agent was employed with the IRS.

# Example 9.
A Department of Justice attorney requests an IRS employee to testify in a refund suit involving Taxpayer A. The testimony may include tax convention information, as defined in section 6105, which was originally obtained by the IRS from a treaty partner in connection with a tax case against Taxpayer B. While no testimony authorization is necessary, because the testimony is being requested by government counsel in a tax matter, the IRS employee may not testify (or otherwise disclose IRS records or information) without coordinating with the U.S. Competent Authority, as disclosure of tax convention information is governed by section 6105. The disclosure must also meet the requirements in section 6103(h)(4).

# Example 10.
In a state court tort action, Defendant subpoenas IRS for Plaintiff's federal income tax returns for particular taxable years. This is a non-IRS matter. The Disclosure Officer instructs Defendant that the IRS has established procedures for obtaining copies of Federal income tax returns. Section 601.702(d)(1) of this chapter establishes the procedures for obtaining Federal tax returns by requiring written requests for copies of tax returns using IRS Form 4506, “Request for Copy of Tax Return.” At Defendant's request, Plaintiff executes Form 4506, naming Defendant's counsel as designee, and the form is properly submitted to IRS. A testimony authorization would not be required to disclose Plaintiff's returns to Defendant's counsel.

Statutory provisions; Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978.
Section 302 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 (92 Stat. 629) provides as follows:
Sec. 302. (a) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States an Offshore Oil Pollution Compensation Fund in an amount not to exceed $200,000,000, except that such limitation shall be increased to the extent necessary to permit any moneys recovered or collected which are referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section to be paid
into the Fund. The Fund shall be administered by the Secretary
1
and the Secretary of the Treasury as specified in this title. The Fund may sue and be sued in its own name.
1
“Secretary” wherever used in this section means the Secretary of Transportation.
(b) The Fund shall be composed of—
(1) All fees collected pursuant to subsection (d) of this section; and
(2) All other moneys recovered or collected on behalf of the Fund under section 308 or any other provision of this title.
(c) The Fund shall be immediately available for—
(1) Removal costs described in section 301(22):
(2) The processing and settlement claims under section 307 of this title (including the costs of assessing injury to, or destruction of, natural resources); and
(3) Subject to such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts, all administrative and personnel costs of the Federal Government incident to the administration of this title, including, but not limited to, the claims settlement activities and adjudicatory and judicial proceedings, whether or not such costs are recoverable under section 308 of this title.
The Secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations designating the person or persons who may obligate available money in the Fund for such purposes.
(d)(1) The Secretary shall levy and the Secretary of the Treasury shall collect a fee of not to exceed 3 cents per barrel on oil obtained from the Outer Continental Shelf, which shall be imposed on the owner of the oil when such oil is produced.
(2) The Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with the Secretary, may promulgate reasonable regulations relating to the collection of the fees authorized by paragraph (1) of this subsection and, from time to time, the modification thereof. Any modification shall become effective on the date specified in the regulation making such modification, but no earlier than the ninetieth day following the date such regulation is published in the
Federal Register.
Any modification of the fee shall be designed to insure that the Fund is maintained at a level of not less than $100,000,000 and not more than $200,000,000. No regulation that sets or modifies fees, whether or not in effect, may be stayed by any court pending completion of judicial review of such regulation.
(3)(A) Any person who fails to collect or pay any fee as required by any regulation promulgated under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000, to be assessed by the Secretary of the Treasury, in addition to the fee required to be collected or paid and the interest on such fee at the rate such fee would have earned if collected or paid when due and invested in special obligations of the United States in accordance with subsection (e)(2) of this section. Upon the failure of any person so liable to pay any penalty, fee, or interest upon demand, the Attorney General may, at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury, bring an action in the name of the Fund against that person for such amount.
(B) Any person who falsifies records or documents required to be maintained under any regulation promulgated under this subsection shall be subject to prosecution for a violation of section 1001 of title 18, United States Code.
(4) The Secretary of the Treasury may, by regulation, designate the reasonably necessary records and documents to be kept by persons from whom fees are to be collected pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, and the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General of the United States shall have access to such records and documents for the purpose of audit and examination.
(e)(1) The Secretary shall determine the level of funding required for immediate access in order to meet potential obligations of the Fund.
(2) The Secretary of the Treasury may invest any excess in the Fund above the level determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection, in interest-bearing special obligations of the United States. Such special obligations may be redeemed at any time in accordance with the terms of the special issue and pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury. The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale of, any obligations held in the Fund shall be deposited in and credited to the Fund.
(f) If at any time the moneys available in the Fund are insufficient to meet the obligations of the Fund, the Secretary shall issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in the forms and denominations, bearing the interest rates and maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Redemption of such notes or other obligations shall be made by the Secretary from moneys in the Fund. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of comparable maturity. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any notes or other obligations issued under this subsection and, for that purpose, he is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act. The purpose for which securities may be issued under that Act are extended to include any purchase of such notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the
Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.

[T.D. 7697, 45 FR 33974, May 21, 1980]
§ 301.9001-1
Collection of fee.
(a)
Imposition of fee
—(1)
In general.
Under section 302(d) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 (Act), the Internal Revenue Service is authorized to collect a fee of not more than 3 cents per barrel on oil that is obtained from the Outer Continental Shelf. This fee is established by the Commandant, United States Coast Guard, and is imposed on the owner of the oil as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The barrels subject to the fee shall be those barrels reported by the owner of the oil (§ 301.9001-1 (a)(2)), or a person authorized to act for the owner, on the monthly royalty reports, Form 9-153, filed with the U.S. Geological Survey as required by 30 CFR 250.94. For the purpose of computing this fee, the owner of the oil shall measure the Outer Continental Shelf oil production by employing the criteria of the U.S. Geological Survey contained in 30 CFR 250.60 and Outer Continental Shelf Gulf of Mexico Order 13. No reduction in the amount due will be permitted by reason of theoretical or actual oil lost in transit. To ensure that the Fund is maintained at a level of not less than $100,000,000 and not more than $200,000,000, the Commandant, United States Coast Guard, may modify the amount of this fee.
(2)
Owner of oil.
For the purposes of §§ 301.9001-1, 301.9001-2, and 301.9001-3, the owner of oil is the person in whom is vested ownership of the oil as it is produced at the wellhead without regard to the existence of contractual arrangements for the sale or other disposition of the oil between such a person and third parties. Under this rule, the Federal government entitlement to royalty oil does not constitute ownership of oil by the Federal government at the time of production.
(3)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X is the owner of oil produced on the Outer Continental Shelf. During one reporting period, 10,000 barrels of oil were obtained from this location. X will use a portion of this oil to make a royalty payment to the United States government. X also has a contract with Y to sell Y the remaining barrels of oil. For the purpose of the Act, X is the owner of the oil and must pay a fee of 3 cents per barrel on all 10,000 barrels of oil.
(4)
Cross-references.
See § 301.9001-2(a) for the definition of barrel, § 301.9001-2(b) for the definition of oil, and § 301.9001-2(c) for the definition of person.
(5)
Effective Date.
The provisions of §§ 301.9001-1, 301.9001-2, and 301.9001-3 are effective on July 25, 1979, at 7:00 a.m., local time. If, however, the established practice has been to gauge oil production at a time other than 7:00 a.m., the effective date is July 25, 1979, at the time production has been gauged.
(b)
Collection of fee.
The Internal Revenue Service shall collect the fee imposed by section 302(d) of the Act. Administrative procedures for the collection of this fee shall be prescribed from time to time by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may designate the reasonably necessary records and documents to be kept by the person or persons from whom the fee is collected. See also the regulations under 33 CFR 135.103 for additional rules relating to the implementation of the Act.
(c)
Time and place for payment of the fee
—(1)
In general.
Payment of the fee shall be made in accordance with the rules established in paragraph (c)(2), (3) and (4) of this section. When a deposit is required by these rules, it must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Austin, Texas 73301 using Form 6008, Fee Deposit for Offshore Oil. Adjustments required in the amount paid during the calendar quarter to reflect the actual amount due for the quarter shall be made on Form 6009, Quarterly Report of Fees Due. Form 6009 must be filed on or before the last day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter with the Austin Service Center. The rules under section 7502, relating to the treatment of timely
mailing as timely filing and paying, and section 7503, relating to the time for performance of acts where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday are applicable to the filing of Form 6009.
(2)
$100 or less of fees.
If the owner of oil is liable in any calendar quarter for $100 or less of fees, the owner or a person authorized to act for the owner may either deposit this amount or pay the full amount of the fee when Form 6009 is filed.
(3)
More than $100 of fees.
If the owner of oil is liable in the first or second month of the calendar quarter for more than $100 of fees and is not required to make a semimonthly deposit (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section), the owner or a person authorized to act for the owner must deposit the amount on or before the last day of the following month following the month of production.
(4)
More than $2000 of fees.
The owner of oil who is liable for more than $2000 of fees for any month of a calendar quarter must deposit fees for the following quarter (regardless of amount) on a semimonthly basis. The deposit must be made on or before the ninth day following the semimonthly period for which it is reportable. The first deposit for a month may be reasonably estimated when an accounting of oil production is normally done by the month. Under these circumstances, the second for that month deposit should be adjusted to reflect the total barrels produced in that month.
(d)
Responsibility for payment of fee
—(1)
In general.
Form 6009, Quarterly Report of Fees Due, must be filed and the fee must be paid either by the owner of the oil (§ 301.9001-1(a)(2)) or by a person authorized to act for the owner of the oil under an acceptable power of attorney filed with the Austin Service Center. For the purposes of the regulations at §§ 301.9001-1, 301.9001-2, and 301.9001-3, an operating agreement between the operator of the oil-producing facility and the owner of oil is considered an acceptable power of attorney if the operating agreement specifically states that the operator is authorized to pay the fee imposed by section 302(d) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
W, X, Y, and Z are oil companies that own equal interests in oil produced on the Outer Continental Shelf. W was selected to be the operator of the offshore facility. Additionally, X, Y, and Z authorized W to file Form 6009 and to pay the fee imposed by section 302(d) of the Act on the oil produced at this facility. Pursuant to this authorization, W paid a fee of $16,600. Since the ownership of the oil is divided equally among W, X, Y, and Z, each company's share of the fee is $4,150.
(e)
Penalty and Interest.
Failure to collect or pay the fee shall result in a civil penalty assessed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The amount of the penalty is not to exceed $10,000 in addition to the fee and the interest on the unpaid fee that would have been earned if paid when due and invested in the special Treasury securities which are to be purchased by the fund. The computation of the rate of interest to be levied on underpayment of fees shall be based on the average interest rate earned by the interest-bearing special obligations of the United States in the fund for each calendar quarter for which there is underpayment. Unless it can be shown that the failure to collect or pay the fee is due to reasonable cause and not due to the willful neglect, the amount of the penalty is the lesser of—
(1) $10,000 or
(2) The amount of the fee.

§ 301.9100-1
Extensions of time to make elections.
(a)
Introduction.
The regulations under this section and §§ 301.9100-2 and 301.9100-3 provide the standards the Commissioner will use to determine whether to grant an extension of time to make a regulatory election. The regulations under this section and § 301.9100-2 also provide an automatic extension of time to make certain statutory elections. An extension of time is available for elections that a taxpayer is otherwise eligible to make. However, the granting of an extension of time is not a determination that the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to make the election. Section 301.9100-2 provides automatic extensions of time for making regulatory and statutory elections when the deadline for making the election is the due date of the return or the due date of the return including extensions. Section 301.9100-3 provides extensions of time for making regulatory elections that do not meet the requirements of § 301.9100-2.
(b)
Terms.
The following terms have the meanings provided below—
Election
includes an application for relief in respect of tax; a request to adopt, change, or retain an accounting method or accounting period; but does not include an application for an extension of time for filing a return under section 6081.
Regulatory election
means an election whose due date is prescribed by a regulation published in the
Federal Register,
or a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
Statutory election
means an election whose due date is prescribed by statute.
Taxpayer
means any person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(1).
(c)
General standards for relief.
The Commissioner in exercising the Commissioner's discretion may grant a reasonable extension of time under the rules set forth in §§ 301.9100-2 and 301.9100-3 to make a regulatory election, or a statutory election (but no more than 6 months except in the case of a taxpayer who is abroad), under all subtitles of the Internal Revenue Code except subtitles E, G, H, and I.
(d)
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, an extension of time will not be granted—
(1) For elections under section 4980A(f)(5); or
(2) For elections that are expressly excepted from relief or where alternative relief is provided by a statute, a regulation published in the
Federal Register,
or a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(e)
Effective dates.
In general, this section and §§ 301.9100-2 and 301.9100-3 apply to all requests for an extension of time submitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on or after December 31, 1997. However, the automatic 12-month and 6-month extensions provided in § 301.9100-2 apply to elections for which corrective action is taken on or after December 31, 1997. For other requests for an extension of time, see §§ 301.9100-1T through 301.9100-3T in effect prior to December 31, 1997 (§§ 301.9100-1T through 301.9100-3T as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1997).
[T.D. 8742, 62 FR 68169, Dec. 31, 1997]
§ 301.9100-2
Automatic extensions.
(a)
Automatic 12-month extension
—(1)
In general.
An automatic extension of 12 months from the due date for making a regulatory election is granted to make elections described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section provided the taxpayer takes corrective action as defined in paragraph (c) of this section within that 12-month extension period. For purposes of this paragraph (a), the due date for making a regulatory election is the extended due date of the return if the due date of the election is the due date of the return or the due date of the return including extensions and the taxpayer has obtained an extension of time to file the return. This extension is available regardless of whether the taxpayer timely filed its return for the year the election should have been made.
(2)
Elections eligible for automatic 12-month extension.
The following regulatory elections are eligible for the automatic 12-month extension described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section—
(i) The election to use other than the required taxable year under section 444;
(ii) The election to use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method under section 472;
(iii) The 15-month rule for filing an exemption application for a section 501(c)(9), 501(c)(17), or 501(c)(20) organization under section 505;
(iv) The 15-month rule for filing an exemption application for a section 501(c)(3) organization under section 508;
(v) The election to be treated as a homeowners association under section 528;
(vi) The election to adjust basis on partnership transfers and distributions under section 754;
(vii) The estate tax election to specially value qualified real property (where the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not yet begun an examination of the filed return) under section 2032A(d)(1);
(viii) The chapter 14 gift tax election to treat a qualified payment right as other than a qualified payment under section 2701(c)(3)(C)(i); and
(ix) The chapter 14 gift tax election to treat any distribution right as a qualified payment under section 2701(c)(3)(C)(ii).
(b)
Automatic 6-month extension.
An automatic extension of 6 months from
the due date of a return excluding extensions is granted to make regulatory or statutory elections whose due dates are the due date of the return or the due date of the return including extensions provided the taxpayer timely filed its return for the year the election should have been made and the taxpayer takes corrective action as defined in paragraph (c) of this section within that 6-month extension period. This paragraph (b) does not apply to regulatory or statutory elections that must be made by the due date of the return excluding extensions.
(c)
Corrective action.
For purposes of this section, corrective action means taking the steps required to file the election in accordance with the statute or the regulation published in the
Federal Register,
or the revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). For those elections required to be filed with a return, corrective action includes filing an original or an amended return for the year the regulatory or statutory election should have been made and attaching the appropriate form or statement for making the election. Taxpayers who make an election under an automatic extension (and all taxpayers whose tax liability would be affected by the election) must file their return in a manner that is consistent with the election and comply with all other requirements for making the election for the year the election should have been made and for all affected years; otherwise, the IRS may invalidate the election.
(d)
Procedural requirements.
Any return, statement of election, or other form of filing that must be made to obtain an automatic extension must provide the following statement at the top of the document: “FILED PURSUANT TO § 301.9100-2”. Any filing made to obtain an automatic extension must be sent to the same address that the filing to make the election would have been sent had the filing been timely made. No request for a letter ruling is required to obtain an automatic extension. Accordingly, user fees do not apply to taxpayers taking corrective action to obtain an automatic extension.
(e) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1. Automatic 12-month extension.
Taxpayer A fails to make an election described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section when filing A's 1997 income tax return on March 16, 1998, the due date of the return. This election does not affect the tax liability of any other taxpayer. The applicable regulation requires that the election be made by attaching the appropriate form to a timely filed return including extensions. In accordance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, A may make the regulatory election by taking the corrective action of filing an amended return with the appropriate form by March 15, 1999 (12 months from the March 16, 1998 due date of the return). If A obtained a 6-month extension to file its 1997 income tax return, A may make the regulatory election by taking the corrective action of filing an amended return with the appropriate form by September 15, 1999 (12 months from the September 15, 1998 extended due date of the return).

# Example 2. Automatic 6-month extension.
Taxpayer B fails to make an election not described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section when filing B's 1997 income tax return on March 16, 1998, the due date of the return. This election does not affect the tax liability of any other taxpayer. The applicable regulation requires that the election be made by attaching the appropriate form to a timely filed return including extensions. In accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, B may make the regulatory election by taking the corrective action of filing an amended return with the appropriate form by September 15, 1998 (6 months from the March 16, 1998 due date of the return).
(f)
Automatic 6-month extension for certain generation-skipping transfer tax allocations and elections
—(1)
Availability.
Paragraph (b) of this section is not available to obtain an automatic 6-month extension to allocate generation-skipping transfer (GST) exemption to a transfer pursuant to section 2632 or to make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5). An automatic 6-month extension to allocate GST exemption under section 2632 or to make an election under section 2632(b)(3) or (c)(5) is available to transferors or the executors of transferors' estates pursuant to § 26.2642-7(i)(1) of this chapter if the requirements of that provision are satisfied.
(2)
Applicability date.
Paragraph (f) of this section applies to any gift or estate tax return or Form 8939,
Allocation of Increase in Basis for Property Acquired from a Decedent,
for which the date prescribed for filing is on or after May 6, 2024 (excluding extensions), regardless of the date of the transfer.
[T.D. 8742, 62 FR 68170, Dec. 31, 1997, as amended by T.D. 9996, 89 FR 37127, May 6, 2024]
§ 301.9100-3
Other extensions.
(a)
In general.
Requests for extensions of time for regulatory elections that do not meet the requirements of § 301.9100-2 must be made under the rules of this section. Requests for relief subject to this section will be granted when the taxpayer provides the evidence (including affidavits described in paragraph (e) of this section) to establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the grant of relief will not prejudice the interests of the Government.
(b)
Reasonable action and good faith
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, a taxpayer is deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer—
(i) Requests relief under this section before the failure to make the regulatory election is discovered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS);
(ii) Failed to make the election because of intervening events beyond the taxpayer's control;
(iii) Failed to make the election because, after exercising reasonable diligence (taking into account the taxpayer's experience and the complexity of the return or issue), the taxpayer was unaware of the necessity for the election;
(iv) Reasonably relied on the written advice of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); or
(v) Reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional, including a tax professional employed by the taxpayer, and the tax professional failed to make, or advise the taxpayer to make, the election.
(2)
Reasonable reliance on a qualified tax professional.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer will not be considered to have reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional if the taxpayer knew or should have known that the professional was not—
(i) Competent to render advice on the regulatory election; or
(ii) Aware of all relevant facts.
(3)
Taxpayer deemed to have not acted reasonably or in good faith.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer is deemed to have not acted reasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer—
(i) Seeks to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662 at the time the taxpayer requests relief (taking into account any qualified amended return filed within the meaning of § 1.6664-2(c)(3) of this chapter) and the new position requires or permits a regulatory election for which relief is requested;
(ii) Was informed in all material respects of the required election and related tax consequences, but chose not to file the election; or
(iii) Uses hindsight in requesting relief. If specific facts have changed since the due date for making the election that make the election advantageous to a taxpayer, the IRS will not ordinarily grant relief. In such a case, the IRS will grant relief only when the taxpayer provides strong proof that the taxpayer's decision to seek relief did not involve hindsight.
(c)
Prejudice to the interests of the Government
—(1)
In general.
The Commissioner will grant a reasonable extension of time to make a regulatory election only when the interests of the Government will not be prejudiced by the granting of relief. This paragraph (c) provides the standards the Commissioner will use to determine when the interests of the Government are prejudiced.
(i)
Lower tax liability.
The interests of the Government are prejudiced if granting relief would result in a taxpayer having a lower tax liability in the aggregate for all taxable years affected by the election than the taxpayer would have had if the election had been timely made (taking into account the time value of money). Similarly, if the tax consequences of more than one taxpayer are affected by the election, the Government's interests
are prejudiced if extending the time for making the election may result in the affected taxpayers, in the aggregate, having a lower tax liability than if the election had been timely made.
(ii)
Closed years.
The interests of the Government are ordinarily prejudiced if the taxable year in which the regulatory election should have been made or any taxable years that would have been affected by the election had it been timely made are closed by the period of limitations on assessment under section 6501(a) before the taxpayer's receipt of a ruling granting relief under this section. The IRS may condition a grant of relief on the taxpayer providing the IRS with a statement from an independent auditor (other than an auditor providing an affidavit pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section) certifying that the interests of the Government are not prejudiced under the standards set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
Special rules for accounting method regulatory elections.
The interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in unusual and compelling circumstances if the accounting method regulatory election for which relief is requested—
(i) Is subject to the procedure described in § 1.446-1(e)(3)(i) of this chapter (requiring the advance written consent of the Commissioner);
(ii) Requires an adjustment under section 481(a) (or would require an adjustment under section 481(a) if the taxpayer changed to the method of accounting for which relief is requested in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year the election should have been made);
(iii) Would permit a change from an impermissible method of accounting that is an issue under consideration by examination, an appeals office, or a federal court and the change would provide a more favorable method or more favorable terms and conditions than if the change were made as part of an examination; or
(iv) Provides a more favorable method of accounting or more favorable terms and conditions if the election is made by a certain date or taxable year.
(3)
Special rules for accounting period regulatory elections.
The interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in unusual and compelling circumstances if an election is an accounting period regulatory election (other than the election to use other than the required taxable year under section 444) and the request for relief is filed more than 90 days after the due date for filing the Form 1128, Application to Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year (or other required statement).
(d)
Effect of amended returns
—(1)
Second examination under section 7605(b).
Taxpayers requesting and receiving an extension of time under this section waive any objections to a second examination under section 7605(b) for the issue(s) that is the subject of the relief request and any correlative adjustments.
(2)
Suspension of the period of limitations under section 6501(a).
A request for relief under this section does not suspend the period of limitations on assessment under section 6501(a). Thus, for relief to be granted, the IRS may require the taxpayer to consent under section 6501(c)(4) to an extension of the period of limitations on assessment for the taxable year in which the regulatory election should have been made and any taxable years that would have been affected by the election had it been timely made.
(e)
Procedural requirements
—(1)
In general.
Requests for relief under this section must provide evidence that satisfies the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and must provide additional information as required by this paragraph (e).
(2)
Affidavit and declaration from taxpayer.
The taxpayer, or the individual who acts on behalf of the taxpayer with respect to tax matters, must submit a detailed affidavit describing the events that led to the failure to make a valid regulatory election and to the discovery of the failure. When the taxpayer relied on a qualified tax professional for advice, the taxpayer's affidavit must describe the engagement and responsibilities of the professional as well as the extent to which the taxpayer relied on the professional. The affidavit must be accompanied by a dated declaration, signed by the taxpayer, which states: “Under penalties
of perjury, I declare that I have examined this request, including accompanying documents, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the request contains all the relevant facts relating to the request, and such facts are true, correct, and complete.” The individual who signs for an entity must have personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances at issue.
(3)
Affidavits and declarations from other parties.
