# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Subpart A—Relation of This Part to Other Parts in This Chapter
§ 501.101
Relation of this part to other parts in this chapter.
This part sets forth standard reporting and recordkeeping requirements and license application and other procedures governing transactions regulated pursuant to other parts codified in this chapter, as well as to economic sanctions programs for which implementation and administration are delegated to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Substantive prohibitions and policies particular to each economic sanctions program are not contained in this part but are set forth in the particular part of this chapter dedicated to that program, or, in the case of economic sanctions programs not yet implemented in regulations, in the applicable executive order or other authority. License application procedures and reporting requirements set forth in this part govern transactions undertaken pursuant to general or specific licenses. The criteria for general and specific licenses pertaining to a particular economic sanctions program are set forth in subpart E of the individual parts in this chapter. Statements of licensing policy contained in subpart E of the individual parts in this chapter, however, may contain additional information collection provisions that require production of specified documentation unique to a given general license or statement of licensing policy.
[62 FR 52494, Oct. 8, 1997]

# Subpart B—Definitions
§ 501.301
Definitions.
Definitions of terms used in this part are found in subpart C of the part within this chapter applicable to the relevant application, record, report, procedure or transaction. In the case of economic sanctions programs for which implementation and administration are delegated to the Office of Foreign Assets Control but for which regulations have not yet been issued, the definitions of terms in this part are governed by definitions contained in the implementing statute or Executive order.

# Subpart C—Reports
§ 501.601
Records and recordkeeping requirements.
Except as otherwise provided, every person engaging in any transaction subject to the provisions of this chapter shall keep a full and accurate record of each such transaction engaged in, regardless of whether such transaction is effected pursuant to license or otherwise, and such record shall be available for examination for at least 10 years after the date of such transaction. Except as otherwise provided, every person holding property blocked pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or funds transfers retained pursuant to § 596.504(b) of this chapter shall keep a full and accurate record of such property, and such record shall be available for examination for the period of time that such property is blocked and for at least 10 years after the date such property is unblocked.
[62 FR 45101, Aug. 25, 1997, as amended at 62 FR 52494, Oct. 8, 1997; 89 FR 74834, Sept. 13, 2024]
§ 501.602
Reports to be furnished on demand.
(a) Every person is required to furnish under oath, in the form of reports or otherwise, from time to time and at any time as may be required by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, complete information relative to any act or transaction, regardless of whether such act or transaction is effected pursuant to license or otherwise, subject to the provisions of this chapter or relative to any property in which any foreign country or any national thereof has or had any interest of any nature whatsoever, direct or indirect. The Office of Foreign Assets Control may require that such reports include the production of any books, contracts, letters, papers, or other hard copy or electronic
documents relating to any such act, transaction, or property, in the custody or control of the persons required to make such reports. Reports with respect to transactions may be required either before, during, or after such transactions. Except as provided in parts 596 and 597, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may, through any person or agency, conduct investigations, hold hearings, administer oaths, examine witnesses, receive evidence, take depositions, and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any books, contracts, letters, papers, and other hard copy or electronic documents relating to any matter under investigation, regardless of whether any report has been required or filed in connection therewith.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term “document” includes any written, recorded, or graphic matter or other means of preserving thought or expression (including in electronic format), and all tangible things stored in any medium from which information can be processed, transcribed, or obtained directly or indirectly, including correspondence, memoranda, notes, messages, contemporaneous communications such as text and instant messages, letters, emails, spreadsheets, metadata, contracts, bulletins, diaries, chronological data, minutes, books, reports, examinations, charts, ledgers, books of account, invoices, air waybills, bills of lading, worksheets, receipts, printouts, papers, schedules, affidavits, presentations, transcripts, surveys, graphic representations of any kind, drawings, photographs, graphs, video or sound recordings, and motion pictures or other film.
(c) Persons providing documents to OFAC pursuant to this section must produce documents in a usable format agreed upon by OFAC. For guidance, see OFAC's data delivery standards available on OFAC's website (
http://www.treasury.gov/ofac
).

# Note 1 to § 501.602:
If OFAC has reason to believe an account or transaction (or class of transactions) may involve the property or interests in property of a blocked person, OFAC may issue an instruction to one or more financial institutions that: (1) provides information or criteria to aid in the identification of blocked property; and (2) requires the financial institution to report transactions that meet the specified criteria and notify OFAC prior to processing such transactions. Upon review, OFAC may determine that a reported transaction involves the property or interests in property of a blocked person and take further action.

# Note 2 to § 501.602:
See subpart F of part 597 for the relationship between this section and part 597.
[84 FR 29058, June 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 40375, May 10, 2024]
§ 501.603
Reports of blocked, unblocked, or transferred blocked property.
(a)
Who must report
—(1)
Persons holding, unblocking, or transferring blocked property.
Any U.S. person (or person subject to U.S. jurisdiction in the case of part 515 of this chapter), including a financial institution, holding, unblocking, or transferring property blocked pursuant to this chapter shall submit the relevant reports described in this section to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This requirement applies to all U.S. persons (or persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction in the case of part 515 of this chapter), who have in their possession or control any property blocked pursuant to this chapter, including financial institutions that receive and block payments or transfers, or who have had in their possession or control such property that is unblocked or transferred, as set out in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Primary responsibility to report.
A report may be filed on behalf of a person who holds, transfers, or releases blocked property by an attorney, agent, or other person. Primary responsibility for reporting, however, rests with the actual holder, transferrer, or releaser of the property, or the person exercising control over property located outside the United States, with the following exceptions: primary responsibility for reporting any trust assets rests with the trustee; and primary responsibility for reporting real property rests with any U.S. co-owner, legal representative, agent, or property manager in the United States. No person is excused from filing a report by reason of the fact that another person has submitted a report
with regard to the same property, except upon actual knowledge of the report filed by such other person.
(3)
Financial institution.
For purposes of this section, the term “financial institution” includes a banking institution, domestic bank, United States depository institution, financial institution, or U.S. financial institution, as those terms are defined in the applicable part of this chapter.
(b)
What must be reported
—(1)
Initial blocking reports
—(i)
When reports are due.
Reports shall be filed within 10 business days from the date that property becomes blocked.
(ii)
Required information to be reported.
Initial reports on blocked property shall include the following:
(A) The name and address of the person holding the property blocked pursuant to this chapter (
i.e.,
the person filing the report on blocked property, such as a financial institution), and the name, telephone number, and email address of a contact from whom additional information may be obtained;
(B) A description of any transaction associated with the blocking, including: The type of transaction; any persons, including financial institutions, participating in the transaction and their respective locations (e.g., if relevant, customers, beneficiaries, originators, letter of credit applicants, and their banks; intermediary banks; correspondent banks; issuing banks; and advising or confirming banks); and any reference numbers, dates, or other information necessary to identify the transaction;
(C) The associated sanctions target(s) whose property is blocked (such as a Specially Designated National or other blocked person), the location(s) of the target(s) (if known), and, if not evident, a narrative description of the interest(s) of the target(s) in the property; if there is no target or the target is not known, include a reference to the relevant written communication from OFAC pursuant to which the blocking action was taken;
(D) A description of the property that is the subject of the blocking and its location in the United States or otherwise, including any relevant account numbers and account types, check numbers, reference numbers, dates, or other information necessary to identify the property;
(E) The date the property was blocked;
(F) The actual, or if unknown, estimated value of the property in U.S. Dollars. If the blocked property represents an outstanding loan, a credit card receivable, or other property with a negative balance, the amount blocked should be reported as $0.00 (zero) with the amount owed reflected in a narrative description.

§ 501.703
Overview of civil penalty process and construction of rules.
(a) The administrative process for enforcing TWEA sanctions programs proceeds as follows:
(1) The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control will notify a suspected violator (hereinafter “respondent”) of an alleged violation by issuing a “Prepenalty Notice.” The Prepenalty Notice shall describe the alleged violation(s) and include a proposed civil penalty amount.
(2) The respondent will have 60 days from the date the Prepenalty Notice is served to make a written presentation either defending against the alleged violation or admitting the violation. A respondent who admits a violation may offer information as to why a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
(3) Absent a settlement agreement or a finding that no violation occurred, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control will issue a “Penalty Notice.” The respondent will have 30 days from the date of service to either pay the penalty or request a hearing.
(4) If the respondent requests a hearing, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control will have two options:
(i) The Director may issue an “Order Instituting Proceedings” and refer the matter to an Administrative Law Judge for a hearing and decision; or
(ii) The Director may determine to discontinue the penalty action based on information presented by the respondent.
(5) Absent review by a Secretary's designee, the decision of the Administrative Law Judge will become the final decision of the Department without further proceedings.
(6) If review is taken by a Secretary's designee, the Secretary's designee reaches the final decision of the Department.
(7) A respondent may seek judicial review of the final decision of the Department.
(b)
Construction of rules.
The rules contained in this subpart shall be construed and administered to promote the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action. To the extent there is a conflict between the rules contained in this subpart and a procedural requirement contained in any statute, the requirement in the statute shall control.
§ 501.704
Appearance and practice.
No person shall be represented before the Director in any civil penalty matter, or an Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee in a civil penalty hearing, under this subpart except as provided in this section.
(a)
Representing oneself.
In any proceeding, an individual may appear on his or her own behalf.
(b)
Representative.
Upon written notice to the Director,
(1) A respondent may be represented by a personal representative. If a respondent wishes to be represented by counsel, such counsel must be an attorney at law admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court of any State, commonwealth, possession, or territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia;
(2) A duly authorized member of a partnership may represent the partnership; and
(3) A bona fide officer, director, or employee of a corporation, trust or association may represent the corporation, trust or association.
(c)
Director representation.
The Director shall be represented by members of the Office of Chief Counsel or any other counsel specifically assigned by the General Counsel.
(d)
Conflicts of interest
—(1)
Conflict of interest in representation.
No individual shall appear as representative for a respondent in a proceeding conducted pursuant to this subpart if it reasonably appears that such representation may be materially limited by that representative's responsibilities to a third person, or by that representative's own interests.
(2)
Corrective measures.
An Administrative Law Judge may take corrective measures at any stage of a proceeding to cure a conflict of interest in representation, including the issuance of an order limiting the scope of representation or disqualifying an individual from appearing in a representative capacity for the duration of the proceeding.
§ 501.705
Service and filing.
(a)
Service of Prepenalty Notice, Penalty Notice, Acknowledgment of Hearing Request and Order Instituting Proceedings.
The Director shall cause any Prepenalty Notice, Penalty Notice, Acknowledgment of Hearing Request, Order Instituting Proceedings, and other related orders and decisions, or any amendments or supplements thereto, to be served upon the respondent.
(1)
Service on individuals.
Service shall be complete:
(i) Upon the date of mailing by first class (regular) mail to the respondent at the respondent's last known address, or to a representative authorized to receive service, including qualified representatives noticed to the Director pursuant to § 501.704. Absent satisfactory evidence in the administrative record to the contrary, the Director may presume that the date of mailing is the date stamped on the first page of the notice or order. The respondent
may rebut the presumption that a notice or order was mailed on the stamped mailing date only by presenting evidence of the postmark date on the envelope in which the notice or order was mailed;
(ii) Upon personal service on the respondent; or leaving a copy at the respondent's place of business with a clerk or other person in charge thereof; or leaving a copy at the respondent's dwelling house or usual place of abode with a person at least 18 years of age then residing therein; or with any other representative authorized by appointment or by law to accept or receive service for the respondent, including representatives noticed to the Director pursuant to § 501.704; and evidenced by a certificate of service signed and dated by the individual making such service, stating the method of service and the identity of the individual with whom the notice or order was left; or
(iii) Upon proof of service on a respondent who is not resident in the United States by any method of service permitted by the law of the jurisdiction in which the respondent resides or is located, provided the requirements of such foreign law satisfy due process requirements under United States law with respect to notice of administrative proceedings, and where applicable laws or intergovernmental agreements or understandings make the methods of service set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section inappropriate or ineffective for service upon the nonresident respondent.
(2)
Service on corporations and other entities.
Service is complete upon delivering a copy of the notice or order to a partner, bona fide officer, director, managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive such notice, by any method specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b)
Service of responses to Prepenalty Notice, Penalty Notice, and requests for a hearing.

(b)
Contents of notice
—(1)
Facts of violation.

Right to respond.
The Prepenalty Notice shall inform the respondent of respondent's right to make a written presentation within the time prescribed in § 501.707 as to why the respondent believes there should be no finding of a violation or why, if the respondent admits the violation, a monetary penalty should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed. The Prepenalty Notice shall also inform the respondent that:
(i) The act of submitting a written response by the respondent is a factor that may result in a lower penalty absent any aggravating factors; and
(ii) If the respondent fails to respond to the Prepenalty Notice within the applicable 60-day period set forth in § 501.707, the Director may proceed with the issuance of a Penalty Notice.
(3)
Right to request a hearing.
The Prepenalty Notice shall inform the respondent of respondent's right, if a subsequent Penalty Notice is issued, to request an administrative hearing. The Director will not consider any request for an administrative hearing until a Penalty Notice has been issued.

(3) The failure to submit a response within the time period set forth in this paragraph (a), including any additional time granted by the Director, shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond to the Prepenalty Notice.
(b)
Form and contents of response
—(1)
In general.
The response need not be in any particular form, but must be typewritten and contain the heading “Response to Prepenalty Notice” and the Office of Foreign Assets Control identification number shown near the top of the Prepenalty Notice. It should be responsive to the allegations contained therein and set forth the nature of the respondent's admission of the violation, or defenses and claims for mitigation, if any.
(i) The response must admit or deny specifically each separate allegation of violation made in the Prepenalty Notice. If the respondent is without knowledge as to an allegation, the response shall so state, and such statement shall constitute a denial. Any allegation not specifically addressed in the response shall be deemed admitted.
(ii) The response must set forth any additional or new matter or arguments the respondent seeks, or shall seek, to use in support of all defenses or claims for mitigation. Any defense the respondent wishes to assert must be included in the response.

In the event of settlement prior to the issuance of a Penalty Notice, the claim proposed in the Prepenalty Notice will be withdrawn and the respondent will not be required to make a written response to the Prepenalty Notice. In the event no settlement is reached, a written response to the Prepenalty Notice is required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
§ 501.708
Director's finding of no penalty warranted.
If after considering any written response to the Prepenalty Notice submitted pursuant to § 501.707 and any other relevant facts, the Director determines that there was no violation or that the violation does not warrant the imposition of a civil monetary penalty, the Director promptly shall notify the respondent in writing of that determination and that no civil monetary penalty pursuant to this subpart will be imposed.
§ 501.709
Penalty notice.
(a) If, after considering any written response to the Prepenalty Notice, and any other relevant facts, the Director determines that there was a violation by the respondent and that a monetary penalty is warranted, the Director promptly shall issue a Penalty Notice informing the respondent that, absent a timely request for an administrative hearing, the Director will impose the civil monetary penalty described in the Penalty Notice.

(4) That absent a timely request for a hearing, the respondent must furnish respondent's taxpayer identification number pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 7701 and that the Director intends to use such information for the purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent penalty amount in the event of a failure to pay the penalty imposed.
§ 501.710
Settlement.
(a)
Availability.
Either the Director or any respondent may, at any time during the administrative civil penalty process described in this subpart, propose an offer of settlement. The amount accepted in settlement may be less than the civil penalty that might be imposed in the event of a formal determination of violation. Upon mutual agreement by the Director and a respondent on the terms of a settlement, the Director shall issue an Order of Settlement.
(b)
Procedure
—(1)
Prior to issuance of Penalty Notice.
Any offer of settlement made by a respondent prior to the issuance of a Penalty Notice shall be submitted, in writing, to the Chief of Civil Penalties, Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220.
(2)
After issuance of Penalty Notice.
Any offer of settlement made by a respondent after issuance of a Penalty
Notice shall state that it is made pursuant to this section; shall recite or incorporate as a part of the offer the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(6) of this section; shall be signed by the respondent making the offer, and not only by his or her representative; and shall be submitted to the Chief Counsel.
(3)
Extensions of time.
The submission of any settlement offer does not provide a basis for adjourning or otherwise delaying all or any portion of the administrative civil penalty process.
(i)
Prior to issuance of Order Instituting Proceedings.
Any respondent (or potential respondent in the case of a pending Prepenalty Notice) may request, in writing, that the Director withhold issuance of any such notice, or grant an extension of time to respond to any such Notice, for a period not to exceed 60 days for the exclusive purpose of effecting settlement. The Director may grant any such request, in writing, under terms and conditions within his or her discretion.
(ii)
After issuance of Order Instituting Proceedings.
Upon mutual agreement of the Director and a respondent, the Administrative Law Judge may grant an extension of time, for a period not to exceed 60 days, for the exclusive purpose of effecting settlement.
(4)
Views of Administrative Law Judge.
Where an Administrative Law Judge is assigned to a proceeding, the Director or the respondent may request that the Administrative Law Judge express his or her views regarding the appropriateness of the offer of settlement. A request for the Administrative Law Judge to express his or her views on an offer of settlement or otherwise to participate in a settlement conference constitutes a waiver by the party making the request of any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Administrative Law Judge based on the views expressed.
(5)
Waivers.
(i) By submitting an offer of settlement, a respondent making the offer waives, subject to acceptance of the offer:
(A) All hearings pursuant to section 16 of the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 16);
(B) The filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;
(C) Proceedings before, and a decision by, an Administrative Law Judge;
(D) All post-hearing procedures; and
(E) Judicial review by any court.
(ii) By submitting an offer of settlement the respondent further waives:
(A) Such provisions of this subpart or other requirements of law as may be construed to prevent any member of the Director's staff, or members of the Office of Chief Counsel or other counsel assigned by the General Counsel, from participating in or advising the Director as to any order, opinion, finding of fact, or conclusion of law to be entered pursuant to the offer; and
(B) Any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Director based on the consideration of or discussions concerning settlement of all or any part of the proceeding.
(6) If the Director rejects the offer of settlement, the respondent shall be so notified in writing and the offer of settlement shall be deemed withdrawn. The rejected offer shall not constitute a part of the record in any proceeding against the respondent making the offer, provided, however, that rejection of an offer of settlement does not affect the continued validity of waivers pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section with respect to any discussions concerning the rejected offer of settlement.
(7) No settlement offer or proposal, or any subsequent negotiation or resolution, is admissible as evidence in any administrative proceeding initiated by the Director.
§ 501.711

Unless otherwise directed by the Administrative Law Judge, an answer
shall specifically admit, deny, or state that the respondent does not have, and is unable to obtain, sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation in the Order Instituting Proceedings. When a respondent intends to deny only a part of an allegation, the respondent shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder. A statement of lack of information shall have the effect of a denial. A defense of res judicata, statute of limitations or any other matter constituting an affirmative defense shall be asserted in the answer. Any allegation not specifically addressed in the answer shall be deemed admitted.
(c)
Motion for more definite statement.
A respondent may file with an answer a motion for a more definite statement of specified matters of fact or law to be considered or determined. Such motion shall state the respects in which, and the reasons why, each such matter of fact or law should be required to be made more definite. If the motion is granted, the order granting such motion shall set the periods for filing such a statement and any answer thereto.

Without further proceedings or notice to the respondent, the Administrative Law Judge may enter a finding that the right to a hearing was waived, and the Penalty Notice shall constitute final agency action as provided in § 501.709(a)(2). A respondent may make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to § 501.726(e).
§ 501.716

§ 501.717
Consolidation of proceedings.
By order of the Administrative Law Judge, proceedings involving common questions of law and fact may be consolidated for hearing of any or all the matters at issue in such proceedings. The Administrative Law Judge may make such orders concerning the conduct of such proceedings as he or she deems appropriate to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.

Unless otherwise limited by order of the Administrative Law Judge in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the scope of discovery is as follows:
(1)
In general.
The availability of information and documents through discovery is subject to the assertion of privileges available to the parties and witnesses. Privileges available to the Director and the Department include exemptions afforded pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) through (9)) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the merits of the pending action, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of any persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the Administrative Law Judge may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the proceeding. Relevant information need not be admissible at the hearing if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(2)
Limitations.
The Administrative Law Judge may issue any order that justice requires to ensure that discovery requests are not unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly burdensome, including an order to show cause why a particular discovery request is justified upon motion of the objecting party. The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods otherwise permitted under this section may be limited by the Administrative
Law Judge if he or she determines that:
(i) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
(ii) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or
(iii) The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the hearing, the importance of the issues at stake, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.
(3)
Interrogatories.
Respondent's interrogatories shall be served upon the Office of the Chief Counsel not later than 30 days after issuance of the Order Instituting Proceedings. The Director's interrogatories shall be served by the later of 30 days after the receipt of service of respondent's interrogatories or 40 days after issuance of the Order Instituting Proceedings if no interrogatories are filed by respondent. Parties shall respond to interrogatories not later than 30 days after the date interrogatories are received. Interrogatories shall be limited to 20 questions only. Each subpart, section, or other designation of a part of a question shall be counted as one complete question in computing the permitted 20 question total. Where more than 20 questions are served upon a party, the receiving party may determine which of the 20 questions the receiving party shall answer. The limitation on the number of questions in an interrogatory may be waived by the Administrative Law Judge.
(4)
Privileged matter.
Privileged documents are not discoverable. Privileges include, but are not limited to, the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative-process or classified information privilege, including materials classified pursuant to Executive Order 12958 (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333) and any future Executive orders that may be issued relating to the treatment of national security information, and all materials and information exempted from release to the public pursuant to the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) through (9)).
(g)
Updating discovery.
A party who has made an initial disclosure under paragraph (a) of this section or responded to a request for discovery with a disclosure or response is under a duty to supplement or correct the disclosure or response to include information thereafter acquired whenever:
(1) The party learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect, if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other party during the discovery process or in writing; or
(2) Ordered by the Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge may impose sanctions for failure to supplement or correct discovery.
(h)
Time limits.
All discovery, including all responses to discovery requests, shall be completed not later than 20 days prior to the date scheduled for the commencement of the hearing, unless the Administrative Law Judge finds on the record that good cause exists to grant additional time to complete discovery.
(i)
Effect of failure to comply.
No witness may testify and no document or exhibit may be introduced at the hearing if such witness, document, or exhibit is not listed in the prehearing submissions pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, except for good cause shown.
§ 501.724
Documents that may be withheld.
(a) Notwithstanding § 501.723(f), the Director or respondent may withhold a document if:
(1) The document is privileged;
(2) The document would disclose the identity of a confidential source; or
(3) The Administrative Law Judge grants leave to withhold a document or category of documents as not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding or otherwise, for good cause shown.
(b) Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section authorizes the Director to withhold documents that contain material exculpatory evidence.
(c)
Withheld document list.
The Director and respondent shall provide the
Administrative Law Judge, for review, a list of documents withheld pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)-(3) of this section. The Administrative Law Judge shall determine whether any such document should be made available for inspection and copying.
§ 501.725
Confidential treatment of information in certain filings.
(a)
Filing document under seal.
(1) The Director may file any document or any part of a document under seal and/or seek a protective order concerning any document if disclosure of the document would be inconsistent with the protection of the public interest or if justice requires protection of any person, including a source or a party, from annoyance, threat, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or the disclosure of the information would be, or might reasonably lead to a disclosure, contrary to Executive Order 12958, as amended by Executive Order 13292, or other Executive orders concerning disclosure of information, Department regulations, or the Privacy Act, or information exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act. The Administrative Law Judge shall allow placement of any such document under seal and/or grant a protective order upon a showing that the disclosure would be inconsistent with any such statute or Executive order, or that the harm resulting from disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
(2) A respondent may file any document or any part of a document under seal and/or seek a protective order to limit such document from disclosure to other parties or to the public. The Administrative Law Judge shall allow placement of any document under seal and/or grant a protective order upon a showing that the harm resulting from disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
(3) The Administrative Law Judge shall safeguard the security and integrity of any documents under seal or protective order and shall take all appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality of such documents or any parts thereof, including closing a hearing or portions of a hearing to the public. Release of any information under seal or to the extent inconsistent with a protective order, in any form or manner, is subject to the sanctions and the exercise of the authorities as are provided with respect to ex parte communications under § 501.719.
(4) If the Administrative Law Judge denies placement of any document under seal or under protective order, any party, and any person whose document or material is at issue, may obtain interlocutory review by the Secretary's designee. In such cases the Administrative Law Judge shall not release or expose any of the records or documents in question to the public or to any person for a period of 20 days from the date of the Administrative Law Judge's ruling, in order to permit a party the opportunity either to withdraw the records and documents or obtain interlocutory review by the Secretary's designee and an order that the records be placed under seal or a protective order.
(5) Upon settlement, final decision, or motion to the Administrative Law Judge for good cause shown, all materials (including all copies) under seal or protective order shall be returned to the submitting parties, except when it may be necessary to retain a record until any judicial process is completed.
(6)(i) Written notice of each request for release of documents or materials under seal or subject to a protective order shall be given to the parties at least 20 days prior to any permitted release or prior to any access not specifically authorized under a protective order. A copy of each request for information, including the name, address, and telephone number of the requester, shall be provided to the parties.
(ii) Each request for access to protected material shall include the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all persons on whose behalf the requester seeks access to protected information. The Administrative Law Judge may impose sanctions as provided under § 501.729 for failure to provide this information.
(b)
Application.
An application for a protective order or to place under seal shall be filed with the Administrative Law Judge. The application shall be accompanied by a sealed copy of the materials as to which confidential treatment is sought.
(1)
Procedure for supplying additional information.
The person making the application may be required to furnish in writing additional information with respect to the grounds for objection to public disclosure. Failure to supply the information so requested within 14 days from the date of receipt of a notice of the information required shall be deemed a waiver of the objection to public disclosure of that portion of the information to which the additional information relates, unless the Administrative Law Judge shall otherwise order for good cause shown at or before the expiration of such 14-day period.
(2)
Confidentiality of materials pending final decision.
Pending the determination of the application for confidential treatment, transcripts, non-final orders including an initial decision, if any, and other materials in connection with the application shall be placed under seal; shall be for the confidential use only of the Administrative Law Judge, the Secretary's designee, the applicant, the Director, and any other respondent and representative; and shall be made available to the public only in accordance with orders of the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee.
(3)
Public availability of orders.
Any final order of the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee denying or sustaining an application for confidential treatment shall be made public. Any prior findings or opinions relating to an application for confidential treatment under this section shall be made public at such time as the material as to which confidentiality was requested is made public.
§ 501.726
Motions.
(a)
Generally.
Unless made during a hearing or conference, a motion shall be in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, shall set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be accompanied by a written brief of the points and authorities relied upon. Motions by a respondent must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge and served upon the Director through the Office of Chief Counsel and with any other party respondent or respondent's representative, unless otherwise directed by the Administrative Law Judge. Motions by the Director must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge and served upon each party respondent or respondent's representative. All written motions must be served in accordance with, and otherwise meet the requirements of, § 501.705. The Administrative Law Judge may order that an oral motion be submitted in writing. No oral argument shall be heard on any motion unless the Administrative Law Judge otherwise directs.
(b)
Opposing and reply briefs.
Except as provided in § 501.741(e), briefs in opposition to a motion shall be filed not later than 15 days after service of the motion. Reply briefs shall be filed not later than 3 days after service of the opposition. The failure of a party to oppose a written motion or an oral motion made on the record shall be deemed a waiver of objection by that party to the entry of an order substantially in the form of any proposed order accompanying the motion.
(c)
Dilatory motions.
Frivolous, dilatory, or repetitive motions are prohibited. The filing of such motions may form the basis for sanctions.
(d)
Length limitation.
Except as otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, a brief in support of, or in opposition to, a motion shall not exceed 15 pages, exclusive of pages containing any table of contents, table of authorities, or addendum.
(e) A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time as determined by the Administrative Law Judge, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and, if applicable, specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. In order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate, the Administrative Law Judge, at any time prior to the filing of his or her decision, or the Secretary's designee, at any time during the review process, may for good cause shown set aside a default.
§ 501.727
Motion for summary disposition.
(a) At any time after a respondent's answer has been filed, the respondent or the Director may make a motion for
summary disposition of any or all allegations contained in the Order Instituting Proceedings. If the Director has not completed presentation of his or her case-in-chief, a motion for summary disposition shall be made only with permission of the Administrative Law Judge. The facts of the pleadings of the party against whom the motion is made shall be taken as true, except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by that party, by uncontested affidavits, or by facts officially noticed pursuant to § 501.732(b).
(b)
Decision on motion.
The Administrative Law Judge may promptly decide the motion for summary disposition or may defer decision on the motion. The Administrative Law Judge shall issue an order granting a motion for summary disposition if the record shows there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law.
(c) A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings, stipulations, depositions, transcripts, affidavits, and any other evidentiary materials that the moving party contends support its position. The motion must also be accompanied by a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the moving party's arguments. Any party opposing a motion for summary disposition must file a statement setting forth those material facts as to which such party contends a genuine dispute exists. The opposition must be supported by evidence of the same type as that submitted with the motion for summary disposition and a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention that summary disposition would be inappropriate.
§ 501.728
Subpoenas.
(a)
Availability; procedure.
In connection with any hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, either the respondent or the Director may request the issuance of subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses at the designated time and place of hearing, and subpoenas requiring the production of documentary or other tangible evidence returnable at a designated time and place. Unless made on the record at a hearing, requests for issuance of a subpoena shall be made in writing and served on each party pursuant to § 501.705.
(b)
Standards for issuance.
If it appears to the Administrative Law Judge that a subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in his or her discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, require the person seeking the subpoena to show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances, the Administrative Law Judge determines that the subpoena or any of its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the subpoena, or issue a modified subpoena as fairness requires. In making the foregoing determination, the Administrative Law Judge may inquire of the other participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought to be proved.
(c)
Service.
Service of a subpoena shall be made pursuant to the provisions of § 501.705.
(d)
Application to quash or modify
—(1)
Procedure.
Any person to whom a subpoena is directed or who is an owner, creator or the subject of the documents or materials that are to be produced pursuant to a subpoena may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but not later than 15 days after the date of service of such subpoena, request that the subpoena be quashed or modified. Such request shall be made by application filed with the Administrative Law Judge and served on all parties pursuant to § 501.705. The party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued may, not later than 5 days after service of the application, file an opposition to the application.
(2)
Standards governing application to quash or modify.
If the Administrative Law Judge determines that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable, oppressive or unduly burdensome,
the Administrative Law Judge may quash or modify the subpoena, or may order return of the subpoena only upon specified conditions. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, a requirement that the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall make reasonable compensation to the person to whom the subpoena was addressed for the cost of copying or transporting evidence to the place for return of the subpoena.
(e)
Witness fees and mileage.
Witnesses summoned to appear at a proceeding shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States. Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witnesses appear.
§ 501.729
Sanctions.
(a)
Contemptuous conduct
—(1)
Subject to exclusion or suspension.
Contemptuous conduct by any person before an Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee during any proceeding, including any conference, shall be grounds for the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee to:
(i) Exclude that person from such hearing or conference, or any portion thereof; and/or
(ii) If a representative, summarily suspend that person from representing others in the proceeding in which such conduct occurred for the duration, or any portion, of the proceeding.
(2)
Adjournment.
Upon motion by a party represented by a representative subject to an order of exclusion or suspension, an adjournment shall be granted to allow the retention of a new representative. In determining the length of an adjournment, the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee shall consider, in addition to the factors set forth in § 501.737, the availability of another representative for the party or, if the representative was a counsel, of other members of a suspended counsel's firm.
(b)
Deficient filings; leave to cure deficiencies.
The Administrative Law Judge, or the Secretary's designee in the case of a request for review, may in his or her discretion, reject, in whole or in part, any filing that fails to comply with any requirements of this subpart or of any order issued in the proceeding in which the filing was made. Any such filings shall not be part of the record. The Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee may direct a party to cure any deficiencies and to resubmit the filing within a fixed time period.
(c)
Failure to make required filing or to cure deficient filing.
The Administrative Law Judge (or the Secretary's designee during review proceedings) may enter a default pursuant to § 501.716, dismiss the case, decide the particular matter at issue against that person, or prohibit the introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning that matter if a person fails:
(1) To make a filing required under this subpart; or
(2) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Failure to make required filing or to cure deficient filing in the case of a request for review.

(1) To make a filing required under this subpart; or
(2) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the Secretary's designee pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 501.730
Depositions upon oral examination.
(a)
Procedure.
Any party desiring to take the testimony of a witness by deposition shall make a written motion setting forth the reasons why such deposition should be taken including the specific reasons why the party believes the witness may be unable to attend or testify at the hearing; the name and address of the prospective witness; the
matters concerning which the prospective witness is expected to be questioned; and the proposed time and place for the taking of the deposition.
(b)
Required finding when ordering a deposition.
In the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, an order for deposition may be issued upon a finding that the prospective witness will likely give testimony material to the proceeding, that it is likely the prospective witness will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability, and that the taking of a deposition will serve the interests of justice.
(c)
Contents of order.
An order for deposition shall designate by name a deposition officer. The designated officer may be the Administrative Law Judge or any other person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the deposition is to be held. An order for deposition also shall state:
(1) The name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken;
(2) The scope of the testimony to be taken;
(3) The time and place of the deposition;
(4) The manner of recording, preserving and filing the deposition; and
(5) The number of copies, if any, of the deposition and exhibits to be filed upon completion of the deposition.
(d)

A witness whose testimony is taken by deposition shall swear or affirm before any questions are put to him or her. Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed as permitted at a hearing. A witness being deposed may have counsel or a representative present during the deposition.
(e)
Objections to questions or evidence.
Objections to questions or evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied upon. Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the deposition officer upon the deposition, but a deposition officer (other than an Administrative Law Judge) shall not have the power to decide on the competency, materiality or relevance of evidence. Failure to object to questions or evidence before the deposition officer shall not be deemed a waiver unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.
(f)
Filing of depositions.
The questions asked and all answers or objections shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim, and a transcript shall be prepared by the deposition officer, or under his or her direction. The transcript shall be subscribed by the witness and certified by the deposition officer. The original deposition transcript and exhibits shall be filed with the Administrative Law Judge. A copy of the deposition transcript and exhibits shall be served on the opposing party or parties. The cost of the transcript (including copies) shall be paid by the party requesting the deposition.

Procedure.
Written questions shall be filed with the motion. Not later than 10 days after service of the motion and written questions, any party may file objections to such written questions and any party may file cross-questions. When a deposition is taken pursuant to this section no persons other than the witness, representative or counsel to the witness, the deposition officer, and, if the deposition officer does not act as reporter, a reporter, shall be present at the examination of the witness. No party shall be present or represented unless otherwise permitted by order. The deposition officer shall propound the questions and cross-questions to the witness in the order submitted.
(c)
Additional requirements.
The order for deposition, filing of the deposition, form of the deposition and use of the deposition in the record shall be governed by paragraphs (b) through (g) of § 501.730, except that no cross-examination shall be made.
§ 501.732
Evidence.
The applicable evidentiary standard for proceedings under this subpart is proof by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The Administrative Law Judge shall admit any relevant and material oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence. The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply, by their own force, to proceedings under this subpart, but shall be employed as general guidelines. The fact that evidence submitted by a party is hearsay goes only to the weight of the evidence and does not affect its admissibility.
(a)
Objections and offers of proof
—(1)
Objections.
Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence must be made on the record and shall be in short form, stating the grounds relied upon. Exceptions to any ruling thereon by the Administrative Law Judge need not be noted at the time of the ruling. Such exceptions will be deemed waived on review by the Secretary's designee, however, unless raised:
(i) Pursuant to interlocutory review in accordance with § 501.741;
(ii) In a proposed finding or conclusion filed pursuant to § 501.738; or
(iii) In a petition for the Secretary's designee's review of an Administrative Law Judge's decision filed in accordance with § 501.741.
(2)
Offers of proof.
Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the record. Excluded material shall be retained pursuant to § 501.739(b).
(b)
Official notice.
An Administrative Law Judge or Secretary's designee may take official notice of any material fact that might be judicially noticed by a district court of the United States, any matter in the public official records of the Secretary, or any matter that is particularly within the knowledge of the Department as an expert body. If official notice is requested or taken of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, a party, upon timely request to the Administrative Law Judge, shall be afforded an opportunity to establish the contrary.
(c)
Stipulations.
The parties may, by stipulation, at any stage of the proceeding agree upon any pertinent fact in the proceeding. A stipulation may be received in evidence and, when accepted by the Administrative Law Judge, shall be binding on the parties to the stipulation.
(d)
Presentation under oath or affirmation.
A witness at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall testify under oath or affirmation.
(e)
Presentation, rebuttal and cross-examination.
A party is entitled to present its case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as, in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
§ 501.733
Evidence: confidential information, protective orders.
(a)
Procedure.
In any proceeding as defined in § 501.702, a respondent; the Director; any person who is the owner, subject or creator of a document subject to subpoena or which may be introduced as evidence; or any witness who testifies at a hearing may file a motion requesting a protective order to limit from disclosure to other parties or to the public documents or testimony containing confidential information. The motion should include a general summary or extract of the documents without revealing confidential details. If a person seeks a protective order against disclosure to other parties as well as the public, copies of the documents shall not be served on other parties. Unless the documents are unavailable, the person shall file for inspection by the Administrative Law Judge a sealed copy of the documents as to which the order is sought.
(b)
Basis for issuance.
Documents and testimony introduced in a public hearing are presumed to be public. A motion for a protective order shall be granted only upon a finding that the harm resulting from disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
(c)
Requests for additional information supporting confidentiality.
A person seeking a protective order under paragraph (a) of this section may be required to furnish in writing additional information with respect to the grounds for confidentiality. Failure to supply the information so requested
not later than 5 days from the date of receipt by the person of a notice of the information required shall be deemed a waiver of the objection to public disclosure of that portion of the documents to which the additional information relates, unless the Administrative Law Judge shall otherwise order for good cause shown at or before the expiration of such 5-day period.
(d)
Confidentiality of documents pending decision.
Pending a determination of a motion under this section, the documents as to which confidential treatment is sought and any other documents that would reveal the confidential information in those documents shall be maintained under seal and shall be disclosed only in accordance with orders of the Administrative Law Judge. Any order issued in connection with a motion under this section shall be made public unless the order would disclose information as to which a protective order has been granted, in which case that portion of the order that would reveal the protected information shall not be made public.
§ 501.734
Introducing prior sworn statements of witnesses into the record.
(a) At a hearing, any person wishing to introduce a prior, sworn statement of a witness who is not a party to the proceeding, that is otherwise admissible in the proceeding, may make a motion setting forth the reasons therefor. If only part of a statement is offered in evidence, the Administrative Law Judge may require that all relevant portions of the statement be introduced. If all of a statement is offered in evidence, the Administrative Law Judge may require that portions not relevant to the proceeding be excluded. A motion to introduce a prior sworn statement may be granted if:
(1) The witness is dead;
(2) The witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the prior sworn statement;
(3) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability;
(4) The party offering the prior sworn statement has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or,
(5) In the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, it would be desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the prior sworn statement to be used. In making this determination, due regard shall be given to the presumption that witnesses will testify orally in an open hearing. If the parties have stipulated to accept a prior sworn statement in lieu of live testimony, consideration shall also be given to the convenience of the parties in avoiding unnecessary expense.
§ 501.735
Proposed findings, conclusions and supporting briefs.
(a)
Opportunity to file.
Before a decision is issued by the Administrative Law Judge, each party shall have an opportunity, reasonable in light of all the circumstances, to file in writing proposed findings and conclusions.
(b)
Procedure.
Proposed findings of fact must be supported by citations to specific portions of the record. If successive filings are directed, the proposed findings and conclusions of the party assigned to file first shall be set forth in serially numbered paragraphs, and any counter statement of proposed findings and conclusions shall, in addition to any other matter presented, indicate those paragraphs of the proposals already filed as to which there is no dispute. A reply brief may be filed by the party assigned to file first, or, where simultaneous filings are directed, reply briefs may be filed by each party, within the period prescribed therefor by the Administrative Law Judge. No further briefs may be filed except with permission of the Administrative Law Judge.
(c)
Time for filing.
In any proceeding in which a decision is to be issued:
(1) At the close of each hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall, by order, after consultation with the parties, prescribe the period within which proposed findings and conclusions and supporting briefs are to be filed. The party directed to file first shall make its initial filing not later than 30 days after the end of the hearing unless the Administrative Law Judge, for good
cause shown, permits a different period and sets forth in the order the reasons why the different period is necessary.
(2) The total period within which all such proposed findings and conclusions and supporting briefs and any counter statements of proposed findings and conclusions and reply briefs are to be filed shall be no longer than 90 days after the close of the hearing unless the Administrative Law Judge, for good cause shown, permits a different period and sets forth in an order the reasons why the different period is necessary.
§ 501.736
Authority of Administrative Law Judge.
The Administrative Law Judge shall have authority to do all things necessary and appropriate to discharge his or her duties. No provision of these rules shall be construed to limit the powers of the Administrative Law Judge provided by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 556, 557. The powers of the Administrative Law Judge include, but are not limited to:
(a) Administering oaths and affirmations;
(b) Issuing subpoenas authorized by law and revoking, quashing, or modifying any such subpoena;
(c) Receiving relevant evidence and ruling upon the admission of evidence and offers of proof;
(d) Regulating the course of a proceeding and the conduct of the parties and their representatives;
(e) Holding prehearing and other conferences as set forth in § 501.726 and requiring the attendance at any such conference of at least one representative of each party who has authority to negotiate concerning the resolution of issues in controversy;
(f) Subject to any limitations set forth elsewhere in this subpart, considering and ruling on all procedural and other motions;
(g) Upon notice to all parties, reopening any hearing prior to the issuance of a decision;
(h) Requiring production of records or any information relevant to any act or transaction subject to a hearing under this subpart, and imposing sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2), 28 U.S.C.) for a party's failure to comply with discovery requests;
(i) Establishing time, place, and manner limitations on the attendance of the public and the media for any hearing; and
(j) Setting fees and expenses for witnesses, including expert witnesses.
§ 501.737
Adjustments of time, postponements and adjournments.
(a)
Availability.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary's designee, as appropriate, at any time prior to the filing of his or her decision, may, for good cause and in the interest of justice, modify any time limit prescribed by this subpart and may, consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, postpone or adjourn any hearing.

§ 501.801
Licensing.
(a)
General licenses.
General licenses may be issued authorizing, under appropriate terms and conditions, certain types of transactions that are subject to the prohibitions contained in this chapter. General licenses also may be issued authorizing, under appropriate terms and conditions, certain types of transactions that are subject to prohibitions contained in economic sanctions programs the implementation and administration of which have been delegated to the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) but which are not yet codified in this chapter. General licenses are set forth in subpart E of each part contained in this chapter, made available on OFAC's website (
https://ofac.treasury.gov
), or published in the
Federal Register
. It is the policy of OFAC not to grant applications for specific licenses authorizing transactions to which the provisions of a general license are applicable. Persons availing themselves of certain general licenses may be required to file reports and statements in accordance with the instructions specified in those licenses. Failure to file timely all required information in such reports or statements may nullify the authorization otherwise provided by the general license and result in apparent violations of the applicable prohibitions that may be subject to OFAC enforcement action.
(b)
Specific licenses

General course of procedure.
Transactions subject to the prohibitions contained in this chapter, or to prohibitions the implementation and administration of which have been otherwise delegated to the OFAC Director, that are not authorized by general license may be effected only under specific license.

The applicant must supply all information specified by relevant instructions (available on OFAC's Reporting and License Application Forms page at

) or forms, and must fully disclose the names of all parties who are concerned with or interested in the proposed transaction. If the application is filed by an agent, the agent must disclose the name of his or her principal(s). Such documents as may be relevant shall be attached to each application as a part of such application, whether filed electronically or by mail, except that documents previously filed with OFAC may, where appropriate, be incorporated by reference in such application. For applications for the release of blocked funds, applicants are encouraged to include, when available, the OFAC Reporting System (ORS) transaction and submission identification numbers. Applicants may be required to furnish such further information as is deemed necessary to assist OFAC in making a determination. Any applicant or other party in interest desiring to present additional information may do so at any time before or after OFAC makes its decision with respect to the application. Any requests to make such an oral presentation must be submitted via the OFAC License Application Page at
https://ofac.treasury.gov/ofac-license-application-page
to the attention of the Licensing Division, referencing the relevant Case ID number and a “Request for Oral Presentation.” Such requests are rarely granted.
(3)
Issuance of specific license.
Specific licenses normally will be issued by OFAC. Specific licenses also may be issued by the Secretary of the Treasury acting directly or through any specifically designated person, agency, or instrumentality.
(4)
Reports under specific licenses.
As a condition for the issuance of any specific license, the licensee may be required to file reports with respect to the transactions authorized by the specific license in such form and at such times and places as may be prescribed in the license or otherwise. Reports should be sent in accordance with the instructions provided in the applicable specific license.
(5)
Effect of denial.
The denial of a specific license does not preclude the reconsideration of an application or the filing of a further application. The applicant or any other party in interest may at any time request, via the OFAC License Application Page at
https://ofac.treasury.gov/ofac-license-application-page
, reconsideration of the denial of an application on the basis of new facts or changed circumstances.

§ 501.807
Procedures governing delisting from the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or any other list of sanctioned persons or property maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
A person may submit a petition for administrative reconsideration pursuant to the procedures outlined below in order to seek removal of a person or property (e.g., a vessel) from the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) or any other list or identification of sanctioned persons or property maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC):
(a) A person blocked under the provisions of any part of this chapter, including a specially designated national, specially designated terrorist, specially designated narcotics trafficker, or a person otherwise subject to sanctions pursuant to the provisions of any part of this chapter (each, a “sanctioned person”), or a person owning a majority interest in property (e.g., a vessel) that is blocked or otherwise subject to sanctions may submit arguments or evidence that the person believes establishes that insufficient basis exists for the sanction or that the circumstances resulting in the sanction no longer apply. The sanctioned person also may propose remedial steps on the person's part, such as corporate reorganization, resignation of persons from positions in a blocked entity, or similar steps, which the person believes
would negate the basis for the sanction. A person owning a majority interest in property (e.g., a vessel) that is blocked or otherwise subject to sanctions may propose the sale of the vessel, with the proceeds to be placed into a blocked interest-bearing account after deducting the costs incurred while the vessel was blocked and the costs of the sale. This submission must be made via email to

(b) For purposes of reconsideration petitions relating to persons or property sanctioned by OFAC:
(1) The information submitted by the person seeking removal of a person or property from the SDN List or any other list or identification of sanctioned persons or property maintained by OFAC will be reviewed by OFAC, which may request clarifying, corroborating, or other additional information.
(2) A person seeking removal of a person or property from the SDN List or any other list or identification of sanctioned persons or property maintained by OFAC may request a meeting with OFAC; however, such meetings are not required, and the office may, at its discretion, decline to conduct such meetings prior to completing a review pursuant to this section.
(3) After OFAC has conducted a review of the request for reconsideration, it will provide a written decision to the person seeking the removal of a person or property from the SDN List or any other list or identification of sanctioned persons or property maintained by OFAC.

Pt. 501, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 501—Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines.

# Note:
This appendix provides a general framework for the enforcement of all economic sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

# I. Definitions
A.
Apparent violation
means conduct that constitutes an actual or possible violation of U.S. economic sanctions laws, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA), the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, and other statutes administered or enforced by OFAC, as well as Executive orders, regulations, orders, directives, or licenses issued pursuant thereto.
B.
Applicable schedule amount
means:
1. $1,000 with respect to a transaction valued at less than $1,000;
2. $10,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $1,000 or more but less than $10,000;
3. $25,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $10,000 or more but less than $25,000;
4. $50,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $25,000 or more but less than $50,000;
5. $100,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $50,000 or more but less than $100,000;
6. $200,000 with respect to a transaction valued at $100,000 or more but less than $200,000;
7. The statutory maximum civil penalty per violation of IEEPA listed in section V.B.2.a.v. of this appendix with respect to a transaction valued at $200,000 or more.
C.
OFAC
means the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
D.
Penalty
is the final civil penalty amount imposed in a Penalty Notice.
E.
Proposed penalty
is the civil penalty amount set forth in a Pre-Penalty Notice.
F.
Regulator
means any Federal, State, local or foreign official or agency that has authority to license or examine an entity for compliance with federal, state, or foreign law.
G.
Subject Person
means an individual or entity subject to any of the sanctions programs administered or enforced by OFAC.
H.
Transaction value
means the dollar value of a subject transaction. In export and import cases, the transaction value generally will be the domestic value in the United States of the goods, technology, or services sought to be exported from or imported into the United States, as demonstrated by commercial invoices, bills of lading, signed Customs declarations, or similar documents. In cases involving seizures by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the transaction value generally will be the domestic value as determined by CBP. If the apparent violation at issue is a prohibited dealing in blocked property by a Subject Person, the transaction value generally will be the dollar value of the underlying transaction involved, such as the value of the property dealt in or the amount of the funds transfer that a financial institution failed to block or reject. Where the transaction value is not otherwise ascertainable, OFAC may consider the market value of the goods or services that were the subject of the transaction, the economic benefit conferred on the sanctioned party, and/or the economic benefit derived by the Subject Person from the transaction, in determining transaction value. For purposes of these Guidelines, “transaction value” will not necessarily have the same meaning, nor be applied in the same manner, as that term is used for import valuation purposes at 19 CFR 152.103.
I.
Voluntary self-disclosure
means self-initiated notification to OFAC of an apparent violation by a Subject Person that has committed, or otherwise participated in, an apparent violation of a statute, Executive order, or regulation administered or enforced by OFAC, prior to or at the same time that OFAC, or any other federal, state, or local government agency or official, discovers the apparent violation or another substantially similar apparent violation. For these purposes, “substantially similar apparent violation” means an apparent violation that is part of a series of similar apparent violations or is related to the same pattern or practice of conduct. Notification of an apparent violation to another government agency (but not to OFAC) by a Subject Person, which is considered a voluntary self-disclosure by that agency, may be considered a voluntary self-disclosure by OFAC, based on a case-by-case assessment. Notification to OFAC of an apparent violation is not a voluntary self-disclosure if: a third party is required to and does notify OFAC of the apparent violation or a substantially similar apparent violation because a transaction was blocked or rejected by that third party (regardless of when OFAC receives such notice from the third party and regardless of whether the Subject Person was aware of the third party's disclosure); the disclosure includes false or misleading information; the disclosure (when considered along with supplemental information provided by the Subject Person) is materially incomplete; the disclosure is not self-initiated (including when the disclosure results from a suggestion or order of a federal or state agency or official); or, when the Subject Person is an entity, the disclosure is made by an individual in a Subject Person entity without the authorization of the entity's senior management. Responding to an administrative subpoena or other inquiry from, or filing a license application with, OFAC is not a voluntary self-disclosure. In addition to notification, a voluntary self-disclosure must include, or be followed within a reasonable period of time by, a report of sufficient detail to afford a complete understanding of an apparent violation's circumstances, and should also be followed by responsiveness to any follow-up inquiries by OFAC. (As discussed further below, a Subject Person's level of cooperation with OFAC is an important factor in determining the appropriate enforcement response to an apparent violation even in the absence of a voluntary self-disclosure as defined herein; disclosure by a Subject Person generally will result in mitigation insofar as it represents cooperation with OFAC's investigation.)

# II. Types of Responses to Apparent Violations
Depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, an OFAC investigation may lead to one or more of the following actions:
A.
No Action.
If OFAC determines that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that a violation has occurred and/or, based on an analysis of the General Factors outlined in Section III of these Guidelines, concludes that the conduct does not rise to a level warranting an administrative response, then no action will be taken. In those cases in which OFAC is aware that the Subject Person has knowledge of OFAC's investigation, OFAC generally will issue a letter to the Subject Person indicating that the investigation is being closed with no administrative action being taken. A no-action determination represents a final determination as to the apparent violation, unless OFAC later learns of additional related violations or other relevant facts.
B.
Request Additional Information.
If OFAC determines that additional information regarding the apparent violation is needed, it
may request further information from the Subject Person or third parties, including through an administrative subpoena issued pursuant to 31 CFR 501.602. In the case of an institution subject to regulation where OFAC has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Subject Person's regulator, OFAC will follow the procedures set forth in such MOU regarding consultation with the regulator. Even in the absence of an MOU, OFAC may seek relevant information about a regulated institution and/or the conduct constituting the apparent violation from the institution's federal, state, or foreign regulator. Upon receipt of information determined to be sufficient to assess the apparent violation, OFAC will decide, based on an analysis of the General Factors outlined in Section III of these Guidelines, whether to pursue further enforcement action or whether some other response to the apparent violation is appropriate.
C.
Cautionary Letter:
If OFAC determines that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that a violation has occurred or that a Finding of Violation or a civil monetary penalty is not warranted under the circumstances, but believes that the underlying conduct could lead to a violation in other circumstances and/or that a Subject Person does not appear to be exercising due diligence in assuring compliance with the statutes, Executive orders, and regulations that OFAC enforces, OFAC may issue a cautionary letter, which may convey OFAC's concerns about the underlying conduct and/or the Subject Person's OFAC compliance policies, practices and/or procedures. A cautionary letter represents a final enforcement response to the apparent violation, unless OFAC later learns of additional related violations or other relevant facts, but does not constitute a final agency determination as to whether a violation has occurred.
D.
Finding of Violation:
If OFAC determines that a violation has occurred and considers it important to document the occurrence of a violation and, based on an analysis of the General Factors outlined in Section III of these Guidelines, concludes that the Subject Person's conduct warrants an administrative response but that a civil monetary penalty is not the most appropriate response, OFAC may issue a Finding of Violation that identifies the violation. A Finding of Violation may also convey OFAC's concerns about the violation and/or the Subject Person's OFAC compliance policies, practices and/or procedures, and/or identify the need for further compliance steps to be taken. A Finding of Violation represents a final enforcement response to the violation, unless OFAC later learns of additional related violations or other relevant facts, and constitutes a final agency determination that a violation has occurred. A Finding of Violation will afford the Subject Person an opportunity to respond to OFAC's determination that a violation has occurred before that determination becomes final. In the event a Subject Person so responds, the initial Finding of Violation will not constitute a final agency determination that a violation has occurred. In such cases, after considering the response received, OFAC will inform the Subject Person of its final enforcement response to the apparent violation.
E.
Civil Monetary Penalty.
If OFAC determines that a violation has occurred and, based on an analysis of the General Factors outlined in Section III of these Guidelines, concludes that the Subject Person's conduct warrants the imposition of a monetary penalty, OFAC may impose a civil monetary penalty. Civil monetary penalty amounts will be determined as discussed in Section V of these Guidelines. The imposition of a civil monetary penalty constitutes a final agency determination that a violation has occurred and represents a final civil enforcement response to the violation. OFAC will afford the Subject Person an opportunity to respond to OFAC's determination that a violation has occurred before a final penalty is imposed.
F.
Criminal Referral.
In appropriate circumstances, OFAC may refer the matter to appropriate law enforcement agencies for criminal investigation and/or prosecution. Apparent sanctions violations that OFAC has referred for criminal investigation and/or prosecution also may be subject to OFAC civil penalty or other administrative action.
G.
Other Administrative Actions.
In addition to or in lieu of other administrative actions, OFAC may also take the following administrative actions in response to an apparent violation:
1.
License Denial, Suspension, Modification, or Revocation.
OFAC authorizations to engage in a transaction (including the release of blocked funds) pursuant to a general or specific license may be withheld, denied, suspended, modified, or revoked in response to an apparent violation.
2.
Cease and Desist Order.
OFAC may order the Subject Person to cease and desist from conduct that is prohibited by any of the sanctions programs enforced by OFAC when OFAC has reason to believe that a Subject Person has engaged in such conduct and/or that such conduct is ongoing or may recur.

# III. General Factors Affecting Administrative Action
As a general matter, OFAC will consider some or all of the following General Factors in determining the appropriate administrative action in response to an apparent violation of U.S. sanctions by a Subject Person, and, where a civil monetary penalty is imposed, in determining the appropriate amount of any such penalty:
A.
Willful or Reckless Violation of Law:
a Subject Person's willfulness or recklessness in violating, attempting to violate, conspiring to violate, or causing a violation of the law. Generally, to the extent the conduct at issue is the result of willful conduct or a deliberate intent to violate, attempt to violate, conspire to violate, or cause a violation of the law, the OFAC enforcement response will be stronger. Among the factors OFAC may consider in evaluating willfulness or recklessness are:
1.
Willfulness.
Was the conduct at issue the result of a decision to take action with the knowledge that such action would constitute a violation of U.S. law? Did the Subject Person know that the underlying conduct constituted, or likely constituted, a violation of U.S. law at the time of the conduct?
2.
Recklessness.
Did the Subject Person demonstrate reckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements or otherwise fail to exercise a minimal degree of caution or care in avoiding conduct that led to the apparent violation? Were there warning signs that should have alerted the Subject Person that an action or failure to act would lead to an apparent violation?
3.
Concealment.
Was there an effort by the Subject Person to hide or purposely obfuscate its conduct in order to mislead OFAC, Federal, State, or foreign regulators, or other parties involved in the conduct about an apparent violation?
4.
Pattern of Conduct.
Did the apparent violation constitute or result from a pattern or practice of conduct or was it relatively isolated and atypical in nature?
5.
Prior Notice.
Was the Subject Person on notice, or should it reasonably have been on notice, that the conduct at issue, or similar conduct, constituted a violation of U.S. law?
6.
Management Involvement.
In cases of entities, at what level within the organization did the willful or reckless conduct occur? Were supervisory or managerial level staff aware, or should they reasonably have been aware, of the willful or reckless conduct?
B.
Awareness of Conduct at Issue:
the Subject Person's awareness of the conduct giving rise to the apparent violation. Generally, the greater a Subject Person's actual knowledge of, or reason to know about, the conduct constituting an apparent violation, the stronger the OFAC enforcement response will be. In the case of a corporation, awareness will focus on supervisory or managerial level staff in the business unit at issue, as well as other senior officers and managers. Among the factors OFAC may consider in evaluating the Subject Person's awareness of the conduct at issue are:
1.
Actual Knowledge.
Did the Subject Person have actual knowledge that the conduct giving rise to an apparent violation took place? Was the conduct part of a business process, structure or arrangement that was designed or implemented with the intent to prevent or shield the Subject Person from having such actual knowledge, or was the conduct part of a business process, structure or arrangement implemented for other legitimate reasons that made it difficult or impossible for the Subject Person to have actual knowledge?
2.
Reason to Know.
If the Subject Person did not have actual knowledge that the conduct took place, did the Subject Person have reason to know, or should the Subject Person reasonably have known, based on all readily available information and with the exercise of reasonable due diligence, that the conduct would or might take place?
3.
Management Involvement.
In the case of an entity, was the conduct undertaken with the explicit or implicit knowledge of senior management, or was the conduct undertaken by personnel outside the knowledge of senior management? If the apparent violation was undertaken without the knowledge of senior management, was there oversight intended to detect and prevent violations, or did the lack of knowledge by senior management result from disregard for its responsibility to comply with applicable sanctions laws?
C.
Harm to Sanctions Program Objectives:
the actual or potential harm to sanctions program objectives caused by the conduct giving rise to the apparent violation. Among the factors OFAC may consider in evaluating the harm to sanctions program objectives are:
1.
Economic or Other Benefit to the Sanctioned Individual, Entity, or Country:
the economic or other benefit conferred or attempted to be conferred to sanctioned individuals, entities, or countries as a result of an apparent violation, including the number, size, and impact of the transactions constituting an apparent violation(s), the length of time over which they occurred, and the nature of the economic or other benefit conferred. OFAC may also consider the causal link between the Subject Person's conduct and the economic benefit conferred or attempted to be conferred.
2.
Implications for U.S. Policy:
the effect that the circumstances of the apparent violation had on the integrity of the U.S. sanctions program and the related policy objectives involved.
3.
License Eligibility:
whether the conduct constituting the apparent violation likely would have been licensed by OFAC under existing licensing policy.
4.
Humanitarian activity:
whether the conduct at issue was in support of a humanitarian activity.
D.
Individual Characteristics:
the particular circumstances and characteristics of a Subject Person. Among the factors OFAC may consider in evaluating individual characteristics are:
1.
Commercial Sophistication:
the commercial sophistication and experience of the Subject Person. Is the Subject Person an individual or an entity? If an individual, was the conduct constituting the apparent violation for personal or business reasons?
2.
Size of Operations and Financial Condition:
the size of a Subject Person's business operations and overall financial condition, where such information is available and relevant. Qualification of the Subject Person as a small business or organization for the purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, as determined by reference to the applicable regulations of the Small Business Administration, may also be considered.
3.
Volume of Transactions:
the total volume of transactions undertaken by the Subject Person on an annual basis, with attention given to the apparent violations as compared with the total volume.
4.
Sanctions History:
the Subject Person's sanctions history, including OFAC's issuance of prior penalties, findings of violations or cautionary, warning or evaluative letters, or other administrative actions (including settlements). As a general matter, OFAC will only consider a Subject Person's sanctions history for the five years preceding the date of the transaction giving rise to the apparent violation.
E.
Compliance Program:
the existence, nature and adequacy of a Subject Person's risk-based OFAC compliance program at the time of the apparent violation, where relevant. In the case of an institution subject to regulation where OFAC has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Subject Person's regulator, OFAC will follow the procedures set forth in such MOU regarding consultation with the regulator with regard to the quality and effectiveness of the Subject Person's compliance program. Even in the absence of an MOU, OFAC may take into consideration the views of federal, state, or foreign regulators, where relevant. Further information about risk-based compliance programs for financial institutions is set forth in the annex hereto.
F.
Remedial Response:
the Subject Person's corrective action taken in response to the apparent violation. Among the factors OFAC may consider in evaluating the remedial response are:
1. The steps taken by the Subject Person upon learning of the apparent violation. Did the Subject Person immediately stop the conduct at issue?
2. In the case of an entity, the processes followed to resolve issues related to the apparent violation. Did the Subject Person discover necessary information to ascertain the causes and extent of the apparent violation, fully and expeditiously? Was senior management fully informed? If so, when?
3. In the case of an entity, whether the Subject Person adopted new and more effective internal controls and procedures to prevent a recurrence of the apparent violation. If the Subject Person did not have an OFAC compliance program in place at the time of the apparent violation, did it implement one upon discovery of the apparent violations? If it did have an OFAC compliance program, did it take appropriate steps to enhance the program to prevent the recurrence of similar violations? Did the entity provide the individual(s) responsible for the apparent violation with additional training, and/or take other appropriate action, to ensure that similar violations do not occur in the future?
4. Where applicable, whether the Subject Person undertook a thorough review to identify other possible violations.
G.
Cooperation with OFAC:
the nature and extent of the Subject Person's cooperation with OFAC. Among the factors OFAC may consider in evaluating cooperation with OFAC are:
1. Did the Subject Person voluntarily self-disclose the apparent violation to OFAC?
2. Did the Subject Person provide OFAC with all relevant information regarding an apparent violation (whether or not voluntarily self-disclosed)?
3. Did the Subject Person research and disclose to OFAC relevant information regarding any other apparent violations caused by the same course of conduct?
4. Was information provided voluntarily or in response to an administrative subpoena?
5. Did the Subject Person cooperate with, and promptly respond to, all requests for information?
6. Did the Subject Person enter into a statute of limitations tolling agreement, if requested by OFAC (particularly in situations where the apparent violations were not immediately notified to or discovered by OFAC, in particularly complex cases, and in cases in which the Subject Person has requested and received additional time to respond to a request for information from OFAC)? If so, the Subject Person's entering into a tolling agreement will be deemed a mitigating factor.

# Note:
A Subject Person's refusal to enter into a tolling agreement will not be considered by OFAC as an aggravating factor in assessing a Subject Person's cooperation or otherwise under the Guidelines.
Where appropriate, OFAC will publicly note substantial cooperation provided by a Subject Person.
H.
Timing of apparent violation in relation to imposition of sanctions:
the timing of the apparent violation in relation to the adoption of the applicable prohibitions, particularly if the apparent violation took place immediately after relevant changes in the sanctions program regulations or the addition of
a new name to OFAC's List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List).
I.
Other enforcement action:
other enforcement actions taken by federal, state, or local agencies against the Subject Person for the apparent violation or similar apparent violations, including whether the settlement of alleged violations of OFAC regulations is part of a comprehensive settlement with other federal, state, or local agencies.
J.
Future Compliance/Deterrence Effect:
the impact administrative action may have on promoting future compliance with U.S. economic sanctions by the Subject Person and similar Subject Persons, particularly those in the same industry sector.
K.
Other relevant factors on a case-by-case basis:
such other factors that OFAC deems relevant on a case-by-case basis in determining the appropriate enforcement response and/or the amount of any civil monetary penalty. OFAC will consider the totality of the circumstances to ensure that its enforcement response is proportionate to the nature of the violation.

# IV. Civil Penalties for Failure To Comply With a Requirement To Furnish Information or Keep Records
As a general matter, the following civil penalty amounts shall apply to a Subject Person's failure to comply with a requirement to furnish information or maintain records:
A. The failure to comply with a requirement to furnish information pursuant to 31 CFR 501.602 may result in a penalty in an amount up to $29,150, irrespective of whether any other violation is alleged. Where OFAC has reason to believe that the apparent violation(s) that is the subject of the requirement to furnish information involves a transaction(s) valued at greater than $500,000, a failure to comply with a requirement to furnish information may result in a penalty in an amount up to $72,876, irrespective of whether any other violation is alleged. A failure to comply with a requirement to furnish information may be considered a continuing violation, and the penalties described above may be imposed each month that a party has continued to fail to comply with the requirement to furnish information. OFAC may also seek to have a requirement to furnish information judicially enforced. Imposition of a civil monetary penalty for failure to comply with a requirement to furnish information does not preclude OFAC from seeking such judicial enforcement of the requirement to furnish information.
B. The late filing of a required report, whether set forth in regulations or in a specific license, may result in a civil monetary penalty in an amount up to $3,550, if filed within the first 30 days after the report is due, and a penalty in an amount up to $7,104 if filed more than 30 days after the report is due. If the report relates to blocked assets, the penalty may include an additional $1,422 for every 30 days that the report is overdue, up to 10 years.

# V. Civil Penalties
OFAC will review the facts and circumstances surrounding an apparent violation and apply the General Factors for Taking Administrative Action in Section III above in determining whether to initiate a civil penalty proceeding and in determining the amount of any civil monetary penalty. OFAC will give careful consideration to the appropriateness of issuing a cautionary letter or Finding of Violation in lieu of the imposition of a civil monetary penalty.

# A. Civil Penalty Process
1.
Pre-Penalty Notice.
If OFAC has reason to believe that a sanctions violation has occurred and believes that a civil monetary penalty is appropriate, it will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice in accordance with the procedures set forth in the particular regulations governing the conduct giving rise to the apparent violation. The amount of the proposed penalty set forth in the Pre-Penalty Notice will reflect OFAC's preliminary assessment of the appropriate penalty amount, based on information then in OFAC's possession. The amount of the final penalty may change as OFAC learns additional relevant information. If, after issuance of a Pre-Penalty Notice, OFAC determines that a penalty in an amount that represents an increase of more than 10 percent from the proposed penalty set forth in the Pre-Penalty Notice is appropriate, or if OFAC intends to allege additional violations, it will issue a revised Pre-Penalty Notice setting forth the new proposed penalty amount and/or alleged violations.
a. In general, the Pre-Penalty Notice will set forth the following with respect to the specific violations alleged and the proposed penalties:
i. Description of the alleged violations, including the number of violations and their value, for which a penalty is being proposed;
ii. Identification of the regulatory or other provisions alleged to have been violated;
iii. Identification of the base category (defined below) according to which the proposed penalty amount was calculated and the General Factors that were most relevant to the determination of the proposed penalty amount;
iv. The maximum amount of the penalty to which the Subject Person could be subject under applicable law; and
v. The proposed penalty amount, determined in accordance with the provisions set forth in these Guidelines.
b. The Pre-Penalty Notice will also include information regarding how to respond to the Pre-Penalty Notice including:
i. A statement that the Subject Person may submit a written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice by a date certain addressing the alleged violation(s), the General Factors Affecting Administrative Action set forth in Section III of these Guidelines, and any other information or evidence that the Subject Person deems relevant to OFAC's consideration.
ii. A statement that a failure to respond to the Pre-Penalty Notice may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty.
2.
Response to Pre-Penalty Notice.
A Subject Person may submit a written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice in accordance with the procedures set forth in the particular regulations governing the conduct giving rise to the apparent violation. Generally, the response should either agree to the proposed penalty set forth in the Pre-Penalty Notice or set forth reasons why a penalty should not be imposed or, if imposed, why it should be a lesser amount than proposed, with particular attention paid to the General Factors Affecting Administrative Action set forth in Section III of these Guidelines. The response should include all documentary or other evidence available to the Subject Person that supports the arguments set forth in the response. OFAC will consider all relevant materials submitted.
3.
Penalty Notice.
If OFAC receives no response to a Pre-Penalty Notice within the time prescribed in the Pre-Penalty Notice, or if following the receipt of a response to a Pre-Penalty Notice and a review of the information and evidence contained therein OFAC concludes that a civil monetary penalty is warranted, a Penalty Notice generally will be issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in the particular regulations governing the conduct giving rise to the violation. A Penalty Notice constitutes a final agency determination that a violation has occurred. The penalty amount set forth in the Penalty Notice will take into account relevant additional information provided in response to a Pre-Penalty Notice. In the absence of a response to a Pre-Penalty Notice, the penalty amount set forth in the Penalty Notice will generally be the same as the proposed penalty set forth in the Pre-Penalty Notice.
4.
Referral to Financial Management Division.
The imposition of a civil monetary penalty pursuant to a Penalty Notice creates a debt due the U.S. Government. OFAC will advise Treasury's Financial Management Division upon the imposition of a penalty. The Financial Management Division may take follow-up action to collect the penalty assessed if it is not paid within the prescribed time period set forth in the Penalty Notice. In addition or instead, the matter may be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action to recover the penalty.
5.
Final Agency Action.
The issuance of a Penalty Notice constitutes final agency action with respect to the violation(s) for which the penalty is assessed.

# B. Amount of Civil Penalty
1.
Egregious case.
In those cases in which a civil monetary penalty is deemed appropriate, OFAC will make a determination as to whether a case is deemed “egregious” for purposes of the base penalty calculation. This determination will be based on an analysis of the applicable General Factors. In making the egregiousness determination, OFAC generally will give substantial weight to General Factors A (“willful or reckless violation of law”), B (“awareness of conduct at issue”), C (“harm to sanctions program objectives”) and D (“individual characteristics”), with particular emphasis on General Factors A and B. A case will be considered an “egregious case” where the analysis of the applicable General Factors, with a focus on those General Factors identified above, indicates that the case represents a particularly serious violation of the law calling for a strong enforcement response. A determination that a case is “egregious” will be made by the Director or Deputy Director.
2.
Pre-Penalty Notice.
The penalty amount proposed in a Pre-Penalty Notice shall generally be calculated as follows, except that neither the base amount nor the proposed penalty will exceed the applicable statutory maximum amount:
6
6
For apparent violations identified in the Cuba Penalty Schedule, 68 Fed. Reg. 4429 (Jan. 29, 2003), for which a civil monetary penalty has been deemed appropriate, the base penalty amount shall equal the amount set forth in the Schedule for such violation, except that the base penalty amount shall be reduced by 50% in cases of voluntary self-disclosure.

# a. Base Category Calculation
i. In a non-egregious case, if the apparent violation is disclosed through a voluntary self-disclosure by the Subject Person, the base amount of the proposed civil penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice shall be one-half of the transaction value, capped at a maximum base amount of $188,850 per violation, except where the statutory maximum penalty applicable to the apparent violation is less than $377,700, in which case the base amount of the proposed civil penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice shall be capped at one-half the statutory maximum penalty applicable to the apparent violation.
ii. In a non-egregious case, if the apparent violation comes to OFAC's attention by
means other than a voluntary self-disclosure, the base amount of the proposed civil penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice shall be the “applicable schedule amount,” as defined above. For apparent violations where the statutory maximum penalty applicable to the apparent violation is $377,700 or greater, the maximum base amount shall be capped at $377,700. For apparent violations where the statutory maximum penalty applicable to the apparent violation is less than $377,700, the maximum base amount shall be capped at the statutory maximum penalty amount applicable to the apparent violation.
iii. In an egregious case, if the apparent violation is disclosed through a voluntary self-disclosure by a Subject Person, the base amount of the proposed civil penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice shall be one-half of the applicable statutory maximum penalty applicable to the violation.
iv. In an egregious case, if the apparent violation comes to OFAC's attention by means other than a voluntary self-disclosure, the base amount of the proposed civil penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice shall be the applicable statutory maximum penalty amount applicable to the violation.
v. The applicable statutory maximum civil penalty per violation for each statute enforced by OFAC is as follows: International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—greater of $377,700 or twice the amount of the underlying transaction; Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA)— $111,308; Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (FNKDA)— $1,876,699; Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)—greater of $99,703 or twice the amount of which a financial institution was required to retain possession or control; and Clean Diamond Trade Act (CDTA)—$17,062. The civil penalty amounts authorized under these statutes are subject to adjustment pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, as amended, 28 U.S.C. 2461 note).
vi. The following matrix represents the base amount of the proposed civil penalty for each category of violation:
ER15JA25.063

# b. Adjustment for Applicable Relevant General Factors
The base amount of the proposed civil penalty may be adjusted to reflect applicable General Factors for Administrative Action set forth in Section III of these Guidelines. Each factor may be considered mitigating or aggravating, resulting in a lower or higher
proposed penalty amount. As a general matter, in those cases where the following General Factors are present, OFAC will adjust the base proposed penalty amount in the following manner:
i. In cases involving substantial cooperation with OFAC but no voluntary self-disclosure as defined herein, including cases in which an apparent violation is reported to OFAC by a third party but the Subject Person provides substantial additional information regarding the apparent violation and/or other related violations, the base penalty amount generally will be reduced between 25 and 40 percent. Substantial cooperation in cases involving voluntary self-disclosure may also be considered as a further mitigating factor.
ii. In cases involving a Subject Person's first violation, the base penalty amount generally will be reduced up to 25 percent. An apparent violation generally will be considered a “first violation” if the Subject Person has not received a penalty notice or Finding of Violation from OFAC in the five years preceding the date of the transaction giving rise to the apparent violation. A group of substantially similar apparent violations addressed in a single Pre-Penalty Notice shall be considered as a single violation for purposes of this subsection. In those cases where a prior penalty notice or Finding of Violation within the preceding five years involved conduct of a substantially different nature from the apparent violation at issue, OFAC may consider the apparent violation at issue a “first violation.” In determining the extent of any mitigation for a first violation, OFAC may consider any prior OFAC enforcement action taken with respect to the Subject Person, including any cautionary, warning or evaluative letters issued, or any civil monetary settlements entered into with OFAC.
In all cases, the proposed penalty amount will not exceed the applicable statutory maximum.
In cases involving a large number of apparent violations, where the transaction value of all apparent violations is either unknown or would require a disproportionate allocation of resources to determine, OFAC may estimate or extrapolate the transaction value of the total universe of apparent violations in determining the amount of any proposed civil monetary penalty.
3.
Penalty Notice.
The amount of the proposed civil penalty in the Pre-Penalty Notice will be the presumptive starting point for calculation of the civil penalty amount in the Penalty Notice. OFAC may adjust the penalty amount in the Penalty Notice based on:
a. Evidence presented by the Subject Person in response to the Pre-Penalty Notice, or otherwise received by OFAC with respect to the underlying violation(s); and/or
b. Any modification resulting from further review and reconsideration by OFAC of the proposed civil monetary penalty in light of the General Factors for Administrative Action set forth in Section III above.
In no event will the amount of the civil monetary penalty in the Penalty Notice exceed the proposed penalty set forth in the Pre-Penalty Notice by more than 10 percent, or include additional alleged violations, unless a revised Pre-Penalty Notice has first been sent to the Subject Person as set forth above. In the event that OFAC determines upon further review that no penalty is appropriate, it will so inform the Subject Person in a no-action letter, a cautionary letter, or a Finding of Violation.

# C. Settlements
A settlement does not constitute a final agency determination that a violation has occurred.
1.
Settlement Process.
Settlement discussions may be initiated by OFAC, the Subject Person or the Subject Person's authorized representative. Settlements generally will be negotiated in accordance with the principles set forth in these Guidelines with respect to appropriate penalty amounts. OFAC may condition the entry into or continuation of settlement negotiations on the execution of a tolling agreement with respect to the statute of limitations.
2.
Settlement Prior to Issuance of Pre-Penalty Notice.
Where settlement discussions occur prior to the issuance of a Pre-Penalty Notice, the Subject Person may request in writing that OFAC withhold issuance of a Pre-Penalty Notice pending the conclusion of settlement discussions. OFAC will generally agree to such a request as long as settlement discussions are continuing in good faith and the statute of limitations is not at risk of expiring.
3.
Settlement Following Issuance of Pre-Penalty Notice.
If a matter is settled after a Pre-Penalty Notice has been issued, but before a final Penalty Notice is issued, OFAC will not make a final determination as to whether a sanctions violation has occurred. In the event no settlement is reached, the period specified for written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice remains in effect unless additional time is granted by OFAC.
4.
Settlements of Multiple Apparent Violations.
A settlement initiated for one apparent violation may also involve a comprehensive or global settlement of multiple apparent violations covered by other Pre-Penalty Notices, apparent violations for which a Pre-Penalty Notice has not yet been issued by OFAC, or previously unknown apparent violations reported to OFAC during the pendency of an investigation of an apparent violation.

# Annex
The following matrix can be used by financial institutions to evaluate their compliance programs:
OFAC Risk Matrix
Low
Moderate
High
Stable, well-known customer base in a localized environment
Customer base changing due to branching, merger, or acquisition in the domestic market
A large, fluctuating client base in an international environment.
Few high-risk customers; these may include nonresident aliens, foreign customers (including accounts with U.S. powers of attorney), and foreign commercial customers
A moderate number of high-risk customers
A large number of high-risk customers.
No overseas branches and no correspondent accounts with foreign banks
Overseas branches or correspondent accounts with foreign banks
Overseas branches or multiple correspondent accounts with foreign banks.
No electronic services (
e.g.,
e-banking) offered, or products available are purely informational or non-transactional
The institution offers limited electronic (
e.g.,
e-banking) products and services
The institution offers a wide array of electronic (
e.g.,
e-banking) products and services (
i.e.,
account transfers, e-bill payment, or accounts opened via the Internet).
Limited number of funds transfers for customers and non-customers, limited third-party transactions, and no international funds transfers
A moderate number of funds transfers, mostly for customers. Possibly, a few international funds transfers from personal or business accounts
A high number of customer and non-customer funds transfers, including international funds transfers.
No other types of international transactions, such as trade finance, cross-border ACH, and management of sovereign debt
Limited other types of international transactions
A high number of other types of international transactions.
No history of OFAC actions. No evidence of apparent violation or circumstances that might lead to a violation
A small number of recent actions (
i.e.,
actions within the last five years) by OFAC, including notice letters, or civil money penalties, with evidence that the institution addressed the issues and is not at risk of similar violations in the future
Multiple recent actions by OFAC, where the institution has not addressed the issues, thus leading to an increased risk of the institution undertaking similar violations in the future.
Management has fully assessed the institution's level of risk based on its customer base and product lines. This understanding of risk and strong commitment to OFAC compliance is satisfactorily communicated throughout the organization
Management exhibits a reasonable understanding of the key aspects of OFAC compliance and its commitment is generally clear and satisfactorily communicated throughout the organization, but it may lack a program appropriately tailored to risk
Management does not understand, or has chosen to ignore, key aspects of OFAC compliance risk. The importance of compliance is not emphasized or communicated throughout the organization.
The board of directors, or board committee, has approved an OFAC compliance program that includes policies, procedures, controls, and information systems that are adequate, and consistent with the institution's OFAC risk profile
The board has approved an OFAC compliance program that includes most of the appropriate policies, procedures, controls, and information systems necessary to ensure compliance, but some weaknesses are noted
The board has not approved an OFAC compliance program, or policies, procedures, controls, and information systems are significantly deficient.
Staffing levels appear adequate to properly execute the OFAC compliance program
Staffing levels appear generally adequate, but some deficiencies are noted
Management has failed to provide appropriate staffing levels to handle workload.
Authority and accountability for OFAC compliance are clearly defined and enforced, including the designation of a qualified OFAC officer
Authority and accountability are defined, but some refinements are needed. A qualified OFAC officer has been designated
Authority and accountability for compliance have not been clearly established. No OFAC compliance officer, or an unqualified one, has been appointed. The role of the OFAC officer is unclear.
Training is appropriate and effective based on the institution's risk profile, covers applicable personnel, and provides necessary up-to-date information and resources to ensure compliance
Training is conducted and management provides adequate resources given the risk profile of the organization; however, some areas are not covered within the training program
Training is sporadic and does not cover important regulatory and risk areas or is nonexistent.
The institution employs strong quality control methods
The institution employs limited quality control methods
The institution does not employ quality control methods.

General and specific licensing procedures.
For provisions relating to licensing procedures, see part 501, subpart E, of this chapter. Licensing actions taken pursuant to part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. General licenses and statements of licensing policy relating to this part also may be available through the North
Korea sanctions page on OFAC's website:
www.treasury.gov/ofac.
§ 510.502
Effect of license or other authorization.
(a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or otherwise issued by OFAC, authorizes or validates any transaction effected prior to the issuance of such license or other authorization, unless specifically provided in such license or authorization.
(b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizes any transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license is issued by OFAC and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to authorize any transaction prohibited by any other part of this chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license specifically refers to such part.
(c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, or license authorizing any transaction otherwise prohibited under this part has the effect of removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license otherwise specifies, such an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any property that would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of law.
(d) Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to supersede the requirements established under any other provision of law or to relieve a person from any requirement to obtain a license or other authorization from another department or agency of the U.S. Government in compliance with applicable laws and regulations subject to the jurisdiction of that department or agency. For example, exports of goods, services, or technical data that are not prohibited by this part or that do not require a license by OFAC nevertheless may require authorization by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of State, or other agencies of the U.S. Government.
(e) No license or other authorization contained in or issued pursuant to this part authorizes transfers of or payments from blocked property or debits to blocked accounts unless the license or other authorization explicitly authorizes the transfer of or payment from blocked property or the debit to a blocked account.
(f) Any payment relating to a transaction authorized in or pursuant to this part that is routed through the U.S. financial system should reference the relevant OFAC general or specific license authorizing the payment to avoid the blocking or rejection of the transfer.
§ 510.503
Exclusion from licenses.
OFAC reserves the right to exclude any person, property, transaction, or class thereof from the operation of any license or from the privileges conferred by any license. OFAC also reserves the right to restrict the applicability of any license to particular persons, property, transactions, or classes thereof. Such actions are binding upon actual or constructive notice of the exclusions or restrictions.
§ 510.504

A transfer of funds or credit by a U.S. financial institution between blocked accounts in its branches or offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is made from an account within the United States to an account held outside the United States, and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may be made only to another blocked account held in the same name.

§ 510.702
Pre-Penalty Notice; settlement.
(a)
When required.
If OFAC has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, regulation, order, directive, or instruction issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of
the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1705) (IEEPA) and determines that a civil monetary penalty is warranted, OFAC will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty. A Pre-Penalty Notice shall be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter. For a description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
(b)
Response
—(1)
Right to respond.
An alleged violator has the right to respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to OFAC. For a description of the information that should be included in such a response, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
(2)
Deadline for response.
A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must be made within 30 days as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The failure to submit a response within 30 days shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond.
(i)
Computation of time for response.
A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed.

A copy of the written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be sent to OFAC's Enforcement Division by mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c)
Settlement.
Settlement discussion may be initiated by OFAC, the alleged violator, or the alleged violator's authorized representative. For a description of practices with respect to settlement, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.

[62 FR 9960, Mar. 5, 1997, as amended at 89 FR 15741, Mar. 5, 2024]
§ 510.703
Penalty imposition.
If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice and any relevant facts, OFAC determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the Pre-Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is appropriate, OFAC may issue a Penalty Notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional details concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in federal district court.
§ 510.704
Administrative collection; referral to United States Department of Justice.
In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to OFAC, the matter may be referred for administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.
§ 510.705
Finding of Violation.
(a)
When issued.
(1) OFAC may issue an initial Finding of Violation that identifies a violation if OFAC:
(i) Determines that there has occurred a violation of any provision of this part, or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, regulation, order, directive, or instruction issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act;
(ii) Considers it important to document the occurrence of a violation; and
(iii) Based on the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter, concludes that an administrative response is warranted but that a civil monetary penalty is not the most appropriate response.
(2) An initial Finding of Violation shall be in writing and may be issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter. For additional details concerning issuance of a Finding of Violation, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
(b)
Response
—(1)
Right to respond.
An alleged violator has the right to contest an initial Finding of Violation by providing a written response to OFAC.
(2)
Deadline for response; default determination.
A response to an initial Finding of Violation must be made within 30 days as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The failure to submit a response within 30 days shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond, and the initial Finding of Violation will become final and will constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in federal district court.
(i)
Computation of time for response.
A response to an initial Finding of Violation must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which the initial Finding of Violation was served. If the initial Finding of Violation was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by OFAC, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.

Extensions of time for response.
If a due date falls on a federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.
(3)
Form and method of response.
A response to an initial Finding of Violation need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof, contain information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the initial Finding of Violation, and include the OFAC identification number listed on the initial Finding of Violation. A copy of the written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be sent to OFAC by mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
Information that should be included in response.
Any response should set forth in detail why the alleged violator either believes that a violation of the regulations did not occur and/or why a Finding of Violation is otherwise unwarranted under the circumstances, with reference to the General Factors Affecting Administrative Action set forth in the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501. The response should include all documentary or other evidence available to the alleged violator that supports the arguments set forth in the response. OFAC will consider all relevant materials submitted in the response.
(c)
Determination
—(1)
Determination that a Finding of Violation is warranted.
If, after considering the response, OFAC determines that a final Finding of Violation should be issued, OFAC will issue a final Finding of Violation that will inform the violator of its decision. A final Finding of Violation shall constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in federal district court.
(2)
Determination that a Finding of Violation is not warranted.
If, after considering the response, OFAC determines a Finding of Violation is not warranted, then OFAC will inform the alleged violator of its decision not to issue a final Finding of Violation.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
c

# )(2):
A determination by OFAC that a final Finding of Violation is not warranted does not preclude OFAC from pursuing other enforcement actions consistent with the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.

Transactions with respect to securities registered or inscribed in the name of a designated national.
Unless authorized by a license expressly referring to this section, the acquisition, transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on or otherwise dealing in any security (or evidence thereof) registered or inscribed in the name of any designated national is prohibited irrespective of the fact that at any time (either prior to, on, or subsequent to the “effective date”) the registered or inscribed owner thereof may have, or appears to have, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of any such security.
§ 515.203
Effect of transfers violating the provisions of this part.
(a) Any transfer after the “effective date” which is in violation of any provision of this part or of any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or authorization thereunder and involves any property in which a designated national has or has had an interest since such “effective date” is null and void and shall not be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to such property.
(b) No transfer before the “effective date” shall be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to, or interest in, any property in which a designated national has or has had an interest since the “effective date” unless the person with whom such property is held or maintained had written notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer prior to such “effective date.”
(c) Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury before, during or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or render it enforceable to the same extent as it would be valid or enforceable but for the provisions of section 5(b) of the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended, and this part and any ruling, order, regulation, direction or instruction issued hereunder.
(d) Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void, or unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to be null and void, or unenforceable pursuant to such provisions, as to any person with whom such property was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in cases in which such person is able to establish each of the following:
(1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the provisions of this part by the person with whom such property was held or maintained;
(2) The person with whom such property was held or maintained did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer required a license or authorization by or pursuant to the provisions of this part and was not so licensed or authorized or if a license or authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
(3) Promptly upon discovery that:
(i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or any regulation, ruling, instruction, license or other direction or authorization thereunder, or
(ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, or
(iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained;
the person with whom such property was held or maintained filed with the Treasury Department, Washington, D.C., a report in triplicate setting forth in full the circumstances relating to such transfer. The filing of a report in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall not be deemed to be compliance or evidence of compliance with paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.
(e) Unless licensed or authorized by § 515.504 or otherwise licensed or authorized pursuant to this chapter any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null and void with respect to any property in which on or since the “effective date” there existed the interest of a designated foreign country or national thereof.

property

§ 515.543
Proof of origin.
Specific licenses for importation of goods of Cuban origin are generally not issued unless the applicant submits satisfactory documentary proof of the location of the goods outside Cuba prior to July 8, 1963 and of the absence of any Cuban interest in the goods at all times on or since that date. Since the type of document which would constitute satisfactory proof varies depending upon the facts of the particular case, it is not possible to state in advance the type of documents required. However, it has been found that affidavits, statements, invoices, and other documents prepared by manufacturers, processors, sellers or shippers cannot be relied on and are therefore not by themselves accepted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control as satisfactory proof of origin. Independent corroborating documentary evidence, such as insurance documents, bills of lading, etc., may be accepted as satisfactory proof.

§ 515.574
Support for the Cuban People.
(a)
General license.
The travel-related transactions set forth in § 515.560(c) and other transactions that are intended to provide support for the Cuban people are authorized, provided that:
(1) The activities are of:
(i) Recognized human rights organizations;
(ii) Independent organizations designed to promote a rapid, peaceful transition to democracy; or
(iii) Individuals and non-governmental organizations that promote independent activity intended to strengthen civil society in Cuba; and
(2) Each traveler engages in a full-time schedule of activities that:
(i) Enhance contact with the Cuban people, support civil society in Cuba, or promote the Cuban people's independence from Cuban authorities; and
(ii) Result in meaningful interaction with individuals in Cuba.
(3) The traveler's schedule of activities does not include free time or recreation in excess of that consistent with a full-time schedule.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
a

# ):
Each person relying on the general authorization in this paragraph must retain specific records related to the authorized travel transactions. See §§ 501.601 and 501.602 of this chapter for applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

# Note 2 to paragraph (
a

# ):
Staying in a room at a rented accommodation in a private Cuban residence (
casa particular
), eating at privately-owned Cuban restaurants (
paladares
), and shopping at privately-owned stores run by self-employed Cubans (
cuentapropista
) are examples of activities that qualify for this general license. However, in order to meet the requirement for a full-time schedule, a traveler must engage in additional authorized Support for the Cuban People activities.
(b) An entire group does not qualify for the general license in paragraph (a) of this section merely because some members of the group qualify individually.
(c)
Certain direct financial transactions restricted.
Nothing in paragraph
(a)(1)(iii) of this section authorizes a direct financial transaction prohibited by § 515.209, with the exception of transactions on behalf of a non-governmental organization.
(d)
Certain travel-related transactions restricted.
Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section authorizes the lodging, paying for lodging, or making any reservation for or on behalf of a third party to lodge, at any property on the Cuba Prohibited Accommodations List (CPA List) to the extent prohibited by § 515.210.
(e)
Specific licenses.
Specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis authorizing the travel-related transactions set forth in § 515.560(c) and such other transactions as are related to support for the Cuban people that do not qualify for the general license under paragraph (a) of this section.

# Example 1 to § 515.574:
An individual plans to travel to Cuba, stay in a room at a rented accommodation in a private Cuban residence (
casa particular
), eat at privately-owned Cuban restaurants (
paladares
), and shop at privately-owned stores run by self-employed Cubans (
cuentapropista
) during his or her four-day trip. While at the
casa particular,
the individual will have breakfast each morning with the Cuban host and engage with the Cuban host to learn about Cuban culture. The traveler will not lodge, or pay for lodging, at any property on the CPA List to the extent prohibited by § 515.210. In addition, the traveler will complete his or her full-time schedule by supporting Cuban entrepreneurs launching their privately-owned businesses. The traveler's activities promote independent activity intended to strengthen civil society in Cuba. Because the individual's qualifying activities are not limited to staying in a room at a rented accommodation in a private Cuban residence (
casa particular
), eating at privately-owned Cuban restaurants (
paladares
), and shopping at privately owned stores run by self-employed Cubans (
cuentapropista
) and the traveler maintains a full-time schedule that enhances contact with the Cuban people, supports civil society in Cuba, and promotes the Cuban people's independence from Cuban authorities, and that results in meaningful interaction between the traveler and Cuban individuals, the individual's travel qualifies for the general license.

# Example 2 to § 515.574:
A group of friends plans to travel and maintain a full-time schedule throughout their trip by volunteering with a recognized non-governmental organization to build a school for underserved Cuban children with the local community. In their free time, the travelers plan to rent bicycles to explore the streets of Havana and visit an art museum. The travelers will not lodge, or pay for lodging, at any property on the CPA List to the extent prohibited by § 515.210. The travelers' trip would qualify for the general license because the volunteer activities promote independent activity intended to strengthen civil society in Cuba and constitute a full-time schedule that enhances contact with the Cuban people and supports civil society in Cuba, and results in meaningful interaction between the travelers and individuals in Cuba.

# Example 3 to § 515.574:
An individual plans to travel to Cuba, rent a bicycle to explore the neighborhoods and beaches, and engage in brief exchanges with local beach vendors. The individual intends to stay at a hotel that does not appear on the Cuba Restricted List (see § 515.209), and will not lodge, or pay for lodging, at any property on the CPA List to the extent prohibited by § 515.210. The traveler's trip does not qualify for this general license because none of these activities promote independent activity intended to strengthen civil society in Cuba.

# Example to § 515.575(b):
A U.S. group of medical professionals that specializes in disease treatment wishes to support a community in Cuba by providing the latest techniques and literature in disease education and prevention directly to the Cuban people. Provided that the medical professionals in the group maintain a full-time schedule related to disease education and prevention, these activities qualify for the general license.

Termination and acquisition of an interest in blocked property.
(a) Whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to this part results in the transfer of property (including any property interest) away from a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 525.201, such property shall no longer be deemed to be property blocked pursuant to § 525.201, unless there exists in the property another interest that is blocked pursuant to § 525.201, the transfer of which has not been effected pursuant to license or other authorization.
(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part, if property (including any property interest) is transferred or attempted to be transferred to a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 525.201, such property shall be deemed to be property in which such person has an interest and therefore blocked.

§ 525.411
Entities owned by one or more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked.
Persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 525.201 have an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which such persons directly or indirectly own, whether individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 525.201, regardless of whether the name of the entity is incorporated into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List).
§ 525.412
Entities of which one or more blocked persons is a member, leader, official, senior executive officer, or otherwise exercises control.
(a) The property and interests in property of an entity, including any
political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of a governmental entity, are not blocked solely because one or more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 525.201 is a member, leader, official, senior executive officer, or otherwise exercises control.

# Note 1 to paragraph
(a)

# .
See
§ 525.411 concerning the blocked status of property and interests in property of an entity that is directly or indirectly owned, whether individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 525.201.

However, U.S. persons are not prohibited from engaging in a routine interaction with an agency in which a blocked person is an official, but which does not involve the blocked person directly or indirectly.

# Note 2 to § 525.412.
OFAC encourages U.S. persons to be cautious in engaging in transactions with any entity of which a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 525.201 is a member, leader, official, senior executive officer, or otherwise exercises control to ensure that U.S. persons are not engaged in transactions, directly or indirectly, with a blocked person, except as authorized or exempt pursuant to this part.

# Subpart E—Licenses, Authorizations, and Statements of Licensing Policy
§ 525.501
General and specific licensing procedures.
For provisions relating to licensing procedures, see part 501, subpart E, of this chapter. Licensing actions taken pursuant to part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. General licenses and statements of licensing policy relating to this part also may be available through the Burma sanctions page on OFAC's website:
https://ofac.treasury.gov.
§ 525.502
Effect of license or other authorization.
(a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or otherwise issued by OFAC, authorizes or validates any transaction effected prior to the issuance of such license or other authorization, unless specifically provided in such license or authorization.
(b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license authorizes any transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license is issued by OFAC and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to authorize any transaction prohibited by any other part of this chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license specifically refers to such part.
(c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license authorizing any transaction prohibited under this part has the effect of removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license otherwise specifies, such an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any property that would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of law.
(d) Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to supersede the requirements established under any other provision of law or to relieve a person from any requirement to obtain a license or other authorization from another department or agency of the U.S. government in compliance with applicable laws and regulations subject to the jurisdiction of that department or agency. For example, exports of goods, services, or technical data that are not prohibited by this part or that do not require a license by OFAC nevertheless may require authorization by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the
U.S. Department of State, or other agencies of the U.S. government.
(e) No license or other authorization contained in or issued pursuant to this part authorizes transfers of or payments from blocked property or debits to blocked accounts unless the license or other authorization explicitly authorizes the transfer of or payment from blocked property or the debit to a blocked account.
(f) Any payment relating to a transaction authorized in or pursuant to this part that is routed through the U.S. financial system should reference the relevant OFAC general or specific license authorizing the payment to avoid the blocking or rejection of the transfer.
§ 525.503
Exclusion from licenses.
OFAC reserves the right to exclude any person, property, transaction, or class thereof from the operation of any license or from the privileges conferred by any license. OFAC also reserves the right to restrict the applicability of any license to particular persons, property, transactions, or classes thereof. Such actions are binding upon actual or constructive notice of the exclusions or restrictions.
§ 525.504
Payments and transfers to blocked accounts in U.S. financial institutions.
Any payment of funds or transfer of credit in which a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 525.201 has any interest that comes within the possession or control of a U.S. financial institution must be blocked in an account on the books of that financial institution. A transfer of funds or credit by a U.S. financial institution between blocked accounts in its branches or offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is made from an account within the United States to an account held outside the United States, and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may be made only to another blocked account held in the same name.

(c) U.S. persons do not need to obtain specific authorization to provide related services, such as making filings and providing other administrative services, that are ordinarily incident to the provision of services authorized by paragraph (a) of this section. Additionally, U.S. persons who provide services authorized by paragraph (a) of this section do not need to obtain specific authorization to contract for related services that are ordinarily incident to the provision of those legal services, such as those provided by private investigators or expert witnesses, or to pay for such services.
See

If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice and any relevant facts, OFAC determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the Pre-Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary penalty is appropriate, OFAC may issue a Penalty Notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional details concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in Federal district court.
§ 525.704
Administrative collection; referral to United States Department of Justice.
In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to OFAC, the matter may be referred for administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a federal district court.
§ 525.705
Findings of Violation.
(a)
When issued.
(1) OFAC may issue an initial Finding of Violation that identifies a violation if OFAC:
(i) Determines that there has occurred a violation of any provision of this part, or a violation of the provisions of any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701
et seq
);
(ii) Considers it important to document the occurrence of a violation; and
(iii) Based on the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter, concludes that an administrative response is warranted but that a civil monetary penalty is not the most appropriate response.
(2) An initial Finding of Violation shall be in writing and may be issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter. For additional details concerning issuance of a Finding of Violation, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
(b)
Response
—(1)
Right to respond.
An alleged violator has the right to contest an initial Finding of Violation by providing a written response to OFAC.
(2)
Deadline for response; default determination.
A response to an initial Finding of Violation must be made within 30 days as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The failure to submit a response within 30 days shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond, and the initial Finding of Violation will become final and will constitute final agency action.
The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in federal district court.
(i)
Computation of time for response.
A response to an initial Finding of Violation must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier), or dated if sent by email, on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which the initial Finding of Violation was served or date the Finding of Violation was sent by email. If the initial Finding of Violation was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by OFAC, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
(ii)
Extensions of time for response.
If a due date falls on a federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.
(3)
Form and method of response.
A response to an initial Finding of Violation need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof (electronic signature is acceptable), contain information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the initial Finding of Violation, and include the OFAC identification number listed on the initial Finding of Violation. The response must be sent to OFAC's Enforcement Division by mail or courier or email and must be postmarked or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
Information that should be included in response.
Any response should set forth in detail why the alleged violator either believes that a violation of the regulations in this part did not occur and/or why a Finding of Violation is otherwise unwarranted under the circumstances, with reference to the General Factors Affecting Administrative Action set forth in the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter. The response should include all documentary or other evidence available to the alleged violator that supports the arguments set forth in the response. OFAC will consider all relevant materials submitted in the response.
(c)
Determination
—(1)
Determination that a Finding of Violation is warranted.
If, after considering the response, OFAC determines that a final Finding of Violation should be issued, OFAC will issue a final Finding of Violation that will inform the violator of its decision. A final Finding of Violation shall constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in federal district court.
(2)
Determination that a Finding of Violation is not warranted.
If, after considering the response, OFAC determines a Finding of Violation is not warranted, then OFAC will inform the alleged violator of its decision not to issue a final Finding of Violation.

# Note 1 to paragraph
(c)(2)

# .
A determination by OFAC that a final Finding of Violation is not warranted does not preclude OFAC from pursuing other enforcement actions consistent with the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
(d)
Representation.
A representative of the alleged violator may act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with OFAC prior to a written submission regarding the specific alleged violations contained in the initial Finding of Violation must be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the initial Finding of Violation was served upon the alleged violator in care of the representative.

Relation of this part to other laws and regulations.
This part is separate from, and independent of, the other parts of this chapter, with the exception of part 501 of this chapter, the recordkeeping and reporting requirements and license application and other procedures of which apply to this part. Actions taken pursuant to part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in this part are considered actions
taken pursuant to this part. Differing foreign policy and national security circumstances may result in differing interpretations of similar language among the parts of this chapter. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to those other parts authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to any other provision of law or regulation authorizes any transaction prohibited by this part. No license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to this part relieves the involved parties from complying with any other applicable laws or regulations.

# Subpart B—Prohibitions

Prohibited transactions.

This prohibition includes the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, any securities on or after the effective date.

# Note 1 to § 526.201.

In certain cases, OFAC may issue an order to: identify as blocked specific property or interests in property of a person designated or otherwise blocked pursuant to this section; block specific property or interests in property of a person pending investigation; or block or impose other prohibitions with respect to specific property or interests in property less than full blocking sanctions. Notice of such orders will be provided: by publication in the
Federal Register
; in writing to persons OFAC may assess to have an interest in the property; or by issuing an order or directive in writing to financial institutions or other transaction intermediaries, and requiring the recipient of the order or directive to promptly disclose it to affected persons with whom the recipient maintains direct commercial relationships. Inquiries regarding any such order should be directed to OFAC's Compliance Division at 202-622-2490 or
https://ofac.treasury.gov/contact-ofac.

# Note 4 to § 526.201:
Subpart E of part 501 of this chapter describes the procedures to be followed for the release of property and interests in property blocked pursuant to this section, including funds blocked due to mistaken identity or typographical or similar errors, and for administrative reconsideration of one's status as a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

(a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of any provision of this part or of any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to § 526.201, is null and void and shall not be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to such property or interest in property.
(b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to § 526.201, unless the person who holds or maintains such property, prior to that date, had written notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
(c) Unless otherwise provided, a license or other authorization issued by OFAC before, during, or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the provisions of this part and any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued pursuant to this part.
(d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of OFAC each of the following:
(1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the provisions of this part by the person with whom such
property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only);
(2) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer required a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part and was not so licensed or authorized, or, if a license or authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and
(3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained filed with OFAC a report setting forth in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery that:
(i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, license, or other authorization issued pursuant to this part;
(ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by OFAC; or
(iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.
(e) The filing of a report in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section have been satisfied.

et seq.
), provided the funds are invested in a money market fund or in U.S. Treasury bills.
(2) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 180 days.
(c) For the purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable if it is the rate currently offered to other depositors on deposits or instruments of comparable size and maturity.
(d) For the purposes of this section, if interest is credited to a separate blocked account or subaccount, the name of the account party on each account must be the same.
(e) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 180 days at the time the funds become subject to § 526.201 may continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (a) or (f) of this section.
(f) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United States at the time the funds become subject to § 526.201 may continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instruments, provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially reasonable.
(g) This section does not create an affirmative obligation for the holder of blocked tangible property, such as real or personal property, or of other blocked property, such as debt or equity securities, to sell or liquidate such property. However, OFAC may issue licenses permitting or directing such sales or liquidation in appropriate cases.
(h) Funds blocked pursuant to § 526.201 may not be held, invested, or reinvested in a manner that provides financial or economic benefit or access to any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 526.201, nor may their holder cooperate in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as collateral of blocked funds or other assets.
§ 526.204

Termination and acquisition of an interest in blocked property.
(a) Whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to this part results in the transfer of property (including any property interest) away from a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 526.201, such property shall no longer be deemed to be property blocked pursuant to § 526.201, unless there exists in the property another interest that is blocked pursuant to § 526.201, the transfer of which has not been effected pursuant to license or other authorization.
(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part, if property (including any property interest) is transferred or attempted to be transferred to a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 526.201, such property shall be deemed to be property in which such person has an interest and therefore blocked.
§ 526.404

(a) Any transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction and necessary to give effect thereto is also authorized, except:
(1) An ordinarily incident transaction, not explicitly authorized within the terms of the license, by or with a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 526.201; or

# Subpart E—Licenses, Authorizations, and Statements of Licensing Policy

General and specific licensing procedures.
For provisions relating to licensing procedures, see part 501, subpart E, of this chapter.

General licenses and statements of licensing policy relating to this part also may be available through the Hostages and Wrongfully Detained U.S. Nationals Sanctions page on OFAC's website:
www.treas.gov/ofac.
§ 526.502
Effect of license or other authorization.
(a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or otherwise issued by OFAC, authorizes or validates any transaction effected prior to the issuance of such license or other authorization, unless specifically provided in such license or authorization.
(b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license authorizes any transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license is issued by OFAC and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to authorize any transaction prohibited by any other part of this chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license specifically refers to such part.
(c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license authorizing any transaction prohibited under this part has the effect of removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license otherwise specifies, such an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any property that would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of law.
(d) Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to supersede the requirements established under any other provision of law or to relieve a person from any requirement to obtain a license or other authorization from another department or agency of the U.S. Government in compliance with applicable laws and regulations subject to the jurisdiction of that department or agency. For example, exports of goods, services, or technical data that are not prohibited by this part or that do not require a license by OFAC nevertheless may require authorization by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of State, or other agencies of the U.S. Government.
(e) No license or other authorization contained in or issued pursuant to this part authorizes transfers of or payments from blocked property or debits to blocked accounts unless the license or other authorization explicitly authorizes the transfer of or payment from blocked property or the debit to a blocked account.
(f) Any payment relating to a transaction authorized in or pursuant to this part that is routed through the U.S. financial system should reference the relevant OFAC general or specific license authorizing the payment to avoid the blocking or rejection of the transfer.
§ 526.503
Exclusion from licenses.
OFAC reserves the right to exclude any person, property, transaction, or class thereof from the operation of any license or from the privileges conferred by any license. OFAC also reserves the right to restrict the applicability of any license to particular persons, property, transactions, or classes thereof. Such actions are binding upon actual or constructive notice of the exclusions or restrictions.
§ 526.504
Payments and transfers to blocked accounts in U.S. financial institutions.
Any payment of funds or transfer of credit in which a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 526.201 has any interest that comes within the possession or control of a U.S. financial institution must be blocked in an account
on the books of that financial institution. A transfer of funds or credit by a U.S. financial institution between blocked accounts in its branches or offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is made from an account within the United States to an account held outside the United States, and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may be made only to another blocked account held in the same name.

e.g.,

(b) The provision of any other legal services to or on behalf of persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 526.201, not otherwise authorized in this part,
requires the issuance of a specific license.
(c) U.S. persons do not need to obtain specific authorization to provide related services, such as making filings and providing other administrative services, that are ordinarily incident to the provision of services authorized by paragraph (a) of this section. Additionally, U.S. persons who provide services authorized by paragraph (a) of this section do not need to obtain specific authorization to contract for related services that are ordinarily incident to the provision of those legal services, such as those provided by private investigators or expert witnesses, or to pay for such services.

If, after considering any written response to the Pre-Penalty Notice and any relevant facts, OFAC determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the Pre-Penalty Notice and that a civil monetary
penalty is appropriate, OFAC may issue a Penalty Notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty. For additional details concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter. The issuance of the Penalty Notice shall constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in Federal district court.
§ 526.704
Administrative collection; referral to United States Department of Justice.
In the event that the violator does not pay the penalty imposed pursuant to this part or make payment arrangements acceptable to OFAC, the matter may be referred for administrative collection measures by the Department of the Treasury or to the United States Department of Justice for appropriate action to recover the penalty in a civil suit in a Federal district court.
§ 526.705
Findings of Violation.
(a)
When issued.
(1) OFAC may issue an initial Finding of Violation that identifies a violation if OFAC:
(i) Determines that there has occurred a violation of any provision of this part, or a violation of the provisions of any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part or otherwise under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701
et seq.
);
(ii) Considers it important to document the occurrence of a violation; and
(iii) Based on the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter, concludes that an administrative response is warranted but that a civil monetary penalty is not the most appropriate response.
(2) An initial Finding of Violation shall be in writing and may be issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter. For additional details concerning issuance of a Finding of Violation, see appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
(b)
Response
—(1)
Right to respond.
An alleged violator has the right to contest an initial Finding of Violation by providing a written response to OFAC.
(2)
Deadline for response; default determination.
A response to an initial Finding of Violation must be made within 30 days as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The failure to submit a response within 30 days shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond, and the initial Finding of Violation will become final and will constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in Federal district court.
(i)
Computation of time for response.
A response to an initial Finding of Violation must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier), or dated if sent by email, on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which the initial Finding of Violation was served or date the Finding of Violation was sent by email. If the initial Finding of Violation was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by OFAC, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.
(ii)
Extensions of time for response.
If a due date falls on a Federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.
(3)
Form and method of response.
A response to an initial Finding of Violation need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof (electronic signature is acceptable), contain information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the initial Finding of Violation, and include the OFAC identification number listed on the initial Finding of Violation. The response must be sent to OFAC's Enforcement Division by mail or courier or email and must be postmarked or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
Information that should be included in response.
Any response should set forth in detail why the alleged violator either believes that a violation of the regulations in this part did not occur and/or why a Finding of Violation is otherwise unwarranted under the circumstances, with reference to the General Factors Affecting Administrative Action set forth in the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter. The response should include all documentary or other evidence available to the alleged violator that supports the arguments set forth in the response. OFAC will consider all relevant materials submitted in the response.
(c)
Determination
—(1)
Determination that a Finding of Violation is warranted.
If, after considering the response, OFAC determines that a final Finding of Violation should be issued, OFAC will issue a final Finding of Violation that will inform the violator of its decision. A final Finding of Violation shall constitute final agency action. The violator has the right to seek judicial review of that final agency action in Federal district court.
(2)
Determination that a Finding of Violation is not warranted.
If, after considering the response, OFAC determines a Finding of Violation is not warranted, then OFAC will inform the alleged violator of its decision not to issue a final Finding of Violation.

# Note 1 to paragraph (c)(2).
A determination by OFAC that a final Finding of Violation is not warranted does not preclude OFAC from pursuing other enforcement actions consistent with the Guidelines contained in appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.
(d)
Representation.
A representative of the alleged violator may act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with OFAC prior to a written submission regarding the specific alleged violations contained in the initial Finding of Violation must be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the initial Finding of Violation was served upon the alleged violator in care of the representative.

(a) Any transfer after the effective date that is in violation of any provision of this part or of any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued pursuant to this part, and that involves any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to § 528.201, is null and void and shall not be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to such property or interest in property.
(b) No transfer before the effective date shall be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to, or any interest in, any property or interest in property blocked pursuant to § 528.201, unless the person who holds or maintains such property, prior to that date, had written notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer.
(c) Unless otherwise provided, a license or other authorization issued by OFAC before, during, or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it enforceable to the same extent that it would be valid or enforceable but for the provisions of this part and any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued pursuant to this part.
(d) Transfers of property that otherwise would be null and void or unenforceable by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to be null and void or unenforceable as to any person with whom such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only) in cases in which such person is able to establish to the satisfaction of OFAC each of the following:
(1) Such transfer did not represent a willful violation of the provisions of this part by the person with whom such property is or was held or maintained (and as to such person only);

(3) The person with whom such property is or was held or maintained filed with OFAC a report setting forth in full the circumstances relating to such transfer promptly upon discovery that:

(ii) Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by OFAC; or
(iii) If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license had been obtained by misrepresentation of a third party or withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained.

(e) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 180 days at the time the funds become subject to § 528.201 may continue to be held until maturity in the original instrument, provided any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid into a blocked interest-bearing account in accordance with paragraph (a) or (f) of this section.

§ 528.401
[Reserved]
§ 528.402
Effect of amendment.
Unless otherwise specifically provided, any amendment, modification, or revocation of any provision in or appendix to this part or chapter or of any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license issued by OFAC does not affect any act done or omitted, or any civil or criminal proceeding commenced or pending, prior to such amendment, modification, or revocation. All penalties, forfeitures, and liabilities under any such regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license continue and may be enforced as if such amendment, modification, or revocation had not been made.
§ 528.403
Termination and acquisition of an interest in blocked property.
(a) Whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to this part results in the transfer of property (including any property interest) away from a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 528.201, such property shall no longer be deemed to be property blocked pursuant to § 528.201, unless there exists in the property another interest that is blocked pursuant to § 528.201, the transfer of which has not been effected pursuant to license or other authorization.
(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part, if property (including any property interest)
is transferred or attempted to be transferred to a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 528.201, such property shall be deemed to be property in which such person has an interest and therefore blocked.
§ 528.404
Transactions ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction.
Any transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction and necessary to give effect thereto is also authorized, except:
(a) An ordinarily incident transaction, not explicitly authorized within the terms of the license, by or with a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 528.201; or
(b) An ordinarily incident transaction, not explicitly authorized within the terms of the license, involving a debit to a blocked account or a transfer of blocked property.
§ 528.405
Setoffs prohibited.
A setoff against blocked property (including a blocked account), whether by a U.S. financial institution or other U.S. person, is a prohibited transfer under § 528.201 if effected after the effective date.
§ 528.406
Entities owned by one or more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked.
Persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 528.201 have an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which such persons directly or indirectly own, whether individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 528.201, regardless of whether the name of the entity is incorporated into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List).

# Subpart E—Licenses, Authorizations, and Statements of Licensing Policy
§ 528.501
General and specific licensing procedures.
For provisions relating to licensing procedures, see part 501, subpart E, of this chapter. Licensing actions taken pursuant to part 501 of this chapter with respect to the prohibitions contained in this part are considered actions taken pursuant to this part. General licenses and statements of licensing policy relating to this part also may be available through the International Criminal Court-Related sanctions page on OFAC's website:
https://ofac.treasury.gov.
§ 528.502
Effect of license or other authorization.
(a) No license or other authorization contained in this part, or otherwise issued by OFAC, authorizes or validates any transaction effected prior to the issuance of such license or other authorization, unless specifically provided in such license or authorization.
(b) No regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license authorizes any transaction prohibited under this part unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license is issued by OFAC and specifically refers to this part. No regulation, ruling, instruction, or license referring to this part shall be deemed to authorize any transaction prohibited by any other part of this chapter unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, or license specifically refers to such part.
(c) Any regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license authorizing any transaction prohibited under this part has the effect of removing a prohibition contained in this part from the transaction, but only to the extent specifically stated by its terms. Unless the regulation, ruling, instruction, order, directive, or license otherwise specifies, such an authorization does not create any right, duty, obligation, claim, or interest in, or with respect to, any property that would not otherwise exist under ordinary principles of law.
(d) Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to supersede the requirements established under any other provision of law or to relieve a person from any requirement to obtain a license or other authorization from another department or agency of the U.S. government in compliance with applicable laws and regulations subject to the jurisdiction of that department or agency. For example, exports of goods, services, or technical data that are not prohibited by this part or that do not require a license by OFAC nevertheless may require authorization by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of State, or other agencies of the U.S. government.
(e) No license or other authorization contained in or issued pursuant to this part authorizes transfers of or payments from blocked property or debits to blocked accounts unless the license or other authorization explicitly authorizes the transfer of or payment from blocked property or the debit to a blocked account.
(f) Any payment relating to a transaction authorized in or pursuant to this part that is routed through the U.S. financial system should reference the relevant OFAC general or specific license authorizing the payment to avoid the blocking or rejection of the transfer.
§ 528.503
Exclusion from licenses.
OFAC reserves the right to exclude any person, property, transaction, or class thereof from the operation of any license or from the privileges conferred by any license. OFAC also reserves the right to restrict the applicability of any license to particular persons, property, transactions, or classes thereof. Such actions are binding upon actual or constructive notice of the exclusions or restrictions.
§ 528.504
Payments and transfers to blocked accounts in U.S. financial institutions.
Any payment of funds or transfer of credit in which a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 528.201 has any interest that comes within the possession or control of a U.S. financial institution must be blocked in an account on the books of that financial institution. A transfer of funds or credit by a U.S. financial institution between blocked accounts in its branches or offices is authorized, provided that no transfer is made from an account within the United States to an account held outside the United States, and further provided that a transfer from a blocked account may be made only to another blocked account held in the same name.

# Note 1 to § 528.504.
See
§ 501.603 of this chapter for mandatory reporting requirements regarding financial transfers.
See also
§ 528.203 concerning the obligation to hold blocked funds in interest-bearing accounts.
§ 528.505
Entries in certain accounts for normal service charges.
(a) A U.S. financial institution is authorized to debit any blocked account held at that financial institution in payment or reimbursement for normal service charges owed it by the owner of that blocked account.
(b) As used in this section, the term
normal service charges
shall include charges in payment or reimbursement for interest due; cable, telegraph, internet, or telephone charges; postage costs; custody fees; small adjustment charges to correct bookkeeping errors; and, but not by way of limitation, minimum balance charges, notary and protest fees, and charges for reference books, photocopies, credit reports, transcripts of statements, registered mail, insurance, stationery and supplies, and other similar items.
§ 528.506
Provision of certain legal services.
(a) The provision of the following legal services to or on behalf of persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 528.201 is authorized, provided that any receipt of payment of professional fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses must be authorized pursuant to § 528.507, which authorizes certain payments for legal services from funds originating outside the United States; via specific license; or otherwise pursuant to this part:
(1) Provision of legal advice and counseling on the requirements of and compliance with the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the
United States, provided that such advice and counseling are not provided to facilitate transactions in violation of this part;
(2) Representation of persons named as defendants in or otherwise made parties to legal, arbitration, or administrative proceedings before any U.S. federal, state, or local court or agency;
(3) Initiation and conduct of legal, arbitration, or administrative proceedings before any U.S. federal, state, or local court or agency;
(4) Representation of persons before any U.S. federal, state, or local court or agency with respect to the imposition, administration, or enforcement of U.S. sanctions against such persons; and
(5) Provision of legal services in any other context in which prevailing U.S. law requires access to legal counsel at public expense.
(b) The provision of any other legal services to or on behalf of persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 528.201, not otherwise authorized in this part, requires the issuance of a specific license.
(c) U.S. persons do not need to obtain specific authorization to provide related services, such as making filings and providing other administrative services, that are ordinarily incident to the provision of services authorized by paragraph (a) of this section. Additionally, U.S. persons who provide services authorized by paragraph (a) of this section do not need to obtain specific authorization to contract for related services that are ordinarily incident to the provision of those legal services, such as those provided by private investigators or expert witnesses, or to pay for such services.
See
§ 528.404.
(d) Entry into a settlement agreement or the enforcement of any lien, judgment, arbitral award, decree, or other order through execution, garnishment, or other judicial process purporting to transfer or otherwise alter or affect property or interests in property blocked pursuant to § 528.201 is prohibited unless licensed pursuant to this part.

# Note 1 to § 528.506:
Pursuant to part 501, subpart E, of this chapter, U.S. persons seeking administrative reconsideration or judicial review of their designation or the blocking of their property and interests in property may apply for a specific license from OFAC to authorize the release of certain blocked funds for the payment of professional fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses for the provision of such legal services where alternative funding sources are not available.

(i) A source within the United States;
(ii) Any source, wherever located, within the possession or control of a U.S. person; or
(iii) Any individual or entity, other than the person on whose behalf the legal services authorized pursuant to § 528.506(a) are to be provided, whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to any part of this chapter or any Executive order or statute.

Records.
Consistent with § 501.601 of this chapter, U.S. persons who receive payments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must retain for ten years from the date of the relevant payment a record that specifies the following for each payment:

Pt. 528, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 528—E.O. 14203 of February 6, 2025

# Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701
et seq.
) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.
) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the International Criminal Court (ICC), as established by the Rome Statute, has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel. The ICC has, without a legitimate basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies, including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel, as neither country is party to the Rome Statute or a member of the ICC. Neither country has ever recognized the ICC's jurisdiction, and both nations are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war. The ICC's recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest. This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel. Furthermore, in 2002, the Congress enacted the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7421
et seq.
) to protect United States military personnel, United States officials, and officials and military personnel of certain allied countries against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party, stating, “In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of the United States to the risk of international criminal prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the President and other senior elected and appointed officials of the United States Government may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court.” (22 U.S.C. 7421(9)).
The United States unequivocally opposes and expects our allies to oppose any ICC actions against the United States, Israel, or any other ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction. The United States remains committed to accountability and to the peaceful cultivation of international order, but the ICC and parties to the Rome Statute must respect the decisions of the United States and other countries not to subject their personnel to the ICC's jurisdiction, consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives.
The United States will impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC's transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members, as their entry into our Nation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.
I therefore determine that any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute protected persons, as defined in section 8(d) of this order, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to address that threat. I hereby determine and order:
Section 1.
(a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
(i) the person listed in the Annex to this order; and
(ii) any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General:
(A) to have directly engaged in any effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute a protected person without consent of that person's country of nationality;
(B) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any activity in subsection (a)(ii)(A) of this section or any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or
(C) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order.
Sec. 2.
I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to address the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 3.
The prohibitions in section 1(a) of this order include:
(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order; and
(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
Sec. 4.
The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order, as well as immediate family members of such aliens, or aliens determined by the Secretary of State to be employed by, or acting as an agent of, the ICC, would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the entry of the person into the United States would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary of State so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person's entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult with the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary of State has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693.
Sec. 5.
Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a report on additional persons that should be included within the scope of section 1 of this order.
Sec. 6.
(a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 7.
Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.
Sec. 8.
For the purposes of this order:
(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;
(b) the term “entity” means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including a foreign branch, subsidiary, or employee of such entity), or any person lawfully in the United States;
(d) the term “protected person” means:
(i) any United States person, unless the United States provides formal consent to ICC jurisdiction over that person or becomes a state party to the Rome Statute, including:
(A) current or former members of the Armed Forces of the United States;
(B) current or former elected or appointed officials of the United States Government; and
(C) any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of the United States Government; and
(ii) any foreign person that is a citizen or lawful resident of an ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction over that person or is not a state party to the Rome Statute, including:
(A) current or former members of the armed forces of such ally of the United States;
(B) current or former elected or appointed government officials of such ally of the United States; and
(C) any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on behalf of such a government;
(e) the term “ally of the United States” means:
(i) a government of a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; or
(ii) a government of a “major non-NATO ally,” as that term is defined by section 2013(7) of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7432(7));
(f) the term “immediate family member” means a spouse or child;
(g) the term “alien” has the meanings given to the term in section 101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)); and
(h) the term “foreign person” means a person that is not a United States person.
Sec. 9.
For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 1 of this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 10.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.
Sec. 11.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 12.
(a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(a) Whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to this part results in the transfer of property (including any property interest) away from Iran or an Iranian entity, such property shall no longer be deemed to be property in which Iran or an Iranian entity has or has had an interest, unless there exists in the property another such interest the transfer of which has not been effected pursuant to license or other authorization.
(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to this part, if property (including any property interest) is transferred to Iran or an Iranian interest, such property shall be deemed to be property in which there exists an interest of Iran or an Iranian entity.

§ 535.416
Letters of credit.
(a)
Question.
Prior to the effective date, a bank subject to the jurisdiction of the United States has issued or confirmed a documentary letter of credit for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian entity. Can payment be made upon presentation of documentary drafts?
Answer.
Yes, provided payment is made into a blocked account in a domestic bank.
(b)
Question.
Prior to the effective date, a domestic branch of a bank organized or incorporated under the laws of the United States has issued or confirmed a documentary letter of credit for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian entity. Payment is to be made through a foreign branch of the bank. Can payment be made upon presentation of documentary drafts?
Answer.
Yes, provided payment is made into a blocked account in a domestic bank.
(c)
Question.
Prior to the effective date, a foreign bank confirms a documentary letter of credit issued by its U.S. agency or branch for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian entity. Can the U.S. agency or branch of the foreign bank transfer
funds to the foreign bank in connection with that foreign bank's payment under the letter of credit?
Answer.
No, the U.S. agency's payment is blocked, unless the foreign bank made payment to the Iranian entity prior to the effective date.
(d)
Question.
Prior to the effective date, a bank subject to the jurisdiction of the United States has issued or confirmed a documentary letter of credit for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian entity. The Iranian entity presents documentry drafts which are deficient in some detail. May the non-Iranian account party waive the documentary deficiency and authorize the bank to make payment?
Answer.
Yes, provided payment is made into a blocked account in a domestic bank. However, the non-Iranian account party is not obligated by these Regulations to exercise a waiver of documentary deficiencies. In cases where such a waiver is not exercised, the bank's payment obligation, if any, under the letter of credit remains blocked, as does any obligation, contingent or otherwise, of the account party. The documents are also blocked.
(e)
Question.
Prior to the effective date, a bank subject to the jurisdiction of the United States has issued or confirmed a documentary letter of credit for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian entity. The Iranian entity does not make timely, complete, or proper presentation of documents, and the letter of credit expires. Does there remain a blocked payment obligation held by the bank?
Answer.
No, but any documents held by the bank continue to be blocked. It is also possible that the account party still has a related obligation to the Iranian entity and any such obligation would be blocked.
(f)
Question.
A bank subject to the jurisdiction of the United States has issued a letter of credit for a U.S. account party in favor of an Iranian entity. The letter of credit is confirmed by a foreign bank. Prior to or after the effective date, the Iranian entity presents documents to the U.S. issuing bank. Payment is deferred. After the effective date, the Iranian entity requests that the issuing bank either return the documents to the Iranian entity or transfer them to the confirming bank. Can the issuing bank do so?
Answer.
No. The U.S. issuing bank can neither return nor transfer the documents without a license. The documents constitute blocked property under the Regulations.
(g)
Question.
Prior to the effective date, a bank subject to the jurisdiction of the United States has issued or confirmed a documentary letter of credit for a non-Iranian account party in favor of an Iranian entity. The Iranian entity presents documentary drafts which are deficient in some detail. May the non-Iranian account party waive the documentary deficiency and make payment?
Answer.
Yes, provided payment is made into a blocked account in a domestic bank. However, the non-Iranian account party is not obligated by these Regulations to exercise a waiver of documentary deficiencies. In cases where such a waiver is not exercised, the amount of the payment held by the account party is blocked.

Standby letters of credit, performance or payment bonds and similar obligations.
(a) Nothing contained in §§ 535.212, 535.213 and 535.214 or in any other provision or revocation or amendment of any provision in this part affects the prohibition in § 535.201 and the licensing procedure in § 535.568 relating to certain standby letters of credit, performance bonds and similar obligations. The term
funds and securities
as used in this part does not include substitute blocked accounts established under section 535.568 relating to standby letters of credit, performance or payment bonds and similar obligations.
(b) No transfer requirement under § 535.213 or § 535.214 shall be deemed to authorize or compel any payment or transfer of any obligation under a standby letter of credit, performance bond or similar obligation as to which a blocked account has been established pursuant to § 535.568 or as to which payment is prohibited under an injunction obtained by the account party.
(Secs. 201-207, 91 Stat. 1626, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706; E.O. 12170, 44 FR 65729; E.O. 12205, 45 FR 24099; E.O. 12211, 45 FR 26685; E.O. 12276, 46 FR 7913; E.O. 12279, 46 FR 7919; E.O. 12280, 46 FR 7921; E.O. 12281, 46 FR 7923; E.O. 12282, 46 FR 7925; E.O. 12283, 46 FR 7927, and E.O. 12294, 46 FR 14111)

§ 535.440
Commercially reasonable interest rates.
(a) For purposes of §§ 535.212 and 535.213, what is meant by “commercially reasonable rates” depends on the particular circumstances. In the case of time or savings deposits, the “commercially reasonable rate” is that rate provided for by the deposit agreement or applicable law. With respect to other obligations where the rate remains to be determined, it is presently expected that the “commercially reasonable rate” will be the rate agreed upon by the bank and Iran. However, where a deposit has in fact operated as a demand account under Treasury license, it would be appropriate to treat the deposit for purposes of §§ 535.212 and 535.213 as a non-interest bearing account. Furthermore, in the event that the Iran-U.S Claims Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) determines that interest additional to that agreed upon between the bank and Iran, or compensation or damages in lieu of interest, is due Iran, then that amount determined by the Tribunal to be owing to Iran shall be transferred as, or as part of, the interest at “commercially reasonable rates” required to be transferred pursuant to §§ 535.212 and 535.213, regardless of any settlement between the bank and Iran or any release or discharge that Iran may have given the bank.
(b) The contingent interest of Iran in any liability for further or additional interest, or compensation or damages in lieu of interest, that may be claimed in, and determined by the Tribunal, constitutes an interest of Iran in property for purposes of this part, and no agreement between Iran and any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is effective to extinguish
such Iranian interest in property unless so specifically licensed by the Treasury Department.
(c) For deposits held as time deposits, no penalty shall be imposed for early withdrawal. (In this connection, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has determined that application of the penalty for early withdrawal of time deposits transferred before maturity, pursuant to § 535.213 is not required.)

In accordance with § 535.222(f), upon payment from the Security Account to the United States, the Settlement Agreement shall operate as a final resolution and discharge of all claims encompassed by the Settlement Agreement for all purposes. All such claims shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission on the terms established in the Settlement Agreement and by the provisions of Public Law 99-93, Title V, Aug. 16, 1985, 99 Stat. 437, applicable to en bloc settlements of claims of U.S. nationals against Iran.

(i) A person receiving a specific license under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall certify to the Office of Foreign Assets Control within five business days after receipt of that license that it has established the blocked account on its books as provided for in those paragraphs. However, in appropriate cases, this time may be extended upon application to the Office of Foreign Assets Control when the account party has filed a petition with an appropriate court seeking a judicial order barring payment by the issuing or confirming bank.
(j) The extension or renewal of a standby letter of credit is authorized.
(k) All specific licenses previously issued under this section to account parties to standby letters of credit are revoked, effective February 28, 1991, unless the license holder submits documentation to the Office of Foreign Assets Control establishing that the specific license pertains to a standby letter of credit obligation that (1) is at issue in any claim brought before the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (“Tribunal”), (2) is or was at issue in any claim that the Tribunal resolves, or has resolved, on the merits in favor of the account party, or (3) was at issue in a matter that was settled by the parties.

§ 536.403
Termination and acquisition of an interest in blocked property.
(a) Whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to this part results in the transfer of property (including any property interest) away from a specially designated narcotics trafficker, such property shall no longer be deemed to be property in which a specially designated narcotics trafficker has or has had an interest, or which is held in the name of a specially designated narcotics trafficker, unless there exists in the property another interest of a specially designated narcotics trafficker, the transfer of which has not been effected pursuant to license or other authorization.
(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part, if property (including any property interest) is transferred or attempted to be transferred to a specially designated narcotics trafficker, such property shall be deemed to be property in which there exists an interest of the specially designated narcotics trafficker.
§ 536.404
Setoffs prohibited.
A setoff against blocked property (including a blocked account), whether by a U.S. bank or other U.S. person, is a prohibited transfer under § 536.201 if effected after the effective date.
§ 536.405
Transactions incidental to a licensed transaction.
Any transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction and necessary to give effect thereto is also authorized, except a transaction by an unlicensed, specially designated narcotics trafficker or involving a debit to a blocked account or a transfer of blocked property not explicitly authorized within the terms of the license.
§ 536.406
Provision of services.
(a) The prohibitions on transactions contained in § 536.201 apply to services performed in the United States or by U.S. persons, wherever located, including by a foreign branch of an entity located in the United States:
(1) On behalf of or for the benefit of a specially designated narcotics trafficker; or
(2) With respect to property interests of a specially designated narcotics trafficker.

§ 536.408
Alleged change in ownership or control of an entity designated as a specially designated narcotics trafficker.
(a) A change or alleged change in ownership or control of an entity designated as a specially designated narcotics trafficker shall not be the basis for removal of that entity from the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List unless, upon investigation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and submission of evidence by the entity, it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control
that the transfer to a bona fide purchaser at arm's length is legitimate and that the entity no longer meets the criteria for designation under § 536.312. Evidence submitted must conclusively demonstrate that all ties with other specially designated narcotics traffickers have been completely severed, and may include, but is not limited to, articles of incorporation; identification of new directors, officers, shareholders, and sources of capital; and contracts evidencing the sale of the entity to its new owners.
(b) Any continuing substantial financial obligations on the part of the new owners to any specially designated narcotics traffickers, including long-term payment plans, leases, or rents, will be considered as evidence of continuing control of the entity by the specially designated narcotics trafficker. Purchase of a designated entity without ongoing substantial financial obligations to a specially designated narcotics trafficker may nonetheless be a basis for subsequent designation of the purchaser, if the transaction is determined materially to assist in or provide financial support for the narcotics trafficking activities of specially designated narcotics traffickers for purposes of § 536.312(b)(2). For example, any acquisition transaction resulting in a direct cash transfer to or other enrichment of a specially designated narcotics trafficker could lead to designation of the purchaser. Mere change in name of an entity will not be considered as constituting a change of the entity's status.
