(i) For each dioxin and furan congener, multiply the congener concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in table 38 to this subpart. For determination of toxic equivalency, zero may be used for congeners with a concentration less than the estimated detection limit (EDL). For congeners with estimated maximum pollutant concentration (EMPC) results, if the value is less than the EDL, zero may be used. Otherwise, the EMPC value must be used in the calculation of toxic equivalency.
(ii) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins and furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
(6) The concentration of dioxins and furans shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen. Use Method 3A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or the manual method in ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) to determine the oxygen concentration (%O2d). The oxygen concentration must be determined concurrently with Method 23 of appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter. The concentration corrected to 3 percent oxygen (Cc) shall be computed using the following equation:

§ 63.138
Process wastewater provisions—performance standards for treatment processes managing Group 1 wastewater streams and/or residuals removed from Group 1 wastewater streams.
(a)
General requirements.
This section specifies the performance standards for treating Group 1 wastewater streams. The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section. Where multiple compliance options are provided, the options may be used in combination for different wastewater streams and/or for different compounds (e.g., Table 8 versus Table 9 compounds) in the same wastewater streams, except where otherwise provided in this section. Once a Group 1 wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream has been treated in accordance with this subpart, it is no longer subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(1)
Existing source.
If the wastewater stream, at an existing source, is Group 1 for Table 9 compounds, comply with § 63.138(b).
(2)
New source.
If the wastewater stream, at a new source, is Group 1 for Table 8 compounds, comply with § 63.138(c). If the wastewater stream, at a new source, is Group 1 for Table 9 compounds, comply with § 63.138(b). If the wastewater stream, at a new source, is Group 1 for Table 8 and Table 9 compounds, comply with both § 63.138(b) and § 63.138(c).

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(2):
The requirements for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds are similar and often identical.
(3)
Biological treatment processes.
Biological treatment processes in compliance with this section may be either open or closed biological treatment processes as defined in § 63.111. An open biological treatment process in compliance with this section need not be covered and vented to a control device as required in § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart. An open or a closed biological treatment process in compliance with this section and using § 63.145(f) or § 63.145(g) of this subpart to demonstrate compliance is not subject to the requirements of § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart. A closed biological treatment process in compliance with this section and using § 63.145(e) of this subpart to demonstrate compliance shall comply with the requirements of § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart. Waste management units upstream of an open or closed biological treatment process shall meet the requirements of § 63.133 through § 63.137 of this subpart, as applicable.
(4)
Performance tests and design evaluations.
If design steam stripper option (§ 63.138(d)) or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) option (§ 63.138(h)) is selected to comply with this section, neither a design evaluation nor a performance test is required. For any other non-biological treatment process, and for closed biological treatment processes as defined in § 63.111 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation as specified in § 63.138(j), or a performance test as specified in § 63.145, of this subpart. For each open biological treatment process as defined in § 63.111 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test as specified in § 63.145 of this subpart.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(4):
Some open biological treatment processes may not require a performance test. Refer to § 63.145(h) and table 36 of this subpart to determine whether the biological treatment process meets the criteria that exempt the owner or operator from conducting a performance test.

§ 63.144
Process wastewater provisions—test methods and procedures for determining applicability and Group 1/Group 2 determinations (determining which wastewater streams require control).
(a)
Procedures to determine applicability.
An owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section for each wastewater stream to determine which wastewater streams require control for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds. The owner or operator may use a combination of the approaches in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section for different wastewater streams generated at the source.
(1)
Determine Group 1 or Group 2 status.
Determine whether a wastewater stream is a Group 1 or Group 2 wastewater stream in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(2)
Designate as Group 1.
An owner or operator may designate as a Group 1 wastewater stream a single wastewater stream or a mixture of wastewater streams. The owner or operator is not required to determine the concentration or flow rate for each designated Group 1 wastewater stream for the purposes of this section.
(b)
Procedures to establish concentrations, when determining Group status under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
An owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine the annual average concentration for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section for existing sources or paragraph (b)(2) of this section for new sources. The annual average concentration shall be a flow weighted average representative of actual or anticipated operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit generating the wastewater over a designated 12 month period. For flexible operation units, the owner or operator shall consider the anticipated production over the designated 12 month period and include all wastewater streams generated by the process equipment during this period. The owner/operator is not required to determine the concentration of Table 8 or Table 9 compounds that are not reasonably expected to be in the process.
(1)
Existing sources.
An owner or operator of an existing source who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine the flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds. For the purposes of this section, the term concentration, whether concentration is used alone or with other terms, may be adjusted by multiplying by the compound-specific fraction measured (Fm) factors listed in table 34 of this subpart unless determined by the methods in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A) and/or (B). When concentration is determined by Method 305 as specified in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(B), concentration may be adjusted by dividing by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. When concentration is determined by Method 25D as specified in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A), concentration may not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. Compound-specific Fm factors may be used only when concentrations of individual compounds are determined or when only one compound is in the wastewater stream. Flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds means the total mass of Table 9 compounds occurring in the wastewater stream during the designated 12-month period divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream during the same designated 12-month period. The total annual average concentration shall be determined for each wastewater stream either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration changes made according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. The procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section are considered acceptable procedures for determining the annual average concentration. They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.
(2)
New sources.
An owner or operator of a new source who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine both the flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds and the flow weighted annual average concentration for each Table 8 compound. For the purposes of this section, the term concentration, whether concentration is used alone or with other terms, may be adjusted by multiplying by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart unless determined by the methods in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A) and/or (B). When concentration is determined by Method 305 as specified in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(B), concentration may be adjusted by dividing by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. When concentration is determined by Method 25D as specified in § 63.144(b)(5)(i)(A), concentration may not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factors listed in table 34 of this subpart. Compound-specific fraction measured factors are compound specific and shall be used only when concentration of individual compounds are determined or when only one compound is in the wastewater stream. The flow weighted annual average concentration of each Table 8 compound means the mass of each Table 8 compound occurring in the wastewater stream during the designated 12-month period divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream during the same designated 12-month
period. Flow weighted total annual average concentration for Table 9 compounds means the total mass of Table 9 compounds occurring in the wastewater stream during the designated 12-month period divided by the total mass of the wastewater stream during the same designated 12-month period. The annual average concentration shall be determined for each wastewater stream either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration changes made according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section are considered acceptable procedures for determining the annual average concentration. They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.
(3)
Knowledge of the wastewater.
Where knowledge is used to determine the annual average concentration, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the annual average concentration for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average concentration is not required for Group 1 streams. Examples of acceptable documentation include material balances, records of chemical purchases, process stoichiometry, or previous test results. If test data are used, the owner or operator shall provide documentation describing the testing protocol and the means by which any losses of volatile compounds during sampling, and the bias and accuracy of the analytical method, were accounted for in the determination.
(4)
Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data.
Where bench-scale or pilot-scale test data are used to determine the annual average concentration, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document that the data are representative of the actual annual average concentration, or are reliably indicative of another relevant characteristic of the wastewater stream that could be used to predict the annual average concentration. For concentration data, the owner or operator shall also provide documentation describing the testing protocol, and the means by which any losses of volatile compounds during sampling, and the bias and accuracy of the analytical method, were accounted for in the determination of annual average concentration.
(5)
Test data from sampling at the point of determination or at a location downstream of the point of determination.
Where an owner or operator elects to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section by measuring the concentration for the relevant Table 8 or Table 9 compounds, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph. For each wastewater stream, measurements shall be made either at the point of determination, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration changes made according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. A minimum of three samples from each wastewater stream shall be taken. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples.

The sample plan shall include procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the relevant hazardous air pollutants listed in table 8 or table 9 of this subpart. An example of an acceptable sampling plan would be one that incorporates similar sampling and sample handling requirements to those of Method 25D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The sampling plan shall be maintained at the facility.
(iii)
Validation of methods.
The owner or operator shall validate EPA methods other than Methods 25D, 305, 624, 625, 1624, and 1625 using the procedures specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) or (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section. The owner or operator shall validate other methods as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.
(A)
Validation of EPA methods and other methods.
The method used to measure organic hazardous air pollutants concentrations in the wastewater shall be validated according to section 5.1 or 5.3, and the corresponding calculations in section 6.1 or 6.3, of Method 301 of appendix A of this part. The data are acceptable if they meet the criteria specified in section 6.1.5 or 6.3.3 of Method 301 of appendix A of this part.

(B)
Validation for EPA methods.
Follow the procedures as specified in “Alternative Validation Procedure for EPA Waste Methods” 40 CFR part 63, appendix D.
(iv)
Calculations of average concentration.
The average concentration for each individually speciated Table 8 compound shall be calculated by adding the individual values determined for the specific compound in each sample and dividing by the number of samples. The total average concentration of Table 9 compounds shall be calculated by first summing the concentration of the individual compounds to obtain a total hazardous air pollutants concentration for the sample; add the sample totals and then divide by the number of samples in the run to obtain the sample average for the run. If the method used does not speciate the compounds, the sample results should be added and this total divided by the number of samples in the run to obtain the sample average for the run.
(6)
Adjustment for concentrations determined downstream of the point of determination.
The owner or operator shall make corrections to the annual average concentration or total annual average concentration when the concentration is determined downstream of the point of determination at a location where: two or more wastewater streams have been mixed; one or more wastewater streams have been treated; or, losses to the atmosphere have occurred. The owner or operator shall
make the adjustments either to the individual data points or to the final annual average concentration.
(c)
Procedures to determine flow rate, when evaluating Group status under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
An owner or operator who elects to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall determine the annual average flow rate of the wastewater stream either at the point of determination for each wastewater stream, or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for flow rate changes made according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. These procedures may be used in combination for different wastewater streams at the source. The annual average flow rate for the wastewater stream shall be representative of actual or anticipated operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit generating the wastewater over a designated 12-month period. The owner or operator shall consider the total annual wastewater volume generated by the chemical manufacturing process unit. If the chemical manufacturing process unit is a flexible operation unit, the owner or operator shall consider all anticipated production in the process equipment over the designated 12-month period. The procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section are considered acceptable procedures for determining the flow rate. They may be used in combination, and no one procedure shall take precedence over another.
(1)
Knowledge of the wastewater.
The owner or operator may use knowledge of the wastewater stream and/or the process to determine the annual average flow rate. The owner or operator shall use the maximum expected annual average production capacity of the process unit, knowledge of the process, and/or mass balance information to either: Estimate directly the annual average wastewater flow rate; or estimate the total annual wastewater volume and then divide total volume by 525,600 minutes in a year. Where knowledge is used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.
(2)
Historical records.
The owner or operator may use historical records to determine the annual average flow rate. Derive the highest annual average flow rate of wastewater from historical records representing the most recent 5 years of operation or, if the process unit has been in service for less than 5 years but at least 1 year, from historical records representing the total operating life of the process unit. Where historical records are used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.
(3)
Measurements of flow rate.
Where an owner or operator elects to comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section by measuring the flow rate, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph. Measurements shall be made at the point of determination, or at a location downstream of the point of determination with adjustments for flow rate changes made according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Where measurement data are used to determine the annual average flow rate, the owner or operator shall provide sufficient information to document the flow rate for wastewater streams determined to be Group 2 wastewater streams. Documentation to determine the annual average flow rate is not required for Group 1 streams.
(4)
Adjustment for flow rates determined downstream of the point of determination.
The owner or operator shall make corrections to the annual average flow rate of a wastewater stream when it is determined downstream of the point of determination at a location where two or more wastewater streams have been mixed or one or more wastewater streams have been treated. The owner or operator shall make corrections for such changes in the annual average flow rate.

§ 63.145
Process wastewater provisions—test methods and procedures to determine compliance.
(a)
General.
This section specifies the procedures for performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a treatment process or a control device with the control requirements specified in § 63.138 of this subpart. Owners or operators conducting a design evaluation shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. Owners or operators conducting a performance test shall comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section.
(1)
Performance tests and design evaluations for treatment processes.
If design steam stripper option (§ 63.138(d)) or RCRA option (§ 63.138(h)) is selected to comply with § 63.138, neither a design evaluation nor a performance test is required. For any other non-biological treatment process, the owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation as specified in § 63.138(j), or a performance test as specified in this section. For closed biological treatment processes, the owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation as specified in § 63.138(j), or a performance test as specified in this section. For each open biological treatment process, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test as specified in this section.

# Note:
Some open biological treatment processes may not require a performance test. Refer to § 63.145(h) and table 36 of this subpart to determine whether the biological treatment process meets the criteria that exempt the owner or operator from conducting a performance test.
(2)
Performance tests and design evaluations for control devices.
The owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation as specified in § 63.139(d), or a performance test as specified in paragraph (i) of this section for control devices other than flares and paragraph (j) of this section for flares.
(3)
Representative process unit operating conditions.
Except as specified in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, compliance shall be demonstrated for representative operating conditions. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction and periods of nonoperation shall not constitute representative conditions. The owner or operator shall record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test.
(4)
Representative treatment process or control device operating conditions.
Performance tests shall be conducted when the treatment process or control device is operating at a representative inlet flow rate and concentration. If the treatment process or control device will be operating at several different sets of representative operating conditions, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section. The owner or operator shall record information that is necessary to document treatment process or control device operating conditions during the test.
(i)
Range of operating conditions.
If the treatment process or control device will be operated at several different sets of representative operating conditions, performance testing over the entire range is not required. In such cases, the performance test results shall be supplemented with modeling and/or engineering assessments to demonstrate performance over the operating range.
(ii)
Consideration of residence time.
If concentration and/or flow rate to the treatment process or control device are not relatively constant (i.e., comparison of inlet and outlet data will not be representative of performance), the owner or operator shall consider residence time, when determining concentration and flow rate.
(5)
Testing equipment.
All testing equipment shall be prepared and installed as specified in the applicable test methods, or as approved by the Administrator.
(6)
Compounds not required to be considered in performance tests or design evaluations.
Compounds that meet the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i), (a)(6)(ii), or (a)(6)(iii) of this section are not required to be included in the performance test. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 shall be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method
305 shall not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart.
(i) Compounds not used or produced by the chemical manufacturing process unit; or
(ii) Compounds with concentrations at the point of determination that are below 1 part per million by weight; or
(iii) Compounds with concentrations at the point of determination that are below the lower detection limit where the lower detection limit is greater than 1 part per million by weight. The method shall be an analytical method for wastewater which has that compound as a target analyte.
(7)
Treatment using a series of treatment processes.
In all cases where the wastewater provisions in this subpart allow or require the use of a treatment process to comply with emissions limitations, the owner or operator may use multiple treatment processes. The owner or operator complying with the requirements of § 63.138(a)(7)(i), when wastewater is conveyed by hard-piping, shall comply with either §§ 63.145(a)(7)(i) or 63.145(a)(7)(ii) of this subpart. The owner or operator complying with the requirements of § 63.138(a)(7)(ii) of this subpart shall comply with the requirements of § 63.145(a)(7)(ii) of this subpart.
(i) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test across each series of treatment processes. For each series of treatment processes, inlet concentration and flow rate shall be measured either where the wastewater stream enters the first treatment process in a series of treatment processes, or prior to the first treatment process as specified in § 63.145(a)(9) of this subpart. For each series of treatment processes, outlet concentration and flow rate shall be measured where the wastewater stream exits the last treatment process in the series of treatment processes, except when the last treatment process is an open or a closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating compliance by using the procedures in § 63.145 (f) or (g) of this subpart. When the last treatment process is either an open or a closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating compliance by using the procedures in § 63.145 (f) or (g) of this subpart, inlet and outlet concentrations and flow rates shall be measured as provided in paragraphs (a)(7)(i)(A) and (a)(7)(i)(B) of this section. The mass flow rates removed or destroyed by the series of treatment processes and by the biological treatment process are all used to calculate actual mass removal (AMR) as specified in § 63.145(f)(5)(ii) of this subpart.
(A) The inlet and outlet to the series of treatment processes prior to the biological treatment process are the points at which the wastewater enters the first treatment process and exits the last treatment process in the series, respectively, except as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
(B) The inlet to the biological treatment process shall be the point at which the wastewater enters the biological treatment process or the outlet from the series of treatment processes identified in paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
(ii) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test across each treatment process in the series of treatment processes. The mass flow rate removed or destroyed by each treatment process shall be added together to determine whether compliance has been demonstrated using § 63.145 (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g), as applicable. If a biological treatment process is one of the treatment processes in the series of treatment processes, the inlet to the biological treatment process shall be the point at which the wastewater enters the biological treatment process, or the inlet to the equalization tank if all the criteria of paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section are met.
(8) When using a biological treatment process to comply with § 63.138 of this subpart, the owner or operator may elect to calculate the AMR using a subset of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds determined at the point of determination or downstream of the point of determination with adjustment for concentration and flowrate changes made according to § 63.144(b)(6) and § 63.144(c)(4) of this subpart, respectively. All Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds measured to determine the RMR, except as provided by
§ 63.145(a)(6), shall be included in the RMR calculation.
(9) The owner or operator determining the inlet for purposes of demonstrating compliance with § 63.145 (e), (f), or (g) of this subpart may elect to comply with paragraph (a)(9)(i) or (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
(i) When wastewater is conveyed exclusively by hard-piping from the point of determination to a treatment process that is either the only treatment process or the first in a series of treatment processes (i.e., no treatment processes or other waste management units are used upstream of this treatment process to store, handle, or convey the wastewater), the inlet to the treatment process shall be at any location from the point of determination to where the wastewater stream enters the treatment process. When samples are taken upstream of the treatment process and before wastewater streams have converged, the owner or operator shall ensure that the mass flow rate of all Group 1 wastewater streams is accounted for when using § 63.138 (e) or (f) to comply and that the mass flow rate of all Group 1 and Group 2 wastewater streams is accounted for when using § 63.138(g) to comply, except as provided in § 63.145(a)(6).
(ii) The owner or operator may consider the inlet to the equalization tank as the inlet to the biological treatment process if all the criteria in paragraphs (a)(9)(ii)(A) through (a)(9)(ii)(C) of this section are met. The outlet from the series of treatment processes prior to the biological treatment process is the point at which the wastewater exits the last treatment process in the series prior to the equalization tank, if the equalization tank and biological treatment process are part of a series of treatment processes. The owner or operator shall ensure that the mass flow rate of all Group 1 wastewater streams is accounted for when using § 63.138 (e) or (f) to comply and that the mass flow rate of all Group 1 and Group 2 wastewater streams is accounted for when using § 63.138(g) to comply, except as provided in § 63.145(a)(6).
(A) The wastewater is conveyed by hard-piping from either the last previous treatment process or the point of determination to the equalization tank.
(B) The wastewater is conveyed from the equalization tank exclusively by hard-piping to the biological treatment process and no treatment processes or other waste management units are used to store, handle, or convey the wastewater between the equalization tank and the biological treatment process.
(C) The equalization tank is equipped with a fixed roof and a closed vent system that routes emissions to a control device that meets the requirements of § 63.133(a)(2)(i) and § 63.133 (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this subpart.
(10) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), the requirement of paragraph (a)(3) of this section no longer applies. Instead, owners and operators must comply with the conditions specified in § 63.103(b)(3)(ii) of subpart F of this part.
(b)
Noncombustion treatment process—concentration limits.
This paragraph applies to performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a noncombustion treatment process with the parts per million by weight wastewater stream concentration limits at the outlet of the treatment process. This compliance option is specified in § 63.138(b)(1) and § 63.138(c)(1). Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity per § 63.144(b)(5)(ii). Samples shall be collected and analyzed using the procedures specified in § 63.144 (b)(5)(i), (b)(5)(ii), and (b)(5)(iii) of this subpart. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples. Samples shall be taken at approximately equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period. Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and the performance test shall consist of a minimum of 3 runs. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 may be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 34 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method 305 may be adjusted by multiplying
each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in table 34 of this subpart. (For wastewater streams that are Group 1 for both Table 8 and Table 9 compounds, compliance is demonstrated only if the sum of the concentrations of Table 9 compounds is less than 50 ppmw, and the concentration of each Table 8 compound is less than 10 ppmw.)
(c)
Noncombustion, nonbiological treatment process: Percent mass removal/destruction option.
This paragraph applies to performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a noncombustion, nonbiological treatment process with the percent mass removal limits specified in § 63.138(e) (1) and (2) for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds. The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements specified in § 63.145 (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this subpart.
(1)
Concentration.
The concentration of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds entering and exiting the treatment process shall be determined as provided in this paragraph. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity per § 63.144(b)(5)(ii). The method shall be an analytical method for wastewater which has that compound as a target analyte. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples. Samples shall be taken at approximately equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period. Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and the performance test shall consist of a minimum of 3 runs. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 shall be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 34 of this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than Method 305 shall not adjust by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 34 of this subpart.
(2)
Flow rate.
The flow rate of the entering and exiting wastewater streams shall be determined using inlet and outlet flow measurement devices, respectively. Where the outlet flow is not greater than the inlet flow, a flow measurement device shall be used, and may be used at either the inlet or outlet. Flow rate measurements shall be taken at the same time as the concentration measurements.
(3)
Calculation of mass flow rate—for noncombustion, nonbiological treatment processes.
The mass flow rates of Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds entering and exiting the treatment process are calculated as follows.

§ 63.149
Control requirements for certain liquid streams in open systems within a chemical manufacturing process unit.
(a) The owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of table 35 of this subpart, for each item of equipment meeting all the criteria specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) and either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.
(b) The item of equipment is of a type identified in table 35 of this subpart;

[62 FR 2776, Jan. 17, 1997]
§ 63.150
Emissions averaging provisions.
(a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing sources who seek to comply with the emission standard in § 63.112(a) of this subpart by using emissions averaging according to § 63.112(f) of this subpart rather than following the provisions of §§ 63.113 through 63.148 of this subpart. Notwithstanding the definition of process vent in § 63.101 and the sampling site designation in § 63.115(a), for purposes of this section the location of a process vent shall be defined, and the characteristics of its gas stream shall be determined, consistent with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
(b) Unless an operating permit application has been submitted, the owner or operator shall develop and submit
for approval an Implementation Plan containing all of the information required in § 63.151(d) of this subpart for all points to be included in an emissions average. The Implementation Plan or operating permit application shall identify all emission points to be included in the emissions average. This must include any Group 1 emission points to which the reference control technology (defined in § 63.111 of this subpart) is not applied and all other emission points being controlled as part of the average.
(c) The following emission points can be used to generate emissions averaging credits, if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point:
(1) Group 2 emission points.
(2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies must be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
(3) Emission points from which emissions are reduced by pollution prevention measures. Percent reductions for pollution prevention measures shall be determined as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
(i) For a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had the reference control technology been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference control technology, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had it been applied instead.
(d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits:
(1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990, unless the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990, in which case credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990.
(2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a reference control technology, unless the reference control technology has been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section. For example, it is not allowable to claim that an internal floating roof meeting the specifications of § 63.119(b) of this subpart applied to a storage vessel is achieving greater than 95 percent control.
(3) Emission points on shut-down process units. Process units that are shut down cannot be used to generate credits or debits.
(4) Wastewater that is not process wastewater or wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms wastewater and wastewater stream are used to mean process wastewater.
(5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved average.
(e) For all points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall:
(1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that
are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology for those emission points. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits.
(2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 or Group 2 emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits. Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be included.
(3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this section.
(i) The owner or operator may choose to include more than the required number of credit-generating emission points in an average in order to increase the likelihood of being in compliance.
(ii) The initial demonstration in the Implementation Plan or operating permit application that credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating emission points must be made under representative operating conditions. After the compliance date, actual operating data will be used for all debit and credit calculations.
(4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.
(5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the Periodic Reports as specified in § 63.152(c) of this subpart. Every fourth Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the emissions averaging provisions as required by § 63.152(c)(5)(iv)(B) of this subpart.
(f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, respectively, and shall not include emissions from the following:
(1) More than 20 individual Group 1 or Group 2 emission points. Where pollution prevention measures (as specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) are used to control emission points to be included in an emissions average, no more than 25 emission points may be included in the average. For example, if two emission points to be included in an emissions average are controlled by pollution prevention measures, the average may include up to 22 emission points.
(2) Periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction as described in the source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by § 63.6(e)(3). For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, this paragraph no longer applies.
(3) Periods of monitoring excursions as defined in § 63.152(c)(2)(ii)(A) of this subpart. For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
(i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission point.
(ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating emission point.
(iii) The owner or operator may demonstrate to the Administrator that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned using the procedures in paragraph (l) of this section.
(g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology, and the emissions allowed for the Group 1 emission point. Debits shall be calculated as follows:
(1) The overall equation for calculating source-wide debits is:

(i) For pollution prevention measures, the percent reduction used in the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(5) of this section and paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(5) of this section is the percent difference between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced during the two monthly periods.
(ii) The following equation shall be used to calculate the percent reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission point.
ER22AP94.290
where:
Percent reduction = Efficiency of pollution prevention measure (percent organic HAP reduction).
E
B
= Monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, determined as specified in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(A), (j)(2)(ii)(B), and (j)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
E
pp
= Monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month, determined as specified in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(D) or (j)(2)(ii)(E) of this section.
P
B
= Monthly production before the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, during the same period over which E
B
is calculated.
P
pp
= Monthly production after the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month.
(A) The monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, E
B
, shall be determined in a manner consistent with the equations and procedures in paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4) of this section for process vents, storage vessels, and transfer operations.
(B) For wastewater, E
B
shall be calculated as follows:
ER26AP99.011
Where:
n = Number of wastewater streams.
Q
Bi
= Average flow rate for wastewater stream i before the pollution prevention measure, defined and determined according to paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, liters per minute, before implementation of the pollution prevention measure.
H
Bi
= Number of hours per month that wastewater stream i was discharged before the pollution prevention measure, hours per month.
s = Total number of table 9 HAP in wastewater stream i.
Fe
m
= Fraction emitted of table 9 HAP m in wastewater of this subpart, dimensionless.
HAP
Bim
= Average concentration of table 9 HAP m in wastewater stream i, defined and determined according to paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, before the pollution prevention measure, parts per million by weight, as measured before the implementation of the pollution measure.
(C) If the pollution prevention measure was implemented prior to April 22, 1994, records may be used to determine E
B
.
(D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, E
pp
, may be determined during a performance test or by a design evaluation and documented engineering calculations. Once an emissions-to-production ratio has been established, the ratio can be used to estimate monthly emissions from monthly production records.
(E) For wastewater, E
pp
shall be calculated using the following equation:
ER22AP94.292
where n, Q
ppi
, H
ppi
, s, Fe
m
, and HAP
ppim
are defined and determined as described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section except that Q
ppi
, H
ppi
, and HAP
ppim
shall be determined after the pollution prevention measure has been implemented.
(iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, and other information used to determine the percent reduction achieved by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully documented.
(iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from multiple emission points. In such cases, the percent reduction in emissions for each emission point must be calculated.
(v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(5) of this section, used to calculate credits for emission points controlled more stringently than the reference control technology, the nominal efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is equivalent to the percent reduction of the pollution prevention measure. When a pollution prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of a source is not required to apply to the Administrator for a nominal efficiency and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
(k) The owner or operator must demonstrate that the emissions from the emission points proposed to be included in the average will not result in greater hazard or, at the option of the operating permit authority, greater risk to human health or the environment than if the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in §§ 63.113 through 63.148.

(2) Owners and operators shall provide documentation demonstrating the hazard or risk equivalency of their proposed emissions average in their operating permit application or in their Implementation Plan if an operating permit application has not yet been submitted.
(3) An emissions averaging plan that does not demonstrate hazard or risk equivalency to the satisfaction of the Administrator shall not be approved. The Administrator may require such adjustments to the emissions averaging plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human health or the environment than would result if the emission points were controlled according to §§ 63.113 through 63.148 of this subpart.
(4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration must:
(i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment;
(ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human health or the environment; and
(iii) Meet any requirements set by the Administrator for such demonstrations.
(l) For periods of excursions, an owner or operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(ii) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of excursions in the Periodic Reports as required in § 63.152 of this subpart.
(2) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that other types of monitoring data or engineering calculations are appropriate to establish that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. This demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the Administrator may establish procedures of demonstrating compliance that are acceptable.
(3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the excursion and the other type of monitoring data or engineering calculations to be used to demonstrate that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits.
(4) The Administrator may assign full or partial credit and debits upon review of the information provided.

All periodic reports must contain the company name and address (including county), as well as the beginning and ending dates of the reporting period.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, for an owner or operator of a source complying with the provisions of §§ 63.113 through 63.147 for any emission points, Periodic Reports shall include all information specified in §§ 63.117 and 63.118 for process vents, § 63.122 for storage vessels, §§ 63.129 and 63.130 for transfer operations, and § 63.146 for process wastewater, including reports of each excursion (
i.e.,
each period when a monitored parameter is outside the established range and periods of insufficient monitoring data) using the procedures described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(i) Report the affected sources or equipment, the monitored parameter that was exceeded and the date of each excursion.
(ii) The parameter monitoring data for Group 1 emission points and emission points included in emissions averages that are required to perform continuous monitoring shall be used to determine compliance with the required operating conditions for the monitored control devices or recovery devices. For each excursion as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) through (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, or paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, except for excused excursions described therein, the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied the control in a manner that achieves the required operating conditions and must report the information specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(F) of this section.
(A) An excursion means any of the three cases listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
), or (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section. For a control device or recovery device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
), or (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section, this is considered a single excursion for the control device or recovery device.
(
1
) When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is outside the permitted range.
(
2
) When the period of control device or recovery device operation is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.
(
3
) When the period of control device or recovery device operation is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than one of the hours during the period of operation does not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data.
(
4
) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as used in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
) and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section, if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour. For data compression systems approved under § 63.151(g)(4), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a valid hour of data if there are less than 4 data values recorded during the hour.
(B) The number of excused excursions for each control device or recovery device for each semiannual period is specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) through (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
6
) of this section. This paragraph applies to sources required to submit Periodic Reports semiannually or quarterly. The first semiannual period is the 6-month period starting the date the Notification of Compliance Status is due.
(
1
) For the first semiannual period—six excused excursions.
(
2
) For the second semiannual period—five excused excursions.
(
3
) For the third semiannual period—four excused excursions.
(
4
) For the fourth semiannual period—three excused excursions.
(
5
) For the fifth semiannual period—two excused excursions.
(
6
) For the sixth and all subsequent semiannual periods—one excused excursion.
(C) A monitored parameter that is outside its established range or monitoring data that are not collected are excursions. However, if the conditions in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) or
(c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section are met, these excursions are not violations and do not count toward the number of excused excursions for determining compliance.
(
1
)
Periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
During periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction when the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 63.102(a)(4). For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, this paragraph no longer applies.
(
2
)
Periods of nonoperation.
During periods of nonoperation of the chemical manufacturing process unit, or portion thereof, that results in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.
(D) Nothing in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall be construed to allow or excuse a monitoring parameter excursion caused by any activity that violates other applicable provisions of subpart A, F, or G of this part.
(E) Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, except paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, shall apply only to emission points and control devices or recovery devices for which continuous monitoring is required by §§ 63.113 through 63.150.

(g) For any parameter with respect to any item of equipment, the owner or operator may implement the recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section as alternatives to the continuous operating parameter monitoring and recordkeeping provisions listed in §§ 63.114, 63.117, and 63.118 for process vents, §§ 63.127, 63.129, and 63.130 for transfer operations, §§ 63.143, 63.146, and 63.147 for wastewater, and/or § 63.152(f), except that § 63.152(f)(7) shall apply. The owner or operator shall retain each record required by paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section as provided in § 63.103(c) of subpart F of this part, except as provided otherwise in paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average value, and is not required to retain more frequent monitored operating parameter values, for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section are met. An owner or operator electing to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of Compliance Status or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, in the periodic report immediately preceding implementation of the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or impossible data during periods of operation other than startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions (
e.g.,
a temperature reading of −200 °C on a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence. For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, the phrase “other than startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions (
e.g.,
a temperature reading of −200 °C on a boiler),” in this paragraph no longer applies.
(ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly throughout each operating day, a running average of the monitoring values that have been obtained during that operating day, and the capability to observe this average is readily available to the Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. All instances in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
(A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum established limits;
(B) The running average is based on at least 6 1-hour average values; and
(C) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a startup, shutdown, or malfunction. For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, the phrase “other than a startup, shutdown, or malfunction” in this paragraph no longer applies.
(iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data during periods of operation other than startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (
e.g.,
pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence. For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, the phrase “other than startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions” in this paragraph no longer applies.
(iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an alarm or other means, if the running average parameter value calculated under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is being monitored.
(v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, at the times specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(v)(A) through (C) of this section. The owner or operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.
(A) Upon initial installation.
(B) Annually after initial installation.
(C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting the monitoring system, which might reasonably be expected to alter the monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this section.
(vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in paragraphs (g)(1)(vi)(A) through (C) of this section.
(A) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
(B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and of how compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraph (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(v) of this section. The description shall include monitoring equipment manufacturer(s) and model number(s) and the pollutant or parameter monitored, and identify the location and format (
e.g.,
on-line storage; log entries) for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded description. The description, and the most recent superseded description, shall be retained as provided in § 63.103(c) of subpart F of this part, except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
(C) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring system that would reasonably be expected to affect its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(D) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (g)(1)(vi)(B) of this section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as long as the description is current, but not less than 5 years from the date of its creation. The current description shall, at all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded description at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded description shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer that provides access within 2 hours after a request) at least 6 months after its creation. Thereafter, the superseded description may be stored off-site.
(2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average value for that parameter for that unit of equipment, for any operating day when the daily average value is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and the monitoring was required and/or approved by the Administrator.
(i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next periodic report. The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment.
(ii) If, on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased recording daily averages as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the daily average value for each day, and shall notify the Administrator in the next periodic report. The owner or operator shall continue to retain each daily average value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section.
(iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (g)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section. For any calendar week, if compliance with paragraphs (g)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of operation other than a startup, shutdown,
or malfunction. For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, the phrase “other than a startup, shutdown, or malfunction” in this paragraph no longer applies.
(iv) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, an excursion means that the daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section.
(A) The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), if the owner or operator operates the source during such periods in accordance with § 63.102(a)(4). For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, this paragraph no longer applies.
(B) An excused excursion, as described in § 63.152(c)(2)(ii)(B) and (C), shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2).
(h) Beginning no later than July 15, 2024, owners and operators must submit performance test reports in accordance with this paragraph. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test required by this subpart, owners and operators must submit the results of the performance test following the procedures specified in § 63.9(k). Data collected using test methods supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed on the EPA's ERT website (ht

§ 63.162
Standards: General.
(a) Compliance with this subpart will be determined by review of the records required by § 63.181 of this subpart and the reports required by § 63.182 of this subpart, review of performance test results, and by inspections.
(b)(1) An owner or operator may request a determination of alternative means of emission limitation to the requirements of §§ 63.163 through 63.170, and §§ 63.172 through 63.174 of this subpart as provided in § 63.177.
(2) If the Administrator makes a determination that a means of emission limitation is a permissible alternative to the requirements of §§ 63.163 through 63.170, and §§ 63.172 through 63.174 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall comply with the alternative.
(c) Each piece of equipment in a process unit to which this subpart applies shall be identified such that it can be distinguished readily from equipment that is not subject to this subpart. Identification of the equipment does not require physical tagging of the equipment. For example, the equipment may be identified on a plant site plan, in log entries, or by designation of process unit boundaries by some form of weatherproof identification.
(d) Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the requirements of this subpart.
(e) Equipment that is in organic HAP service less than 300 hours per calendar year is excluded from the requirements of §§ 63.163 through 63.174 of this subpart and § 63.178 of this subpart if it is identified as required in § 63.181(j) of this subpart.
(f) When each leak is detected as specified in §§ 63.163 and 63.164; §§ 63.168 and 63.169; and §§ 63.172 through 63.174 of this subpart, the following requirements apply:
(1) Clearly identify the leaking equipment.
(2) The identification on a valve may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in §§ 63.168(f)(3), and 63.175(e)(7)(i)(D) of this subpart, and no leak has been detected during the follow-up monitoring. If the owner or operator elects to comply using the provisions of § 63.174(c)(1)(i) of this subpart, the identification on a connector may be removed after it is monitored as specified in § 63.174(c)(1)(i) and no leak is detected during that monitoring.
(3) The identification which has been placed on equipment determined to have a leak, except for a valve or for a connector that is subject to the provisions of § 63.174(c)(1)(i), may be removed after it is repaired.
(g) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, all terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual), refer to the standard calendar periods unless specified otherwise in the section or subsection that imposes the requirement.
(1) If the initial compliance date does not coincide with the beginning of the standard calendar period, an owner or operator may elect to utilize a period beginning on the compliance date, or may elect to comply in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this section.
(2) Time periods specified in this subpart for completion of required tasks may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part. For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section, where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date does not coincide with the beginning of the calendar period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) or (g)(3)(ii) of this section, as appropriate.
(i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or
(ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs.
(4) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during each period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.
(h) In all cases where the provisions of this subpart require an owner or operator to repair leaks by a specified time after the leak is detected, it is a violation of this subpart to fail to take action to repair the leaks within the specified time. If action is taken to repair the leaks within the specified time, failure of that action to successfully repair the leak is not a violation of this subpart. However, if the repairs are unsuccessful, a leak is detected and the owner or operator shall take further action as required by applicable provisions of this subpart.

(C) Notifying operators immediately that a pressure release is occurring. The device or monitoring system must be either specific to the pressure relief device itself or must be associated with the process system or piping, sufficient to indicate a pressure release to the atmosphere. Examples of these types of devices and systems include, but are not limited to, a rupture disk indicator, magnetic sensor, motion detector on the pressure relief valve stem, flow monitor, or pressure monitor.
(ii) Owners and operators must apply at least three redundant prevention measures to each affected pressure relief device and document these measures. Examples of prevention measures include:
(A) Flow, temperature, liquid level and pressure indicators with deadman switches, monitors, or automatic actuators. Independent, non-duplicative systems within this category count as separate redundant prevention measures.
(B) Documented routine inspection and maintenance programs and/or operator training (maintenance programs and operator training may count as only one redundant prevention measure).
(C) Inherently safer designs or safety instrumentation systems.
(D) Deluge systems.
(E) Staged relief system where the initial pressure relief device (with lower set release pressure) discharges to a flare or other closed vent system and control device.
(iii) If any affected pressure relief device releases to atmosphere as a result of a pressure release event, owners and operators must perform root cause analysis and corrective action analysis according to the requirement in paragraph (e)(6) of this section and implement corrective actions according to the requirements in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. Owners and operators must also calculate the quantity of organic HAP released during each pressure release event and report this quantity as required in § 63.182(d)(2)(xviii). Calculations may be based on data from the pressure relief device monitoring alone or in combination with process parameter monitoring data and process knowledge.
(iv) Owners and operators must determine the total number of release
events that occurred during the calendar year for each affected pressure relief device separately.
(v) Except for pressure relief devices described in paragraphs (e)(4) and (5) of this section, the following release events from an affected pressure relief device are a violation of the pressure release management work practice standards.
(A) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(D) of this section, any release event for which the root cause of the event was determined to be operator error or poor maintenance.
(B) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(D) of this section, a second release event from a single pressure relief device in a 3 calendar year period for the same root cause for the same equipment.
(C) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(D) of this section, a third release event from a single pressure relief device in a 3 calendar year period for any reason.
(D) Paragraphs (e)(3)(v)(A) through (e)(3)(v)(C) of this section do not apply to pressure relief devices in ethylene oxide service, as defined in § 63.101; instead, any release event from an affected pressure relief device in ethylene oxide service is a violation of the pressure release management work practice standards.
(4)

(6)
Root cause analysis and corrective action analysis.
A root cause analysis and corrective action analysis must be completed as soon as possible, but no later than 45 days after a release event. Special circumstances affecting the number of root cause analyses and/or corrective action analyses are provided in paragraphs (e)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Owners and operators may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single emergency event that causes two or more pressure relief devices installed on the same equipment to release.
(ii) [Reserved]
(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section, if more than one pressure relief device has a release during the same time period, an initial root cause analysis must be conducted separately for each pressure relief device that had a release. If the initial root cause analysis indicates that the release events have the same root cause(s), the initially separate root cause analyses may be recorded as a single root cause analysis and a single corrective action analysis may be conducted.
(7)
Corrective action implementation.
Owners and operators must conduct a root cause analysis and corrective action analysis as specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) and (e)(6) of this section, and owners and operators must implement the corrective action(s) identified in
the corrective action analysis in accordance with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (e)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) All corrective action(s) must be implemented within 45 days of the event for which the root cause and corrective action analyses were required or as soon thereafter as practicable. If the owner or operator concludes that no corrective action should be implemented, the owner or operator must record and explain the basis for that conclusion no later than 45 days following the event.
(ii) For corrective actions that cannot be fully implemented within 45 days following the event for which the root cause and corrective action analyses were required, owners and operators must develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable.
(iii) No later than 45 days following the event for which a root cause and corrective action analyses were required, owners and operators must record the corrective action(s) completed to date, and, for action(s) not already completed, a schedule for implementation, including proposed commencement and completion dates.

(2) For new sources, within the first 12 months after initial start-up or by no later than 12 months after the date of promulgation of a specific subpart that references this subpart, whichever is later, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors, except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section.
(3) After conducting the initial survey required in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall perform all subsequent monitoring of connectors at the frequencies specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(v) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(vi) and (c)(2) of this section:
(i) Once per year (i.e., 12-month period), if the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was 0.5 percent or greater during the last required annual or biennial monitoring period.
(ii) Once every 2 years, if the percent leaking connectors was less than 0.5 percent during the last required monitoring period. An owner or operator may comply with this paragraph by monitoring at least 40 percent of the connectors in the first year and the remainder of the connectors in the second year. The percent leaking connectors will be calculated for the total of all monitoring performed during the 2-year period.
(iii) If the owner or operator of a process unit in a biennial leak detection and repair program calculates less than 0.5 percent leaking connectors from the 2-year monitoring period, the owner or operator may monitor the connectors one time every 4 years.

(ii) As an alternative to the requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, an owner or operator may choose not to monitor connectors that have been opened or otherwise had the seal broken. In this case, the owner or operator may not count nonrepairable connectors for the purposes of paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The owner or operator shall calculate the percent leaking connectors for the monitoring periods described in paragraph (b) of this section, by setting the nonrepairable component, C
AN
, in the equation in paragraph (i)(2) of this section to zero for all monitoring periods.
(iii) An owner or operator may switch alternatives described in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section at the end of the current monitoring period he is in, provided that it is reported as required in § 63.182 of this subpart and begin the new alternative in annual monitoring.

If an owner or operator eliminates a connector subject to monitoring under paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator may receive credit for elimination of the connector, as described in paragraph (i) of this section, provided the requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) through (j)(4) are met.
(1) The connector was welded after the date of proposal of the specific subpart that references this subpart.
(2) The integrity of the weld is demonstrated by monitoring it according to the procedures in § 63.180(b) of this subpart or by testing using X-ray, acoustic monitoring, hydrotesting, or other applicable method.
(3) Welds created after the date of proposal but before the date of promulgation of a specific subpart that references this subpart are monitored or tested by 3 months after the compliance date specified in the applicable subpart.
(4) Welds created after promulgation of the subpart that references this subpart are monitored or tested within 3 months after being welded.
(5) If an inadequate weld is found or the connector is not welded completely around the circumference, the connector is not considered a welded connector and is therefore not exempt from the provisions of this subpart.

(ii) Whether the valve is in gas or light liquid service.
(iii) If a leak is detected, the repair methods used and the instrument readings after repair.
(3) The owner or operator shall continue to collect data on the valves as long as the process unit remains in the quality improvement program.
(4) The owner or operator must demonstrate progress in reducing the percent leaking valves each quarter the process unit is subject to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii) and (d)(4)(iii) of this section.
(i) Demonstration of progress shall mean that for each quarter there is at least a 10-percent reduction in the percent leaking valves from the percent leaking valves determined for the preceding monitoring period. The percent leaking valves shall be calculated as a rolling average of two consecutive quarters of monitoring data. The percent reduction shall be calculated using the rolling average percent leaking valves, according to the following:

(ii) An owner or operator who fails for two consecutive rolling averages to demonstrate at least a 10-percent reduction per quarter in percent leaking valves, and whose overall average percent reduction based on two or more rolling averages is less than 10 percent per quarter, shall either comply with the requirements in § 63.168(d)(1)(i) of this subpart using monthly monitoring or shall comply using a quality improvement program for technology review as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. If the owner or operator elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, the schedule for performance trials and valve replacements remains as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
(iii) As an alternative to the provisions in paragraph (d)(4)(i), an owner or operator may use the procedure specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(A) and (d)(4)(iii)(B) of this section to demonstrate progress in reducing the percent leaking valves.
(A) The percent reduction that must be achieved each quarter shall be calculated as follows:

comply with one of the standards specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, or the owner or operator may petition for approval of an alternative standard under the provisions of § 63.177 of this subpart. The alternative standards of this section provide the options of pressure testing or monitoring the equipment for leaks. The owner or operator may switch among the alternatives provided the change is documented as specified in § 63.181.
(b) The following requirements shall be met if an owner or operator elects to use pressure testing of batch product-process equipment to demonstrate compliance with this subpart. An owner or operator who complies with the provisions of this paragraph is exempt from the monitoring provisions of § 63.163, §§ 63.168 and 63.169, and §§ 63.173 through 63.176 of this subpart.
(1) Each time equipment is reconfigured for production of a different product or intermediate, the batch product-process equipment train shall be pressure-tested for leaks before organic HAP is first fed to the equipment and the equipment is placed in organic HAP service.

§ 63.180
Test methods and procedures.
(a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the test methods and procedures requirements provided in this section.
(b) Monitoring, as required under this subpart, shall comply with the following requirements:
(1) Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(2)(i) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in Section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the process fluid not each individual VOC in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, water, air, or other inerts which are not organic HAP's or VOC's, the average stream response factor may be calculated on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted.
(ii) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(4) Calibration gases shall be:
(i) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million of hydrocarbon in air); and
(ii) Mixtures of methane in air at the concentrations specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section. A calibration gas other than methane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
(A) For Phase I, a mixture of methane or other compounds, as applicable, in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million.
(B) For Phase II, a mixture of methane or other compounds, as applicable, and air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million for agitators, 5,000 parts per million for pumps, and 500 parts per million for all other equipment, except
as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
(C) For Phase III, a mixture of methane or other compounds, as applicable, and air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million methane for agitators; 2,000 parts per million for pumps in food/medical service; 5,000 parts per million for pumps in polymerizing monomer service; 1,000 parts per million for all other pumps; and 500 parts per million for all other equipment, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
(iii) The instrument may be calibrated at a higher methane concentration than the concentration specified for that piece of equipment. The concentration of the calibration gas may exceed the concentration specified as a leak by no more than 2,000 parts per million. If the monitoring instrument's design allows for multiple calibration scales, then the lower scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is no higher than 2,000 parts per million above the concentration specified as a leak and the highest scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is approximately equal to 10,000 parts per million. If only one scale on an instrument will be used during monitoring, the owner or operator need not calibrate the scales that will not be used during that day's monitoring.
(5) Monitoring shall be performed when the equipment is in organic HAP service, in use with an acceptable surrogate volatile organic compound which is not an organic HAP, or is in use with any other detectable gas or vapor.
(6) Monitoring data that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section may be used to qualify for less frequent monitoring under the provisions in § 63.168(d)(2) and (d)(3) or § 63.174(b)(3)(ii) or (b)(3)(iii) of this subpart provided the data meet the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (b)(6)(ii) of this section.
(i) The data were obtained before April 22, 1994.
(ii) The departures from the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section or from the specified monitoring frequency of § 63.168(c) are minor and do not significantly affect the quality of the data. Examples of minor departures are monitoring at a slightly different frequency (such as every six weeks instead of monthly or quarterly), following the performance criteria of section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 instead of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or monitoring at a different leak definition if the data would indicate the presence or absence of a leak at the concentration specified in this subpart. Failure to use a calibrated instrument is not considered a minor departure.
(c) When equipment is monitored for compliance as required in §§ 63.164(i), 63.165(a) or (e)(1), and 63.172(f) or when equipment subject to a leak definition of 500 ppm is monitored for leaks as required by this subpart, the owner or operator may elect to adjust or not to adjust the instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects to not adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. In such case, all instrument readings shall be compared directly to the applicable leak definition to determine whether there is a leak. If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
(1) The requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this section shall apply.
(2) The background level shall be determined, using the same procedures that will be used to determine whether the equipment is leaking.
(3) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(4) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 500 parts per million for determining compliance.
(d)(1) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably be
expected to contain equipment in organic HAP service is presumed to be in organic HAP service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in organic HAP service, it must be determined that the percent organic HAP content can be reasonably expected not to exceed 5 percent by weight on an annual average basis. For purposes of determining the percent organic HAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used. ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) may also be used in lieu of Method 18, if the target compounds are all known and are all listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-18 as measurable; ASTM D6420-18 must not be used for methane and ethane; and ASTM D6420-18 may not be used as a total VOC method.
(2)(i) An owner or operator may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to determine that the percent organic HAP content does not exceed 5 percent by weight. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service, however, the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
(ii) Conversely, the owner or operator may determine that the organic HAP content of the process fluid does not exceed 5 percent by weight by, for example, accounting for 98 percent of the content and showing that organic HAP is less than 3 percent.
(3) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in organic HAP service, the determination can be revised after following the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or by documenting that a change in the process or raw materials no longer causes the equipment to be in organic HAP service.
(4) Samples used in determining the percent organic HAP content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.
(e) When a flare is used to comply with § 63.172(d), the owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (a) of § 63.108. The owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test to determine percent emission reduction or outlet organic HAP or TOC concentration.
(1) Conduct a visible emission test using the techniques specified in § 63.11(b)(4).
(2) Determine the net heating value of the gas being combusted using the techniques specified in § 63.11(b)(6).
(3) Determine the exit velocity using the techniques specified in either § 63.11(b)(7)(i) (and § 63.11(b)(7)(iii), where applicable) or § 63.11(b)(8), as appropriate.
(f) The following procedures shall be used to pressure test batch product-process equipment for pressure or vacuum loss to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of § 63.178(b)(3)(i) of this subpart.
(1) The batch product-process equipment train shall be pressurized with a gas to a pressure less than the set pressure of any safety relief devices or valves or to a pressure slightly above the operating pressure of the equipment, or alternatively, the equipment shall be placed under a vacuum.
(2) Once the test pressure is obtained, the gas source or vacuum source shall be shut off.
(3) The test shall continue for not less than 15 minutes unless it can be determined in a shorter period of time that the allowable rate of pressure drop or of pressure rise was exceeded. The pressure in the batch product-process equipment shall be measured after the gas or vacuum source is shut off and at the end of the test period. The rate of change in pressure in the batch product-process equipment shall be calculated using the following equation:
ER22AP94.294
where:
Δ P/t = Change in pressure, psig/hr.
P
f
= Final pressure, psig.
P
i
= Initial pressure, psig.
t
f
−t
i
= Elapsed time, hours.
(4) The pressure shall be measured using a pressure measurement device (gauge, manometer, or equivalent) which has a precision of ±2.5 millimeter mercury in the range of test pressure and is capable of measuring pressures up to the relief set pressure of the pressure relief device. If such a pressure measurement device is not reasonably available, the owner or operator shall use a pressure measurement device with a precision of at least + 10 percent of the test pressure of the equipment and shall extend the duration of the test for the time necessary to detect a pressure loss or rise that equals a rate of one psig per hour.
(5) An alternative procedure may be used for leak testing the equipment if the owner or operator demonstrates the alternative procedure is capable of detecting a pressure loss or rise.
(g) The following procedures shall be used to pressure-test batch product-process equipment using a liquid to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of § 63.178(b)(3)(ii) of this subpart.
(1) The batch product-process equipment train, or section of the train, shall be filled with the test liquid (e.g., water, alcohol) until normal operating pressure is obtained. Once the equipment is filled, the liquid source shall be shut off.
(2) The test shall be conducted for a period of at least 60 minutes, unless it can be determined in a shorter period of time that the test is a failure.
(3) Each seal in the equipment being tested shall be inspected for indications of liquid dripping or other indications of fluid loss. If there are any indications of liquids dripping or of fluid loss, a leak is detected.
(4) An alternative procedure may be used for leak testing the equipment, if the owner or operator demonstrates the alternative procedure is capable of detecting losses of fluid.

§ 63.184
Fenceline monitoring provisions.
For each source as defined in § 63.101, and for each source as defined in § 63.191, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(12), the owner or operator must conduct sampling along the facility property boundary and analyze the samples in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section. Sampling of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, chloroprene, and ethylene dichloride must be conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. Sampling of ethylene oxide and vinyl chloride must be conducted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section apply for any compound required to be sampled.
(a) The owner or operator must conduct sampling along the facility property boundary and analyze the samples in accordance with Methods 325A and 325B of appendix A to this part and paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. The monitoring perimeter may be located inside the facility, away from the facility property boundary. However, the monitoring perimeter must encompass all potential sources of the target analyte(s) specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that are located within the facility's property boundary.
(1) The owner or operator must monitor the target analyte(s), as specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. The owner or operator must follow the procedure in Section 9.6 of Method 325B of appendix A to this part to determine the detection limit of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, chloroprene, and ethylene dichloride for each sampler used to collect samples and blanks.
(i) If an affected source uses, produces, stores, or emits benzene, the owner or operator must include benzene as a target analyte.
(ii) If an affected source uses, produces, stores, or emits 1,3-butadiene, the owner or operator must include 1,3-butadiene as a target analyte.
(iii) If an affected source uses, produces, stores, or emits chloroprene, the owner or operator must include chloroprene as a target analyte.
(iv) If an affected source uses, produces, stores, or emits ethylene dichloride, the owner or operator must include ethylene dichloride as a target analyte.
(2) The owner or operator must determine passive monitor locations in accordance with Section 8.2 of Method 325A of appendix A to this part.
(i) As it pertains to this subpart, known sources of VOCs, as used in Section 8.2.1.3 in Method 325A of appendix A to this part for siting passive monitors, means a wastewater treatment unit, process unit, or any emission source requiring control according to the requirements of this subpart, including marine vessel loading operations. For marine vessel loading operations, one passive monitor should be sited on the shoreline adjacent to the dock. For this subpart, an additional monitor is not required if the only emission sources within 50 meters of the monitoring boundary are equipment leak sources satisfying all of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. If a leak is found, it must be repaired no later than 15 calendar days after it is detected with no provisions for delay of repair. If a repair is not completed within 15 calendar days, the additional passive monitor specified in Section 8.2.1.3 in Method 325A of appendix A to this part must be used.
(A) The equipment leak sources in organic HAP service within 50 meters of the monitoring boundary are limited to valves, pumps, connectors, sampling connections, and open-ended lines. If compressors, pressure relief devices, or agitators in organic HAP service are present within 50 meters of the monitoring boundary, the additional passive monitoring location specified in Section 8.2.1.3 in Method 325A of appendix A to this part must be used.
(B) All equipment leak sources in gas or light liquid service (and in organic HAP service), including valves, pumps, connectors, sampling connections and open-ended lines, must be monitored using Method 21 of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 no less frequently than quarterly with no provisions for skip period monitoring, or according to the provisions of § 63.11(c) Alternative Work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks. For the purpose of this provision, a leak is detected if the instrument reading equals or exceeds the applicable limits in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B)(
1
) through (
5
) of this section:
(
1
) For valves, pumps or connectors at an existing source, an instrument reading of 10,000 ppmv.
(
2
) For valves or connectors at a new source, an instrument reading of 500 ppmv.
(
3
) For pumps at a new source, an instrument reading of 2,000 ppmv.
(
4
) For sampling connections or open-ended lines, an instrument reading of 500 ppmv above background.
(
5
) For equipment monitored according to the Alternative Work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks, the leak definitions contained in § 63.11(c)(6)(i) through (iii).
(C) All equipment leak sources in organic HAP service, including sources in gas, light liquid and heavy liquid service, must be inspected using visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method at least monthly. A leak is detected if the inspection identifies a potential leak to the atmosphere or if there are indications of liquids dripping.
(ii) If there are 19 or fewer monitoring locations, the owner or operator must collect at least one co-located duplicate sample per sampling period and at least one field blank per sampling period. If there are 20 or more monitoring locations, the owner or operator must collect at least two co-located duplicate samples per sampling period and at least one field blank per sampling period. The co-located duplicates may be collected at any of the perimeter sampling.
(iii) Samplers are not required to be placed along internal roads, waterways, or other right of ways that may bisect the facility. If a facility is bounded by a waterway on one or more sides, the shoreline is considered the facility property boundary.
(3) The owner or operator must use a sampling period and sampling frequency as specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i)
Sampling period.
A 14-day sampling period must be used, unless a shorter sampling period is determined to be necessary under paragraph (e) or (g) of this section. A sampling period is defined as the period during which sampling tube is deployed at a specific sampling location with the diffusive sampling end cap in-place and does not include the time required to analyze the sample. For the purpose of this subpart, a 14-day sampling period may
be no shorter than 13 calendar days and no longer than 15 calendar days, but the routine sampling period must be 14 calendar days.
(ii)
Base sampling frequency.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, the frequency of sample collection must be once each contiguous 14-day sampling period, such that the beginning of the next 14-day sampling period begins immediately upon the completion of the previous 14-day sampling period.
(iii)
Alternative sampling frequency for burden reduction.
When an individual monitor consistently achieves results for a particular analyte at or below the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the owner or operator may elect to use the applicable minimum sampling frequency specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(A) through (E) of this section for that monitoring site for that analyte. When calculating Δc for the monitoring period when using this alternative for burden reduction, use zero for the lowest sampling result for each monitoring period where one or more samples was not taken and/or analyzed for the analyte(s) that qualifies for this alternative sampling frequency. This alternative for burden reduction is determined on an analyte specific basis. If an owner or operator is not required to sample for a particular analyte for a particular monitoring site in accordance with this paragraph (a)(3)(iii), the owner or operator must still sample for any other analytes required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section at the frequency specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, unless the other analyte(s) also qualifies for this alternative for burden reduction.
(A) For the analyte of interest, if every sample at a monitoring site is at or below the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section for 2 years (52 consecutive samples), every other sampling period can be skipped for that analyte for that monitoring site,
i.e.,
sampling will occur approximately once per month.
(B) For the analyte of interest, if every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is at or below the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section for 2 years (
i.e.,
26 consecutive “monthly” samples), five 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that analyte for that monitoring site following each period of sampling,
i.e.,
sampling will occur approximately once per quarter.
(C) For the analyte of interest, if every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section is at or below the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section for 2 years (
i.e.,
8 consecutive quarterly samples), twelve 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that analyte for that monitoring site following each period of sampling,
i.e.,
sampling will occur twice a year.
(D) For the analyte of interest, if every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) of this section is at or below the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section for 2 years (
i.e.,
4 consecutive semiannual samples), only one sample per year is required for that analyte for that monitoring site. For yearly sampling, samples shall occur at least 10 months but no more than 14 months apart.
(E) If at any time a sample for a monitoring site that is monitored for the analyte at the frequency specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section returns a result for the analyte that is above the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the sampling site must return to the original sampling requirements for the analyte of contiguous 14-day sampling periods with no skip periods for one quarter (six 14-day sampling periods). If every sample collected for the analyte during this quarter is at or below the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the owner or operator may revert back to the reduced monitoring schedule applicable for that analyte for that monitoring site prior to the sample reading exceeding the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If any sample collected for the analyte during this quarter is above the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, that monitoring site must return to the original sampling requirements for that analyte of contiguous 14-day sampling periods
with no skip periods for a minimum of two years. The burden reduction requirements can be used again for that analyte for that monitoring site once the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section are met again,
i.e.,
after 52 contiguous 14-day samples with no results above the level specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(4) To use the alternative sampling frequency outlined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, an individual monitor must consistently achieve results for the analyte at or below the level specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) For benzene, the results must be consistently at or below 0.9 µg/m
3
.
(ii) For 1,3-butadiene, the results must be consistently at or below 0.3 µg/m
3
.
(iii) For ethylene dichloride, the results must be consistently at or below 0.4 µg/m
3
.
(b) The owner or operator must conduct sampling along the facility property boundary and analyze the samples in accordance with Method 327 of appendix A to this part and paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator must monitor the target analyte(s), as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) If an affected source uses, produces, stores, or emits ethylene oxide, the owner or operator must include ethylene oxide as a target analyte.
(ii) If an affected source uses, produces, stores, or emits vinyl chloride, the owner or operator must include vinyl chloride as a target analyte.
(2) The owner or operator must use a sampling period and sampling frequency as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i)
Sampling period.
A 24-hour sampling period must be used, unless a shorter sampling period is determined to be necessary under paragraph (e) or (g) of this section. A sampling period is defined as the period during which the canister is deployed at a specific sampling location and actively sampling and does not include the time required to analyze the sample. For the purpose of this subpart, a 24-hour sampling period may be no shorter than 23 hours and no longer than 25 hours.
(ii)
Base sampling frequency.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the frequency of sample collection must be once every 5 calendar days, such that the beginning of each sampling period begins approximately 96 hours (± 24 hours) from the end of the previous sample.
(iii)
Alternative sampling frequency for burden reduction.
This alternative is only applicable for the measurement of vinyl chloride from sites with a monitoring perimeter less than or equal to 5,000 meters. When an individual sampling point consistently achieves results at or below 0.3 µg/m
3
, the owner or operator may elect to use the applicable minimum sampling frequency specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A) through (E) of this section for that sampling site for vinyl chloride. If ethylene oxide is a required analyte, the owner or operator must continue to monitor ethylene oxide at the frequency specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. When calculating Δc for the monitoring period when using this alternative for burden reduction, use zero for the lowest sampling result for each monitoring period where one or more samples was not taken for vinyl chloride.
(A) If every sample at a monitoring site is at or below 0.3 µg/m
3
for 2 years (52 consecutive samples), every other sampling period can be skipped for that sampling site,
i.e.,
sampling will occur approximately once per month.
(B) If every sample at a sampling site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is at or below 0.3 µg/m
3
for 2 years (
i.e.,
26 consecutive “monthly” samples), five 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that sampling site following each period of sampling,
i.e.,
sampling will occur approximately once per quarter.
(C) If every sample at a sampling site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section is at or below 0.3 µg/m
3
for 2 years (
i.e.,
8 consecutive quarterly samples), twelve 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that sampling site following each period of sampling,
i.e.,
sampling will occur twice a year.
(D) If every sample at a sampling site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section is at or below 0.3 µg/m
3
for 2 years (
i.e.,
4 consecutive semiannual samples), only one sample per year is required for that sampling site. For yearly sampling, samples shall occur at least 10 months but no more than 14 months apart.
(E) If at any time a sample for a sampling site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A) through (E) of this section returns a result that is above 0.3 µg/m
3
, the sampling site must return to the original sampling requirements of sampling every 5 calendar days with no skip periods for one quarter (18 5-day sampling periods). If every sample collected during this quarter is at or below 0.3 µg/m
3
, the owner or operator may revert back to the reduced monitoring schedule applicable for that sampling site prior to the sample reading exceeding 0.3 µg/m
3
. If any sample collected during this quarter is above 0.3 µg/m
3
, that sampling site must return to the original sampling requirements of sampling every 5 calendar days with no skip periods for a minimum of two years. The burden reduction requirements can be used again for that sampling site once the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section are met again,
i.e.,
after 146 consecutive samples with no results above 0.3 µg/m
3
.
(3) The owner or operator must determine canister sample locations in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) The monitoring perimeter must be located on or inside the facility property boundary. If the monitoring perimeter is located away from the facility property boundary, the monitoring perimeter must encompass all potential sources of the target analyte(s) specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that are located within the facility's property boundary. If the site contains process units that are disconnected (
i.e.,
one or more process areas are not within the boundary of the main facility), the owner or operator must follow the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section. Canisters are not required to be placed along internal roads, waterways, or other right of ways that may bisect the facility. If a facility is bounded by a waterway on one or more sides, the shoreline is considered the facility property boundary.
(ii) The owner or operator must place 8 canisters around the monitoring perimeter during each sampling period.
(iii) To determine sampling locations, measure the length of the monitoring perimeter.
(A) Locate the point on the monitoring perimeter that is closest to sources of the target analyte(s). If one of the target analytes is ethylene oxide, this point must be the point on the monitoring perimeter that is closest to the sources of ethylene oxide.
(B) If the monitoring perimeter is less than or equal to 5,000 meters, divide the monitoring perimeter into 8 evenly spaced sampling points, with one point located in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
(C) If the monitoring perimeter is greater than 5,000 meters, but less than or equal to 10,000 meters, divide the monitoring perimeter into 16 evenly spaced sampling points, with one point located in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
(D) If the monitoring perimeter is greater than 10,000 meters, divide the monitoring perimeter into 24 evenly spaced sampling points, with one point located in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
(iv) Place canisters on the monitoring perimeter at the sampling points as follows.
(A) If there are only 8 sampling points for the site, monitor each sampling point during each sampling period.
(B) If there are 16 sampling points for the site, number the sampling points consecutively along the monitoring perimeter. During the first sampling period, monitor the odd numbered sampling points. During the second sampling period, monitor the even numbered sampling points. Continue to alternate between the odd numbered and even numbered sampling points in subsequent sampling periods.
(C) If there are 24 sampling points for the site, number the sampling points consecutively along the monitoring perimeter. During the first sampling period, monitor every third sampling point starting with the first sampling point (
i.e.,
points 1, 4, 7, etc.). During the second sampling period, monitor every third sampling point starting with the second sampling point (
i.e.,
points 2, 5, 8, etc.). During the third sampling period, monitor every third sampling point starting with the third sampling point (
i.e.,
points 3, 6, 9, etc.). Continue to alternate between these placements for each subsequent sampling period (
i.e.,
the fourth sampling period will include every third sampling point starting with the first sampling point, the fifth sampling period will include every third sampling point starting with the second sampling point, and so on).
(v) If the site consists of small areas disconnected from the main facility, additional monitors must be placed on these areas in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this section. The monitoring perimeter for the disconnected area(s) must be located between the property boundary of the area and the process unit(s), such that the monitoring perimeter for the disconnected area encompasses all potential sources of the target analyte(s) specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(A) If the disconnected area is less than 50 acres, the owner or operator must sample at two locations each sampling period. One location must be placed in the expected prevailing wind direction for the sampling period, downwind of the main source of emissions of the target analyte(s). The other location must be located on the monitoring perimeter at 180 degrees from the first sample location.
(B) If the disconnected area is equal to or greater than 50 acres but less than or equal to 150 acres, the owner or operator must sample at four equally spaced locations. One sampling point must be located on the monitoring perimeter at the point that is closest to sources of the target analyte(s). If one of the target analytes is ethylene oxide, this point must be the point on the monitoring perimeter that is closest to the sources of ethylene oxide.
(C) If the disconnected area is greater than 150 acres, the sampling points for the disconnected area must be determined according to paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (iv) of this section.
(4) At least one co-located duplicate sample and at least one field blank must be collected per sampling period.
(5) The owner or operator must follow the procedures in Method 327 of appendix A to this part to determine the detection limit of the target analyte(s) and requirements for quality assurance samples.
(c) The owner or operator must collect and record meteorological data according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) If monitoring is conducted under paragraph (b) of this section, if a near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, or if an alternative test method is used that provides time-resolved measurements, the owner or operator must use an on-site meteorological station in accordance with Section 8.3 of Method 325A of appendix A to this part. Collect and record hourly average meteorological data, including temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and wind direction and calculate daily unit vector wind direction and daily sigma theta.
(2) For cases other than those specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must collect and record sampling period average temperature and barometric pressure using either an on-site meteorological station in accordance with Section 8.3 of Method 325A of appendix A to this part or, alternatively, using data from a National Weather Service (NWS) meteorological station provided the NWS meteorological station is within 40 kilometers (25 miles) of the facility.
(3) If an on-site meteorological station is used, the owner or operator must follow the calibration and standardization procedures for meteorological measurements in EPA-454/B-08-002 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(d) Within 45 days of completion of each sampling period, the owner or operator must determine whether the results are above or below the action level for each measured compound as follows. If the owner or operator is required to monitor any small disconnected area(s) of the facility under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, the procedure for determining whether the results are above or below the action level for each measured compound must be performed for the disconnected area(s) separately.
(1) The owner or operator must determine the facility impact on the concentration (Δc) of each compound for each sampling period according to either paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) Except when near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator must determine the highest and lowest sample results for each compound individually from the sample pool and calculate each compound's Δc as the difference in these concentrations. Co-located samples must be averaged together for the purposes of determining the concentration at a particular sampling location, and, if applicable, for determining Δc. The owner or operator must adhere to the following procedures when one or more samples for the sampling period are below the method detection limit for a particular compound:
(A) If the lowest detected value of a compound is below detection, the owner or operator must use zero as the lowest sample result when calculating Δc.
(B) If all sample results are below the method detection limit, the owner or operator must use the highest method detection limit for the sample set as the highest sample result and zero as the lowest sample result when calculating Δc.
(C) In the case of co-located samples, if one sample is above the method detection limit while the other sample is below the method detection limit, the owner or operator must use the method detection limit as the result for the sample that is below the method detection limit for purposes of averaging the results to determine the concentration at a particular sampling location, and, if applicable, for determining Δc.
(ii) When near-field source correction for a compound is used as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the owner or operator must determine Δc using the calculation protocols outlined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, except as provided in this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), and the additional requirements in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, as well as any additional requirements outlined in the approved site-specific monitoring plan. The Δc for the compound for the sampling period is equal to the higher of the values in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
(A) The highest corrected sample result for the compound from a sampling location where near-field source correction for the compound is used during the sampling period.
(B) The difference in concentration between the highest sample result that was not corrected for a near-field source for the compound during the sampling period and the lowest sample result for the compound for the sampling period.
(2) The owner or operator must calculate the annual average Δc for each monitored compound as follows:
(i) For sampling conducted under paragraph (a) of this section, the annual average Δc for each compound is based on the average of the Δc values for the 26 most recent 14-day sampling periods. The owner or operator must update this annual average value after receiving the results of each subsequent 14-day sampling period.
(ii) For sampling conducted under paragraph (b) of this section, the annual average Δc for each compound is based on the average of the Δc values for the 73 most recent sampling periods. The owner or operator must update this annual average value after receiving the results of each subsequent sampling period.
(3) The action level for each compound is listed in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section. If the annual average Δc value for a compound is greater than the listed action level for the compound, the concentration is above the action level, and the owner or operator must conduct a root cause
analysis and corrective action in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(i) The action level for benzene is 9 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m
3
) on an annual average basis.
(ii) The action level for 1,3-butadiene is 3 µg/m
3
on an annual average basis.
(iii) The action level for chloroprene is 0.8 µg/m
3
on an annual average basis.
(iv) The action level for ethylene oxide is 0.2 µg/m
3
on an annual average basis.
(v) The action level for vinyl chloride is 3 µg/m
3
on an annual average basis.
(vi) The action level for ethylene dichloride is 4 µg/m
3
on an annual average basis.
(e) Once any action level in paragraph (d)(3) of this section has been exceeded, the owner or operator must take the following actions to bring the annual average Δc back below the action level(s).
(1) Within 5 days of updating the annual average value as required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and determining that any action level in paragraph (d)(3) of this section has been exceeded (
i.e.,
in no case longer than 50 days after completion of the sampling period), the owner or operator must initiate a root cause analysis to determine appropriate corrective action. A root cause analysis is an assessment conducted through a process of investigation to determine the primary underlying cause and all other contributing causes to an exceedance of an action level(s) set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(i) The initial root cause analysis may include, but is not limited to:
(A) Leak inspection using Method 21 of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60, optical gas imaging, or handheld monitors.
(B) Visual inspection to determine the cause of the high emissions.
(C) Operator knowledge of process changes (
e.g.,
a malfunction or release event).
(ii) If the initial root cause cannot be identified using the type of techniques described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the owner or operator must employ more frequent sampling and analysis to determine the root cause of the exceedance.
(A) The owner or operator may first employ additional monitoring points and shorter sampling periods for Methods 325A and 325B of appendix A to this part for benzene, 1,3-butadiene, chloroprene, or ethylene dichloride or more frequent sampling with Method 327 of appendix A to this part for ethylene oxide or vinyl chloride to determine the root cause of the exceedance.
(B) If the owner or operator has not determined the root cause of the exceedance within 30 days of determining that the action level has been exceeded, the owner or operator must employ the appropriate real-time sampling techniques (
e.g.,
mobile gas chromatographs, optical spectroscopy instruments, sensors) to locate the cause of the exceedance. If the root cause is not identified after 48 hours, either the real-time monitor must be relocated or an additional real-time monitor must be added. Relocation or addition of extra real-time monitors must continue after each 48-hour period of nonidentification until the owner or operator can identify the root cause of the exceedance.
(2) If the underlying primary and other contributing causes of the exceedance are deemed to be under the control of the owner or operator, the owner or operator must take appropriate corrective action as expeditiously as possible to bring annual average fenceline concentrations back below the action level(s) set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. At a minimum, the corrective actions taken must address the underlying primary and other contributing cause(s) determined in the root cause analysis to prevent future exceedances from the same underlying cause(s).
(3) The root cause analysis must be completed and initial corrective actions taken no later than 45 days after determining there is an exceedance of an action level.
(4) Until the annual average Δc is below the action level again, following completion of the initial corrective action, the owner or operator must conduct a new root cause analysis according to this paragraph (e), and if required, submit a corrective action plan under paragraph (f) of this section following any sampling period for which
the sampling start time begins after the completion of the initial corrective actions and for which the Δc for the sampling period is greater than the level specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (vi) of this section for the compound(s) that initially exceeded the action level.
(i) For benzene, a sampling period Δc of 9 µg/m
3
.
(ii) For 1,3-butadiene, a sampling period Δc of 3 µg/m
3
.
(iii) For chloroprene, a sampling period Δc of 0.8 µg/m
3
.
(iv) For ethylene dichloride, a sampling period Δc of 4 µg/m
3
.
(v) For ethylene oxide, a sampling period Δc of 0.2 µg/m
3
.
(vi) For vinyl chloride, a sampling period Δc of 3 µg/m
3
.
(f) An owner or operator must develop a corrective action plan if the conditions in paragraphs (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section are met. The corrective action plan must describe the corrective action(s) completed to date, additional measures that the owner or operator proposes to employ to reduce annual average fenceline concentrations below the action level(s) set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and a schedule for completion of these measures. The corrective action plan does not need to be approved by the Administrator. However, if upon review, the Administrator disagrees with the additional measures outlined in the plan, the owner or operator must revise and resubmit the plan within 7 calendar days of receiving comments from the Administrator.
(1) If the compound that exceeded the action level was benzene, 1,3-butadiene, chloroprene, or ethylene dichloride, the owner or operator must develop a corrective action plan if, upon completion of the root cause analysis and initial corrective actions required in paragraph (e) of this section, the Δc value for the next sampling period, for which the sampling start time begins after the completion of the initial corrective actions, is greater than the level specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section for the compound(s) that initially exceeded the action level. The corrective action plan must include the implementation of real-time sampling techniques to locate the primary and other contributing causes of the exceedance. The owner or operator must submit the corrective action plan to the Administrator within 60 days after receiving the analytical results indicating that the Δc value for the sampling period following the completion of the initial corrective action is greater than the level specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) For benzene, a sampling period Δc of 9 µg/m
3
.
(ii) For 1,3-butadiene, a sampling period Δc of 3 µg/m
3
.
(iii) For chloroprene, a sampling period Δc of 0.8 µg/m
3
.
(iv) For ethylene dichloride, a sampling period Δc of 4 µg/m
3
.
(2) If the compound that exceeded the action level was ethylene oxide or vinyl chloride, the owner or operator must develop a corrective action plan if, upon completion of the root cause analysis and initial corrective actions required in paragraph (e) of this section, the Δc value for any of the next three sampling periods, for which the sampling start time begins after the completion of the initial corrective actions, is greater than the level specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section for the compound(s) that initially exceeded the action level. The corrective action plan must include the implementation of real-time sampling techniques to locate the primary and other contributing causes of the exceedance. The owner or operator must submit the corrective action plan to the Administrator within 60 days after receiving the analytical results indicating that the Δc value for the sampling period following the completion of the initial corrective action is greater than the level specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) For ethylene oxide, a sampling period Δc of 0.2 µg/m
3
.
(ii) For vinyl chloride, a sampling period Δc of 3 µg/m
3
.
(3) The owner or operator must develop a corrective action plan if complete implementation of all corrective measures identified in the root cause analysis required by paragraph (e) of this section will require more than 45 days. The owner or operator must submit the corrective action plan to the
Administrator no later than 60 days following the completion of the root cause analysis required in paragraph (e) of this section.
(g) An owner or operator may request approval from the Administrator for a site-specific monitoring plan to account for offsite upwind sources according to the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator must prepare and submit a site-specific monitoring plan and receive approval of the site-specific monitoring plan prior to using the near-field source alternative calculation for determining Δc provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The site-specific monitoring plan must include, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section. The procedures in Section 12 of Method 325A of appendix A to this part are not required, but may be used, if applicable, when determining near-field source contributions.
(i) Identification of the near-field source or sources.
(ii) Location of the additional monitoring stations that will be used to determine the near-field source concentration contribution. The owner or operator must use additional monitoring stations to determine the near-field source contribution.
(iii) Identification of the fenceline monitoring locations impacted by the near-field source. If more than one near-field source is present, identify the near-field source or sources that are expected to contribute to the concentration at that monitoring location.
(iv) A description of (including sample calculations illustrating) the planned data reduction; the treatment of invalid data, data below detection limits, and data collected during calm wind periods; and calculations to determine the near-field source concentration contribution for each monitoring location.
(v) A detailed description of the measurement technique, measurement location(s), the standard operating procedures, measurement frequency, recording frequency, measurement detection limit, and data quality indicators to ensure accuracy, precision, and validity of the data.
(vi) A detailed description of how data will be handled during periods of calm wind conditions (
i.e.,
less than 2 miles per hour).
(2) When an approved site-specific monitoring plan is used, the owner or operator must determine Δc for comparison with the action level according to paragraph (d) of this section. When determining the highest and lowest sample results for use in the Δc calculation, the concentration for any monitor that has been corrected using an approved site-specific monitoring plan will be corrected according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) For each monitoring location corrected using the site-specific monitoring plan, the corrected fenceline concentration at that monitoring station will be equal to the fenceline concentration measured with Methods 325A and 325B or Method 327 of appendix A to this part minus the near-field source contributing concentration at the measurement location determined using the additional measurements and calculation procedures included in the site-specific monitoring plan.
(ii) If the fenceline concentration at the monitoring station is below the method detection limit for Methods 325A and 325B or Method 327 of appendix A to this part, no near-field source contribution can be subtracted from that monitoring station for that sampling period.
(3) The site-specific monitoring plan must be submitted and approved as described in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) The site-specific monitoring plan must be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
(ii) The site-specific monitoring plan must also be submitted to the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Sector Policies and Programs Division, U.S. EPA Mailroom (E143-01), Attention: Hazardous Organic Chemical Manufacturing Sector Lead, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, P.O. Box 12055, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Electronic copies in lieu of hard copies may also be submitted to
fencelineplan@epa.gov.
(iii) The Administrator will approve or disapprove the plan in 90 days. The plan is considered approved if the Administrator either approves the plan in writing or fails to disapprove the plan in writing. The 90-day period begins when the Administrator receives the plan.
(iv) If the Administrator finds any deficiencies in the site-specific monitoring plan and disapproves the plan in writing, the owner or operator may revise and resubmit the site-specific monitoring plan following the requirements in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. The 90-day period starts over with the resubmission of the revised monitoring plan.
(4) The approval by the Administrator of a site-specific monitoring plan will be based on the completeness, accuracy and reasonableness of the request for a site-specific monitoring plan. Factors that the Administrator will consider in reviewing the request for a site-specific monitoring plan include, but are not limited to, those described in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) The identification of the near-field source or sources and evidence of how the sources impact the fenceline concentrations.
(ii) The location(s) selected for additional monitoring to determine the near-field source concentration contribution.
(iii) The identification of the fenceline monitoring locations impacted by the near-field source or sources.
(iv) The appropriateness of the planned data reduction and calculations to determine the near-field source concentration contribution for each monitoring location, including the handling of invalid data, data below the detection limit, and data during calm periods.
(v) The adequacy of the description of and rationale for the measurement technique, measurement location(s), the standard operation procedure, measurement frequency, recording frequency, measurement detection limit, and data quality indicators to ensure accuracy, precision, and validity of the data.
(h) The owner or operator must comply with the applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements in §§ 63.181 and 63.182.
(i) As outlined in § 63.7(f), the owner or operator may submit a request for an alternative test method. At a minimum, the request must follow the requirements outlined in paragraphs (i)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) The alternative method may be used in lieu of all or a partial number of passive samplers required in Method 325A of appendix A to this part or the canister sampling locations required under paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) The alternative method must be validated according to Method 301 in appendix A to this part or contain performance-based procedures and indicators to ensure self-validation.
(3) The method detection limit must nominally be at least one-third of the action level for the compound(s) that will be monitored with the alternative method. The alternate test method must describe the procedures used to provide field verification of the detection limit.
(4) If the alternative test method will be used to replace some or all passive samplers required under paragraph (a) of this section, the spatial coverage must be equal to or better than the spatial coverage provided in Method 325A of appendix A to this part. If the alternative test method will be used to replace some or all canisters required under paragraph (b) of this section, the spatial coverage must be equal to or better than the spatial coverage provided under paragraph (b) of this section.
(i) For path average concentration open-path instruments, the physical path length of the measurement must be no more than a passive sample footprint (the spacing that would be provided by the sorbent traps when following Method 325A of appendix A to this part) or canister sample footprint, as applicable. For example, if Method 325A requires spacing monitors A and B 610 meters (2,000 feet) apart, then the physical path length limit for the measurement at that portion of the fenceline must be no more than 610 meters (2,000 feet).
(ii) For range resolved open-path instrument or approach, the instrument or approach must be able to resolve an average concentration over each passive sampler footprint or canister sample footprint within the path length of the instrument.
(iii) The extra samplers required in Sections 8.2.1.3 of Method 325A of appendix A to this part may be omitted when they fall within the path length of an open-path instrument.
(5) At a minimum, non-integrating alternative test methods must provide a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period.
(6) For alternative test methods capable of real time measurements (less than a 5 minute sampling and analysis cycle), the alternative test method may allow for elimination of data points corresponding to outside emission sources for purpose of calculation of the high point for the two week average. The alternative test method approach must have wind speed, direction and stability class of the same time resolution and within the footprint of the instrument.
(7) For purposes of averaging data points to determine the Δc for the individual sampling period, all results measured under the method detection limit must use the method detection limit. For purposes of averaging data points for the individual sampling period low sample result, all results measured under the method detection limit must use zero.

padup rebuild
if it effectively constitutes a replacement of the battery above the pad, even if some portion of the brickwork above the pad is retained.
Pushing,
for the purposes of § 63.305, means the coke oven operation that commences when the pushing ram starts into the oven to push out coke that has completed the coking cycle and ends when the quench car is clear of the coke side shed.
Pushing/charging machine (PCM)
means the combined coke oven pushing and charging machine operated on rail tracks to open an oven door, push the finished coke from the open oven, and close the oven door, and to charge the adjacent oven with coal to start the coking cycle. Typically used with horizontal ovens such as those at nonrecovery coke facilities.
Root cause analysis
is an assessment conducted through a process of investigation to determine the primary underlying cause and all other contributing causes to an exceedance of an action level set forth in this rule.
Run
means the observation of visible emissions from topside port lids, offtake systems, coke oven doors, or the charging of a coke oven that is made in accordance with and is valid under Methods 303 or 303A in appendix A to this part.
Shed
means a structure for capturing coke oven emissions on the coke side or pusher side of the coke oven battery, which routes the emissions to a control device or system.

(b) To qualify for approval of an alternative standard, the owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a test plan for the measurement of emissions. A copy of the request shall also be sent to the Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. The plan shall describe the procedures to be used for the measurement of particulate matter; the parameters to be measured that affect the shed exhaust rate (e.g., damper settings, fan power) and the procedures for measuring such parameters; and if applicable under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the procedures to be used for the measurement of benzene soluble organics, benzene, toluene, and xylene emitted from the control device for the shed. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 30 days before any performance test is conducted.
(c) A complete test plan is deemed approved if no disapproval is received within 60 days of the submittal to the Administrator. After approval of the test plan, the owner or operator shall;
(1) Determine the efficiency of the control device for removal of particulate matter by conducting measurements at the inlet and the outlet of the emission control device using Method 5 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, with the filter box operated at ambient temperature and in a manner to avoid condensation, with a backup filter;
(2) Measure the visible emissions from coke oven doors that escape capture by the shed using Method 22 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter. For the purpose of approval of an alternative standard, no visible emissions may escape capture from the shed.
(i) Visible emission observations shall be taken during conditions representative of normal operations, except that pushing shall be suspended and pushing emissions shall have cleared the shed; and
(ii) Method 22 observations shall be performed by an observer certified according to the requirements of Method 9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter. The observer shall allow pushing emissions to be evacuated (typically 1 to 2 minutes) before making observations;
(3) Measure the opacity of emissions from the control device using Method 9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter during conditions representative of normal operations, including pushing; and
(i) If the control device has multiple stacks, the owner or operator shall use an evaluation based on visible emissions and opacity to select the stack with the highest opacity for testing under this section;
(ii) The highest opacity, expressed as a 6-minute average, shall be used as the opacity standard for the control device.
(iii) Alternatively, ASTM D7520-16, (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) may be used with the following conditions:
(A) During the digital camera opacity technique (DCOT) certification procedure outlined in section 9.2 of ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), the owner or operator or the DCOT vendor must present the plumes in front of various backgrounds of color and contrast representing conditions anticipated during field use such as blue sky, trees, and mixed backgrounds (clouds and/or a sparse tree stand).
(B) The owner or operator must also have standard operating procedures in place including daily or other frequency quality checks to ensure the equipment is within manufacturing specifications as outlined in section 8.1 of ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(C) The owner or operator must follow the recordkeeping procedures outlined in § 63.10(b)(1) for the DCOT certification, compliance report, data sheets, and all raw unaltered JPEGs used for opacity and certification determination.
(D) The owner or operator or the DCOT vendor must have a minimum of four independent technology users apply the software to determine the visible opacity of the 300 certification plumes. For each set of 25 plumes, the user may not exceed 15 percent opacity of anyone reading and the average error must not exceed 7.5 percent opacity.
(E) Use of this approved alternative does not provide or imply a certification or validation of any vendor's hardware or software. The onus to maintain and verify the certification and/or training of the DCOT camera, software, and operator in accordance with ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and these requirements is on the facility, DCOT operator, and DCOT vendor.
(4) Thoroughly inspect all compartments of each air cleaning device prior to the performance test for proper operation and for changes that signal the potential for malfunction, including the presence of tears, holes, and abrasions in filter bags; damaged seals; and for dust deposits on the clean side of bags; and

(iii) If the visible emission limitation is achieved for 12 consecutive observations, compliance shall be determined by monthly rather than weekly performance tests. If any exceedance occurs during a performance test, weekly performance tests shall be resumed.
(iv) Observations taken at times other than those specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section shall be subject to the provisions of § 63.309(f).
(2) The certified observer shall monitor the visible coke oven emissions escaping capture by the shed on a weekly basis. The provision in paragraph (f)(6) of this section is applicable if visible coke oven emissions are observed during periods when pushing emissions have cleared the shed.
(3) The owner or operator shall not discharge or allow to be discharged to the atmosphere any visible emissions
from the shed's control device exhibiting more than 0 percent opacity unless an alternative limit has been approved under paragraph (e) of this section.
(4) The opacity of emissions from the control device for the shed shall be monitored in accordance with the requirements of either paragraph (f)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, at the election of the owner or operator.
(i) The owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain a continuous opacity monitor, and record the output of the system, for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged from the emission control system per §§ 63.300(e) and 63.8(d)(1) and (2).

If the performance evaluation plan is revised, the owner or operator shall keep previous (
i.e.,
superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. The program of corrective action should be included in the plan required under § 63.8(d)(2); or
(ii) A certified observer shall monitor and record at least once each day during daylight hours, opacity observations for the control device for the shed using Method 9 in appendix A-4 to 40 CFR part 60. Alternatively, ASTM D7520-16, (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) may be used with the following conditions:
(A) During the digital camera opacity technique (DCOT) certification procedure outlined in section 9.2 of ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), the owner or operator or the DCOT vendor must present the plumes in front of various backgrounds of color and contrast representing conditions anticipated during field use such as blue sky, trees, and mixed backgrounds (clouds and/or a sparse tree stand).
(B) The owner or operator must also have standard operating procedures in place including daily or other frequency quality checks to ensure the equipment is within manufacturing specifications as outlined in section 8.1 of ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(C) The owner or operator must follow the recordkeeping procedures outlined in § 63.10(b)(1) for the DCOT certification, compliance report, data sheets, and all raw unaltered JPEGs used for opacity and certification determination.
(D) The owner or operator or the DCOT vendor must have a minimum of four independent technology users apply the software to determine the visible opacity of the 300 certification plumes. For each set of 25 plumes, the user may not exceed 15 percent opacity of anyone reading and the average error must not exceed 7.5 percent opacity.
(E) Use of this approved alternative does not provide or imply a certification or validation of any vendor's hardware or software. The onus to maintain and verify the certification and/or training of the DCOT camera, software, and operator in accordance with ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and these requirements is on the facility, DCOT operator, and DCOT vendor.
(5) The owner or operator shall visually inspect the structural integrity of the shed at least once a quarter for defects, such as deterioration of sheet metal (e.g., holes in the shed), that may allow the escape of visible emissions.
(i) The owner or operator shall record the time and date a defect is first observed, the time and date the defect is corrected or repaired, and a brief description of repairs or corrective actions taken;
(ii) The owner or operator shall temporarily repair the defect as soon as
possible, but no later than 5 days after detection of the defect;
(iii) Unless a major repair is required, the owner or operator shall perform a complete repair of the defect within 15 days of detection of the defect. If a major repair is required (e.g., replacement of large sections of the shed), the owner or operator shall submit a repair schedule to the enforcement agency.
(6) If the no visible emission limit for the shed specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section is exceeded, the Administrator may require another test for the shed according to the approved test plan as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. If the certified observer observes visible coke oven emissions from the shed, except during periods of pushing or when pushing emissions have not cleared the shed, the owner or operator shall check to ensure that the shed and control device are working properly.
(7) The owner or operator shall monitor the parameter(s) affecting shed exhaust flow rate, and record data, in accordance with the approved monitoring plan for these parameters.
(8) The owner or operator shall not operate the exhaust system of the shed at an exhaust flow rate lower than that measured during the test required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as indicated by the monitored parameters.
(g) Each side of a battery subject to an alternative standard for doors under this section shall be treated separately for purposes of §§ 63.306(c) (plan implementation) and 63.306(d) (plan revisions) of this subpart. In making determinations under these provisions for the side of the battery subject to an alternative standard, the requirement that exceedances be independent shall not apply. During any period when work practices for doors for both sides of the battery are required to be implemented, § 63.306(a)(3) shall apply in the same manner as if the provisions of a plan for a single emissions point were required to be implemented. Exceedances of the alternative standard for percent leaking doors under a shed is the only provision in this section implicating implementation of work practice requirements.
(h) Multiple exceedances of the visible emission limitation for door leaks and/or the provisions of an alternative standard under this section for door leaks at a battery on a single day shall be considered a single violation.

(1) The owner or operator of a coke oven battery subject to visible emission limitations under this subpart on and after November 15, 1993, shall:
(i) Implement the provisions of the work practice plan pertaining to a particular emission point following the second independent exceedance of the visible emission limitation for the emission point in any consecutive 6-month period, by no later than 3 days after receipt of written notification of the second such exceedance from the certified observer. For the purpose of this paragraph (c)(1)(i), the second exceedance is “independent” if either of the following criteria is met:
(A) The second exceedance occurs 30 days or more after the first exceedance;
(B) In the case of coke oven doors, topside port lids, and offtake systems, the 29-run average, calculated by excluding the highest value in the 30-day period, exceeds the value of the applicable emission limitation; or
(C) In the case of charging emissions, the 29-day logarithmic average, calculated in accordance with Method 303 in appendix A to this part by excluding the valid daily set of observations in the 30-day period that had the highest arithmetic average, exceeds the value of the applicable emission limitation.
(ii) Continue to implement such plan provisions until the visible emission limitation for the emission point is achieved for 90 consecutive days if work practice requirements are implemented pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. After the visible emission limitation for a particular emission point is achieved for 90 consecutive days, any exceedances prior to the beginning of the 90 days are not included in making a determination under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(2) The owner or operator of a coke oven battery not subject to visible emission limitations under this subpart until December 31, 1995, shall:
(i) Implement the provisions of the work practice plan pertaining to a particular emission point following the second exceedance in any consecutive 6-month period of a federally enforceable emission limitation for that emission point for coke oven doors, topside port lids, offtake systems, or charging operations by no later than 3 days after receipt of written notification from the applicable enforcement agency; and
(ii) Continue to implement such plan provisions for 90 consecutive days after the most recent written notification from the enforcement agency of an exceedance of the visible emission limitation.
(d)
Revisions to plan.
Revisions to the work practice emission control plan will be governed by the provisions in this paragraph (d) and in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The reviewing authority is the Administrator or the delegated State, local, or Tribal authority.
(1) The reviewing authority may request the owner or operator to review and revise as needed the work practice emission control plan for a particular emission point if there are 2 exceedances of the applicable visible emission limitation in the 6-month period that starts 30 days after the owner or operator is required to implement work practices under paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of a coke oven battery subject to visual emission limitations under this subpart, the second exceedance must be independent of the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(2) The reviewing authority may not request the owner or operator to review and revise the plan more than twice in any 12 consecutive month period for any particular emission point unless the reviewing authority disapproves the plan according to the provisions in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
(3) If the certified observer calculates that a second exceedance (or, if applicable, a second independent exceedance) has occurred, the certified observer shall notify the owner or operator. No later than 10 days after receipt of such a notification, the owner or operator shall notify the reviewing authority of any finding of whether work practices are related to the cause or the solution of the problem. The notification is subject to review by the reviewing authority according to the provisions in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
(4) The owner or operator shall submit a revised work practice plan within 60 days of notification from the reviewing authority under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, unless the reviewing authority grants an extension of time to submit the revised plan.
(5) If the reviewing authority requires a plan revision, the reviewing authority may require the plan to address a subject area or areas in addition to those in paragraph (b) of this section, if the reviewing authority determines that without plan coverage of such an additional subject area, there is a reasonable probability of further exceedances of the visible emission limitation for the emission point for which a plan revision is required.
(6) The reviewing authority may disapprove a plan revision required under
paragraph (d) of this section if the reviewing authority determines that the revised plan is inadequate to prevent exceedances of the visible emission limitation under this subpart for the emission point for which a plan revision is required or, in the case of a battery not subject to visual emission limitations under this subpart, other federally enforceable emission limitations for such emission point. The reviewing authority may also disapprove the finding that may be submitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section if the reviewing authority determines that a revised plan is needed to prevent exceedances of the applicable visible emission limitations.

Performance tests and procedures.
(a) Except as otherwise provided, a daily performance test shall be conducted each day, 7 days per week for each new and existing coke oven battery, the results of which shall be used in accordance with procedures specified in this subpart to determine compliance with each of the applicable visible emission limitations for coke oven doors, topside port lids, offtake systems, and charging operations in this subpart. If a facility pushes and charges only at night, then that facility must, at its option, change their schedule and charge during daylight hours or provide adequate lighting so that visible emission inspections can be made at night. “Adequate lighting” will be determined by the enforcement agency. The performance test should be based on representative performance (
i.e.,
performance based on the entire range of normal operating conditions) of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent the entire range of normal operations, including operational conditions for maximum emissions if such emissions are not expected during maximum production. You shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(1) Each performance test is to be conducted according to the procedures and requirements in this section and in Method 303 or 303A in appendix A to this part or Methods 9 and 22 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter (where applicable).

(3) Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2.
(4) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov,
and as described above, should include clear CBI markings. For performance test reports, the CBI should be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group; for all other reports and notifications, to the attention of the Coke Ovens Sector Lead. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(5) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: OAQPS Document Control Officer (C404-02), OAQPS, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, Attention Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group or Coke Oven Sector Lead as indicated in paragraph (k)(4) of this section. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.
(6) All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available.
(7) You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described in paragraphs (h), (i), or (j) of this section.
(l)
Fenceline monitoring recordkeeping.
For fenceline monitoring systems subject to § 63.314, each owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (l)(1) through (10) of this section on an ongoing basis.
(1) Coordinates of all fenceline monitors, including co-located samplers and field blanks, and if applicable, the meteorological station. The owner or operator shall determine the coordinates using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 3 meters. The coordinates shall be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places.
(2) The start and stop times and dates for each sample, as well as the tube identifying information.
(3) Sampling period average temperature and barometric pressure measurements.
(4) For each outlier determined in accordance with Section 9.2 of Method 325A in appendix A to this part, the sampler location of and the concentration of the outlier and the evidence used to conclude that the result is an outlier.
(5) For samples that will be adjusted for a background, the location of and the concentration measured simultaneously by the background sampler(s), and the perimeter samplers to which it applies.
(6) Individual sample results, the calculated Δc for benzene for each sampling period and the two samples used to determine it, whether background correction was used, and the annual average Δc calculated after each sampling period.
(7) Method detection limit for each sample, including co-located samples and blanks.
(8) Documentation of the root cause analysis and any corrective action taken each time the action level was exceeded, including the dates the root cause analysis was initiated and the resulting correction action(s) were taken.
(9) Any corrective action plan developed under § 63.314(e).
(10) Other records as required by Methods 325A and 325B in appendix A to this part.
(11) If a near-field source correction is used as provided in § 63.314(f), or if an alternative test method is used that provides time-resolved measurements, records of hourly meteorological data, including temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and wind direction, calculated daily unit vector wind direction and daily sigma theta, and other records specified in the site-specific monitoring plan.
