# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# INQUIRIES
For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd-numbered pages.

Acute dermal LD
50
means a statistically derived estimate of the single dermal dose of a substance that would cause 50 percent mortality to the test population under specified conditions.
Acute inhalation LC

(2) Any aquatic, terrestrial, outdoor, or forestry use pattern, if no product containing the active ingredient is currently registered for that use pattern; or
(3) Any additional use pattern that would result in a significant increase in the level of exposure, or a change in the route of exposure, to the active ingredient of man or other organisms.
Operated by the same producer,
when used with respect to two establishments, means that each such establishment is either owned by, or leased for operation by and under the control of, the same person. The term does not include establishments owned or operated by different persons, regardless of contractural agreement between such persons.
Package
or

Products stored in an area where finished products are ordinarily held for shipment, but which are not intended to be released for shipment must be physically separated and marked as not yet released for shipment. Once a product becomes released for shipment, the product remains in the condition of being released for shipment unless subsequent activities, such as relabeling or repackaging, constitute production.
Residential use
means use of a pesticide directly:
(1) On humans or pets,
(2) In, on, or around any structure, vehicle, article, surface, or area associated with the household, including but not limited to areas such as non-agricultural outbuildings, non-commercial greenhouses, pleasure boats and recreational vehicles, or

§ 152.5
Pests.
An organism is declared to be a pest under circumstances that make it deleterious to man or the environment, if it is:
(a) Any vertebrate animal other than man;
(b) Any invertebrate animal, including but not limited to, any insect, other arthropod, nematode, or mollusk such as a slug and snail, but excluding any internal parasite of living man or other living animals;
(c) Any plant growing where not wanted, including any moss, alga, liverwort, or other plant of any higher order, and any plant part such as a root; or
(d) Any fungus, bacterium, virus, prion, or other microorganism, except for those on or in living man or other living animals and those on or in processed food or processed animal feed,
beverages, drugs (as defined in FFDCA section 201(g)(1)) and cosmetics (as defined in FFDCA section 201(i)).

§ 152.6
Substances excluded from regulation by FIFRA.
Products and substances listed in this section are excluded from FIFRA regulation if they meet the specified conditions or criteria.
(a)
Liquid chemical sterilants.
A liquid chemical sterilant product is not a pesticide under section 2(u) of FIFRA if it meets all of the following criteria. Excluded products are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Products excluded are those meeting all of the following criteria:
(1)
Composition.
The product must be in liquid form as sold or distributed. Pressurized gases or products in dry or semi-solid form are not excluded by this provision. Ethylene oxide products are not liquid products and are not excluded by this provision.
(2)
Claims.
The product must bear a sterilant claim, or a sterilant plus subordinate level disinfection claim. Products that bear antimicrobial claims solely at a level less than “sterilant” are not excluded and are jointly regulated by EPA and FDA.
(3)
Use site.
(i) The product must be intended and labeled only for use on “critical or semi-critical devices.” A “critical device” is any device which is introduced directly into the human body, either into or in contact with the bloodstream or normally sterile areas of the body. A
semi-critical device
is any device which contacts intact mucous membranes but which does not ordinarily penetrate the blood barrier or otherwise enter normally sterile areas of the body.
(ii) Liquid chemical sterilants that bear claims solely for use on non-critical medical devices are jointly regulated by EPA and FDA.
(iii) Liquid chemical sterilants that bear claims solely for use on sites that are not medical devices, such as veterinary equipment, are not excluded and are regulated solely by EPA.
(b)
Nitrogen stabilizers.
A nitrogen stabilizer is excluded from regulation under FIFRA if it is a substance (or mixture of substances), meeting all of the following criteria:
(1) The substance prevents or hinders the process of nitrification, denitrification, ammonia volatilization, or urease production through action affecting soil bacteria and is distributed and sold solely for those purposes and no other pesticidal purposes. For purposes of this section, living organisms are not considered to be substances, and the actions of living organisms are not relevant to whether a substance is deemed to be a nitrogen stabilizer.
(2) The substance was in “commercial agronomic use” in the United States before January 1, 1992. EPA considers a substance to be in commercial agronomic use if it is available for sale or distribution to users for direct agronomic benefit, as opposed to limited research, experimental or demonstration use.
(3) The substance was not registered under FIFRA before January 1, 1992.
(4) Since January 1, 1992, the distributor or seller has made no claim that the product prevents or hinders the process of nitrification, denitrification, ammonia volatilization or urease production. EPA considers any of the following claims (or their equivalents) to be a claim that the product prevents or hinders nitrification, denitrification, ammonia volatilization or urease production:
(i) Improves crop utilization of applied nitrogen.
(ii) Reduces leaching of applied nitrogen or reduces groundwater nitrogen contamination.
(iii) Prevents nitrogen loss.
(iv) Prolongs availability of nitrogen.
(v) Increases nitrogen uptake, availability, usage, or efficiency.
(5) A product will be considered to have met the criterion of paragraph (b)(4) of this section that no nitrogen stabilization claim has been made if:
(i) The nitrogen stabilization claim, in whatever terms expressed, is made solely in compliance with a State requirement to include the claim in materials required to be submitted to a State legislative or regulatory authority, or in the labeling or other literature accompanying the product; and
(ii) The State requirement to include the claim was in effect both before the product bearing the claim was introduced into commercial agronomic use, and before the effective date of this rule.
(6) A product that meets all of the criteria of this paragraph with respect to one State is not thereby excluded from FIFRA regulation if distributed and sold in another State whose nitrogen stabilization statement requirement does not meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.
(c)
Human drugs.
Fungi, bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms in or on living man are not “pests” as defined in section 2(t) of FIFRA. Products intended and labeled for use against such organisms are human drugs subject to regulation by the FDA under the FFDCA.
(d)
Animal drugs.
(1) Fungi, viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms on or in living animals are not “pests” under section 2(t) of FIFRA. Products intended for use against such organisms are “animal drugs” regulated by the FDA under the FFDCA.
(2) A “new animal drug” as defined in section 201(w) of the FFDCA, or an animal drug that FDA has determined is not a “new animal drug” is not a pesticide under section 2(u) of FIFRA. Animal drugs are regulated by the FDA under the FFDCA.
(e)
Animal feeds.
An animal feed containing a new animal drug is not a pesticide under section 2(u) of FIFRA. An animal feed containing a new animal drug is subject to regulation by the FDA under the FFDCA.
(f)
Vitamin hormone products.
A product consisting of a mixture of plant hormones, plant nutrients, inoculants, or soil amendments is not a “plant regulator” under section 2(v) of FIFRA, provided it meets the following criteria:
(1) The product, in the undiluted package concentration at which it is distributed or sold, meets the criteria of § 156.62 of this chapter for Toxicity Category III or IV; and
(2) The product is not intended for use on food crop sites, and is labeled accordingly.
(g)
Products intended to aid the growth of desirable plants.
A product of any of the following types, intended only to aid the growth of desirable plants, is not a “plant regulator” under section 2(v) of FIFRA, and therefore is not a pesticide:
(1) A plant nutrient product, consisting of one or more macronutrients or micronutrient trace elements necessary to normal growth of plants and in a form readily usable by plants.
(2) A plant inoculant product consisting of microorganisms to be applied to the plant or soil for the purpose of enhancing the availability or uptake of plant nutrients through the root system.
(3) A soil amendment product containing a substance or substances intended for the purpose of improving soil characteristics favorable for plant growth.
[66 FR 64763, Dec. 14, 2001, as amended at 73 FR 75594, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 152.8
Products that are not pesticides because they are not for use against pests.
A substance or article is not a pesticide, because it is not intended for use against “pests” as defined in § 152.5, if it is:
(a) A fertilizer product not containing a pesticide.
(b) A product intended to force bees from hives for the collection of honey crops.
[53 FR 15975, May 4, 1988, as amended at 66 FR 64764, Dec. 14, 2001]
§ 152.10
Products that are not pesticides because they are not intended for a pesticidal purpose.
A product that is not intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate a pest, or to defoliate, desiccate or regulate the growth of plants, is not considered to be a pesticide. The following types of products or articles are not considered to be pesticides unless a pesticidal claim is made on their labeling or in connection with their sale and distribution:
(a) Deodorizers, bleaches, and cleaning agents;
(b) Products not containing toxicants, intended only to attract pests for survey or detection purposes, and labeled accordingly;
(c) Products that are intended to exclude pests only by providing a physical barrier against pest access, and which contain no toxicants, such as certain pruning paints to trees.
§ 152.15
Pesticide products required to be registered.
No person may distribute or sell any pesticide product that is not registered under the Act, except as provided in §§ 152.20, 152.25, and 152.30. A pesticide is any substance (or mixture of substances) intended for a pesticidal purpose,
i.e.
, use for the purpose of preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest or use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant. A substance is considered to be intended for a pesticidal purpose, and thus to be a pesticide requiring registration, if:
(a) The person who distributes or sells the substance claims, states, or implies (by labeling or otherwise):
(1) That the substance (either by itself or in combination with any other substance) can or should be used as a pesticide; or
(2) That the substance consists of or contains an active ingredient and that it can be used to manufacture a pesticide; or
(b) The substance consists of or contains one or more active ingredients and has no significant commercially valuable use as distributed or sold other than (1) use for pesticidal purpose (by itself or in combination with any other substance), (2) use for manufacture of a pesticide; or
(c) The person who distributes or sells the substance has actual or constructive knowledge that the substance will be used, or is intended to be used, for a pesticidal purpose.

# Subpart B—Exemptions

# Source:
53 FR 15977, May 4, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 152.20
Exemptions for pesticides adequately regulated by another Federal agency.
The pesticides or classes of pesticide listed in this section are exempt from all requirements of FIFRA. The Agency has determined, in accordance with FIFRA sec. 25(b)(1), that they are adequately regulated by another Federal agency.
(a)
Certain biological control agents.
(1) Except as provided by paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, all biological control agents are exempt from FIFRA requirements.
(2) If the Agency determines that an individual biological control agent or class of biological control agents is no longer adequately regulated by another Federal agency, and that it should not otherwise be exempted from the requirements of FIFRA, the Agency will revoke this exemption by amending paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(3) The following biological control agents are not exempt from FIFRA requirements:
(i) A eucaryotic microorganism including, but not limited to, protozoa, algae and fungi;
(ii) A procaryotic microorganism including, but not limited to, Eubacteria and Archaebacteria; or
(iii) A parasitically-replicating microscopic element, including, but not limited to, viruses.
(4) All living plants intended for use as biological control agents are exempt from the requirements of FIFRA. However, plant-incorporated protectants are not exempt pursuant to this section. Regulations, including exemptions, for plant-incorporated protectants are addressed in part 174 of this chapter.
(b)
Non-liquid chemical sterilants.
A non-liquid chemical sterilant, except ethylene oxide, that meets the criteria of § 152.6(a)(2) with respect to its claims and § 152.6(a)(3) with respect to its use sites is exempted from regulation under FIFRA.
[53 FR 15977, May 4, 1988, as amended at 66 FR 37814, July 19, 2001; 66 FR 64764, Dec. 14, 2001; 72 FR 61027, Oct. 26, 2007]
§ 152.25
Exemptions for pesticides of a character not requiring FIFRA regulation.
The pesticides or classes of pesticides listed in this section have been determined to be of a character not requiring regulation under FIFRA, and are therefore exempt from all provisions of FIFRA when intended for use, and used, only in the manner specified.
(a)
Treated articles or substances.
An article or substance treated with, or containing, a pesticide to protect the article or substance itself (for example, paint treated with a pesticide to protect the paint coating, or wood products treated to protect the wood against insect or fungus infestation), if the pesticide is registered for such use.
(b)
Pheromones and pheromone traps.
Pheromones and identical or substantially similar compounds labeled for use only in pheromone traps (or labeled for use in a manner which the Administrator determines poses no greater risk of adverse effects on the environment than use in pheromone traps), and pheromone traps in which those compounds are the sole active ingredient(s).
(1) For the purposes of this paragraph, a pheromone is a compound produced by an arthropod which, alone or in combination with other such compounds, modifies the behavior of other individuals of the same species.
(2) For the purposes of this paragraph, a synthetically produced compound is identical to a pheromone only when their molecular structures are identical, or when the only differences between the molecular structures are between the stereochemical isomer ratios of the two compounds, except that a synthetic compound found to have toxicological properties significantly different from a pheromone is not identical.
(3) When a compound possesses many characteristics of a pheromone but does not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it may, after review by the Agency, be deemed a substantially similar compound.
(4) For the purposes of this paragraph, a pheromone trap is a device containing a pheromone or an identical or substantially similar compound used for the sole purpose of attracting, and trapping or killing, target arthropods. Pheromone traps are intended to achieve pest control by removal of target organisms from their natural environment and do not result in increased levels of pheromones or identical or substantially similar compounds over a significant fraction of the treated area.
(c)
Preservatives for biological specimens.
(1) Embalming fluids.
(2) Products used to preserve animal or animal organ specimens, in mortuaries, laboratories, hospitals, museums and institutions of learning.
(3) Products used to preserve the integrity of milk, urine, blood, or other body fluids for laboratory analysis.
(d)
Foods.
Products consisting of foods and containing no active ingredients, which are used to attract pests.
(e)
Natural cedar.
(1) Natural cedar blocks, chips, shavings, balls, chests, drawer liners, paneling, and needles that meet all of the following criteria:
(i) The product consists totally of cedarwood or natural cedar.
(ii) The product is not treated, combined, or impregnated with any additional substance(s).
(iii) The product bears claims or directions for use solely to repel arthropods other than ticks or to retard mildew, and no additional claims are made in sale or distribution. The labeling must be limited to specific arthropods, or must exclude ticks if any general term such as “arthropods,” “insects,” “bugs,” or any other broad inclusive term, is used. The exemption does not apply to natural cedar products claimed to repel ticks.
(2) The exemption does not apply to cedar oil, or formulated products which contain cedar oil, other cedar extracts, or ground cedar wood as part of a mixture.
(f)
Minimum risk pesticides
—(1)
Exempted products.
Products containing the following active ingredients, alone or in combination with other substances listed in table 1 of this paragraph, are exempt from the requirements of FIFRA provided that all of the criteria of this section are met. All listed active ingredients may be used in non-food use products. Under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and EPA (FFDCA) implementing regulations at part 180 of this chapter, food and animal feed in commerce can bear pesticide residues only for those ingredients that have tolerances or tolerance exemptions in part 180 of this chapter. Such tolerances or exemptions may be found, for example, in §§ 180.950, 180.1071, 180.1087, 180.1233, and 180.1251 of this chapter.

# Subpart C—Registration Procedures

# Source:
53 FR 15978, May 4, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 152.40
Who may apply.
Any person may apply for new registration of a pesticide product. Any registrant may apply for amendment of the registration of his product.
§ 152.42
Application for new registration.
Any person seeking to obtain a registration for a new pesticide product must submit an application for registration, containing the information specified in § 152.50. An application for new registration must be approved by the Agency before the product may legally be distributed or sold, except as provided by § 152.30.
§ 152.43
Alternate formulations.
(a) A product proposed for registration must have a single, defined composition, except that EPA may approve a basic formulation and one or more alternate formulations for a single product.
(b) An alternate formulation must meet the criteria listed in paragraph (b) (1) through (4) of this section. The Agency may require the submission of data to determine whether the criteria have been met.
(1) The alternate formulation must have the same certified limits for each active ingredient as the basic formulation.
(2) If the alternate formulation contains an inert ingredient or impurity of
toxicological significance, the formulation must have the same upper certified limit for that substance as the basic formulation;
(3) The label text of the alternate formulation product must be identical to that of the basic formulation.
(4) The analytical method required under § 158.355 of this chapter must be suitable for use on both the basic formulation and the alternate formulation.
(c) Notwithstanding the criteria in this section, the Agency may determine that an alternate formulation must be separately registered. If EPA makes this determination, the Agency will notify the applicant of its determination and its reasons. Thereafter the application for an alternate formulation will be treated as an application for new registration, and the alternate formulation will be assigned a new registration number.
[53 FR 15978, May 4, 1988, as amended at 72 FR 61027, Oct. 26, 2007]
§ 152.44
Application for amended registration.
(a) Except as provided by § 152.46, any modification in the composition, labeling, or packaging of a registered product must be submitted with an application for amended registration. The applicant must submit the information required by § 152.50, as applicable to the change requested. If an application for amended registration is required, the application must be approved by the Agency before the product, as modified, may legally be distributed or sold.
(b) In its discretion, the Agency may:
(1) Waive the requirement for submission of an application for amended registration;
(2) Require that the applicant certify to the Agency that he has complied with an Agency directive rather than submit an application for amended registration; or
(3) Permit an applicant to modify a registration by notification or non-notification in accordance with § 152.46.
(c) A registrant may at any time submit identical minor labeling amendments affecting a number of products as a single application if no data are required for EPA to approve the amendment (for example, a change in the wording of a storage statement for designated residential use products). A consolidated application must clearly identify the labeling modification(s) to be made (which must be identical for all products included in the application), list the registration number of each product for which the modification is requested, and provide required supporting materials (for example, labeling) for each affected product.
[53 FR 15978, May 4, 1988, as amended at 61 FR 33041, June 26, 1996; 66 FR 64764, Dec. 14, 2001]
§ 152.46
Notification and non-notification changes to registrations.
(a)
Changes permitted by notification.
(1) EPA may determine that certain minor modifications to registration having no potential to cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment may be accomplished by notification to the Agency, without requiring that the registrant obtain Agency approval. If EPA so determines, it will issue procedures following an opportunity for public comment describing the types of modifications permitted by notification and any conditions and procedures for submitting notifications.
(2) A registrant may modify a registration consistent with paragraph (a)(1) of this section and any procedures issued thereunder and distribute or sell the modified product as soon as the Agency has received the notification. Based upon the notification, the Agency may require that the registrant submit an application for amended registration. If it does so, the Agency will notify the registrant and state its reasons for requiring an application for amended registration. Thereafter, if the registrant fails to submit an application the Agency may determine that the product is not in compliance with the requirements of the Act. Notification under this paragraph is considered a report filed under the Act for the purposes of FIFRA section 12(a)(2)(M).
(b)
Changes permitted without notification.
EPA may determine that certain minor modifications to registration having no potential to cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment may be accomplished without notification to or approval by the Agency. If
EPA so determines, it will issue procedures following an opportunity for public comment describing the types of amendments permitted without notification (also known as non-notification). A registrant may distribute or sell a product changed in a manner consistent with such procedures without notification to or approval by the Agency.
(c)
Effect of non-compliance.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the Agency determines that a product has been modified through notification or without notification in a manner inconsistent with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section and any procedures issued thereunder, the Agency may initiate regulatory and/or enforcement action without first providing the registrant with an opportunity to submit an application for amended registration.
[61 FR 33041, June 26, 1996]
§ 152.50
Contents of application.
Each application for registration or amended registration must include the following information, as applicable:
(a)
Application form.
An application form must be completed and submitted to the Agency. Application forms are provided by the Agency, with instructions as to the number of copies required and proper completion.
(b)
Identity of the applicant
—(1)
Name.
The applicant must identify himself. An applicant not residing in the United States must also designate an agent in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section to act on behalf of the applicant on all registration matters.
(2)
Address of record.
The applicant must provide an address in the United States for correspondence purposes. The U.S. address provided will be considered the applicant's address of record, and EPA will send all correspondence concerning the application and any subsequent registration to that address. It is the responsibility of the applicant and any registrant under § 152.122 to ensure that the Agency has a current and accurate address.
(3)
Authorized agent.
An applicant may designate a person residing in the United States to act as his agent. If an applicant wishes to designate an agent, he must send the Agency a letter stating the name and United States address of his agent. The applicant must notify the Agency if he changes his designated agent. This relationship may be terminated at any time by the applicant by notifying the Agency in writing.
(4)
Company number.
If an applicant has been assigned a company number by the Agency, the application must reference that number.
(c)
Summary of the application.
Each application must include a list of the data submitted with the application, together with a brief description of the results of the studies. The list of data submitted may be the same as the list required by § 158.32 or § 161.32, as applicable, of this chapter. The summary must state that it is releasable to the public after registration in accordance with § 152.119.
(d)
Identity of the product.
The product for which application is being submitted must be identified. The following information is required:
(1) The product name;
(2) The trade name(s) (if different); and
(3) The EPA Registration Number, if currently registered.
(e)
Draft labeling.
Each application for new registration must be accompanied by five legible copies of draft labeling (typescript or mock-up). Each application for amended registration that proposes to make any changes in the product labeling must be accompanied by five legible copies of draft labeling incorporating the proposed labeling changes. If the proposed labeling change affects only a portion of the labeling, such as the use directions, the applicant may submit five copies of that portion of the label which is the subject of the amendment. Upon request, an applicant for amended registration must submit a complete label to consolidate amendments.
(f)
Registration data requirements.
(1) An applicant must submit materials to demonstrate that he has complied with the FIFRA sec. 3(c)(1)(F) and subpart E of this part with respect to satisfaction of data requirements, to enable the Agency to make the determination required by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5)(B). Required items are described in subpart E of this part.
(2) An applicant must furnish any data specified in part 158 or part 161 of this chapter, as applicable, of this chapter which are required by the Agency to determine that the product meets the registration standards of FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) or (7). Each study must comply with:

# Subpart E—Satisfaction of Data Requirements and Protection of Data Submitters' Rights

# Source:
49 FR 30903, Aug. 1, 1984, unless otherwise noted.
§ 152.80
General.
This subpart E describes the information that an applicant must submit with his application for registration or amended registration to comply (and for the Agency to determine compliance) with the provisions of FIFRA sec. 3(c)(1)(F). This subpart also describes the procedures by which data submitters may challenge registration actions which allegedly failed to comply with these procedures. If the Agency determines that an applicant has failed to comply with the requirements and procedures in this subpart, the application
may be denied. If the Agency determines, after registration has been issued, that an applicant failed to comply with these procedures and requirements, the Agency may issue a notice of intent to cancel the product's registration.
[73 FR 75594, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 152.81
Applicability.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the requirements of this subpart apply to:
(1) Each application for registration of a new product.
(2) Each application for amended registration of a currently registered product.
(3) Each submission in response to a Data Call-In under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) section 3(c)(2)(B) for an existing registration, including but not limited to, a product subject to reregistration under FIFRA section 4 or registration review under FIFRA section 3(g). If the Data Call-In establishes procedures for protection of data submitters' rights, recipients must comply with the specific requirements of the Data Call-In rather than the generic procedures set forth in §§ 152.85 through 152.96.
(b) This subpart does not apply to any of the following:
(1) An application for registration submitted to a State under FIFRA section 24(c).
(2) An application for an experimental use permit (EUP) under FIFRA section 5.
(3) An application for an emergency exemption under FIFRA section 18.
(4) A request for cancellation of a registration, or a request for deletion of one or more existing uses, under FIFRA section 6(f).
(5) A modification to registration of a currently registered product that may be accomplished under the notification or non-notification provisions of § 152.46 and any procedures issued thereunder. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, compliance with this subpart is required if the Administrator has, by written notice under § 152.46, determined that the modification may not be accomplished by notification or non-notification.
(6) Any type of amendment if the Administrator determines, by written finding, that Agency consideration of data would not be necessary in order to approve the amendment under FIFRA section 3(c)(5).
(7) Compliance with Agency regulations, adjudicatory hearing decisions, notices, or other Agency announcements that unless the registration is amended in the manner the Agency proposes, the product's registration will be suspended or canceled, or that a hearing will be held under FIFRA section 6. However, this paragraph does not apply to amendments designed to avoid cancellation or suspension threatened under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B) or because of failure to submit data.

[79 FR 6825, Feb. 5, 2014]
§ 152.85
Formulators' exemption.
(a)
Statutory provision.
FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(D) excuses an applicant from the requirement to submit or cite data pertaining to any pesticide contained in his product that is derived solely from one or more EPA-registered products which the applicant purchases from another person. This provision is commonly referred to as the formulators' exemption.
(b)
Applicability of the formulators' exemption.
(1) The formulators' exemption applies only to data concerning the purchased product or its ingredients. These data may include, but are not limited to, product chemistry, toxicology, residue chemistry, exposure, environmental fate, and ecological effects.
(2) The data to which the formulators' exemption applies usually will concern the safety of one or more of the product's active ingredients, specifically, those active ingredients which are contained in the purchased product. In general, data for which the required test substance is the technical grade of the active ingredient, the pure active ingredient, the radiolabeled pure active ingredient, or a typical end-use product are eligible for the formulators' exemption.
(3) The formulators' exemption generally does not apply to data on the applicant's product itself, including the safety or efficacy of the product, unless the composition of the product is identical to the purchased product. In general, data for which the required test substance is the product proposed for registration are not eligible for the formulators' exemption.
(c)
Limitation of the formulators' exemption.
EPA interprets FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(D) as allowing an applicant to use the formulators' exemption with respect to data concerning an ingredient of his product only if:
(1) The application indicates that the ingredient's presence in the product is attributable solely to the purchase from another person of an identified, registered product containing that ingredient and the use of the purchased product in formulating the product; and
(2) The purchased product is a registered manufacturing-use product whose label does not prohibit its use for making an end-use product labeled for any use for which the applicant's product will be labeled; or
(3) The purchased product is a registered end-use product labeled for each use for which the applicant's product will be labeled.
(d)
Claiming eligibility for the exemption.
(1) If the product contains one or more ingredients eligible for the formulators' exemption, the applicant need not comply with the requirements of §§ 152.90 through 152.96 with respect to any data requirement pertaining to such ingredient, provided that he submits to the Agency a certification statement containing the following information (a form for this purpose is available from the Agency):
(i) Identification of the applicant, and of the product by EPA registration number or file symbol.
(ii) Identification of each ingredient in the pesticide that is eligible for the formulators' exemption, and the EPA registration number of the product that is the source of that ingredient.
(iii) A statement that the listed ingredients meet the requirements for the formulators' exemption.
(iv) A statement that the applicant has submitted (either previously or with the current application) a complete, accurate and current Confidential Statement of Formula.
(v) The name, title and signature of the applicant or his authorized representative and the date of signature.
(2) An applicant for amended registration is not required to submit a new formulators' exemption statement, if the current statement in Agency files is complete and accurate.
(e)
Approval of registration.
Notwithstanding FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(D), EPA will not approve an application unless there are available to EPA for its review all data that are necessary to make the required risk/benefit finding under FIFRA section 3(c)(5) or section 3(c)(7).
[72 FR 61027, Oct. 26, 2007]

(2) No court order prohibits the transfer, and any required court approvals have been obtained; and
(3) The transfer is authorized under Federal, State, and local law and relevant corporate charters, bylaws or partnership agreements.
(c) The Agency will acknowledge the transfer of the data by notifying both transferor and transferee, and will state the effective date of the transfer. Thereafter the transferee will be considered to be the original data submitter of the items of data transferred for all purposes under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F), unless a new transfer agreement is submitted to the Agency.

§ 152.99
Petitions to cancel registration.
An original data submitter may petition the Agency to deny or cancel the registration of a product in accordance with this section if he has submitted to the Agency a valid study which, he claims, satisfies a data requirement that an applicant purportedly has failed to satisfy.
(a)
Grounds for petition.
(1) If an applicant has offered to pay compensation to an original data submitter of a study (either specifically or by filing a general offer to pay statement), the original data submitter may petition the Agency to deny or cancel the registration to which the offer related on any of the following grounds:
(i) The applicant has failed to participate in an agreed-upon procedure for reaching an agreement on the amount and terms of compensation. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the agreed-upon procedure and describe the applicant's failure to participate in the procedure.
(ii) The applicant has failed to comply with the terms of an agreement on compensation. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the agreement, and shall describe how the applicant has failed to comply with the agreement.
(iii) The applicant has failed to participate in an arbitration proceeding. The petitioner shall submit evidence of such failure.
(iv) The applicant has failed to comply with the terms of an arbitration decision. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the arbitration decision, and describe how the applicant has failed to comply with the decision.
(2) When no offer to pay has been made, the petitioner shall state in his petition the basis for the challenge, and describe how the failure of the applicant to comply with the procedures
of this subpart has deprived him of the rights accorded him under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F). Possible grounds for challenge include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) The applicant has failed to list a data requirement applicable to his product, or has failed to demonstrate compliance with all applicable data requirements.
(ii) The applicant has submitted or cited a study that is not valid.
(iii) The applicant has submitted or cited a study that does not satisfy the data requirement for which it was submitted or cited.
(iv) The applicant has falsely or improperly claimed that a data gap existed at the time of his application.
(v) The applicant has submitted or cited a study originally submitted by the petitioner, without the required authorization or offer to pay.
(b)
Procedure for petition to the Agency
—(1)
Time for filing.
A petition under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be filed at any time that the circumstances warrant. A petition under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be filed within one year after the Agency makes public the issuance of the registration.
(2)
Notice to affected registrant.
At the same time that the petitioner files his petition with the Agency, the petitioner shall send a copy to the affected applicant or registrant by certified mail or by any other method that provides evidence of delivery. The affected applicant or registrant shall have 60 days from the date of receipt of the petition to submit written comments to the Agency.
(c)
Disposition of petitions.
The Agency will consider the material submitted by the petitioner and the response, if any, by the affected applicant or registrant.
(1) If the Agency determines that the petition is without merit, it will inform the petitioner and the affected applicant or registrant that the petition is denied. Denial of a petition is a final Agency action.
(2) If the Agency determines that an applicant has acted in any way described by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Agency will notify the petitioner and the affected applicant or registrant that it intends to deny or cancel the registration of the product in support of which the data were cited. The affected applicant or registrant will have 15 days from the date of delivery of this notice to respond. If the Agency determines, after considering any response, that the affected applicant or registrant has acted in the ways described by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Agency will deny or cancel the registration without further hearing. Refer to FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F)(ii). Denial or cancellation of a registration is a final Agency action.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the Agency determines that an applicant for registration of a product has acted in any way that deprives an original data submitter of rights under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F), the Agency will take steps to deny the application or cancel the registration, as appropriate. The procedures in FIFRA section 3(c)(6) or section 6(b) shall be followed. Denial or cancellation is a final Agency action.
(d)
Hearing.
Any hearing will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 164. The only matter for resolution at the hearing shall be whether the registrant failed to comply with the requirements and procedures of FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F) or of this subpart, in the manner described by the petitioner. A decision following a hearing shall be final.
[49 FR 30903, Aug. 1, 1984, as amended at 73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008; 79 FR 6826, Feb. 5, 2014]

# Subpart F—Agency Review of Applications

# Source:
53 FR 15980, May 4, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 152.100
Scope.
(a) The Agency will follow the procedures in this subpart for all applications for registration, except an application for registration of a pesticide that has been the subject of a previous Agency cancellation or suspension notice under FIFRA sec. 6.
(b) The Agency will follow the procedures of subpart D of part 164 of this chapter in evaluating any application
for registration of a pesticide involving use of the pesticide in a manner that is prohibited by a suspension or cancellation order, to the extent required by subpart D of part 164.
§ 152.102
Publication.
The Agency will issue in the
Federal Register
a notice of receipt of each application for registration of a product that contains a new active ingredient or that proposes a new use. After registration of the product, the Agency will issue in the
Federal Register
a notice of issuance. The notice of issuance will describe the new chemical or new use, summarize the Agency's regulatory conclusions, list missing data and the conditions for their submission, and respond to comments received on the notice of application.
§ 152.104
Completeness of applications.
The applicant is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information submitted in connection with the application. The Agency will review each application to determine whether it is complete. An application is incomplete if any pertinent item specified in § 152.50 has not been submitted, or has been incorrectly submitted (for example, data required by part 158, or part 161 of this chapter, as applicable, and not submitted in accordance with the requirements for format, claims of confidential business information, or flagging).
[72 FR 61028, Oct. 26, 2007]
§ 152.105
Incomplete applications.
The Agency will not begin or continue the review of an application that is incomplete. If the Agency determines that an application is incomplete or that further information is needed in order to complete the Agency's review, the Agency will notify the applicant of the deficiencies and allow the applicant 75 days to make corrections or additions to complete the application. If the applicant believes that the deficiencies cannot be corrected within 75 days, he must notify the Agency within those 75 days of the date on which he expects to complete the application. If, after 75 days, the applicant has not responded, or if the applicant subsequently fails to complete the application within the time scheduled for completion, the Agency will terminate any action on such application, and will treat the application as if it had been withdrawn by the applicant. Any subsequent submission relating to the same product must be submitted as a new application.
§ 152.107
Review of data.
(a) The Agency normally will review data submitted with an application that have not previously been submitted to the Agency.
(b) The Agency normally will review other data submitted or cited by an applicant only:
(1) As part of the process of reregistering currently registered products;
(2) When acting on an application for registration of a product containing a new active ingredient;
(3) If such data have been flagged in accordance with § 158.34 or § 161.34 of this chapter; or
(4) When the Agency determines that it would otherwise serve the public interest.
(c) If the Agency finds that it needs additional data in order to determine whether the product may be registered, it will notify the applicant as early as possible in the review process.
[53 FR 15980, May 4, 1988, as amended at 72 FR 61028, Oct. 26, 2007]
§ 152.108
Review of labeling.
The Agency will review all draft labeling submitted with the application. If an applicant for amended registration submits only that portion of the labeling proposed for amendment, the Agency may review the entire label, as revised by the proposed changes, in deciding whether to approve the amendment. The Agency will not approve final printed labeling, but will selectively review it for compliance.
§ 152.110
Time for agency review.
The Agency will complete its review of applications as expeditiously as possible. Applications subject to specific timeframes under the fee schedule established by FIFRA section 33 will be
reviewed within the timeframes established for the application or action type.
[73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 152.111
Choice of standards for review of applications.
The Agency has discretion to review applications under either the unconditional registration criteria of FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) or the conditional registration criteria of FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7). The type of review chosen depends primarily on the extent to which the relevant data base has been reviewed for completeness and scientific validity. EPA conducts data reviews needed to support unconditional registrations on a chemical-by-chemical basis, according to an established priority list. Except for applications for registration of a new active ingredient or in special cases where it finds immediate review to be warranted, the Agency will not commence a complete review of the existing data base on a given chemical in response to receipt of an application for registration. Instead the Agency will review the application using the criteria for conditional registration in FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7) (A) and (B).
§ 152.112
Approval of registration under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5).
EPA will approve an application under the criteria of FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) only if:
(a) The Agency has determined that the application is complete and is accompanied by all materials required by the Act and this part, including, but not limited to, evidence of compliance with subpart E of this part;
(b) The Agency has reviewed all relevant data in the possession of the Agency (see §§ 152.107 and 152.111);
(c) The Agency has determined that no additional data are necessary to make the determinations required by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) with respect to the pesticide product which is the subject of the application;
(d) The Agency has determined that the composition of the product is such as to warrant the proposed efficacy claims for it, if efficacy data are required to be submitted for the product by part 158 or part 161 of this chapter, as applicable.
(e) The Agency has determined that the product will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, and that, when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, the product will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment;
(f) The Agency has determined that the product is not misbranded as that term is defined in FIFRA sec. 2(q) and part 156 of this chapter, and its labeling and packaging comply with the applicable requirements of the Act, this part, and parts 156 and 157 of this chapter;
(g) If the proposed labeling bears directions for use on food, animal feed, or food or feed crops, or if the intended use of the pesticide results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in pesticide residues (including residues of any active or inert ingredient of the product, or of any metabolite or degradation product thereof) in or on food or animal feed, all necessary tolerances, exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance, and food additive regulations have been issued under FFDCA sec. 408, and
(h) If the product, in addition to being a pesticide, is a drug within the meaning of FFDCA sec. 201(q), the Agency has been notified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the product complies with any requirements imposed by FDA.
[53 FR 15980, May 4, 1988, as amended at 72 FR 61028, Oct. 26, 2007; 73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 152.113
Approval of registration under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)—Products that do not contain a new active ingredient.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Agency may approve an application for registration or amended registration of a pesticide product, each of whose active ingredients is contained in one or more other registered peticide products, only if the Agency has determined that:
(1) It possesses all data necessary to make the determinations required by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)(A) or (B) with respect to the pesticide product which is
the subject of the application (including, at a minimum, data needed to characterize any incremental risk that would result from approval of the application);
(2) Approval of the application would not significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment; and
(3) The criteria of § 152.112(a), (d), and (f) through (h) have been satisfied.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency will not approve the conditional registration of any pesticide under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)(A) unless the Agency has determined that the applicant's product and its proposed use are identical or substantially similar to a currently registered pesticide and use, or that the pesticide and its proposed use differ only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency will not approve the conditional registration of any pesticide product for a new use under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)(B) if:
(1) The pesticide is the subject of a special review, based on a use of the product that results in human dietary exposure; and
(2) The proposed new use involves use on a major food or feed crop, or involves use on a minor food or feed crop for which there is available an effective alternative registered pesticide which does not meet the risk criteria associated with human dietary exposure. The determination of available and effective alternatives shall be made with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture.
§ 152.114
Approval of registration under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7)—Products that contain a new active ingredient.
An application for registration of a pesticide containing an active ingredient not in any currently registered product may be conditionally approved for a period of time sufficient for the generation and submission of certain of the data necessary for a finding of registrability under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) if the Agency determines that:
(a) Insufficient time has elapsed since the imposition of the data requirement for those data to have been developed;
(b) All other required test data and materials have been submitted to the Agency;
(c) The criteria in § 152.112(a), (b), (d), and (f) through (h) have been satisfied;
(d) The use of the pesticide product during the period of the conditional registration will not cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment; and
(e) The registration of the pesticide product and its subsequent use during the period of the conditional registration are in the public interest.
§ 152.115
Conditions of registration.
(a)
Substantially similar products and new uses.
Each registration issued under § 152.113 shall be conditioned upon the submission or citation by the registrant of all data which are required for unconditional registration of his product under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5), but which have not yet been submitted, no later than the time such data are required to be submitted for similar pesticide products already registered. If a notice requiring submission of such data has been issued under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(2)(B) prior to the date of approval of the application, the applicant must submit or cite the data described by that notice at the time specified by that notice. The applicant must agree to these conditions before the application may be approved.
(b)
New active ingredients.
Each registration issued under § 152.114 shall be conditioned upon the applicant's agreement to each of the following conditions:
(1) The applicant will submit remaining required data (and interim reports if required) in accordance with a schedule approved by the Agency.
(2) The registration will expire upon a date established by the Agency, if the registrant fails to submit data as required by the Agency. The expiration date will be established based upon the length of time necessary to generate and submit the required data. If the studies are submitted in a timely manner, the registration will be cancelled if the Agency determines, based on the
data (alone, or in conjuction with other data), that the product or one or more of its uses meets or exceeds any of the risk criteria established by the Agency to initiate a special review. If the Agency so determines, it will issue to the registrant a Notice of Intent to Cancel under FIFRA sec. 6(e), and will specify any provisions for sale and distribution of existing stocks of the pesticide product.
(3) The applicant will submit an annual report of the production of the product.
(c)
Other conditions.
The Agency may establish, on a case-by-case basis, other conditions applicable to registrations to be issued under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(7).
(d)
Cancellation if condition is not satisfied.
If any condition of the registration of the product is not satisfied, or if the Agency determines that the registrant has failed to initiate or pursue appropriate action towards fulfillment of any condition, the Agency will issue a notice of intent to cancel under FIFRA sec. 6(e).
[53 FR 15980, May 4, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 32096, June 19, 1995]
§ 152.116
Notice of intent to register to original submitters of exclusive use data.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, at least 30 days before registration of a product containing an active ingredient for which a previously submitted study is eligible for exclusive use under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(1)(F)(i), the Agency will notify the original submitter of the exclusive use study of the intended registration of the product. If requested by the exclusive use data submitter within 30 days, the Agency will also provide the applicant's list of data requirements and method of demonstrating compliance with each data requirement.
(b) Within 30 days after receipt of the Agency's notice, or of the applicant's list of data requirements, whichever is later, the exclusive use data submitter may challenge the issuance of the registration in accordance with the procedures in § 152.99 (b) and (c). If the Agency finds that the challenge has merit, it will issue a notice of denial of the application. The applicant may then avail himself of the hearing procedures provided by FIFRA sec. 3(c)(6). If the Agency finds that the challenge is without merit, it will deny the petition and register the applicant's product. Denial of the petition is a final Agency action.
(c) If an applicant has submitted to the Agency a certification from an exclusive use data submitter that he is aware of the applicant's application for registration, and does not object to the issuance of the registration, the Agency will not provide the 30-day notification described in paragraph (a) of this section to that exclusive use data submitter.
[53 FR 15980, May 4, 1988, as amended at 73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 152.117
Notification to applicant.
The Agency will notify the applicant of the approval of his application by a Notice of Registration for new registration, or by a letter in the case of an amended registration.
§ 152.118
Denial of application.
(a)
Basis for denial.
The Agency may deny an application for registration if the Agency determines that the pesticide product does not meet the criteria for registration under either FIFRA sec. 3(c)(5) or (7), as specified in §§ 152.112 through 152.114.
(b)
Notification of applicant.
If the Agency determines that an application should be denied, it will notify the applicant by certified letter. The letter will set forth the reasons and factual basis for the determination with conditions, if any, which must be fulfilled in order for the registration to be approved.
(c)
Opportunity for remedy by the applicant.
The applicant will have 30 days from the date of receipt of the certified letter to take the specified corrective action. During this time the applicant may request that his application be withdrawn.
(d)
Notice of denial.
If the applicant fails to correct the deficiencies within the 30-day period, the Agency may issue a notice of denial, which will be published in the
Federal Register,
and which will set forth the reasons and the factual basis for the denial.
(e)
Hearing rights.
Within 30 days following the publication of the notice of
denial, an applicant, or any interested person with written authorization of the applicant, may request a hearing in accordance with FIFRA sec. 6(b). Hearings will be conducted in accordance with part 164 of this chapter.
§ 152.119
Availability of material in support of registration.
(a) The information submitted to support a registration application shall be part of the official Agency file for that registration.
(b) Within 30 days after registration, the Agency will make available for public inspection, upon request, the materials required by subpart E to be submitted with an application. Materials that will be publicly available include an applicant's list of data requirements, the method used by the applicant to demonstrate compliance for each data requirement, and the applicant's citations of specific studies in the Agency's possession if applicable.
(c) Except as provided by FIFRA sec. 10, within 30 days after registration, the data on which the Agency based its decision to register the product will be made available for public inspection, upon request, in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2.

# Subpart G—Obligations and Rights of Registrants

# Source:
53 FR 15983, May 4, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 152.122
Currency of address of record and authorized agent.
(a) The registrant must keep the Agency informed of his current name and address of record. If the Agency's good faith attempts to contact the registrant are not successful, the Agency will issue in the
Federal Register
a notice of intent to cancel all products of the registrant under FIFRA sec. 6(b). The registrant must respond within 30 days requesting that the registrations be maintained in effect, and providing his name and address of record. If no response is received, the cancellations will become effective at the end of 30 days without further notice to the registrant. The Agency may make provision for the sale and distribution of existing stocks of such products after the effective date of cancellation.
(b) The registrant must also notify the Agency if he changes his authorized agent.
§ 152.125
Submission of information pertaining to adverse effects.
If at any time the registrant receives or becomes aware of any factual information regarding unreasonable adverse effects of the pesticide on the environment that has not previously been submitted to the Agency, the registrant shall, in accordance with FIFRA section 6(a)(2) and the requirements of part 159, subpart D of this chapter, provide such information to the Agency, clearly identified as FIFRA 6(a)(2) data.
[73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 152.130
Distribution under approved labeling.
(a) A registrant may distribute or sell a registered product with the composition, packaging and labeling currently approved by the Agency.
(b) A registrant may distribute or sell a product under labeling bearing any subset of the approved directions for use, provided that in limiting the uses listed on the label, no changes would be necessary in precautionary statements, use classification, or packaging of the product.
(c) Normally, if the product labeling is amended on the initiative of the registrant, by submission of an application for amended registration, the registrant may distribute or sell under the previously approved labeling for a period of 18 months after approval of the revision, unless an order subsequently issued by the Agency under FIFRA sec. 6 or 13 provides otherwise. However, if paragraph (d) of this section applies to the registrant's product, the time frames established by the Agency in accordance with that paragraph shall take precedence.
(d) If a product's labeling is required to be revised as a result of the issuance of a Registration Standard, a Label Improvement Program notice, or a notice concluding a special review process, the Agency will specify in the notice to the registrant the period of time that previously approved labeling may be
used. In all cases, supplemental or sticker labeling may be used as an interim compliance measure for a reasonable period of time. The Agency may establish dates as follows governing when label changes must appear on labels:
(1) The Agency may establish a date after which all product distributed or sold by the registrant must bear revised labeling.
(2) The Agency may also establish a date after which no product may be distributed or sold by any person unless it bears revised labeling. This date will provide sufficient time for product in channels of trade to be distributed or sold to users or otherwise disposed of.
§ 152.132
Supplemental distribution.
The registrant may distribute or sell his registered product under another person's name and address instead of (or in addition to) his own. Such distribution and sale is termed “supplemental distribution” and the product is referred to as a “distributor product.” The distributor is considered an agent of the registrant for all intents and purposes under the Act, and both the registrant and the distributor may be held liable for violations pertaining to the distributor product. Supplemental distribution is permitted upon notification to the Agency if all the following conditions are met:
(a) The registrant has submitted to the Agency for each distributor product a statement signed by both the registrant and the distributor listing the names and addresses of the registrant and the distributor, the distributor's company number, the additional brand name(s) to be used, and the registration number of the registered product.
(b) The distributor product is produced, packaged and labeled in a registered establishment operated by the same producer (or under contract in accordance with § 152.30) who produces, packages, and labels the registered product.
(c) The distributor product is not repackaged (remains in the producer's unopened container).
(d) The label of the distributor product is the same as that of the registered product, except that:
(1) The product name of the distributor product may be different (but may not be misleading);
(2) The name and address of the distributor may appear instead of that of the registrant;
(3) The registration number of the registered product must be followed by a dash, followed by the distributor's company number (obtainable from the Agency upon request);
(4) The establishment number must be that of the final establishment at which the product was produced; and
(5) Specific claims may be deleted, provided that no other changes are necessary.
(e) Voluntary cancellation of a product applies to the registered product and all distributor products distributed or sold under that registration number. The registrant is responsible for ensuring that distributors under his cancelled registration are notified and comply with the terms of the cancellation.
[53 FR 15975, May 4, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 32096, June 19, 1995]
§ 152.135
Transfer of registration.
(a) A registrant may transfer the registration of a product to another person, and the registered product may be distributed and sold without the requirement of a new application for registration by that other person, if the parties submit to the Agency the documents listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and receive Agency approval as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(b) Persons seeking approval of a transfer of registration must provide a document signed by the authorized representative of the registrant (the transferor) and of the person to whom the registration is transferred (the transferee) that contains the following information:
(1) The name, address and State of incorporation (if any) of the transferor;
(2) The name, address and State of incorporation of the transferee;
(3) The name(s) and EPA registration number(s) of the product(s) being transferred;
(4) A statement that the transferor transfers irrevocably to the transferee
all right, title, and interest in the EPA registration(s) listed in the document;
(5) A statement that the transferred registration(s) shall not serve as collateral or otherwise secure any loan or other payment arrangement or executory promise, and that the registration(s) shall not revert to the transferor unless a new transfer agreement is submitted to and approved by the Agency;
(6) A description of the general nature of the underlying transaction, e.g., merger, spinoff, bankruptcy transfer (no financial information need be disclosed);
(7) A statement that the transferor and transferee understand that any false statement may be punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001; and
(8) An acknowledgment by the transferee that his rights and duties concerning the registration under FIFRA and this chapter will be deemed by EPA to be the same as those of the transferor at the time the transfer is approved.
(c) In addition, the transferor must submit to the Agency a notarized statement affirming that:
(1) The person signing the transfer agreement is authorized by the registrant to bind the transferor;
(2) No court order prohibits the transfer, and that any required court approvals have been obtained; and
(3) The transfer is authorized under all relevant Federal, State and local laws and all relevant corporate charters, bylaws, partnerships, or other agreements.
(d) If the required documents are submitted, and no information available to the Agency indicates that the information is incorrect, the Agency will approve the transfer without requiring that the transferee obtain a new registration. The Agency will notify the transferor and transferee of its approval.
(e) The transfer will be effective on the date of Agency approval. Thereafter the transferee will be regarded as the registrant for all purposes under FIFRA.
(f) Rights to exclusive use of data or compensation under FIFRA section 3(c)(1)(F) are separate from the registration itself and may be retained by the transferor, or may be transferred independently in accordance with the provisions of § 152.98. If the registrant as the original data submitter wishes to transfer data rights at the same time as he transfers the registration, he may submit a single transfer document containing the information required by this section for both the registration and the data.

(a)
Grouping of products for classification purposes.
In its discretion, the Agency may identify a group of products having common characteristics or uses and may classify for restricted use same or all of the products or uses included in that group. Such a group may be comprised of, but is not limited to, products that:
(1) Contain the same active ingredients.
(2) Contain the same active ingredients in a particular concentration range, formulation type, or combination of concentration range and formulation type.
(3) Have uses in common.
(4) Have other characteristics, such as toxicity, flammability, or physical properties, in common.
(b)
Classification reviews.
The Agency may conduct classification reviews and classify products at any time, if it determines that a restriction on the use of a pesticide product is necessary to avoid unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. However, classification reviews normally will be conducted and products classified only in the following circumstances:
(1) As part of the review of an application for new registration of a product containing an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered product.
(2) As part of the review of an application for a new use of a product, if existing uses of that product previously have been classified for restricted use. Review of a restricted use product at this time is for the purpose of determining whether the new use should also be classified for restricted use. Normally the Agency will not conduct initial classification reviews for existing uses of individual products in conjunction with an application for amended registration.
(3) As part of the process of developing or amending a registration standard for a pesticide. The Agency normally will conduct classification reviews of all uses of a currently registered pesticide at this time.
(4) As part of any special review of a pesticide, in accordance with the procedures of 40 CFR part 154.
(c)
Classification procedures.
(1) If the Agency determines that a product or one or more of its uses should be classified for restricted use, the Agency initially may classify the product by regulation. In this case, within 60 days after the effective date of a final rule, each registrant of a product subject to the rule must submit to the Agency one of the following, as directed in the final rule:
(i) A copy of the amended label and any supplemental labeling to be used as an interim compliance measure.
(ii) A statement, which the Agency considers a report under the Act, that the registrant will comply with the labeling requirements prescribed by the Agency within the timeframes prescribed by the regulation.
(iii) An application for amended registration to delete the uses which have been restricted, or to “split” the registration into two registrations, one including only restricted or all uses, and the other including only uses that have not been classified.
(2) Alternatively, EPA may notify the applicant or registrant of the classification decision and require that he submit the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Agency may deny registration or initiate cancellation proceedings if the registrant fails to comply within the timeframes established by the Agency in its notification.
§ 152.166
Labeling of restricted use products.
(a)
Products intended for end use.
A product whose labeling bears directions for end use and that has been classified for restricted use must be labeled in accordance with the requirements of § 156.10 of this chapter or other Agency instructions. The Agency will permit the use of stickers or supplemental labeling as an interim alternative to the use of an approved amended label, in accordance with § 152.167.
(b)
Products intended only for formulation.
A product whose labeling does not bear directions for end use (a product that is intended and labeled solely for
further formulation into other pesticide products) is not subject to the labeling requirements of this subpart.
§ 152.167
Distribution and sale of restricted use products.
Unless modified by the Agency, the compliance dates in this section shall apply to restricted use products.
(a)
Sale by registrant or producer.
(1) No product with a use classified for restricted use may be distributed or sold by the registrant or producer after the 120th day after the effective date of such classification unless the product:
(i) Bears an approved amended label which contains the terms of restricted use imposed by the Agency and otherwise complies with part 156 of this chapter;
(ii) Bears a sticker containing the product name, EPA registration number, and any terms of restricted use imposed by the Agency; or
(iii) Is accompanied by supplemental labeling bearing the information listed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
(2) If the registrant chooses to delete the restricted uses from his product label, that product may not be distributed or sold after the 180th day after the effective date of classification unless the product bears amended labeling with the restricted uses deleted.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, after the 270th day after the effective date of classification, no registrant or producer may distribute or sell a product that does not bear the approved amended label. After that date, stickers and supplemental labeling described in paragraph (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) are no longer acceptable.
(b)
Sale by retailer.
No product with a use classified for restricted use by a regulation may be distributed or sold by a retailer or other person after the 270th day after the effective date of the final rule unless the product bears a label or labeling which complies with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
§ 152.168
Advertising of restricted use products.
(a) Any product classified for restricted use shall not be advertised unless the advertisement contains a statement of its restricted use classification.
(b) The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies to all advertisements of the product, including, but not limited, to:
(1) Brochures, pamphlets, circulars and similar material offered to purchasers at the point of sale or by direct mail.
(2) Newspapers, magazines, newsletters and other material in circulation or available to the public.
(3) Broadcast media such as radio and television.
(4) Telephone advertising.
(5) Billboards and posters.
(c) The requirement may be satisfied for printed material by inclusion of the statement “Restricted Use Pesticide,” or the terms of restriction, prominently in the advertisement. The requirement may be satisfied with respect to broadcast or telephone advertising by inclusion in the broadcast of the spoken words “Restricted use pesticide,” or a statement of the terms of restriction.
(d) The requirements of this section shall be effective:
(1) After 270 days after the effective date of restriction of a product that is currently registered, unless the Agency specifies a shorter time period;
(2) Upon the effective date of registration of a product not currently registered.
§ 152.170
Criteria for restriction to use by certified applicators.
(a)
General criteria.
An end-use product will be restricted to use by certified applicators (or persons under their direct supervision) if the Agency determines that:
(1) Its toxicity exceeds one or more of the specific hazard criteria in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, or evidence described in paragraph (d) of this section substantiates that the product or use poses a serious hazard that may be mitigated by restricting its use;
(2) Its labeling, when considered according to the factors in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, is not adequate to mitigate these hazard(s);
(3) Restriction of the product would decrease the risk of adverse effects; and
(4) The decrease in risks of the pesticide as a result of restriction would exceed the decrease in benefits.
(b)
Criteria for human hazard
—(1)
Residential and institutional uses.
A pesticide product intended for residential or institutional use will be considered for restricted use classification if:
(i) The pesticide, as diluted for use, has an acute oral LD
50
of 1.5 g/kg or less;
(ii) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute dermal LD
50
of 2000 mg/kg or less;
(iii) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute inhalation LC
50
of 0.5 mg/liter or less, based upon a 4-hour exposure period;
(iv) The pesticide, as formulated, is corrosive to the eye (causes irreversible destruction of ocular tissue) or results in corneal involvement or irritation persisting for more than 7 days;
(v) The pesticide, as formulated, is corrosive to the skin (causes tissue destruction into the dermis and/or scarring) or causes severe irritation (severe erythema or edema) at 72 hours; or
(vi) When used in accordance with label directions, or widespread and commonly recognized practice, the pesticide may cause significant subchronic, chronic or delayed toxic effects on man as a result of single or multiple exposures to the product ingredients or residues.
(2)
All other uses.
A pesticide product intended for uses other than residential or institutional use will be considered for restricted use classification if:
(i) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute oral LD
50
of 50 mg/kg or less;
(ii) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute dermal LD
50
of 200 mg/kg or less;
(iii) The pesticide, as diluted for use, has an acute dermal LD
50
of 16 g/kg or less;
(iv) The pesticide, as formulated, has an acute inhalation LC
50
of 0.05 mg/liter or less, based upon a 4-hour exposure period;
(v) The pesticide, as formulated, is corrosive to the eye or causes corneal involvement or irritation persisting for more than 21 days;
(vi) The pesticide, as formulated, is corrosive to the skin (causes tissue destruction into the dermis and/or scarring); or
(vii) When used in accordance with label directions, or widespread and commonly recognized practice, the pesticide may cause significant subchronic toxicity, chronic toxicity, or delayed toxic effects on man, as a result of single or multiple exposures to the product ingredients or residues.
(c)
Criteria for hazard to non-target species
—(1)
All products.
A pesticide product intended for outdoor use will be considered for restricted use classification if:
(i) When used according to label directions, application results in residues of the pesticide, its metabolites, or its degradation products, in the diet of exposed mammalian wildlife, immediately after application, such that:
(A) The level of such residues equals or exceeds one-fifth of the acute dietary LC
50
; or
(B) The amount of pesticide consumed in one feeding day (mg/kg/day) equals or exceeds one-fifth of the mammalian acute oral LD
50
;
(ii) When used according to label directions, application results, immediately after application, in residues of the pesticide, its metabolites or its degradation products, in the diet of exposed birds at levels that equal or exceed one-fifth of the avian subacute dietary LC
50
;
(iii) When used according to label directions, application results in residues of the pesticide, its metabolites or its degradation products, in water that equal or exceed one-tenth of the acute LC
50
for non-target aquatic organisms likely to be exposed; or
(iv) Under conditions of label use or widespread and commonly recognized practice, the pesticide may cause discernible adverse effects on non-target organisms, such as significant mortality or effects on the physiology, growth, population levels or reproduction rates of such organisms, resulting from direct or indirect exposure to the pesticide, its metabolites or its degradation products.
(2)
Granular products.
In addition to the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a pesticide intended for outdoor use and formulated as a granular
product will be considered for restricted use classification if:
(i) The formulated product has an acute avian or mammalian oral LD
50
of 50 mg/kg or less as determined by extrapolation from tests conducted with technical material or directly with the formulated product; and
(ii) It is intended to be applied in such a manner that significant exposure to birds or mammals may occur.
(d)
Other evidence.
The Agency may also consider evidence such as field studies, use history, accident data, monitoring data, or other pertinent evidence in deciding whether the product or use may pose a serious hazard to man or the environment that can reasonably be mitigated by restricted use classification.
(e)
Alternative labeling language.
(1) If the Agency determines that a product meets one or more of the criteria of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, or if other evidence identified in paragraph (d) of this section leads the Agency to conclude that the product should be considered for restricted use classification, the Agency will then determine if additional labeling language would be adequate to mitigate the identified hazard(s) without restricted use classification. If the labeling language meets all the criteria specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the product will not be classified for restricted use.
(2) The labeling will be judged adequate if it meets all the following criteria:
(i) The user, in order to follow label directions, would not be required to perform complex operations or procedures requiring specialized training and/or experience.
(ii) The label directions do not call for specialized apparatus, protective equipment, or materials that reasonably would not be available to the general public.
(iii) Failure to follow label directions in a minor way would result in few or no significant adverse effects.
(iv) Following directions for use would result in few or no significant adverse effects of a delayed or indirect nature through bioaccumulation, persistence, or pesticide movement from the original application site.
(v) Widespread and commonly recognized practices of use would not nullify or detract from label directions such that unreasonable adverse effects on the environment might occur.
§ 152.171
Restrictions other than those relating to use by certified applicators.
The Agency may by regulation impose restrictions on a product or class of products if it determines that:
(a) Without such restrictions, the product when used in accordance with warnings, cautions and directions for use or in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practices of use may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and
(b) The decrease in risks as a result of restricted use would exceed the decrease in benefits as a result of restricted use.
§ 152.175

# Subpart U—Registration Fees

# Source:
53 FR 19114, May 26, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 152.400
Purpose.
Subpart U prescribes fees to be charged for the pesticide regulatory activities set forth in § 152.403 as performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 9701 and Pub. L. 100-202) and provisions regarding their payment.
§ 152.401
Inapplicability of fee provisions to applications filed prior to October 1, 1997.
No fee required by this subpart U shall be levied with respect to any application filed during the period beginning on October 25, 1988, and ending on September 30, 1997. See FIFRA section 4(i)(7) (added to FIFRA by Pub. L. 100-532, October 25, 1988, 102 Stat. 2654).
[53 FR 11923, Mar. 22, 1989]
§ 152.403
Definitions of fee categories.
(a)
New chemical registration review
means review of an application for registration of a pesticide product containing a chemical active ingredient which is not contained as an active ingredient in any other pesticide product that is registered under FIFRA at the time the application is made.
(b)
New biochemical and microbial registration review
means review of an application for registration of a biochemical or microbial pesticide product containing a biochemical or microbial active ingredient not contained in any other pesticide product that is registered under FIFRA at the time the application is made. For purposes of this subpart, the definitions of biochemical and microbial pesticides contained in §§ 158.2000 and 158.2100, respectively, shall apply.
(c)
New use pattern registration review
means review of an application for registration, or for amendment of a registration entailing a major change to the use pattern of an active ingredient contained in a product registered under FIFRA or pending Agency decision on a prior application at the time of application. For purposes of this paragraph, examples of major changes include but are not limited to, changes from non-food to food use, outdoor to indoor use, ground to aerial application, terrestrial to aquatic use, and non-residential to residential use.
(d)
Old chemical registration review
means review of an application for registration of a new product containing active ingredients and uses which are substantially similar or identical to those currently registered or for which an application is pending Agency decision.
(e)
Amendment review
means review of any application requiring Agency approval to amend the registration of a currently registered product, or for which an application is pending Agency decision, not entailing a major change to the use pattern of an active ingredient.
(f)
Experimental use permit review
means review of an application for a permit pursuant to section 5 of FIFRA to apply a limited quantity of a pesticide in order to accumulate information necessary to register the pesticide. The application may be for a new chemical or for a new use of an old chemical. The fee applies to such experimental uses of a single unregistered active ingredient (no limit on the number of other active ingredients, in a tank mix, already registered for the crops involved) and no more than three crops. This fee does not apply to experimental use permits required for small-scale field testing of microbial pest control agents (40 CFR 172.3).
[53 FR 19114, May 26, 1988, as amended at 72 FR 61028, Oct. 26, 2007]
§ 152.404
Fee amounts.
The fee prescribed by the following table must be submitted with each application for registration, amended registration or experimental use permit. Fees will be adjusted annually in accordance with § 152.410. The Agency may waive or refund fees in accordance with § 152.412.

§ 152.406
Submission of supplementary data.
Applicants may submit data to supplement pending applications without incurring additional charges if the proper fee was paid with submission of the original application and subsequent submissions of supplementary data do not constitute a change in the type of registration action requested.
[53 FR 19114, May 26, 1988, as amended at 58 FR 34203, June 23, 1993]
§ 152.408
Special considerations.
(a) If two or more applicants apply for a new chemical registration for products having the same active ingredient and each applicant provides a set of data in support of the registration developed independently of the other applicants' data, then each applicant submitting an independent set of data
shall be charged the full new chemical registration review fee.
(b) If two or more applicants apply for a new chemical registration for products having the same active ingredient and the applicants have jointly developed or paid for the joint development of a common set of data to support their applications for registration, then each applicant shall be charged an equal share of the total fee for review of the applications for all of the subject products. The total fee will include the sum of the new chemical registration review fee for one product and one old chemical registration review fee for each additional product.
(c) If an application is received for registration of a product that contains two or more new chemical active ingredients and a different set of generic data is required by the Agency for each new chemical for the purpose of registration, the applicant will be required to pay the full new chemical registration review fee for each active ingredient.
§ 152.410
Adjustment of fees.
(a) The fee schedule will be adjusted annually by the same percentage as the percent change in the Federal General Schedule (GS) pay scale. Such adjustments will be published in the
Federal Register
as a final rule and will be effective 30 days or more after promulgation.
(b) Processing costs and fees will be reviewed periodically and changes will be made to the schedule as necessary. Such adjustments will be published for notice and comment in the
Federal Register.
§ 152.412
Waivers and refunds.
(a)
Refunds.
If an application is not accepted for processing because it is incomplete, the fee, less $1,200 for handling and initial review (or the amount of the fee, whichever is less), shall be returned. If an application is withdrawn by the applicant before significant Agency scientific review has begun, the fee, less $1,200, shall be returned. If an unacceptable or withdrawn petition is resubmitted, it shall be accompanied by the fee that would be required if it were submitted for the first time.
(b)
Waiver of fees for activities initiated by the Agency.
The Agency may waive fees for amended registrations where the amendment has been initiated solely by the Agency. The Agency retains sole discretion in determining when this fee will be waived. The announcement of the fee waiver will accompany the EPA request for an amendment. The Agency will not approve any individual requests for waivers of EPA-initiated activity fees.
(c)
Waiver of fees for activities initiated by applicants.
Upon request by an applicant, together with the supporting documentation or justification described in this paragraph, the Agency may waive or refund fees in whole or in part. A request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with § 152.414(a). An application for which a waiver of fees has been requested will not be accepted for review until the waiver has been granted, or until the waiver has been denied and thereafter the proper fee has been submitted.
(1)
Minor use.
Fees may be waived for applications limited to minor uses that lack commercial feasibility for the pesticide applicant. An applicant requesting a waiver on this basis must provide supporting information that demonstrates that anticipated revenues from the uses that are the subject of the application would be insufficient to pay back the cost of the fee. The burden of proof of the reasonableness of this estimate rests with the applicant.
(2)
IR-4.
Fees will be waived for registration actions that are determined to be specifically associated with tolerance petitions submitted by the Inter-Regional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4 program) when such waiver is deemed by the Agency to be in the public interest.
(3)
Severe economic impact.
The Agency may waive two-thirds of any cumulative registration fee payment in a 12-month period following completion of the applicant's most recent fiscal year that exceeds 3 percent of the applicant's pesticide sales in its most recently completed fiscal year. An applicant requesting a waiver on this basis must provide documentation (e.g. copy of an annual report, or income tax forms filed with the Internal Revenue
Service, or if needed, a notarized statement signed by a corporate officer regarding annual pesticide sales) demonstrating that:
(i) The company applying had less than $40 million in gross revenue (including all revenue sources) in the most recently concluded fiscal year of operation, and a single fee would constitute more than 3 percent of the applicant's gross revenue from pesticide sales in the most recently completed fiscal year of operation, or
(ii) The company applying had less than $40 million in gross revenue (including all revenue sources) in the most recently concluded fiscal year of operation, and the cumulative registration fees paid during the 12 months following the applicant's most recently completed fiscal year, including any registration fees paid for the applicant for which a waiver is requested, constitute more than 3 percent of the applicant's gross revenue from pesticide sales in the most recently concluded fiscal year of operation.
(iii) The Agency will not grant such a waiver if it determines that the entity submitting the application has been formed or manipulated to qualify for such a waiver.

§ 152.414
Procedures.
(a)
Procedures for requesting a waiver.
(1) A request for a waiver must be submitted in writing at the time the application is submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing Desk at the appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b).
(2) A payment of $1,200 for processing the waiver or the amount of the actual fee, whichever is less, must be submitted simultaneously to the address set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. This fee will be refunded (or applied to any resulting partial fee) if the waiver is granted. Payment of fees for the registration activities, in contrast to the waiver fee, shall not be required until the Agency makes a determination on the waiver request. Since the actual fee is submitted to an address different than the one to which the waiver request is submitted, a copy of the payment document must be submitted with the waiver request that is submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing Desk as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. No fee is required from a person who has no financial interest in the application.
(b)
Procedures for payment of fees.
All fees required by this section must be paid by money order, bank draft, or certified check drawn to the order of the Environmental Protection Agency. All payment of fees must be forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency, Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, Office of Pesticide Programs (Registration Fees), P.O. Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251. The payments should be specifically labeled “Registration Fees” and should be accompanied only by a copy of the registration application form or the experimental use permit application form, as appropriate. An application will not be accepted for processing until the required fees have been submitted.
(c)
Procedures for submitting application and supporting data.
The application, along with supporting data, shall be forwarded within 30 days of payment to the Washington DC address set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

§ 153.125
Criteria for determination of pesticidal activity.
(a) An ingredient will be considered an active ingredient if it is contained in a pesticide product and:
(1) The ingredient has the capability by itself, and when used as directed at the proposed use dilution, to function as a pesticide; or
(2) The ingredient has the ability to elicit or enhance a pesticidal effect in another compound whose pesticidal activity is substantially increased due to the interaction of the compounds. Compounds which function simply to enhance or prolong the activity of an active ingredient by physical action, such as stickers and other adjuvants, are not generally considered to be active ingredients.
(b) Normally the applicant will determine and state in his application whether an ingredient is active or inert with respect to pesticidal activity. The Agency, as part of its review of an application for registration, or in conjunction with the Registration Standard or Special Review process, may require any ingredient, to be designated as an active ingredient if the Agency finds that it meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. Conversely, the Agency may determine that any ingredient designated as active by an applicant is an inert ingredient if it fails to meet those criteria.
(c) If an ingredient is designated as an active ingredient, it must be identified in the label ingredients statement. If an ingredient is designated as an inert ingredient, it must be included as part of the total inert ingredients in the label ingredients statement.
(d) Designation of a substance as a pesticidally inert ingredient does not relieve the applicant or registrant of other requirements of FIFRA with respect to labeling of inert ingredients or
submission of data, or from the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to tolerances or other clearance of ingredients.

# Source:
53 FR 15990, May 4, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 153.140
General.
Section 25(c)(5) of the Act authorizes the Administrator to prescribe regulations requiring coloration or discoloration of any pesticide if the Administrator determines that such requirements are feasible and necessary for the protection of health and the environment. This subpart describes those pesticide products which must be colored or discolored.
[60 FR 32096, June 19, 1995]
§ 153.155
Seed treatment products.
(a) Pesticide products intended for use in treating seeds must contain an EPA-approved dye to impart an unnatural color to the seed, unless appropriate tolerances or other clearances have been established under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for residues of the pesticide.
(b) The following products are exempt from the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) Products intended and labeled for use solely by commercial seed treaters, provided that the label bears a statement requiring the user to add an EPA-approved dye with the pesticide during the seed treatment process.
(2) Products intended and labeled for use solely as at-planting or hopper box treatments.
(3) Products which are gaseous in form or are used as fumigants.
(c) EPA-approved dyes for seed treatment are listed in:
(1) Sections 180.910, 180.920, and 180.950 if an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance has been established.
(2) Section 180.2010 if EPA has determined that residues of the dye will be present, if at all, at levels that are below the threshold of regulation.
(3) Section 180.2020 if it has been determined that no tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is needed as a result of a determination by EPA that the use is unlikely to result in residues in food/feed.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 154.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of the Special Review process is to help the Agency determine whether to initiate procedures to cancel, deny, or reclassify registration of a pesticide product because
uses of that product may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, in accordance with sections 3(c)(6) and 6 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The process is intended to ensure that the Agency assesses risks that may be posed by pesticides, and the benefits of use of those pesticides, in an open and responsive manner. The issuance of a Notice of Special Review means that the Agency has determined that one or more uses of a pesticide may pose significant risks and that, following completion of the Special Review process, the Agency expects to initiate formal proceedings seeking to cancel, deny, reclassify, or require modifications to the registration of the product(s) in question unless it has been shown during the Special Review that the Agency's initial determination was erroneous, that the risks can be reduced to acceptable levels without the need for formal proceedings, or that the benefits of the pesticide's use outweigh the risks. Following completion of the Special Review process, a pesticide in question may be returned to the registration process.
(b)
Scope.
This part sets forth the substantive standards for initiating a Special Review of a pesticide product and the procedures for initiating and conducting the Special Review.
§ 154.3
Definitions.
Terms used in this part have the same meaning as in the Act. In addition, as used in this part, the following terms shall apply:
Act or FIFRA
means the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended.
Administrator
means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or any officer or employee thereof to whom authority has been delegated to act for the Administrator.
Confidential business information
means trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information under FIFRA section 10(b) or 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) or (4).
Other significant evidence
means factually significant information that relates to the uses of the pesticide and its adverse risk to man or to the environment but does not include evidence based only on misuse of the pesticide unless such misuse is widespread and commonly recognized practice.
Person
means an applicant, registrant, manufacturer, pesticide user, environmental group, labor union, or other individual or group of individuals interested in pesticide regulation.
Pesticide use
means a use of a pesticide (described in terms of the application site and other applicable identifying factors) that is included in the labeling of a pesticide product which is registered, or for which an application for registration is pending, and the terms and conditions (or proposed terms and conditions) of registration for the use.
Terms and conditions of registration
means the terms and conditions governing lawful sale, distribution, and use approved in conjunction with registration, including labeling, use classification, composition, and packaging.
Validated test
means a test determined by the Agency to have been conducted and evaluated in a manner consistent with accepted scientific procedures.
[73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 154.5
Burden of persuasion in determinations under this part.
In making determinations under this part the Administrator shall be guided by the principle that the burden of persuasion that a pesticide product is entitled to registration or continued registration for any particular use or under any particular set of terms and conditions of registration is always on the proponent(s) of registration.
§ 154.7
Criteria for initiation of Special Review.
(a) The Administrator may conduct a Special Review of a pesticide use if he determines, based on a validated test or other significant evidence, that the use of the pesticide (taking into account the ingredients, impurities, metabolites, and degradation products of the pesticide):
(1) May pose a risk of serious acute injury to humans or domestic animals.
(2) May pose a risk of inducing in humans an oncogenic, heritable genetic,
teratogenic, fetotoxic, reproductive effect, or a chronic or delayed toxic effect, which risk is of concern in terms of either the degree of risk to individual humans or the number of humans at some risk, based upon:
(i) Effects demonstrated in humans or experimental animals.
(ii) Known or predicted levels of exposure of various groups of humans.
(iii) The use of appropriate methods of evaluating data and relating such data to human risk.
(3) May result in residues in the environment of nontarget organisms at levels which equal or exceed concentrations acutely or chronically toxic to such organisms, or at levels which produce adverse reproductive effects in such organisms, as determined from tests conducted on representative species or from other appropriate data.
(4) May pose a risk to the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species designated by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
(5) May result in the destruction or other adverse modification of any habitat designated by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce under the Endangered Species Act as a critical habitat for any endangered or threatened species.
(6) May otherwise pose a risk to humans or to the environment which is of sufficient magnitude to merit a determination whether the use of the pesticide product offers offsetting social, economic, and environmental benefits that justify initial or continued registration.
(b) In making any determination that a pesticide use satisfies one of the criteria for issuance of a Special Review specified by paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator shall consider available evidence concerning both the adverse effect in question and the magnitude and scope of exposure of humans and nontarget organisms associated with use of the pesticide.
§ 154.10
Petitions to begin the Special Review process.
The Administrator may evaluate a pesticide use under the criteria of § 154.7 either on his own initiative, or at the suggestion of any interested person.
§ 154.15
Docket for the Special Review.
(a)
Establishment of the docket.
When the Agency first notifies registrants privately that it is considering issuance of a Notice of Special Review for a pesticide, it shall establish a docket concerning that particular pesticide.
(b)
Contents of the docket.
For each pre-Special Review or Special Review, the docket shall contain:
(1) The Notice of Special Review, any Notice of Preliminary Determination, and any Notice of Final Determination.
(2) Any notice issued under § 154.21 or § 154.23.
(3) Any documents (other than information claimed to be confidential business information) referred to by the Agency in those notices as relied upon by the Agency in reaching its determination.
(4) Copies of all written comments or materials (other than information claimed to be confidential business information) responding to any notice furnished under § 154.21 or § 154.23 or submitted at any time during the Special Review process by any person outside of government.
(5) Any written response to the Notice of Preliminary Determination from the Secretary of Agriculture or the Scientific Advisory Panel.
(6) A transcript of all public meetings held by the Scientific Advisory Panel or conducted by the Agency for the purpose of gathering information.
(7) A memorandum describing each meeting between Agency personnel and any person or party outside of government which concerns a pending pre-Special Review or Special Review decision. Each such memorandum shall be based on notes taken at the meeting and shall specify the date and time of the meeting, the participants and their affiliations, who requested the meeting, the subject matter of the meeting, and the person who prepared the memorandum. Except for information claimed to be confidential business information, each memorandum shall describe fully and accurately all significant positions taken, arguments made, and facts presented by each participant
in the meeting, and shall identify all documents, proposals, or other materials distributed or exchanged at the meeting. Any discussion of claimed confidential business information shall be identified in meeting notes and referenced in the memorandum.
(8) All comments, correspondence, or other materials concerning a pending pre-Special Review or Special Review decision provided to the Agency by a person or party outside of government (other than information claimed to be confidential business information).
(9) All documents, proposals, or other materials concerning a pending pre-Special Review or Special Review decision, provided by the Agency to any person or party outside of government (other than information claimed to be confidential business information).
(c)
Assertion of confidential business information claims.
(1) Information, comments, data, or other written material submitted to the Agency concerning a Special Review may be claimed by the submitter to be confidential business information. The burden of identifying claimed confidential business information rests with the submitter, or, in meetings, with the participants who wish to assert a claim of confidentiality.
(2) To assert a claim of confidentiality for all or any part of a written submission concerning a Special Review, the submitter must furnish three copies of the material. Two copies must be complete, with claimed confidential business information clearly marked in the text. Items in the document that are claimed confidential should be numbered consecutively throughout the text. The third copy must have the claimed confidential business information excised from the text without closing up or paraphrasing the remaining text. The deletions should be consecutively numbered to correspond to the numbering of the complete copies. Each copy must be marked on the cover as to whether it contains claimed confidential business information.
(3) Any written material concerning a Special Review received by the Agency that is not marked as confidential will be deemed to be nonconfidential, and may be made available through the public docket or otherwise disclosed without prior notice to the submitter.
(d)
Placement of materials in the docket.
Any memorandum identified under paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall be placed in the docket within 10 working days of the subject meeting. Materials identified under paragraph (b)(8) of this section shall be placed in the docket within 10 working days of receipt by the Office of Pesticide Programs, or within 15 working days of receipt by the Office of Pesticide Programs if the submitter has asserted a confidential business information claim concerning the submittal. Materials identified under paragraph (b)(9) of this section shall be placed in the docket within 15 working days of transmittal to such person or party outside of government.
(e)
Index.
The Agency shall prepare and maintain a current index of all materials included in the docket. The index will include a list identifying, for each meeting between Agency personnel and a person or party outside of government for which a memorandum has been prepared, the date, the subject, participants, and person who requested the meeting. The index will also list any document included in the docket by its title, its source, its recipient, and the date it was received or provided by the Agency.
(f)
Access to the docket.
(1)(i) For each chemical in Special Review, the docket shall be available for public inspection and copying and its index kept current and made available to the public on request. The docket and index for any pesticide for which the Agency has issued a pre-Special Review notification under § 154.21 will only be made available for public inspection and copying following issuance of a proposed decision not to start a Special Review under § 154.23, a Notice of Special Review under § 154.25(c), or as otherwise specified in § 154.34.
(ii) The docket and index will be available at the OPP Regulatory Public Docket located as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(c).
(2) Information contained in the docket shall not be disclosed to the public to the extent that FIFRA or any other statute or regulation (including, but not limited to, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) or (4)) prohibits its disclosure.
(3) The Agency will distribute a compendium of indices for new materials in the public docket by mail, on a monthly basis, to those members of the public who have specifically requested such material. The Agency will announce the availability of docket indices both annually in the
Federal Register
and in each
Federal Register
Notice concerning pre-Special Review or Special Review for specific pesticides. The Agency may also periodically require parties on the mailing list to renew their previous request for such materials.
[50 FR 49015, Nov. 27, 1985, as amended at 69 FR 39864, July 1, 2004; 71 FR 35545, June 21, 2006]

# Subpart B—Procedures
§ 154.21
Preliminary notification to registrants and applicants for registration.
(a)
Preliminary notification.
If the Administrator decides that he may initiate a Special Review of a pesticide use, he shall send written notice by certified mail to the affected registrant(s) and applicant(s) setting forth his decision and a general description of the information which supports it.
(b)
Comment opportunity.
Registrant(s) and applicant(s) will be allowed 30 days from the receipt of notification to respond in writing to dispute the validity of the Agency's conclusions or to present information in response to the notification.
§ 154.23
Proposed decision not to initiate a Special Review.
If the Administrator proposes not to initiate a Special Review after having given notice under § 154.21, he shall issue a proposed decision for publication in the
Federal Register.
The proposal shall include a description of the concerns which were the original basis for placement of the pesticide in pre-Special Review status and the Agency's rationale for its proposed decision, announce the availability of a public docket, and provide a period generally not less than 30 days for submission of comments. A notice under § 154.25(b) may not be published unless it has been preceded by a notice under this section. A proposal under this section shall not be based on the benefits of use of a pesticide product.
§ 154.25
Public announcement of final decision whether to initiate a Special Review.
(a) The Administrator shall evaluate the available information and the comments received in response to the notice under § 154.21 and any notice issued under § 154.23, and shall issue for publication in the
Federal Register
a notice under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
(b) If the Administrator determines after having given notice under § 154.21 not to initiate a Special Review, he shall issue his decision for publication in the
Federal Register
with a statement of reasons.
(c) If the Administrator determines after having given notice under § 154.21 that one or more of the risk criteria set forth in § 154.7 have been satisfied, the Agency shall issue a notice for publication in the
Federal Register
which shall include:
(1) Identification of the pesticide uses for which a Special Review has been initiated and an identification of the criteria which have been satisfied.
(2) A brief discussion of the Agency's reasons for determining that the criteria have been satisfied.
(3) A statement indicating that EPA has established a docket for the Special Review, the contents of the docket, the location of the docket, and the times during which the docket will be available for inspection and copying.
(4) An invitation to all interested persons to submit further information concerning the risks and benefits associated with each use of the pesticide subject to the Special Review.
(5) A brief description of the Special Review process and a statement that registrants and applicants bear an affirmative burden of supporting registration of a pesticide product.
(6) A date by which information in response to the Agency's request for further information must be submitted.
(d) In his discretion, the Administrator may request that the Scientific Advisory Panel hold a public meeting to review the scientific issues related to the Special Review.
§ 154.26
Comment opportunity.
After issuance of a Notice of Special Review that applies to a use of a pesticide product (or category of products), any person may submit to the Agency any information, argument, or both, pertinent to:
(a) Whether the use of a pesticide product satisfies any of the § 154.7 risk criteria, with respect to the composition, labeling, packaging, and restrictions on use of the product as currently registered.
(b) Whether the use of a pesticide product would satisfy any of the § 154.7 risk criteria if its composition, labeling, packaging, and restrictions on use were approved in accordance with an application for registration or amended registration pending before the Agency. For further information see § 154.27(b).
(c) Whether any risks posed by the use or proposed use of the product that satisfy the § 154.7 risk criteria are unreasonable, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of the product.
(d) What regulatory action, if any, the Agency should take with respect to the use of the product.
§ 154.27
Meetings with interested persons.
(a) In the Special Review process, to assure openness and responsiveness, no person or party outside of government will be afforded special or preferential access to Agency Special Review decisionmakers or to the Agency's Special Review process. At the same time, however, Agency personnel are free to meet and otherwise communicate with persons or parties outside of government, including registrants and manufacturers, users, trade unions, environmental groups and other interested persons, to obtain information, exchange views, explore factual and substantive positions, or discuss regulatory options concerning Special Review decisions.
(b) Meetings between EPA and any person or party outside of government will not result in undue delay in reaching Special Review decisions. During such meetings, the Agency will not commit to take any particular action concerning a pending decision. The Agency may receive and consider information and recommendations from persons or parties outside of government; however, the Agency will make the final administrative decision on a wholly independent basis and in accordance with law.
(c) Any interested person may ask to meet with Agency officials to discuss factual information available to the Agency, to present any factual information, to respond to presentations by other persons, or to discuss what regulatory actions should be taken regarding a pesticide which is or may be the subject of a Special Review. If, at its discretion, the Agency holds such meetings with any person outside of government concerning a use of a pesticide product, the Agency will prepare and file in the docket a memorandum of such meeting, meeting the requirements specified in § 154.15(b)(7).
(d) Meetings described in this section may include meetings held after issuance of a Notice of Special Review with any registrant who proposes to change voluntarily the composition, packaging, and labeling, or other terms and conditions of registration of his pesticide product in a way which he believes would reduce the risks of use of the product so that it would no longer meet or exceed the risk criteria of § 154.7. Meetings for this purpose will be most helpful and productive for both registrants and the Agency if they are requested by registrants shortly after the issuance of the Notice of Special Review.
(e) If the Agency meets with any person or party outside of government concerning a pending Special Review decision, the Agency will not issue a final Special Review decision until 30 days after inclusion of a memorandum concerning that meeting in the public docket. During those 30 days, any person or party may submit written comments to the Agency regarding the subject matter of the meeting in question. The Agency may issue a final Special Review decision without allowing this 30-day period if expedited action is necessary to protect public health or the environment, or if the Agency has invited other parties with potentially opposing viewpoints to the meeting in
question (e.g., registrants, users, labor, and environmental groups).
(f) The Agency may decline to meet subsequently with any person or party who asserts unreasonable confidential business information claims pursuant to § 154.15(c) for the purpose of circumventing the docketing procedures described in § 154.15(b).
§ 154.29
Informal public hearings.
(a)
Timing.
At any time after issuance of a Notice of Special Review and prior to issuance of a Notice of Final Determination, the Administrator may conduct an informal public hearing to gather relevant information or otherwise assist Agency decisionmaking.
(b)
Federal Register
notice. The Administrator shall issue a notice for publication in the
Federal Register
of any informal public hearing to be held under this section. The notice shall contain the following information:
(1) The time, date, and place of the hearing.
(2) A brief description of the procedures governing participation in the hearing by interested persons.
(3) The issues to be considered at the hearing.
(c)
Transcript.
A verbatim transcript of the hearing shall be prepared and filed in the public docket.
§ 154.31
Notices of Preliminary Determination.
The Administrator shall prepare a Notice of Preliminary Determination after the close of the comment period on a Notice of Special Review.
(a)
Contents of notice.
The Notice of Preliminary Determination shall respond to all significant comments submitted in response to the Notice of Special Review. For each use of a pesticide product that was the subject of the Notice of Special Review, the Notice of Preliminary Determination shall also include, as appropriate:
(1) A determination whether the use satisfies any of the risk criteria set forth in § 154.7, and a discussion of the reasons for the determination.
(2) A determination of whether any changes in the composition, packaging, labeling, or restrictions on use of a pesticide product that were proposed in an application for new or amended registration submitted after issuance of the Notice of Special Review would reduce the risk so that the use no longer would satisfy any of the risk criteria in § 154.7.
(3) If the use satisfies any of the risk criteria set forth in § 154.7, a determination of whether the adverse effects posed by the use are unreasonable, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of the product, and a discussion of reasons for the determination.
(4) If the use is determined to pose an unreasonable adverse effect, a statement of the regulatory action, if any, which the Agency intends to initiate with respect to the use, and a discussion of the reasons for initiating that regulatory action.
(5) A statement that the Administrator is requesting comments from the Secretary of Agriculture and the Scientific Advisory Panel on the notices and analysis specified in paragraph (b) of this section, and that the notices and analysis are available on request.
(6) Instructions to interested persons on how to submit comments (including the deadline for submission of comments).
(7) The location of the docket under § 154.15 and the times during which the docket will be available for inspection and copying.
(b)
Referral to Secretary of Agriculture and Scientific Advisory Panel.
If the Administrator proposes to cancel, deny, or change the classification of the registration of a pesticide product which is the subject of a Special Review, or to hold a hearing under FIFRA section 6(b)(2) on whether to take any of those actions, he shall:
(1) Prepare a proposed form of a Notice of Intent to Cancel, a Notice of Intent to Deny Registration, a Notice of Intent to Hold a Hearing, and/or a Notice of Intent to Change Classification, as appropriate.
(2) Prepare an Agricultural Impact Analysis, analyzing the impact of the proposed action on production and prices of agricultural commodities, retail food prices, and otherwise on the agricultural economy.
(3) Send the proposed notices and analysis to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Scientific Advisory Panel for comment, as provided by the Act.
(4) Send the Notice of Preliminary Determination and the other notices and analysis prepared under this section to all registrants and applicants for registration of products that are subject to the Special Review.
(c)
Publication.
The Agency shall issue the Notice of Preliminary Determination for publication in the

§ 154.33
Notice of Final Determination.
(a)
Publication and notice to registrants and applicants.
The Administrator shall prepare a Notice of Final Determination after the close of the comment period on a Notice of Preliminary Determination. As necessary, the Administrator shall also prepare Notices of Intent to Cancel, Notices of Denial, Notices of Intent to Hold a Hearing under FIFRA section 6(b)(2), or Notices of Intent to Change Classification.
(b)
Contents.
The Notice of Final Determination shall include:
(1) For each pesticide use subject to the Notice of Preliminary Determination, the Agency's final determination with respect to each use, along with a discussion of the reasons for the determination.
(2) Any comments submitted by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Scientific Advisory Panel, and the responses of the Administrator to these comments.
(3) The response of the Administrator to any significant public comments submitted on the Notice of Preliminary Determination.
(4) Instructions to registrants, applicants for registration, and other interested persons concerning the procedures which will be used to implement any regulatory action which the Administrator has decided upon, including instructions concerning how to request hearings, if hearings are available as of right under the Act or have been made available by the Administrator under the Act.
(5) The location of the docket under § 154.15 and the times during which the docket will be available for inspection and copying.
(c)
Publication and notification of registrants and applicants.
The Notice of Final Determination and any Notice of Intent to Cancel, Notice of Denial, Notice of Intent to Hold a Hearing, or Notice of Intent to Change Classification shall be published in the
Federal Register.
If the Administrator issues a Notice of Intent to Cancel, Notice of Denial, Notice of Intent to Hold a Hearing, or Notice of Intent to Change Classification, such notice, along with the Notice of Final Determination, also shall be sent by certified mail to all affected registrants and applicants.
§ 154.34
Expedited procedures.
(a) The Agency may elect to issue a Notice of Special Review and a Notice of Preliminary Determination simultaneously; or, to initiate cancellation, suspension, or denial proceedings concerning a pesticide or any of its uses without first conducting a Special Review or issuing a Notice of Preliminary Determination.
(b) If the Agency elects to issue a simultaneous Notice of Special Review and Notice of Preliminary Determination, the Agency will make the docket for that decision available for public inspection no more than 3 months after the Agency privately notifies the registrant of its risk concerns pursuant to § 154.21(a).
§ 154.35
Finality of determinations.
(a) The Administrator will not approve an application for registration or amended registration of a pesticide product except by use of the procedures specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if:
(1) The application proposes registration of a product for a use which earlier had been the subject of a notice under § 154.21(a);
(2) After the Administrator issued the notice, he determined not to initiate a Special Review, because of a proposal by an applicant for registration or amended registration to change the terms and conditions of registration of the product in a way which would reduce the risk sufficiently to eliminate the need for a Special Review; and
(3) The application for registration or amended registration now proposes that the terms and conditions which served as the basis of the earlier determination be eliminated, or be modified in a way which might increase the risk which was the subject of the notice under § 154.21(a).
(b) The Administrator will not approve an application for registration or amended registration of a pesticide product except by use of the procedures specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if:
(1) The application proposed registration of a product for a use which earlier had been the subject of a Notice of Special Review issued under § 154.25;
(2) After the Administrator issued that Notice, he determined not to issue a notice under FIFRA section 3(c)(6) or 6(b) because of a proposal by an applicant for registration or amended registration to change the terms and conditions of registration of the product in a way which would reduce the risk sufficiently to eliminate the need for issuance of a notice under FIFRA section 3(c)(6) or 6(b); and
(3) The application for registration or amended registration now proposes that the terms and conditions of registration which served as the basis for the earlier determination now be eliminated or be modified in a way which might increase the risk which was the subject of the Notice of Special Review.
(c) An application to which paragraph (a) or (b) of this section applies may not be approved until:
(1) The Administrator issues a notice for publication in the
Federal Register
which describes why the application is subject to the provisions of this section, states that the Administrator proposes to approve the application and his reasons, solicits public comment on whether the application should be approved, and provides a period not less than 30 days for comments to be submitted; and
(2) If any substantive comments are submitted in response to the notice, the Administrator issues a second notice for publication in the
Federal Register
responding to the comments.

§ 155.23
Definitions.
For the purposes of this part,
confidential business information
means trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information under FIFRA sec. 10(b) or 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (3) or (4).
§ 155.25
Schedule.
EPA will issue annually in the
Federal Register
a notice listing the pesticides (or groups of pesticides) for
which Registration Standards are currently being developed. The list will include pesticides for which a Registration Standard is scheduled for issuance within the next year, and the approximate sequence of issuance. The list may also include pesticides for which a Registration Standard will be under development during the upcoming year, but which are not scheduled for issuance until the succeeding year. The notice will invite comment and submission of information on the individual pesticides on the list.
§ 155.27
Agency review of data.
EPA will independently (or using the services of disinterested contractors or consultants) review available data in preparation for the development of a Registration Standard, and will be responsible for the drafting of the Registration Standard based on such data reviews. The Agency will not permit registrants to prepare, or assist in the preparation of, data reviews or other Registration Standard documents. The Agency may, however, meet with registrants to discuss its pending reviews, decisions, or documents, in accordance with the meeting procedures in § 155.30, and the docketing procedures in § 155.32.
§ 155.30
Meetings and communications.
EPA personnel may, upon their own initiative or upon request of any interested person or party, meet or communicate with persons or parties outside of government concerning a Registration Standard under development. Such meetings or communications will conform to the following policies and procedures:
(a)
Purpose.
Meetings and communications may be for the purpose of receiving and considering information, exchanging views, exploring factual and substantive positions, discussing regulatory options or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by the Agency in its deliberations concerning development of a Registration Standard. The Agency will not commit to take any particular action concerning a Registration Standard under development during discussions with any person or party outside of government. The Agency will make its final administrative decision on a wholly independent basis, and in accordance with law.
(b)
Meetings with persons or parties outside of government.
Requests by responsible persons or parties outside of government to meet with Agency personnel concerning a Registration Standard under development should be directed in writing to the Registration Division. Reasonable requests will ordinarily be granted on a timely basis. EPA will decide the time and place of such meetings, and the Agency personnel who will attend. EPA may decline to meet with persons or parties who assert unreasonable claims of confidential business information for the purpose of circumventing the docketing procedures in § 155.32. EPA may also decline to meet if the number or frequency of meetings would delay unduly the issuance of the Registration Standard. Further, no person or party outside government will be accorded special or preferential access to Agency pesticide decisionmaking or to the Agency's decisional process.
(c)
Information submitted to the Agency concerning a Registration Standard under development.
(1) Information, comments, data, or other written material submitted to the Agency at any time concerning a Registration Standard under development may be claimed by the submitter to be confidential business information. The burden of identifying claimed confidential business information rests with the submitter, or, in meetings, with the participants from outside of government who wish to assert a claim of confidentiality.
(2) To assert a claim of confidentiality for all or any part of a written submission concerning a Registration Standard under development, the submitter must furnish three copies of the material. Two copies must be complete, with claimed confidential business information clearly marked in the text. Items in the document that are claimed confidential should be numbered consecutively throughout the document. The third copy must have the claimed confidential business information excised from the text without
closing up or paraphrasing the remaining text. The deletions should be consecutively numbered to correspond to the numbering of the complete copies. Each copy must be marked on the cover as to whether it contains claimed confidential business information.
(3) Any written material received by the Agency that is not marked as confidential will be deemed to be nonconfidential, and may be made available through the public docket or otherwise disclosed without prior notice to the submitter.
(d)
Memorandum of meeting.
For each meeting with a person or party outside of government, the Agency will prepare, based on notes taken at the meeting, a memorandum of the meeting. The memorandum will be prepared within 10 working days of the meeting and will include all of the following information:
(1) The date and time of the meeting.
(2) The name of the person who requested the meeting.
(3) The names and affiliations of the participants.
(4) The subject matter of the meeting.
(5) A full and accurate description of all significant positions taken, facts presented, and arguments made by each participant (except that any discussion of claimed confidential business information will be identified in meeting notes, and referenced in the memorandum).
(6) Identification of all documents, proposals, or other materials (other than information claimed to be confidential business information) distributed or exchanged at the meeting.
(7) The name of the person who prepared the memorandum.
[50 FR 49001, Nov. 27, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 34203, June 23, 1993]
§ 155.32
Public docket.
(a)
When created.
(1) A docket will be created for each Registration Standard under development when the Agency begins review of data for the Registration Standard or upon publication of the notice described in § 155.25 setting out the list and sequence of Registration Standards, whichever is earlier. The Agency will announce in its annual schedule notice the dockets that are available for Registration Standards under development.
(2) If the Agency notifies registrants privately in accordance with 40 CFR 154.21 that one or more risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7 (leading to a special review) may have been exceeded, that notification and any subsequent communications concerning that notification will be placed in a separate docket pertaining to possible special review in accordance with the provisions of § 154.15.
(b)
Contents of docket.
The docket will contain, within the time frames indicated, all of the following documents and information (except that information claimed to be confidential business information will not be included):
(1) An index of its contents (refer to paragraph (c) of this section).
(2) A copy of each comment received in response to the notice described in § 155.25 that pertains to a pesticide for which the notice indicated a Registration Standard was under development (within 10 working days after receipt by the Agency, or 15 working days if the submitter has asserted a confidential business information claim concerning the material).
(3) A copy of each memorandum of a meeting between the Agency and persons or parties outside of government, prepared in accordance with § 155.30(d) (within 10 working days after the meeting).
(4) A copy of each document, comment, item of correspondence or other written material concerning the Registration Standard submitted to the Agency by any person or party outside of government, whether in a meeting or separately (within 10 working days after receipt, or 15 working days if the submitter has asserted a confidential business information claim concerning the material).
(5) A copy of each document, proposal, or other item of written material concerning the Registration Standard provided by the Agency to any person or party outside of government (within 15 working days after the item is made available to such person or party).
(6) A copy of the Registration Standard;
(7) With respect to a Registration Standard for which the Agency has determined that a substantially complete chronic health and teratology data base exists, a copy of the
Federal Register
notice concerning availability of a proposed Registration Standard, and a copy of each comment received in response to that notice (within 10 working days after receipt by the Agency, or 15 working days if the submitter has asserted a confidential business information claim concerning the material).
(8) A copy of the
Federal Register
notice announcing the issuance of the Registration Standard (within 10 working days after the publication of the notice).
(c)
Index of the docket.
The Agency will establish and keep current an index to the docket for each Registration Standard. The index will include, but is not limited to:
(1) A list of each meeting between the Agency and any person or party outside of government, containing the date and subject of the meeting, the names of participants and the name of the person requesting the meeting.
(2) A list of each document in the docket by title, source or recipient(s), and the date the document was received or provided by the Agency.
(d)
Availability of docket and indices.
(1) The Agency will make available to the public for inspection and copying the docket and index for any Registration Standard.
(2) The Agency will establish and maintain a mailing list of persons who have specifically requested that they receive indices for Registration Standard dockets. On a quarterly basis, EPA will distribute the indices of new materials placed in the public docket to these persons. Annually, EPA will require that persons on the list renew their requests for inclusion on the list.
(3) The Agency will issue annually in the
Federal Register
(in conjunction with the annual schedule notice specified in § 155.25) a notice announcing the availability of docket indices.
(4) Each
Federal Register
notice of availability of a Registration Standard will announce the availability of the docket index for that Standard.
§ 155.34
Notice of availability.
(a) The Agency will issue in the
Federal Register
a notice announcing the issuance and availability of Registration Standard which:
(1) Concerns a previously unregistered active ingredient; or
(2) Concerns a previously registered active ingredient, and the Registration Standard states that registrants will be required (under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B)) to submit chronic health (including, but not limited to, chronic feeding, oncogenicity and reproduction) or teratology studies.
(b) Interested persons may submit comments concerning any Registration Standard described by paragraph (a) of this section at any time.
(c) The Agency will issue in the
Federal Register
a notice announcing the availability of, and providing opportunity for comment on, each proposed Registration Standard which concerns a previously registered active ingredient for which the Agency has determined that a substantially complete chronic health and teratology data base exists. Following the comment period and issuance of the Registration Standard, the Agency will issue in the
Federal Register
a notice of availability of the Registration Standard.

# Subpart C—Registration Review Procedures

# Source:
71 FR 45732, Aug. 9, 2006, unless otherwise noted.
§ 155.40
General.
(a)
Purpose.
These regulations establish procedures for the registration review program required in FIFRA section 3(g). Registration review is the periodic review of a pesticide's registration to ensure that each pesticide registration continues to satisfy the FIFRA standard for registration. Under FIFRA section 3(g), each pesticide is required to be reviewed every 15 years.
(1) Among other things, FIFRA requires that a pesticide generally will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. Registration review is intended to ensure that each
pesticide's registration is based on current scientific and other knowledge regarding the pesticide, including its effects on human health and the environment.
(2) If a product fails to satisfy the FIFRA standard for registration, the product's registration may be subject to cancellation or other remedies under FIFRA.
(b)
Applicability.
This subpart applies to every pesticide product registered under FIFRA section 3 as well as all pesticide products registered under FIFRA section 24(c). It does not apply to products whose sale or distribution is authorized under FIFRA section 5 or section 18.
(c)
Limitations.
(1) At any time, the Agency may undertake any other review of a pesticide under FIFRA, irrespective of the pesticide's past, ongoing, scheduled, or not yet scheduled registration review.
(2) When the Agency determines that new data or information are necessary for a pesticide's registration review, it will require such data under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B).
[71 FR 45732, Aug. 9, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 75595, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 155.42
Registration review cases.
(a)
Establishing registration review cases.
A registration review case will be composed of one or more active ingredients and all the products containing such ingredient(s). The Agency may group related active ingredients into a registration review case when the active ingredients are so closely related in chemical structure and toxicological profile as to allow common use of some or all required data for hazard assessment.
(1)
Existing pesticides.
The Agency will assign each pesticide registered on or before the effective date of this regulation to a registration review case.
(2) New pesticides. The Agency will assign each pesticide registered after the effective date of this regulation to an existing registration review case or to a new registration review case.
(3) A pesticide product that contains multiple active ingredients will belong to the registration review cases for each of its active ingredients.
(b)
Modifying registration review cases.
New data or information may suggest that a registration review case should be modified. The Agency may modify a registration review case in the following ways:
(1) Add a new active ingredient to a registration review case. The Agency may determine that a new active ingredient is chemically and toxicologically similar to active ingredients in an existing registration review case and should be grouped with the ingredients in the existing registration review case.
(2) Split a registration review case into two or more registration review cases. For example, new data or information may suggest that active ingredients in a registration review case are not as similar as previously believed and that they belong in two or more separate registration review cases.
(3) Move an ingredient from one registration review case to another. For example, new data or information might suggest that an ingredient should not be grouped with the other ingredients in the registration review case and that it belongs in a different registration review case.
(4) Merge two or more registration review cases into a single registration review case. For example, new data or information might suggest that the active ingredients in two or more registration review cases should be grouped together for registration review.
(5) Delete an active ingredient from a registration review case. For example, the Agency will remove the ingredient from the case if the registrations of all products containing an active ingredient in a registration review case are canceled.
(c)
Closing a registration review case.
The Agency will close a registration review case if all products in the case are canceled.
(d)
Establishing a baseline date for a registration review case.
For the purpose of scheduling registration reviews, the Agency will establish a baseline date for each registration review case. In general, the baseline date will be the date of initial registration of the oldest pesticide product in the case or the date of reregistration, whichever is
later. For the purpose of these procedures, the date of reregistration is the date on which the Reregistration Eligibility Decision or Interim Reregistration Decision was signed, whichever date the Agency determines to be more appropriate based on the comprehensiveness of the review.
(1) The Agency generally will not change the baseline date for a registration review case when it modifies a case by adding or deleting ingredients or products.
(2) When the Agency splits a registration review case into two or more cases, the new case(s) generally will have the baseline date of the original registration review case.
(3) When the Agency merges two or more registration review cases into a single case, the Agency generally will use the earliest baseline date as the baseline date for the new case.
(e)
Announcing registration review cases and baseline dates.
The Agency will maintain a list of registration review cases, including baseline dates, on its website.
§ 155.44
Establish schedules for registration review.
The Agency will develop schedules for registration review that are generally based on the baseline date of the registration review case or on the date of the latest registration review of the registration review case. The Agency may also take into account other factors, such as achieving process efficiencies by reviewing related cases together, when developing schedules for registration review. The Agency will maintain schedules for the current year and at least two subsequent years on its website.
§ 155.46
Deciding that a registration review is complete and additional review is not needed.
The Agency may determine that there is no need to reconsider a previous decision that a pesticide satisfies the standard of registration in FIFRA. In such cases, instead of establishing a pesticide registration review case docket as described in § 155.50, the Agency may propose that, based on its determination that a pesticide meets the FIFRA standard for registration, no further review will be necessary. In such circumstances, the Agency will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing the availability of the proposed decision and provide a comment period of at least 60 calendar days. The Agency will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing the availability of a final version of the decision, an explanation of any changes to the proposed decision and its response to any comments. The date of the final notice of availability would be used as the date of the latest registration review for the purpose of scheduling subsequent registration reviews.
§ 155.48
Data Call-In.
The Agency may issue a Data Call-In notice under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B) at any time if the Agency believes that the data are needed to conduct the registration review. The provisions in FIFRA section 3(c)(1), (c)(2)(B), and (c)(2)(D) apply to the submission, compensation, and exemption of data required to conduct a registration review.
§ 155.50
Initiate a pesticide's registration review.
The Agency will initiate a pesticide's registration review by establishing a docket for each registration review case, except for cases covered under § 155.46, and opening it for public review.
(a)
Contents of the registration review case docket.
The Agency will place in this docket information that will assist the public in understanding the types of information and issues that the Agency may consider in the course of the registration review. The Agency may include information from its files including, but not limited to, the following information:
(1) An overview of registration review case status;
(2) A list of current registrations and registrants, any
Federal Register
notices regarding pending registration actions, and current or pending tolerances;
(3) Risk assessment documents;
(4) Bibliographies concerning current registrations;
(5) Summaries of incident data; and
(6) Any other pertinent data or information.
(b)
Public review of the registration review case docket.
The Agency will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing the availability for public review of the information described in paragraph (a) of this section and establishing a comment period of at least 60 days. During this comment period, interested persons may identify any additional information they believe the Agency should consider in the course of the registration review.
(c)
Submission of data and other information during the comment period.
The Agency may identify, either in the notice published under paragraph (b) of this section, or at any other time, data or information that it does not have but which may be useful, if available, for consideration in the registration review. Any person may submit data or information in response to such identification. In order to be considered during a pesticide's registration review, the submitted data or information must meet the requirements listed below.
(1) In order to ensure that the Agency will consider data or information in the conduct of a registration review, interested persons must submit the data or information during the comment period established in the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section. The Agency may, at its discretion, consider data or information submitted at a later date.
(2) The data or information must be presented in a legible and useable form. For example, an English translation must accompany any material that is not in English and a written transcript must accompany any information submitted as an audiographic or videographic record. Written material may be submitted in paper or electronic form.
(3) Submitters must clearly identify the source of any submitted data or information.
(4) Submitters may request the Agency to reconsider data or information that the Agency rejected in a previous review. However, submitters must explain why they believe the Agency should reconsider the data or information in the pesticide's registration review.
(d) For the purposes of this subpart, the provisions of subpart B do not apply.
§ 155.52
Stakeholder engagement.
In addition to the public participation opportunities described in § 155.50 and § 155.53(c), the Agency may meet with stakeholders regarding a forthcoming or ongoing registration review. For example, before conducting a pesticide's registration review, the Agency may consult with registrants or pesticide users regarding the use and usage of the pesticide. The Agency may consult with registrants, pesticide users, or other persons during a pesticide's registration review with regard to developing risk management options for a pesticide. The Agency may informally consult with officials of Federal, State or Tribal agencies regarding a forthcoming or ongoing registration review.
(a)
Minutes of meetings with persons outside of government.
Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, if the Agency meets with one or more individuals that are not government employees to discuss matters relating to a registration review, the Agency will place in the docket a list of meeting attendees, minutes of the meeting, and any documents exchanged at the meeting, not later than the earlier of:
(1) 45 days after the meeting; or
(2) The date of issuance of the registration review decision.
(b)
Exchange of documents or other written material.
In the course of a meeting with a person outside of government, the Agency or that person may provide the other with a copy of a document or other written material that has not yet been released to the public. The Agency will place a copy of any such document or other written material in the docket along with the minutes of the meeting where the materials were exchanged.
(c)
Confidential business information.
The Agency will identify, but not include in the docket, any confidential business information whose disclosure is prohibited by FIFRA section 10.
[71 FR 45732, Aug. 9, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 75596, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 155.53
Conduct of a pesticide's registration review.
The Agency will review data and information described in § 155.50(a), (b), and (c) or submitted in response to a Data Call-In notice that it believes should be considered in the pesticide's registration review.
(a)
Assess changes since a pesticide's last review.
The Agency will assess any changes that may have occurred since the Agency's last registration decision in order to determine the significance of such changes and whether the pesticide still satisfies the FIFRA standard for registration. The Agency will consider whether to conduct a new risk assessment to take into account, among other things, any changes in statutes or regulations, policy, risk assessment procedures or methods, or data requirements. The Agency will consider whether any new data or information on the pesticide, including any data or information submitted under § 155.50 or in response to a Data Call-In notice, warrant conducting a new risk assessment or a new risk/benefit assessment. The Agency will also consider whether any new data or information regarding an individual pesticide product, including any data or information submitted under § 155.50 or in response to a Data Call-In notice, such as data or information about an inert ingredient in the pesticide product or other information or data relating to the composition, labeling or use of the pesticide product, warrant additional review of a pesticide product's registration.
(b)
Conduct new assessments as needed.
(1) Active ingredient(s) in the registration review case. If the Agency finds that a new assessment of the pesticide is needed, it will determine whether it can base the new assessment on available data or information, including data or information submitted under § 155.50 or in response to a Data Call-In notice. If sufficient data or information are available, the Agency will conduct the new risk assessment or risk/benefit assessment. If the Agency determines that additional data or information are needed to conduct the review, the Agency will issue a Data Call-In notice under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B).
(2) Individual product registrations. If the Agency finds that additional review of an individual product's registration is needed, it will review the pesticide product label, confidential statement of formula, product-specific data, or other pertinent data or information, as appropriate, to determine whether the registration of the individual product meets the FIFRA standard for registration. If the Agency determines that additional data or information are needed to conduct the review, the Agency will issue a Data Call-In notice under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B).
(c)
Public participation during a pesticide's registration review.
The Agency will generally make available for public review and comment a draft risk assessment for a pesticide if a new risk assessment has been conducted. The Agency will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing the availability of the draft risk assessment and provide a comment period of at least 30 calendar days. The Agency will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing the availability of a revised risk assessment, an explanation of any changes to the proposed document, and its response to comments. If the revised risk assessment indicates risks of concern, the Agency may, in the notice announcing the availability of the revised risk assessment, provide a comment period of at least 30 calendar days for the public to submit suggestions for mitigating the risk identified in the revised risk assessment.
(1) The Agency might not request comments on a draft risk assessment in cases where the Agency's initial screening of a pesticide indicates that it has low use/usage, affects few if any stakeholders or members of the public, poses low risk, and/or requires little or no risk mitigation. In such cases, the Agency will make a draft risk assessment available for public review and comment when it issues a proposed decision on the registration review case.
(2) If the Agency finds that it is not necessary to conduct a new risk assessment, it will issue a proposed decision on the registration review case as described in § 155.58.
§ 155.56
Interim registration review decision.
The Agency may issue, when it determines it to be appropriate, an interim registration review decision before completing a registration review. Among other things, the interim registration review decision may require new risk mitigation measures, impose interim risk mitigation measures, identify data or information required to complete the review, and include schedules for submitting the required data, conducting the new risk assessment and completing the registration review. A FIFRA 3(c)(2)(B) notice requiring the needed data or information may precede, accompany, or follow issuance of the interim registration review decision. The Agency will follow procedures in § 155.58 when issuing an interim registration review decision.
§ 155.57
Registration review decision.
A registration review decision is the Agency's determination whether a pesticide meets, or does not meet, the standard for registration in FIFRA.
§ 155.58
Procedures for issuing a decision on a registration review case.
(a) The Agency will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing the availability of a proposed registration review decision or a proposed interim registration review decision. At that time, the Agency will place in the pesticide's registration review docket the Agency's proposed decision and the bases for the decision. There will be a comment period of at least 60 calendar days on the proposed decision.
(b) In its proposed decision, the Agency will, among other things:
(1) State its proposed findings with respect to the FIFRA standard for registration and describe the basis for such proposed findings.
(2) Identify proposed risk mitigation measures or other remedies as needed and describe the basis for such proposed requirements.
(3) State whether it believes that additional data are needed and, if so, describe what is needed. A FIFRA 3(c)(2)(B) notice requiring such data may be issued in conjunction with a proposed or final decision on the registration review case or a proposed or final interim decision on a registration review case.
(4) Specify proposed labeling changes; and

[73 FR 64224, Oct. 29, 2008]
§ 156.10
Labeling requirements.
(a)
General
—(1)
Contents of the label.
Every pesticide product shall bear a label containing the information specified by the Act and the regulations in this part. The contents of a label must show clearly and prominently the following:
(i) The name, brand, or trademark under which the product is sold as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section;
(ii) The name and address of the producer, registrant, or person for whom produced as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section;
(iii) The net contents as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section;
(iv) The product registration number as prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section;
(v) The producing establishment number as prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section;
(vi) An ingredient statement as prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section;
(vii) Hazard and precautionary statements as prescribed in subpart D of this part for human and domestic animal hazards and subpart E of this part for environmental hazards.
(viii) The directions for use as prescribed in paragraph (i) of this section; and
(ix) The use classification(s) as prescribed in paragraph (j) of this section.
(2)
Prominence and legibility.
(i) All words, statements, graphic representations, designs or other information required on the labeling by the Act or the regulations in this part must be clearly legible to a person with normal vision, and must be placed with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or graphic matter on the labeling) and expressed in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.
(ii) All required label text must:
(A) Be set in 6-point or larger type;
(B) Appear on a clear contrasting background; and
(C) Not be obscured or crowded.
(3)
Language to be used.
All required label or labeling text shall appear in the English language. However, the Agency may require or the applicant may propose additional text in other languages as is considered necessary to protect the public. When additional text in another language is necessary, all labeling requirements will be applied equally to both the English and other-language versions of the labeling.
(4)
Placement of Label
—(i)
General.
The label shall appear on or be securely attached to the immediate container of the pesticide product. For purposes of this section, and the misbranding provisions of the Act, “securely attached”
shall mean that a label can reasonably be expected to remain affixed during the foreseeable conditions and period of use. If the immediate container is enclosed within a wrapper or outside container through which the label cannot be clearly read, the label must also be securely attached to such outside wrapper or container, if it is a part of the package as customarily distributed or sold.
(ii)
Tank cars and other bulk containers
—(A)
Transportation.
While a pesticide product is in transit, the appropriate provisions of 49 CFR parts 170-189, concerning the transportation of hazardous materials, and specifically those provisions concerning the labeling, marking and placarding of hazardous materials and the vehicles carrying them, define the basic Federal requirements. In addition, when any registered pesticide product is transported in a tank car, tank truck or other mobile or portable bulk container, a copy of the accepted label must be attached to the shipping papers, and left with the consignee at the time of delivery.
(B)
Storage.
When pesticide products are stored in bulk containers, whether mobile or stationary, which remain in the custody of the user, a copy of the label of labeling, including all appropriate directions for use, shall be securely attached to the container in the immediate vicinity of the discharge control valve.
(5)
False or misleading statements.
Pursuant to section 2(q)(1)(A) of the Act, a pesticide or a device declared subject to the Act pursuant to § 152.500, is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular including both pesticidal and non-pesticidal claims. Examples of statements or representations in the labeling which constitute misbranding include:
(i) A false or misleading statement concerning the composition of the product;
(ii) A false or misleading statement concerning the effectiveness of the product as a pesticide or device;
(iii) A false or misleading statement about the value of the product for purposes other than as a pesticide or device;
(iv) A false or misleading comparison with other pesticides or devices;
(v) Any statement directly or indirectly implying that the pesticide or device is recommended or endorsed by any agency of the Federal Government;
(vi) The name of a pesticide which contains two or more principal active ingredients if the name suggests one or more but not all such principal active ingredients even though the names of the other ingredients are stated elsewhere in the labeling;
(vii) A true statement used in such a way as to give a false or misleading impression to the purchaser;
(viii) Label disclaimers which negate or detract from labeling statements required under the Act and these regulations;
(ix) Claims as to the safety of the pesticide or its ingredients, including statements such as “safe,” “nonpoisonous,” “noninjurious,” “harmless” or “nontoxic to humans and pets” with or without such a qualifying phrase as “when used as directed”; and
(x) Non-numerical and/or comparative statements on the safety of the product, including but not limited to:
(A) “Contains all natural ingredients”;
(B) “Among the least toxic chemicals known”
(C) “Pollution approved”
(6)
Final printed labeling.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, final printed labeling must be submitted and accepted prior to registration. However, final printed labeling need not be submitted until draft label texts have been provisionally accepted by the Agency.
(ii) Clearly legible reproductions or photo reductions will be accepted for unusual labels such as those silk-screened directly onto glass or metal containers or large bag or drum labels. Such reproductions must be of microfilm reproduction quality.
(b)
Name, brand, or trademark.
(1) The name, brand, or trademark under which the pesticide product is sold shall appear on the front panel of the label.
(2) No name, brand, or trademark may appear on the label which:
(i) Is false or misleading, or
(ii) Has not been approved by the Administrator through registration or supplemental registration as an additional name pursuant to § 152.132.
(c) Name and address of producer, registrant, or person for whom produced. An unqualified name and address given on the label shall be considered as the name and address of the producer. If the registrant's name appears on the label and the registrant is not the producer, or if the name of the person for whom the pesticide was produced appears on the label, it must be qualified by appropriate wording such as “Packed for * * *,” “Distributed by * * *,” or “Sold by * * *” to show that the name is not that of the producer.
(d)
Net weight or measure of contents.
(1) The net weight or measure of content shall be exclusive of wrappers or other materials and shall be the average content unless explicitly stated as a minimum quantity.
(2) If the pesticide is a liquid, the net content statement shall be in terms of liquid measure at 68 °F (20 °C) and shall be expressed in conventional American units of fluid ounces, pints, quarts, and gallons.
(3) If the pesticide is solid or semisolid, viscous or pressurized, or is a mixture of liquid and solid, the net content statement shall be in terms of weight expressed as avoirdupois pounds and ounces.
(4) In all cases, net content shall be stated in terms of the largest suitable units,
i.e.
, “1 pound 10 ounces” rather than “26 ounces.”
(5) In addition to the required units specified, net content may be expressed in metric units.
(6) Variation above minimum content or around an average is permissible only to the extent that it represents deviation unavoidable in good manufacturing practice. Variation below a stated minimum is not permitted. In no case shall the average content of the packages in a shipment fall below the stated average content.
(7) For a pesticide product packaged in a refillable container, an appropriately sized area on the label may be left blank to allow the net weight or measure of content to be marked in by the refiller according to 40 CFR 165.65(h) or 165.70(i) prior to distribution or sale of the pesticide. As required in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the net contents must be shown clearly and prominently on the label.
(e)
Product registration number.
The registration number assigned to the pesticide product at the time of registration shall appear on the label, preceded by the phrase “EPA Registration No.,” or the phrase “EPA Reg. No.” The registration number shall be set in type of a size and style similar to other print on that part of the label on which it appears and shall run parallel to it. The registration number and the required identifying phrase shall not appear in such a manner as to suggest or imply recommendation or endorsement of the product by the Agency.
(f)
Producing establishment's registration number.
The producing establishment registration number preceded by the phrase “EPA Est.”, of the final establishment at which the product was produced may appear in any suitable location on the label or immediate container. It must appear on the wrapper or outside container of the package if the EPA establishment registration number on the immediate container cannot be clearly read through such wrapper or container. For a pesticide product packaged in a refillable container, an appropriately sized area on the label may be left blank after the phrase “EPA Est.” to allow the EPA establishment registration number to be marked in by the refiller according to 40 CFR 165.65(h) or 165.70(i) prior to distribution or sale of the pesticide.
(g)
Ingredient statement
—(1)
General.
The label of each pesticide product must bear a statement which contains the name and percentage by weight of each active ingredient, the total percentage by weight of all inert ingredients; and if the pesticide contains arsenic in any form, a statement of the percentages of total and water-soluble arsenic calculated as elemental arsenic. The active ingredients must be designated by the term “active ingredients” and the inert ingredients by the term “inert ingredients,” or the singular forms of these terms when appropriate. Both terms shall be in the same type size, be aligned to the same margin and be equally prominent. The
statement “Inert Ingredients, none” is not required for pesticides which contain 100 percent active ingredients. Unless the ingredient statement is a complete analysis of the pesticide, the term “analysis” shall not be used as a heading for the ingredient statement.
(2)
Position of ingredient statement.
(i) The ingredient statement is normally required on the front panel of the label. If there is an outside container or wrapper through which the ingredient statement cannot be clearly read, the ingredient statement must also appear on such outside container or wrapper. If the size or form of the package makes it impracticable to place the ingredient statement on the front panel of the label, permission may be granted for the ingredient statement to appear elsewhere.
(ii) The text of the ingredient statement must run parallel with other text on the panel on which it appears, and must be clearly distinguishable from and must not be placed in the body of other text.
(3)
Names to be used in ingredient statement.
The name used for each ingredient shall be the accepted common name, if there is one, followed by the chemical name. The common name may be used alone only if it is well known. If no common name has been established, the chemical name alone shall be used. In no case will the use of a trademark or proprietary name be permitted unless such name has been accepted as a common name by the Administrator under the authority of section 25(c)(6).
(4)
Statements of percentages.
The percentages of ingredients shall be stated in terms of weight-to-weight. The sum of percentages of the active and the inert ingredients shall be 100. Percentages shall not be expressed by a range of values such as “22-25%.” If the uses of the pesticide product are expressed as weight of active ingredient per unit area, a statement of the weight of active ingredient per unit volume of the pesticide formulation shall also appear in the ingredient statement.
(5)
Accuracy of stated percentages.
The percentages given shall be as precise as possible reflecting good manufacturing practice. If there may be unavoidable variation between manufacturing batches, the value stated for each active ingredient shall be the lowest percentage which may be present.
(6)
Deterioration.
Pesticides which change in chemical composition significantly must meet the following labeling requirements:
(i) In cases where it is determined that a pesticide formulation changes chemical composition significantly, the product must bear the following statement in a prominent position on the label: “Not for sale or use after [date].”
(ii) The product must meet all label claims up to the expiration time indicated on the label.
(7)
Inert ingredients.
The Administrator may require the name of any inert ingredient(s) to be listed in the ingredient statement if he determines that such ingredient(s) may pose a hazard to man or the environment.
(h) [Reserved]
(i)
Directions for Use
—(1)
General requirements
—(i)
Adequacy and clarity of directions.

(E) For restricted use pesticides, a statement that the pesticide may be applied under the direct supervision of a certified applicator who is not physically present at the site of application but nonetheless available to the person applying the pesticide, unless the Agency has determined that the pesticide may only be applied under the direct supervision of a certified applicator who is physically present.
(F) Other pertinent information which the Administrator determines to be necessary for the protection of man and the environment.
(j)
Statement of use classification.
Any pesticide product for which some uses are classified for general use and others for restricted use shall be separately labeled according to the labeling standards set forth in this subsection, and shall be marketed as separate products with different registration numbers, one bearing directions only for general use(s) and the other bearing directions for restricted use(s) except that, if a product has both restricted use(s) and general use(s), both of these uses may appear on a product labeled for restricted use. Such products shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
(1)
General Use Classification.
Pesticide products bearing directions for use(s) classified general shall be labeled with the exact words “General Classification” immediately below the heading “Directions for Use.” And reference to the general classification that suggests or implies that the general utility of the pesticide extends beyond those purposes and uses contained in the Directions for Use will be considered a false or misleading statement under the statutory definitions of misbranding.
(2)
Restricted Use Classification.
Pesticide products bearing direction for use(s) classified restricted shall bear statements of restricted use classification on the front panel as described below:
(i)
Front panel statement of restricted use classification.
(A) At the top of the front panel of the label, set in type of the same minimum sizes as required for human hazard signal words (see table in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section), and appearing with sufficient prominence relative to other text and graphic material on the front panel to make it unlikely to be overlooked under customary conditions of purchase and use, the statement “Restricted Use Pesticide” shall appear.
(B) Directly below this statement on the front panel, a summary statement of the terms of restriction imposed as a precondition to registration shall appear. If use is restricted to certified applicators, the following statement is required: “For retail sale to and use only by Certified Applicators or persons under their direct supervision and only for those uses covered by the Certified Applicator's certification.” If, however, other regulatory restrictions are imposed, the Administrator will define the appropriate wording for the terms of restriction by regulation.

# Subpart D—Human Hazard and Precautionary Statements

# Source:
66 FR 64764, Dec. 14, 2001, unless otherwise noted.
§ 156.60
General.
Each product label is required to bear hazard and precautionary statements for humans and domestic animals (if applicable) as prescribed in this subpart. Hazard statements describe the type of hazard that may occur, while precautionary statements will either
direct or inform the user of actions to take to avoid the hazard or mitigate its effects.
(a)
Location of statements
—(1)
Front panel statements.
The signal word, child hazard warning, and, in certain cases, the first aid statement are required to appear on the front panel of the label, and also in any supplemental labeling intended to accompany the product in distribution or sale.
(2)
Statements elsewhere on label.
Hazard and precautionary statements not required on the front panel may appear on other panels of the label, and may be required also in supplemental labeling. These include, but are not limited to, the human hazard and precautionary statements, domestic animal statements if applicable, a Note to Physician, and physical or chemical hazard statements.
(b)
Placement and prominence
—(1)
Front panel statements.
All required front panel warning statements shall be grouped together on the label, and shall appear with sufficient prominence relative to other front panel text and graphic material to make them unlikely to be overlooked under customary conditions of purchase and use. The table below shows the minimum type size requirements for the front panel warning statements for various front panel sizes.

§ 156.62
Toxicity Category.
This section establishes four Toxicity Categories for acute hazards of pesticide products, Category I being the highest toxicity category. Most human hazard, precautionary statements, and human personal protective equipment statements are based upon the Toxicity Category of the pesticide product as sold or distributed. In addition, toxicity categories may be used for regulatory purposes other than labeling, such as classification for restricted use and requirements for child-resistant packaging. In certain cases, statements based upon the Toxicity Category of the product as diluted for use are also permitted. A Toxicity Category is assigned for each of five types of acute exposure, as specified in the table in this paragraph.
Acute Toxicity Categories for Pesticide Products

Moderate irritation at 72 hours
Mild or slight irritation at 72 hours
§ 156.64
Signal word.
(a)
Requirement.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4), each pesticide product must bear on the front panel a signal word, reflecting the highest Toxicity Category (Category I is the highest toxicity category) to which the product is assigned by any of the five routes of exposure in § 156.62. The signal word
must also appear together with the heading for the human precautionary statement section of the labeling (see § 156.70).
(1)
Toxicity Category I.
Any pesticide product meeting the criteria of Toxicity Category I for any route of exposure must bear on the front panel the signal word “DANGER.” In addition, if the product is assigned to Toxicity Category I on the basis of its oral, inhalation or dermal toxicity (as distinct from skin and eye irritation), the word “Poison” must appear in red on a background of distinctly contrasting color, and the skull and crossbones symbol must appear in immediate proximity to the word “Poison.”
(2)
Toxicity Category II.
Any pesticide product meeting the criteria of Toxicity Category II as the highest category by any route of exposure must bear on the front panel the signal word “WARNING.”
(3)
Toxicity Category III.
Any pesticide product meeting the criteria of Toxicity Category III as the highest category by any route of exposure must bear on the front panel the signal word “CAUTION.”
(4)
Toxicity Category IV.
A pesticide product meeting the criteria of Toxicity Category IV by all routes of exposure is not required to bear a signal word. If a signal word is used, it must be “CAUTION.”
(b)
Use of signal words.
In no case may a product:
(1) Bear a signal word reflecting a higher Toxicity Category than indicated by the route of exposure of highest toxicity, unless the Agency determines that such labeling is necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on man or the environment;
(2) Bear a signal word reflecting a lesser Toxicity Category associated with a diluted product. Although precautionary statements for use dilutions may be included on label, the signal word must reflect the toxicity of the product as distributed or sold; or
(3) Bear different signal words on different parts of the label.
§ 156.66
Child hazard warning.
(a) Each pesticide product must bear on the front panel of the label the statement “Keep Out of Reach of Children.” That statement, or any alternative statement approved by EPA, must appear on a separate line in close proximity to the signal word, if required. The statement is required on Toxicity Category IV products that do not otherwise require a signal word.
(b) In its discretion, EPA may waive the requirement, or require or permit an alternative child hazard warning, if:
(1) The applicant can demonstrate that the likelihood of exposure of children to the pesticide during distribution, marketing, storage or use is remote (for example, an industrial use product); or
(2) The pesticide is approved for use on children (for example, an insect repellent).
(c) EPA may approve an alternative child hazard warning that more appropriately reflects the nature of the pesticide product to which children may be exposed (for example, an impregnated pet collar). In this case, EPA may also approve placement on other than the front panel.
§ 156.68
First aid statement.
(a)
Product as sold and distributed.
Each product must bear a first aid statement if the product has systemic effects in Category I, II, or III, or skin or eye irritation effects in Category I or II.
(b)
Product as diluted for use.
If the product labeling bears directions for dilution with water prior to use, the label may also include a statement describing how the first aid measures may be modified for the diluted product. Such a statement must reflect the Toxicity Category(ies) of the diluted product, based upon data for the route of exposure (or calculations if appropriate). If the labeling provides for a range of use dilutions, only that use dilution representing the highest concentration allowed by labeling may be used as the basis for a statement pertaining to the diluted product. The statement for a diluted product may not substitute for the statement for the concentrate, but augments the information provided for the concentrate.
(c)
Heading.
The heading of the statement may be “First Aid” or “Statement of Practical Treatment.”
(d)
Location of first aid statement.
The first aid statement must appear on the front panel of the label of all products assigned to Toxicity Category I by any route of exposure. Upon review, the Agency may permit reasonable variations in the placement of the first aid statement if a reference such as “See first aid statement on back panel” appears on the front panel. The first aid statement for products assigned to Toxicity Categories II or III may appear on any panel of the label.
§ 156.70
Precautionary statements for human hazards.

(i) If the product contains only one active ingredient and it is in toxicity category I by the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the restricted-entry interval shall be 48 hours. If, in addition, the active ingredient is an organophosphorus ester that inhibits cholinesterase and that may be applied outdoors in an
area where the average annual rainfall for the application site is less than 25 inches per year, the following statement shall be added to the restricted-entry interval statement: “(72 hours in outdoor areas where average annual rainfall is less than 25 inches a year).”
(ii) If the product contains only one active ingredient and it is in toxicity category II by the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the restricted-entry interval shall be 24 hours.
(iii) If the product contains only active ingredients that are in toxicity category III or IV by the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the restricted-entry interval shall be 12 hours.
(3)
Restricted-entry interval for multiple active ingredient products.
If the product contains more than one active ingredient, the restricted-entry interval (including any associated statement concerning use in arid areas under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) shall be based on the active ingredient that requires the longest restricted-entry interval as determined by the criteria in this section.
(d)
Exception for fumigants.
The criteria for determining restricted-entry intervals in paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply to any product that is a fumigant. For fumigants, any existing restricted-entry interval (hours, days, or acceptable exposure level) shall be retained. Entry restrictions for fumigants have been or shall be established on a case-by-case basis at the time of registration, reregistration, or other Agency review process.
(e)
Existing product-specific restricted-entry intervals.
(1) A product-specific restricted-entry interval, based on data collected in accordance with § 158.1070 or § 161.390 of this chapter and Subdivision K of the Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, shall supersede any restricted-entry interval applicable to the product under paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) Product-specific restricted-entry intervals established for pesticide products or pesticide uses that are not covered by part 170 of this chapter shall remain in effect and shall not be placed under the heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS in the labeling.
(f)
Existing interim restricted-entry intervals.
(1) An interim restricted-entry interval established by the Agency before the effective date of this subpart will continue to apply unless a longer restricted-entry interval is required by paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) Existing interim restricted-entry intervals established by the Agency for pesticide products or pesticide uses not covered by part 170 of this chapter shall remain in effect and shall not be placed under the heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS in the labeling.

§ 156.210
Notification-to-workers statements.
(a)
Requirement.
Each product that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall bear the posting and oral notification statements prescribed below. The statements shall be in the DIRECTIONS FOR USE section of the labeling under the heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS.
(b)
Notification to workers of pesticide application.
(1) Each product that contains any active ingredient classified as toxicity category I for either acute dermal toxicity or skin irritation potential under the criteria in § 156.62 shall bear the statement: “Notify workers of the application by warning them orally and by posting warning signs at entrances to treated areas.” If no acute dermal toxicity data are obtainable, data on acute oral toxicity of the active ingredient shall be considered instead. If no data on acute dermal toxicity, skin irritation potential, or acute oral toxicity are obtainable on the active ingredient, the toxicity category corresponding to the signal word of any registered manufacturing-use product that is the source of the active ingredient in the end-use product shall be used. If none of the applicable acute toxicity data are obtainable on the active ingredient and no toxicity category of the registered manufacturing-use product is obtainable, the toxicity category of the end-use product corresponding to the product's signal word shall be used.
(2) Each product that is a fumigant and is registered for use in a greenhouse (or whose labeling allows use in a greenhouse) shall bear the statement: “For greenhouse applications, notify workers of the application by warning them orally and by posting warning signs outside all entrances to the greenhouse.”
[57 FR 38146, Aug. 21, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 34203, June 23, 1993; 73 FR 75596, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 156.212
Personal protective equipment statements.
(a)
Requirement.
Each product shall bear the personal protective equipment statements prescribed in paragraphs (d) through (j) of this section.
(b)
Exceptions.
(1) If personal protective equipment were required for a product before the effective date of this subpart, the existing requirements shall be retained on the labeling wherever they are more specific or more protective (as specified in EPA guidance materials) than the requirements in the table in paragraph (e) of this section.
(2) Any existing labeling statement that prohibits the use of gloves or boots overrides the corresponding requirement in paragraph (e) of this section and must be retained on the labeling.
(3) If the product labeling contains uses that are not covered by part 170 of this chapter, the registrant may adopt the personal protective equipment required in this section for those uses. However, if the personal protective equipment required in this section would not be sufficiently protective or would be onerously overprotective for uses not covered by part 170 of this chapter, the registrant must continue to apply the existing personal protective equipment requirements to those uses. The labeling must indicate which personal protective equipment requirements apply to uses covered by part 170 of this chapter and which personal protective equipment requirements apply to other uses.
(c)
Location of personal protective equipment statements
—(1)
Personal protective equipment statements for pesticide handlers.
Personal protective equipment statements for pesticide handlers shall be in the HAZARDS TO HUMANS (AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS) section of the labeling. The required statements may be combined to avoid redundancy as long as the requirements and conditions under which they apply are identified.
(2) Personal protective equipment statements for early-entry workers. Personal protective equipment statements for early-entry workers shall be placed in the DIRECTIONS FOR USE section of the labeling under the heading AGRICULTURAL USE REQUIREMENTS and immediately after the restricted-entry statement required in § 156.208(a).
(d)
Personal protective equipment statements for pesticide handlers.
(1) The table in paragraph (e) of this section specifies minimum requirements for personal protective equipment (as defined in § 170.240 of this chapter) and work clothing for pesticide handlers. This personal protective equipment requirement applies to any product that presents a hazard through any route of exposure identified in the table (acute dermal toxicity, skin irritation potential, acute inhalation toxicity, and eye irritation potential).
(2) The requirement for personal protective equipment is based on the acute toxicity category of the end-use product for each route of exposure as defined by § 156.62. If data to determine the acute dermal toxicity or the acute inhalation toxicity are not obtainable, the acute oral toxicity shall be used as a surrogate to determine the personal protective equipment requirements for that route of exposure. If data to determine the acute toxicity of the product by a specific route of exposure (including acute oral toxicity in lieu of acute dermal or acute inhalation toxicity) are not obtainable, the toxicity category corresponding to the signal word of the end-use product shall be used to determine personal protective equipment requirements for that route of exposure. If the signal word is “CAUTION,” toxicity category III will be used.
(3) The minimum personal protective equipment and work clothing requirements specified in this section shall be
included in a statement such as the following: “Applicators and other handlers must wear: (body protection statement); (glove statement, if applicable); (footwear statement, if applicable); (protective eyewear statement, if applicable); (respirator statement, if applicable).” The format of statements given in this paragraph is optional, but it is recommended for clarity.

Subpart A [Reserved]

# Subpart B—Child-Resistant Packaging
§ 157.20
General.
This subpart prescribes requirements for child-resistant packaging of pesticide products and devices. The requirements are established under the authority of FIFRA section 25(a)(1), which authorizes the Administrator to issue regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act, and FIFRA section 25(c)(3), which authorizes the Administrator to establish standards with respect to the package, container or wrapping in which a pesticide or device is enclosed in order to protect children and adults from serious injury or illness resulting from accidental ingestion or contact with pesticides or devices regulated under the Act.
§ 157.21
Definitions.
Terms used in this subpart shall have the following meanings:
Appropriate,
when used with respect to child-resistant packaging, means that the packaging is chemically compatible with the pesticide contained therein.
Child-resistant packaging
means packaging that is designed and constructed to be significantly difficult for children under 5 years of age to open or obtain a toxic or harmful amount of the substance contained therein within a reasonable time, and that is not difficult for normal adults to use properly.
Package
or
packaging
means the immediate container or wrapping, including any attached closure(s), in which the pesticide is contained for distribution, sale, consumption, use or storage. The term does not include any shipping or bulk container used for transporting or delivering the pesticide unless it is the only such package.
Practicable,
when used with respect to child-resistant packaging, means that the packaging can be mass produced and can be used in assembly line production.
Residential use
means use of a pesticide or device:
(1) Directly on humans or pets;
(2) In, on, or around any structure, vehicle, article, surface or area associated with the household, including but not limited to areas such as non-agricultural outbuildings, non-commercial greenhouses, pleasure boats and recreational vehicles; or
(3) In or around any preschool or day care facility.
Technically feasible,
when applied to child-resistant packaging, means that the technology exists to produce the child-resistant packaging for a particular pesticide.
Unit packaging
means a package that is labeled with directions to use the entire contents of the package in a single application.
[51 FR 21286, June 11, 1986, as amended at 73 FR 75596, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 157.22
When required.
Unless exempted under § 157.24, a pesticide product must be distributed and sold in child-resistant packaging complying with § 157.32 if it meets both of the following criteria:
(a)
Toxicity criterion.
Based upon testing with an appropriate test species, the product meets any of the following toxicity criteria:
(1) The pesticide has an acute oral LD
50
of 1.5 g/kg or less;
(2) The pesticide has an acute dermal LD
50
of 2000 mg/kg or less;
(3) The pesticide has an acute inhalation LC
50
of 2 mg/liter or less;
(4) The pesticide is corrosive to the eye (causes irreversible destruction of ocular tissue) or causes corneal involvement or irritation persisting for 21 days or more;
(5) The pesticide is corrosive to the skin (causes tissue destruction into the dermis and/or scarring) or causes severe skin irritation (severe erythema or edema) at 72 hours; or
(6) The pesticide or device has such characteristics that, based upon human toxicological data, use history, accident data or such other evidence as is available, the Agency determines there is serious hazard of accidental injury or illness which child-resistant packaging could reduce; and
(b)
Use criterion.
The product's labeling either directly recommends residential use or reasonably can be interpreted to permit residential use.
§ 157.24
Exemptions.
(a)
General exemptions.
The Agency hereby exempts from the requirement for child-resistant packaging the following classes of products:
(1)
Products classified for restricted use.
(i) A product restricted to use by or under the supervision of a certified applicator is not required to be distributed and sold in child-resistant packaging.
(ii) Notwithstanding the exemption in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the Agency may require the use of child-resistant packaging for a product classified for restricted use by or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator if the Agency determines that the product poses a risk of serious accidental injury or illness which child-resistant packaging could reduce. If the Agency makes such a determination, it will notify the registrant in writing and provide a short statement of the basis of its determination. The registrant will then have 30 days to request a hearing on the Agency's determination. Thereafter the Agency will decide whether to require the product to be distributed only in child-resistant packaging and will notify the registrant of its decision.
(2)
Products packaged in large sizes.
(i) Except as provided by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a product is not required to be in child-resistant packaging if distributed and sold in the following sizes:
(A) If the product is a solid product, regardless of pesticide type, a size of 50 pounds or greater;
(B) If the product is a liquid product intended for use in swimming pools, a size greater than 7.5 gallons by volume;
(C) If the product is a liquid product intended for any other pesticide use, a size of 5 gallons or greater by volume;
(D) If the product is packaged as an aerosol (measured by weight), regardless of pesticide type, a weight of 2 pounds or greater.
(ii) The Agency may require that a product packaged in a size exceeding that listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section be distributed and sold only in child-resistant packaging if the Agency determines that the product is, or is intended to be, distributed or sold to homeowners or other members of the general public. If the Agency makes such a determination, it will notify the registrant in writing and provide a short statement of the basis of its determination. The registrant will then have 30 days to request a hearing on the Agency's determination. Thereafter the Agency will decide whether to require the product to be distributed only in child-resistant packaging and will notify the registrant of its decision.
(b)
Exemptions requiring Agency approval.
The Agency may, in accordance with paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section, grant an exemption from the requirements of this subpart. An exemption may be withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(1)
Requesting an exemption.
A request for an exemption must be submitted to the Agency, and must be accompanied by two copies of the following information:
(i) The name, address, and telephone number of the requester;
(ii) The name and registration number (or file symbol) of the product(s) for which the exemption is requested;
(iii) A description of the package and the size(s) for which the exemption is requested; and
(iv) Documentation supporting the request for exemption, including the length of time for which the exemption is requested.
(2)
Exemption based upon lack of toxicity.
The Agency may grant an exemption from the requirements of this subpart if the registrant or applicant demonstrates to the Agency's satisfaction that the hazards indicated by the toxicity criteria in § 157.22(a) are not indicative of the hazards to man. If granted, an exemption shall apply to other products of substantially similar composition. A notice will be issued in the
Federal Register
stating the nature of and reasons for the exemption.
(3)
Exemption based upon technical factors.
The Agency may grant an exemption from the requirements of this subpart based upon technical considerations. If granted, the exemption will be for a specified length of time, and will apply to other products of substantially similar composition and intended uses. A notice of the granting of
an exemption will be issued in the
Federal Register.
In considering whether to grant an exemption, the Agency will consider, among other things, the following:
(i) Whether the toxicity of the product is such that it should not be allowed to be distributed or sold except in child-resistant packaging.
(ii) Whether child-resistant packaging is technically feasible, practicable, or appropriate. An exemption may be granted if the Agency determines that any one of these criteria has not been met.
(iii) Whether the composition or use pattern of the product necessitates a particular form of packaging for proper use.
(iv) Whether child-resistant packaging that is technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate is available for the product or can reasonably be made available to the registrant in sufficient quantities to meet his packaging needs. This determination does not include a consideration of whether the packaging would be adaptable to a registrant's existing package type or packaging equipment.
(v) Whether the registrant has made a timely and good faith effort to obtain child-resistant packaging for the product.
(vi) If child-resistant packaging which is technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate is not yet available, when such packaging is likely to be available.
(4) An exemption may be withdrawn by the Agency at any time if the lack of child-resistant packaging results in serious illnesses or injuries to children. If the Agency determines that an exemption should be withdrawn, it will notify the registrant, stating the basis for its determination. The registrant will then have 30 days to request a hearing on the Agency's determination. Thereafter the Agency will decide whether to withdraw the exemption, and will notify the registrant of its decision.
§ 157.27
Unit packaging.
Pesticide products distributed or sold as an aggregate of one or more unit packages and meeting the criteria of § 157.22 must be distributed or sold in child-resistant packaging either for each unit package or for the outer retail container which contains the unit packages. Child-resistant packaging is not required for both the outer package and the unit packages unless the Agency determines, on a case-by-case basis, that it is necessary for risk reduction.
§ 157.30
Voluntary use of child-resistant packaging.
A registrant whose product is not required to be in child-resistant packaging may distribute or sell his pesticide product in child-resistant packaging. If he does so, that packaging must meet the standards for child-resistant packaging stated in § 157.32. The registrant must certify to this effect in accordance with § 157.34, and must retain the records required by § 157.36.
§ 157.32
Standards.
(a)
Effectiveness standard.
The child-resistant packaging, when tested by the protocol specified in 16 CFR 1700.20, shall meet the effectiveness specifications in 16 CFR 1700.15(b).
(b)
Compatibility standard.
The child-resistant packaging must continue to meet the effectiveness specifications of paragraph (a) of this section when in actual use as a pesticide container. This requirement may be satisfied by appropriate scientific evaluation of the compatibility of the substance with the child-resistant packaging to determine that the chemical and physical characteristics of the pesticide will not compromise or interfere with the proper functioning of the child-resistant packaging and that the packaging will not be detrimental to the integrity of the product during storage and use.
(c)
Durability standard.
The child-resistant packaging must continue to meet the effectiveness and compatibility standards of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for the reasonably expected lifetime of the package, taking into account the number of times the package is customarily opened and closed. This requirement may be satisfied by appropriate technical evaluation based on physical wear and stress factors of packaging, the force required for activation, and other relevant factors.
§ 157.34
Certification.
(a)
General.
(1) The registrant of a pesticide product required to be in child-resistant packaging shall certify to the Agency that the package meets the standards of § 157.32.
(2) Certification must be submitted with each application for new registration, if applicable. If the Agency determines, in accordance with § 157.24(a)(1)(ii), (2)(ii), or (b)(4), that a currently registered product is required to be packaged in child-resistant packaging, a certification must be submitted within 6 months after the Agency finally notifies the registrant of the requirement.
(b)
Contents of certification.
The certification must contain the following information:
(1) The name and EPA registration number of the product to which the certification applies, the registrant's name and address, the date, and the name, title and signature of the company official making the certification.
(2) A statement that the packaging that is being used for the product will meet the standards of § 157.32. The statement, “I certify that the packaging that will be used for this product meets the standards of 40 CFR 157.32,” will suffice for this purpose.
§ 157.36
Recordkeeping.
For as long as the registration of a pesticide product required to be in child-resistant packaging is in effect, the registrant must retain the records listed in this section. The registrant must, upon request by the Agency, make them available to Agency representatives for inspection and copying, or must submit them to the Agency.
(a) A description of the package, including a description of:
(1) The container and its dimensions and composition.
(2) The closure or child-resistant mechanism, including the name of its manufacturer and the manufacturer's designation for the closure or the physical working of the child-resistant packaging mechanism.
(b) A copy of the certification statement required by § 157.34.
(c) One of the following types of records verifying that each package for the product is child-resistant:
(1) Test data on the package based on the Consumer Product Safety Commission protocol in 16 CFR 1700.20.

§ 158.3
Definitions.
All terms defined in sec. 2 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act apply to this part and are used with the meaning given in the Act. Applicable terms from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act also apply to this part. Individual subparts may contain definitions that pertain solely to that subpart. The following additional terms apply to this part:
Applicant
means any person or entity, including for the purposes of this part a registrant, who submits, or is required to submit, to the Agency any application, petition, or submission intended to persuade EPA to grant, modify, or leave unmodified a registration or other approval required as a condition of sale or distribution of a pesticide. Such submissions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) An application for registration or amended registration of a pesticide product under FIFRA sec. 3 or 24.
(2) A submission of data required in conjunction with reregistration of a currently registered product under FIFRA sec. 4.
(3) An application for an experimental use permit under FIFRA sec. 5.
(4) A submission of data in response to a notice issued by EPA under FIFRA sec. 3(c)(2)(B).
(5) A petition to establish or modify a tolerance or an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue under FFDCA sec. 408.
Registration
includes a new registration, amended registration and reregistration, unless stated otherwise.
§ 158.5
Applicability.
(a) The requirements of this part apply to the following submissions:
(1) An application for new or amended registration under FIFRA sec. 3 or 24.
(2) An application for experimental use permit under FIFRA sec. 5.
(3) A submission of data or information to support the continuation of a registration under FIFRA sec. 3, 4, or 24.
(4) A petition to establish, modify or revoke a tolerance or exemption from a tolerance under FFDCA sec. 408.
(b) The information specified in this part must be furnished with each submission described in paragraph (a) of
this section if it has not been submitted previously, or if any previous submission is not accurate or complete.
§ 158.30
Flexibility.
(a) FIFRA provides EPA flexibility to require, or not require, data and information for the purposes of making regulatory judgments for pesticide products. EPA has the authority to establish or modify data needs for individual pesticide chemicals. The actual data required may be modified on an individual basis to fully characterize the use and properties, characteristics, or effects of specific pesticide products under review. The Agency encourages each applicant to consult with EPA to discuss the data requirements particular to its product prior to and during the registration process.
(b) The Agency cautions applicants that the data routinely required in this part may not be sufficient to permit EPA to evaluate the potential of the product to cause unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment. EPA may require the submission of additional data or information beyond that specified in this part if such data or information are needed to appropriately evaluate a pesticide product.
(c) This part will be updated as needed to reflect evolving program needs and advances in science.
§ 158.32
Format of data submissions.
(a)
General.
(1) All data submitted under this part must be formatted in accordance with this section.
(2) The requirements of this section do not apply to administrative materials accompanying a data submission, including forms, labeling, and correspondence.
(b)
Transmittal document.
Each submission in support of a regulatory action must be accompanied by a transmittal document, which includes:
(1) Identity of the submitter.
(2) The transmittal date.

§ 158.33
Confidential data.
(a)
Definitions.
For the purposes of this section:
(1)
Registered or previously registered pesticide
means any pesticide containing an active ingredient contained in a product that is, or has ever been, an active ingredient in a product registered under sec. 3 of FIFRA. A registered pesticide that is the subject of
an application for a new use falls within the category of “registered or previously registered pesticide.”
(2)
Safety and efficacy information
means information concerning the objectives, methodology, results, or significance of any test or experiment performed on or with a registered or previously registered pesticide or its separate ingredients, impurities, or degradation products, and any information concerning the effects of such pesticide on any organism or the behavior of such pesticide in the environment, including, but not limited to, data on safety to fish and wildlife, humans and other mammals, plants, animals, and soil, and studies on persistence, translocation and fate in the environment, and metabolism.
(b)
Applicability.
(1) This section applies to information submitted pursuant to this part. It supplements the general confidentiality procedures in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, including FIFRA confidentiality procedures at 40 CFR 2.307. To the extent that provisions in this section conflict with those in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, the provisions in this section take precedence. The provisions of 40 CFR 2.308 do not apply to information to which this section applies. In addition to complying with the requirements of this section, any confidentiality claims for information subject to 40 CFR part 174 (plant-incorporated protectants) must be substantiated at the time of submission as described in § 174.9 of this chapter.
(2) FFDCA sec. 408(i) protects confidential information submitted in connection with an application for a tolerance or exemption to the same extent as FIFRA sec. 10. References in this section to FIFRA sec. 10 are deemed to apply equally to information submitted pursuant to FFDCA sec. 408, pursuant to the authority in sec. 408(i).
(c)
Method of asserting business confidentiality claims
—(1)
Claim required.
Information to which this section applies (and which is submitted on or after the effective date of this regulation) will be deemed as not subject to a confidentiality claim unless a claim for that information is made in accordance with the procedures specified in this paragraph. Information not subject to a confidentiality claim may be made available to the public without further notice, subject to the requirements of FIFRA sec. 10(g).
(2)
Statement required.
Upon submission to EPA, each document must be accompanied by a signed and dated document containing either the statements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. No claims or markings on the document or any attachments, other than these statements and attachments submitted in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be recognized as asserting a claim of confidentiality. The format of data submissions is set forth in § 158.32.
(i)
No claim of confidentiality.
No claim of confidentiality, on any basis whatsoever, is made for any information contained in this document. I acknowledge that information not designated as within the scope of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C) and which pertains to a registered or previously registered pesticide is not entitled to confidential treatment and may be released to the public, subject to the provisions regarding disclosure to multinational entities under FIFRA sec. 10(g).
(ii)
Claim of confidentiality.
Information claimed as confidential has been removed to a confidential attachment.
(3)
Confidential attachment.
(i) All information claimed as confidential must be submitted in a separate confidential attachment to the document and cross referenced to the specific location in the document from which it was removed. The confidential attachment must have its own title page and be paginated separately from the non-confidential document.
(ii) All information in the confidential attachment that consists of (or whose disclosure would in turn disclose) manufacturing or quality control processes must be individually identified in the confidential attachment as a claim for information within the scope of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(A).
(iii) All information in the confidential attachment that consists of (or whose disclosure would in turn disclose) the details of any methods for testing, detecting, or measuring the quantity of any deliberately added inert ingredient of a pesticide, must be
individually identified in the confidential attachment as a claim for information within the scope of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(B).
(iv) All information in the confidential attachment that consists of (or whose disclosure would in turn disclose) the identity or percentage quantity of any deliberately added inert ingredient of a pesticide must be individually identified in the confidential attachment as a claim for information within the scope of FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(C).
(v) Information in the confidential attachment that is designated in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) - (iv) of this section must be on a separate page from information that is not so designated.
(4)
Voluntary release of information to States and foreign governments.
(i) Submitters are encouraged to include with the statement required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section an additional statement to allow EPA to share information with State and foreign governments. EPA will not consider such a statement to be a waiver of confidentiality or proprietary claims for the information. The statement is as follows:
I authorize the Environmental Protection Agency to release any information contained in this document to State or foreign governments, without relinquishing proprietary rights or any confidentiality claims asserted above.
(ii) Information designated as releasable to state or foreign governments in accordance with this section may be released to such a government without further notice to the submitter. EPA will inform the State or foreign government of any of the confidentiality claims associated with the information.
(d)
Release of information.
(1) Safety and efficacy information that was submitted to EPA on or after May 4, 1988 and that has not been designated by the submitter as FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C) information in accordance with the applicable requirements of this section is not entitled to confidential treatment and may be disclosed to the public without further notice to the submitter, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Safety and efficacy information which has been designated by the submitter as FIFRA sec. 10(d)(1) (A), (B), or (C) information is entitled to confidential treatment only to the extent provided by FIFRA sec. 10(b), this section, and 40 CFR 2.208.
(2) Information that is not entitled to be protected as confidential in accordance with FIFRA sec. 10(b), this section and with EPA confidentiality regulations at 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, may be released to the public without the affirmation of non-multinational status provided under FIFRA sec. 10(g), provided that the information does not contain or consist of any complete unpublished report submitted to EPA, or excerpts or restatements of any such report which reveal the full methodology and complete results of the study, test, or experiment, and all explanatory information necessary to understand the methodology or interpret the results.
§ 158.34

§ 158.45
Waivers.
(a) The data requirements specified in this part as applicable to a category of products will not always be appropriate for every product in that category. Some products may have unusual physical, chemical, or biological properties or atypical use patterns which would make particular data requirements inappropriate, either because it would not be possible to generate the required data or because the data would not be useful in the Agency's evaluation of the risks or benefits of the product. The Agency will waive data requirements it finds are inappropriate, but will ensure that sufficient data are available to make the determinations required by the applicable statutory standards.
(b)(1) Applicants are encouraged to discuss a data waiver request with the Agency before developing and submitting supporting data, information, or other materials.
(2) All waiver requests must be submitted to the Agency in writing. The request must clearly identify the data requirement(s) for which a waiver is sought along with an explanation and supporting rationale why the applicant believes the data requirement should be waived. In addition, the applicant
must describe any unsuccessful attempts to generate the required data, furnish any other information which the applicant(s) believe(s) would support the request, and when appropriate, suggest alternative means of obtaining data to address the concern which underlies the data requirement.
(c) The Agency will review each waiver request and subsequently inform the applicant in writing of its decision. If the decision could apply to more than the requested product, the Agency, in its discretion, may choose to send a notice to all registrants or publish a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing the decision. An Agency decision denying a written request to waive a data requirement is a final Agency action.
§ 158.60
Minor use data policies.
FIFRA sec. 2(ll) defines the term “minor use”and FIFRA provides a number of statutory provisions concerning minor uses. In addition, EPA has established policies with respect to minor uses of pesticides, including, but not limited to, the following:
(a) A new data requirement pertinent to both an unregistered minor use and a registered major use will not be applied to a minor use applicant until it is applied to the major use registration.
(b) EPA will accept appropriate and adequate extrapolations and regional data to support establishment of individual minor use tolerances.
§ 158.70
Satisfying data requirements.
(a)
General policy.
The Agency will determine whether the data submitted or cited to fulfill the data requirements specified in this part are acceptable. This determination will be based on the design and conduct of the experiment from which the data were derived, and an evaluation of whether the data fulfill the purpose(s) of the data requirement. In evaluating experimental design, the Agency will consider whether generally accepted methods were used, sufficient numbers of measurements were made to achieve statistical reliability, and sufficient controls were built into all phases of the experiment. The Agency will evaluate the conduct of each experiment in terms of whether the study was conducted in conformance with the design, good laboratory practices were observed, and results were reproducible. The Agency will not reject data merely because they were derived from studies which, when initiated, were in accordance with an Agency-recommended protocol, even if the Agency subsequently recommends a different protocol, as long as the data fulfill the purposes of the requirements as described in this paragraph.
(1) The provisions in this part 158 should be read in conjunction with the provisions in § 152.85 to claim eligibility for the formulators' exemption.
(2) [Reserved]
(b)
Good laboratory practices.
Applicants must adhere to the good laboratory practice (GLP) standards described in 40 CFR part 160 when conducting studies. Applicants must also adhere to GLP standards when conducting a study in support of a waiver request of any data requirement which is within the scope of the GLP requirements.
(c)
Agency guidelines.
EPA has published Test Guidelines that contain standards for conducting acceptable tests, guidance on the evaluation and reporting of data, definition of terms, and suggested study protocols. Copies of the Test Guidelines may be obtained by visiting the agency's website at
www.epa.gov/pesticides.
(d)
Study protocols
—(1)
General.
Any appropriate protocol may be used to generate the data required by this part, provided that it meets the purpose of the test standards specified in the pesticide assessment guidelines, and provides data of suitable quality and completeness as typified by the protocols cited in the guidelines. Applicants should use the test procedure which is most suitable for evaluation of the particular ingredient, mixture, or product. Accordingly, failure to follow a suggested protocol will not invalidate a test if another appropriate methodology is used.
(2)
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) protocols.
Tests conducted in accordance with the requirements and recommendations of the applicable OECD protocols can be used to develop data necessary to meet
the requirements specified in this part. Applicants should note, however, that certain of the OECD recommended test standards, such as test duration and selection of test species, are less restrictive than those recommended by EPA. Therefore, when using OECD protocols, care should be taken to observe the test standards in a manner such that the data generated by the study will satisfy the requirements of this part.
(e)
Combining studies.
Certain toxicology studies may be combined to satisfy data requirements. For example, carcinogenicity studies in rats may be combined with the rat chronic toxicity study. Combining appropriate studies may be expected to reduce usage of test animals as well as reduce the cost of studies. EPA encourages this practice by including standards for acceptable combined tests in the Pesticide Assessment Guidelines. Registrants and applicants are encouraged to consider combining other tests when practical and likely to produce scientifically acceptable results. Registrants and applicants, however, must consult with the EPA before initiating combined studies.
§ 158.75
Requirements for additional data.
The data routinely required by this part may not be sufficient to permit EPA to evaluate every pesticide product. If the information required under this part is not sufficient to evaluate the potential of the product to cause unreasonable adverse effects on man or the environment, additional data requirements will be imposed. However, EPA expects that the information required by this part will be adequate in most cases for an assessment of the properties and effects of the pesticide.
§ 158.80
Use of other data.
(a)
Data developed in foreign countries.
With certain exceptions, laboratory and field study data developed outside the United States may be submitted in support of a pesticide registration. Data generated in a foreign country which the Agency will not consider include, but are not limited to, data from tests which involved field test sites or a test material, such as a native soil, plant, or animal, that is not characteristic of the United States. Applicants submitting foreign data must take steps to ensure that U.S. materials are used, or be prepared to supply data or information to demonstrate the lack of substantial or relevant differences between the selected material or test site and the U.S. material or test site. Once submitted, the Agency will determine whether or not the data meet the data requirements.
(b)
Data generated for other purposes.
Data developed for purposes other than satisfaction of FIFRA data requirements, such as monitoring studies, may also satisfy data requirements in this part. Consultation with the Agency should be arranged if applicants are unsure about suitability of such data.

# Subpart B—How To Use Data Tables
§ 158.100
Pesticide use patterns.
(a)
General use patterns for conventional, biochemical, and microbial pesticides.
There are six broad use categories used in the data tables. The six broad categories include terrestrial outdoor uses, aquatic outdoor uses, greenhouse uses, forestry uses, residential outdoor uses, and indoor uses of all types. The 6 broad use categories are further subdivided into 12 general use patterns which are the bases for data requirements established by use pattern. Within the data tables, general use patterns have been combined into single columns when the data requirements are the same for the combined uses. If there are no data requirements for a specific use, the column for that use is not included in the table. The 12 general use pattern groups used in the data table in this part are:
(1) Terrestrial food crop use.
(2) Terrestrial feed crop use.
(3) Terrestrial nonfood crop use.
(4) Aquatic food crop use.
(5) Aquatic nonfood use.
(6) Greenhouse food crop use.
(7) Greenhouse nonfood crop use.
(8) Forestry use.
(9) Residential outdoor use.
(10) Residential indoor use.
(11) Indoor food use.
(12) Indoor nonfood use.
(b)
Pesticide use site index for conventional, biochemical, and microbial pesticides.
The Pesticide Use Site Index for Conventional, Biochemical, and Microbial Pesticides is a comprehensive list of specific pesticide use sites. The index is alphabetized separately by site for all agricultural and all nonagricultural uses. The Pesticide Use Site Index associates each pesticide use site with one or more of the 12 general use patterns. It may be used in conjunction with the data tables to determine the applicability of data requirements to specific uses. The Pesticide Use Site Index for Conventional, Biochemical, and Microbial Pesticides will be updated periodically, and is available from the Agency or may be obtained from the Agency's Web site at
http://www.epa.gov/pesticides.
(c)
Antimicrobial pesticide use patterns.
The general use patterns for antimicrobial pesticides are described in § 158.2201.
(d)
Pesticide use site index for antimicrobial pesticides.
The Pesticide Use Site Index for Antimicrobial Pesticides is a comprehensive list of specific antimicrobial use sites. The index is alphabetized by antimicrobial use sites, and associates each antimicrobial use site with one or more of the antimicrobial use patterns. It may be used in conjunction with the data tables to determine the applicability of data requirements to specific uses. The Pesticide Use Site Index for Antimicrobial Pesticides will be updated periodically, and is available from the Agency or may be obtained from the Agency's Web site at
http://www.epa.gov/pesticides.
(e)
Determination of use pattern.
Applicants unsure of the correct use pattern for their particular product should consult the Agency.
[72 FR 60957, Oct. 26, 2007, as amended at 78 FR 26978, May 8, 2013]
§ 158.110
Required and conditionally required data.
The tables in this part use the descriptors R (required), CR (conditionally required), and NR (not required) as a general indication of the applicability of a data requirement. In all cases, the test notes referred to in the table must be consulted to determine the actual applicability of the data requirement.
(a) EPA requires data designated as “required”(R) for products with a given use pattern in order to evaluate the risks or benefits of a product having that use pattern under any conditions established by the test notes.
(b) Data designated as “conditionally required” (CR) for products with a given use pattern are required by EPA to evaluate the risks or benefits of a product having that use pattern if the product meets the conditions specified in the notes accompanying the requirement. The determination of whether the data must be submitted is based on the product's use pattern, physical or chemical properties, expected exposure of nontarget organisms, and/or results of previous testing (for example, tier testing). Applicants must evaluate each applicable test note for the conditions and criteria to be considered in determining whether conditionally required data must be submitted.
(c) Data not required for the Agency's assessment of the risks and benefits of a particular use pattern are designated “not required” (NR) in data tables.
§ 158.120
Determining data requirements.
As with current practice, the actual data and studies required may be modified on an individual basis to fully characterize the use and properties of specific pesticide products under review. While EPA is attempting to assist the applicant in this subpart, it is important to emphasize that it is the applicant's obligation under FIFRA to demonstrate that an individual product meets the standard under FIFRA and/or FFDCA. Accordingly, applicants are encouraged to consult with the Agency on the appropriate data requirements as set forth here as they relate to their specific product prior to and during the registration process.
(a)
Finding the appropriate data table.
(1) Pesticide data requirements for conventional chemical active ingredients and related substances are presented in subparts D, E, F, G, K, L, N, and O of this part in the form of a series of data tables, each addressing a particular scientific discipline or data topic. Data
requirements for biochemical and microbial pest control agents are contained and are described separately within subparts U and V of this part, respectively.
(2) Key to table notations. R = required data; CR = conditionally required data; NR = Not required; MP = manufacturing-use product; EP = end-use product; TEP = typical end-use product; TGAI = technical grade of the active ingredient; PAI = pure active ingredient; PAIRA = pure active ingredient, radiolabeled; Choice = choice of several test substances depending on studies required.
(b)
Identifying required studies.
To determine the specific kinds of data needed to support the registration use of each pesticide product, the applicant may:
(1) Refer to the applicable subpart(s) of this part. These subparts describe the data requirements including data tables for each subject area.
(2) Select the general use pattern(s) that best cover the use pattern(s) specified on the pesticide product label as explained in § 158.100. All applicable use patterns must be included.
(3) Proceed down the appropriate general use pattern column in the table and note which tests are required (R), conditionally required (CR), or not required (NR). Required and conditionally required studies are described in § 158.110.
(4) Review the notes for each requirement to determine its applicability to the specific product proposed for registration.
(5)(i) Proceed down the Test substance columns and determine the appropriate test substance needed for that study. If the data are intended to support a manufacturing-use product, use the MP column. If the data are intended to support an end-use product, use the EP column.
(ii) The test substances columns specify which substance is to be used for testing. Applicants should note that the substance that must be used when performing the study may or may not be the product itself. For example, the data from a certain study may be required to support the registration of an end-use product, but the test substance column may state that the particular test shall be performed using the technical grade of the active ingredient(s) in the end-use product.
(iii) Manufacturing-use products (MP) and end-use products (EP) containing a single active ingredient and no intentionally added inert ingredients are considered identical in composition to each other, and to the technical grade of the active ingredient (TGAI) from which they were derived. Therefore, the data from a test conducted using any one of these as the test substance is also suitable to meet the requirement (if any) for the same test to be conducted using either of the other substances.
(6) Refer to the Pesticide Assessment Guideline reference number for each study located in the first column. See § 158.70(c) for information pertaining to the guidelines and how to obtain copies.
§ 158.130
Purposes of the registration data requirements.
(a)
General.
The data requirements for registration are intended to generate data and information necessary to address concerns pertaining to the identity, composition, potential adverse effects and environmental fate of each pesticide.
(b)
Product chemistry
—(1)
Product composition.
Data on product composition are needed:
(i) To support the conclusions expressed in the statement of formula;
(ii) To compare to the composition of materials used in required testing under this part; and
(iii) To determine whether a product is “identical or substantially similar”to another product, a determination that involves the comparison of product composition.
(2)
Nominal concentration and certified limits.
The nominal concentration of a product, defined as that concentration that is expected to be present in a product as a result of the production or formulation process, is used to gauge the acceptability of the certified limits, which define the outer limits of the range of the product's ingredients. The certified limits are used to enforce the composition of the product and to ensure the accuracy of hazard assessments.
(3)
Physical and chemical characteristics.
The physical and chemical characteristics of an active ingredient or product are used:
(i) To confirm or provide supportive information on the identity and composition of the product;
(ii) To assess the hazards of the ingredient or product; and
(iii) To trigger or evaluate certain other studies required by this part.
(c)
Product performance.
Requirements to develop data on product performance provide a mechanism to ensure that pesticide products will perform as intended and that unnecessary pesticide exposure to the environment will not occur as a result of the use of ineffective products. Specific performance standards are used to validate the efficacy data in the public health areas, including disinfectants used to control microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the inanimate environment and those pesticides used to control vertebrates (such as rodents, birds, bats and skunks) that may directly or indirectly transmit diseases to humans.
(d)
Toxicology-humans and domestic animals.
Data required to assess hazards to humans and domestic animals are derived from a variety of acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity tests, and tests to assess mutagenicity and pesticide metabolism.
(1)
Acute studies.
Determination of acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity is usually the initial step in the assessment and evaluation of the toxic characteristics of a pesticide. These data provide information on health hazards likely to arise soon after, and as a result of, short-term exposure. Data from acute studies serve as a basis for classification and precautionary labeling. For example, acute toxicity data are used to calculate farmworker reentry intervals and to develop precautionary label statements pertaining to protective clothing requirements for applicators. They also provide information used in establishing the appropriate dose levels in subchronic and other studies; provide initial information on the mode of toxic action(s) of a substance; and determine the need for child resistant packaging. Information derived from primary eye and primary dermal irritation studies serves to identify possible hazards from exposure of the eyes, associated mucous membranes and skin.
(2)
Subchronic studies.
Subchronic tests provide information on health hazards that may arise from repeated exposures over a limited period of time. They provide information on target organs and accumulation potential. The resulting data are also useful in selecting dose levels for chronic studies and for establishing safety criteria for human exposure. These tests are not capable of detecting those effects that have a long latency period for expression (e.g., carcinogenicity).
(3)
Chronic studies.
Chronic toxicity studies (usually conducted by feeding the test substance to the test species) are intended to determine the effects of a substance in a mammalian species following prolonged and repeated exposure. Under the conditions of this test, effects which have a long latency period or are cumulative should be detected. The purpose of long-term carcinogenicity studies is to observe test animals over most of their life span for the development of neoplastic lesions during or after exposure to various doses of a test substance by an appropriate route of administration.
(4)
Developmental toxicity and reproduction studies.
The developmental toxicity study is designed to determine the potential of the test substance to induce structural and/or other abnormalities to the fetus as the result of exposure of the mother during pregnancy. Two-generation reproduction testing is designed to provide information concerning the general effects of a test substance on gonadal function, estrus cycles, mating behavior, conception, parturition, lactation, weaning, and the growth and development of the offspring. The study may also provide information about the effects of the test substance on neonatal morbidity, mortality, and preliminary data on prenatal developmental toxicity and serve as a guide for subsequent tests.
(5)
Mutagenicity studies.
For each test substance a battery of tests is required to assess the potential to affect the mammalian cell's genetic components. The objectives underlying the selection
of a battery of tests for mutagenicity assessment are:
(i) To detect, with sensitive assay methods, the capacity of a chemical to alter genetic material in cells.
(ii) To determine the relevance of these mutagenic changes to mammals.
(iii) When mutagenic potential is demonstrated, to incorporate these findings in the assessment of heritable effects, carcinogenicity, and, possibly, other health effects.
(6)
Metabolism studies.
Data from studies on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a pesticide aid in the valuation of test results from other toxicity studies and in the extrapolation of data from animals to man. The main purpose of metabolism studies is to produce data which increases the Agency's understanding of the behavior of the chemical when considering the human exposure anticipated from intended uses of the pesticide.
(e)
Hazards to nontarget organisms
—(1)
General.
The information required to assess hazards to nontarget organisms is derived from tests to determine pesticidal effects on birds, mammals, fish, terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and plants. These tests include short-term acute, subacute, reproduction, simulated field, and full field studies arranged in a hierarchical or tier system which progresses from the basic laboratory tests to the applied field tests. The results of each tier of testing must be evaluated to determine the potential of the pesticide to cause adverse effects, and to determine whether further testing is required. A purpose common to all data requirements is to provide data which determine the need for (and appropriate wording for) precautionary label statements to minimize the potential adverse effects to nontarget organisms.
(2)
Short-term studies.
The short-term acute and subchronic laboratory studies provide basic toxicity information which serves as a starting point for the hazard assessment. These data are used: To establish acute toxicity levels of the active ingredient to the test organisms; to compare toxicity information with measured or estimated pesticide residues in the environment in order to assess potential impacts on fish, wildlife and other nontarget organisms; and to indicate whether further laboratory and/or field studies are needed.
(3)
Long-term and field studies.
Additional studies (
i.e.
, avian, fish, and invertebrate reproduction, life cycle studies and plant field studies) may be required when basic data and environmental conditions suggest possible problems. Data from these studies are used to: Estimate the potential for chronic effects, taking into account the measured or estimated residues in the environment; and to determine if additional field or laboratory data are necessary to further evaluate hazards. Simulated field and/or field data are used to examine acute and chronic adverse effects on captive or monitored fish and wildlife populations under natural or near-natural environments. Such studies are required only when predictions as to possible adverse effects in less extensive studies cannot be made, or when the potential for adverse effects is high.
(f)
Applicator and post-application exposure.
Data are used to evaluate exposures to persons in occupational and non-occupational settings, including agricultural, residential, commercial, institutional and recreational sites. Data include oral, dermal and inhalation exposure data, post-application residue data, post-application monitoring data, use information, and human activity information. These data, together with toxicology data, are used to determine whether application or post-application risks are of concern, and, where appropriate, to develop post-application restrictions such as reentry restrictions.
(g)
Pesticide spray drift evaluation.
Data required to evaluate pesticide spray drift are derived from studies of droplet size spectrum and spray drift field evaluations. These data contribute to the development of the overall exposure estimate and, along with data on toxicity for humans, fish and wildlife, or plants, are used to assess the potential hazard of pesticides to these organisms. A purpose common to all these tests is to provide data which will be used to determine the need for (and appropriate wording for) precautionary labeling to minimize the
potential adverse effect to nontarget organisms.
(h)
Environmental fate
—(1)
General.
The data generated by environmental fate studies are used to: Assess the toxicity to man through exposure of humans to pesticide residues remaining after application, either upon reentering treated areas or from consuming inadvertantly-contaminated food; assess the presence of widely distributed and persistent pesticides in the environment which may result in loss of usable land, surface water, ground water, and wildlife resources; and, assess the potential environmental exposure of other nontarget organisms, such as fish and wildlife, to pesticides. Another specific purpose of the environmental fate data requirements is to help applicants and the Agency estimate expected environmental concentrations of pesticides in specific habitats where threatened or endangered species or other wildlife populations at risk are found.
(2)
Degradation studies.
The data from hydrolysis and photolysis studies are used to determine the rate of pesticide degradation and to identify pesticides that may adversely affect nontarget organisms.
(3)
Metabolism studies.
Data generated from aerobic and anaerobic metabolism studies are used to determine the nature and availability of pesticides to rotational crops and to aid in the evaluation of the persistence of a pesticide.
(4)
Mobility studies.
These data requirements pertain to leaching, adsorption/desorption, and volatility of pesticides. They provide information on the mode of transport and eventual destination of the pesticide in the environment. This information is used to assess potential environmental hazards related to: Contamination of human and animal food; loss of usable land and water resources to man through contamination of water (including ground water); and habitat loss of wildlife resulting from pesticide residue movement or transport in the environment.
(5)
Dissipation studies.
The data generated from dissipation studies are used to assess potential environmental hazards (under actual field use conditions) related to: Reentry into treated areas; hazards from residues in rotational crops and other food sources; and the loss of land as well as surface and ground water resources.
(i)
Residue chemistry.
(1) Residue chemistry data are used by the Agency to estimate the exposure of the general population to pesticide residues in food and for setting and enforcing tolerances for pesticide residues in food or feed.
(2) Information on the chemical identity and composition of the pesticide product, the amounts, frequency and time of the pesticide application, and results of tests on the amount of residues remaining on or in the treated food or feed, are needed to support a finding as to the magnitude and identity of residues which result in food or animal feed as a consequence of a proposed pesticide usage.
(3) Residue chemistry data are also needed to support the adequacy of one or more methods for the enforcement of the tolerance, and to support practicable methods for removing residues that exceed any proposed tolerance.
(4)
Accumulation studies.
Accumulation studies indicate pesticide residue levels in food supplies that originate from wild sources or from rotational crops. Rotational crop studies are necessary to establish realistic crop rotation restrictions and to determine if tolerances may be needed for residues on rotational crops. Data from irrigated crop studies are used to determine the amount of pesticide residues that could be taken up by representative crops irrigated with water containing pesticide residues. These studies allow the Agency to establish label restrictions regarding application of pesticides on sites where the residues can be taken up by irrigated crops. These data also provide information that aids the Agency in establishing any corresponding tolerances that would be needed for residues on such crops. Data from pesticide accumulation studies in fish are used to establish label restrictions to prevent applications in certain sites so that there will be minimal residues entering edible fish or shellfish. These residue data
are also used to determine if a tolerance or action level is needed for residues in aquatic animals eaten by humans.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table to paragraph (c) of this section.
1. The Agency has waived the requirement to submit efficacy data unless the pesticide product bears a claim to control pest microorganisms that pose a threat to human health and whose presence cannot readily be observed by the user including, but not limited to, microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the inanimate environment, or a claim to control vertebrates (such as rodents, birds, bats, canids, and skunks) that may directly or indirectly transmit diseases to humans. However each registrant must ensure through testing that his product is efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency reserves the right to require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of efficacy data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table to paragraph (c) of this section.
1. Not required if test material is a gas or a highly volatile liquid.
2. Not required if test material is corrosive to skin or has a pH of less than 2 or greater than 11.5.
3. Required if the product consists of, or under conditions of use will result in, a respirable material (e.g., gas, vapor, aerosol, or particulate).
4. Required if repeated dermal exposure is likely to occur under conditions of use.
5. Required if the test material is an organophosphorus substance, which includes uncharged organophosphorus esters, thioesters, or anhydrides of organophosphoric, organophosphonic, or organophosphoramidic acids, or of related phosphorothioic, phosponothioic, or phosphorothioamidic acids, or is structurally related to other substances that may cause the delayed neurotoxicity sometimes seen in this class of chemicals.
6. These studies are seldom required to support EUPs. They may be required if the dietary exposure for these EUPs occupies a large part, e.g., greater than 50%, of the reference dose.
7. The oral route, by oral intubation, is preferred unless the chemical or physical properties of the test substance or the pattern of exposure suggests a more appropriate route of exposure.
8. May be combined with the 2-generation reproduction study in rodents by utilizing a second mating of the parental animals in either generation.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table to paragraph (c) of this section.
1. Data using the TGAI are required to support all outdoor end-use product uses including, but not limited to, turf. Data are generally not required to support end-use products in the form of a gas, a highly volatile
liquid, a highly reactive solid, or a highly corrosive material.
2. For greenhouse and indoor end-use products, data using the TGAI are required to support manufacturing-use products to be reformulated into these same end-use products or to support end-use products when there is no registered manufacturing-use product. Avian acute oral data are not required for liquid formulations for greenhouse and indoor uses. The study is not required if there is no potential for environmental exposure.
3. Data are required on one passerine species and either one waterfowl species or one upland game bird species for terrestrial, aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. Data are preferred on waterfowl or upland game bird species for indoor and greenhouse uses.
4. Data are required on waterfowl and upland game bird species.
5. Data are required on one coldwater fish and one warmwater fish for terrestrial, aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. For indoor and greenhouse uses, testing with only one of either fish species is required.
6. EP or TEP testing is required for any product which meets any of the following conditions:
i. The end-use pesticide will be introduced directly into an aquatic environment (e.g., aquatic herbicides and mosquito larvicides) when used as directed.
ii. The maximum expected environmental concentration (MEEC) or the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) in the aquatic environment is ≥one-half the LC
50
or EC
50
of the TGAI when the EP is used as directed.
iii. An ingredient in the end-use formulation other than the active ingredient is expected to enhance the toxicity of the active ingredient or to cause toxicity to aquatic organisms.
7. Data are required on one freshwater aquatic invertebrate species.
8. Data are generally not required for outdoor residential uses, other than turf, unless data indicate that pesticide residues from the proposed use(s) can potentially enter waterways.
9. Data are required on one freshwater fish species. If the test species is different from the two species used for the freshwater fish acute toxicity tests, a 96 hour LC
50
on that species must also be provided.
10. Not required when:
i. The octanol/water partition coefficients of the pesticide and its major degradates are
1,000; or
ii. There are no potential exposures to fish and other nontarget aquatic organisms; or
iii. The hydrolytic half-life is
5 days at pH 5, 7 and 9.

§ 158.300
Definitions.
The following terms are defined for the purposes of this subpart:
Active ingredient
means any substance (or group of structurally similar substances, if specified by the Agency) that will prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate any pest, or that functions as a plant regulator, desiccant, defoliant, or nitrogen stabilizer, within the meaning of FIFRA sec. 2(b).
End-use product
means a pesticide product whose labeling:
(1) Includes directions for use of the product (as distributed or sold, or after combination by the user with other substances) for controlling pests or defoliating, desiccating or regulating growth of plants, or as a nitrogen stabilizer, and
(2) does not state that the product may be used to manufacture or formulate other pesticide products.
Formulation
means:
(1) The process of mixing, blending, or dilution of one or more active ingredients with one or more other active or inert ingredients, without an intended chemical reaction, to obtain a manufacturing-use product or an end-use product, or
(2) The repackaging of any registered product.
Impurity
means any substance (or group of structurally similar substances if specified by the Agency), in a pesticide product other than an active ingredient or an inert ingredient, including unreacted starting materials, side reaction products, contaminants, and degradation products.
Impurity associated with an active ingredient
means:
(1) Any impurity present in the technical grade of active ingredient; and
(2) Any impurity which forms in the pesticide product through reactions between the active ingredient and any other component of the product or packaging of the product.

Each impurity associated with the active ingredient which the applicant has reason to believe may be present in the product at any time before use at a level ≥0.1 percent (1,000 ppm) by weight of the product based on what he knows about the following:
(1) The possible carryover of impurities present in any registered product which serves as the source of any of the product's active ingredients. The identity and level of impurities in the registered source need not be discussed or quantified unless known to the formulator.
(2) The possible carryover of impurities present in the inert ingredients in the product.
(3) Possible reactions occurring during the formulation of the product between any of its active ingredients, between the active ingredients and inert ingredients, or between the active ingredient and the production equipment.
(4) Post-production reactions between any of the product's active ingredients and any other component of the product or its packaging.
(5) Possible migration of packaging materials into the product.
(6) Possible contaminants resulting from earlier use of equipment to produce other products.
(c)
Expanded discussion.
On a case-by-case basis, the Agency may require an expanded discussion of information on impurities:
(1) From other possible chemical reactions.
(2) Involving other ingredients.
(3) At additional points in the production or formulation process.
§ 158.345
Preliminary analysis.
(a) If the product is produced by an integrated system, the applicant must provide a preliminary analysis of each technical grade of active ingredient contained in the product to identify all impurities present at 0. 1 percent or greater of the technical grade of the active ingredient. The preliminary analysis should be conducted at the point in the production process after which no further chemical reactions designed to produce or purify the substances are intended.
(b) Based on the preliminary analysis, a statement of the composition of the technical grade of the active ingredient must be provided. If the technical grade of the active ingredient cannot be isolated, a statement of the composition of the practical equivalent of the technical grade of the active ingredient must be submitted.
§ 158.350
Certified limits.
The applicant must propose certified limits for the ingredients in the product. Certified limits become legally binding limits upon approval of the application. Certified limits will apply to the product from the date of production to date of use. If the product label bears a statement prohibiting use after a certain date, the certified limits will apply only until that date.
(a)
Ingredients for which certified limits are required.
Certified limits are required on the following ingredients of a pesticide product:
(1) An upper and lower limit for each active ingredient.
(2) An upper and lower limit for each inert ingredient.
(3) If the product is a technical grade of active ingredient or is produced by an integrated system, an upper limit for each impurity of toxicological significance associated with the active ingredient and found to be present in any sample of the product.
(4) On a case-by-case basis, certified limits for other ingredients or impurities as specified by EPA.
(b)
EPA determination of standard certified limits for active and inert ingredients.
(1) Unless the applicant proposes different limits as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the upper and lower certified limits for active and inert ingredients will be determined by EPA. EPA will calculate the certified limits on the basis of the nominal concentration of the ingredient in the product, according to the table in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2) Table of standard certified limits.
Standard Certified Limits
If the nominal concentration (N) for the ingredient and percentage by weight for the ingredient is:
The certified limits for that ingredient will be as follows:
Upper Limit
Lower Limit
N ≤1.0%
N + 10%N
N - 10%N
1.0% ≤N ≤20.0%
N + 5%N
N - 5%N
20.0% ≤N ≤100.0%
N + 3%N
N - 3%N
(c)
Applicant proposed limits.
(1) The applicant may propose a certified limit for an active or inert ingredient that differs from the standard certified limit calculated according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2) If certified limits are required for impurities, the applicants must propose a certified limit. The standard certified limits may not be used for such substances.
(3) Certified limits should:
(i) Be based on a consideration of the variability of the concentration of the ingredient in the product when good manufacturing practices and normal quality control procedures are used.
(ii) Allow for all sources of variability likely to be encountered in the production process.
(iii) Take into account the stability of the ingredient in the product and the possible formation of impurities between production and sale or distribution.
(4) The applicant may include an explanation of the basis of his proposed
certified limits, including how the certified limits were arrived at (e.g., sample analysis, quantitative estimate based on production process), and its accuracy and precision. This will be particularly useful if the range of the certified limit for an active or inert ingredient is greater than the standard certified limits.
(d)
Special cases.
If the Agency finds unacceptable any certified limit (either standard, or applicant proposed), the Agency will inform the registrant or applicant of its determination and will provide supporting reasons. The Agency may also recommend alternative limits to the applicant. The Agency may require, on a case-by-case basis, any or all of the following:
(1) More precise limits.
(2) More thorough explanation of how the certified limits were determined.
(3) A narrower range between the upper and lower certified limits than that proposed.
(e)
Certification statement.
The applicant must certify the accuracy of the information presented, and that the certified limits of the ingredients will be maintained. The following statement, signed by the authorized representative of the company, is acceptable:
I hereby certify that, for purposes of FIFRA sec. 12(a)(1)(C), the description of the composition of [
insert product name
], EPA Reg. No. [
insert registration number
], refers to the composition set forth on the Statement of Formula and supporting materials. This description includes the representations that: (1) no ingredient will be present in the product in an amount greater than the upper certified limit or in an amount less than the lower certified limit (if required) specified for that ingredient in a currently approved Statement of Formula (or as calculated by the Agency); and (2) if the Agency requires that the source of supply of an ingredient be specified, that all quantities of such ingredient will be obtained from the source specified in the Statement of Formula.
§ 158.355
Enforcement analytical method.
An analytical method suitable for enforcement purposes must be provided for each active ingredient in the product and for each other ingredient or impurity that the Agency determines to be toxicologically significant.

Test notes.
The following notes appy to the data requirements table in paragraph (d) of this section.
1. The Agency has waived the requirement to submit product performance data unless the pesticide product bears a claim to control pest microorganisms that pose a threat to human health and whose presence cannot readily be observed by the user including, but not limited to, microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the inanimate environment, or a claim to control vertebrates (such as rodents, birds, bats, canids, and skunks) that may directly or indirectly transmit diseases to humans. However each registrant must ensure through testing that his product is efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency reserves the right to require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of product performance data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:
1. Not required if test material is a gas or a highly volatile liquid.
2. Diluted EP testing is required to support the end product registration if results using the EP meet the criteria for restricted use classification under § 152.170(b) or special review consideration under § 154.7(a)(1).
3. Not required if the test material is corrosive to skin or has a pH of less than 2 or greater than 11.5.
4. Required if the product consists of, or under conditions of use will result in, a respirable material (e.g., gas, vapor, aerosol, or particulate).
5. Required if repeated dermal exposure is likely to occur under conditions of use.
6. Required if the test material is an organophosphorus substance, which includes uncharged organophosphorus esters; thioesters or anhydrides of organophosphoric, organophosphonic, or organophosphoramidic acids; or of related phosphorothioic, phosponothioic, or phosphorothioamidic acids; or is structurally related to other substances that may cause the delayed neurotoxicity sometimes seen in this class of chemicals.
7. As determined by the Agency, additional measurements may also be required, such as cholinesterase activity for certain pesticides, e.g., organophosphates and some carbamates. The route of exposure must correspond with the primary route of exposure.
8. Required for nonfood use pesticides if oral exposure could occur.
9. The 90-day study is required in the rat for hazard characterization (possibly endpoint selection) and dose-setting for the chronic/carcinogenicity study. It is not required in the mouse, but the Agency would strongly encourage the registrant to conduct a 90-day range finding for the purposes of dose selection for the mouse carcinogenicity study to achieve adequate dosing and an acceptable study. The registrant is also encouraged to consult with the Agency on the results of the 90-day mouse study prior to conducting the carcinogenicity study.
10. Required for agricultural uses or if repeated human dermal exposure may occur. Not required if an acceptable 90-day dermal toxicity study is performed and submitted.
11. EP testing is required if the product, or any component of it, may increase dermal absorption of the active ingredient(s) as determined by testing using the TGAI, or increase toxic or pharmacologic effects.
12. Required for food uses if either of the following criteria is met:
(i) The use pattern is such that the dermal route would be the primary route of exposure; or
(ii) The active ingredient is known or expected to be metabolized differently by the dermal route of exposure than by the oral route, and a metabolite is the toxic moiety.
13. Required if there is the likelihood of significant repeated inhalation exposure to the pesticide as a gas, vapor, or aerosol.
14. Based on estimates of the magnitude and duration of human exposure, studies of shorter duration, e.g., 21- or 28-days, may be sufficient to satisfy this requirement. Registrants should consult with the Agency to determine whether studies of shorter duration would meet this requirement.
15. Required if results of acute neurotoxicity study indicate significant statistical or biological effects, or if other available data indicate the potential for this type of delayed neurotoxicity, as determined by the Agency.
16. All 90-day subchronic studies in rats can be designed to simultaneously fulfill the requirements of the 90-day neurotoxicity study using separate groups of animals for testing. Although the subchronic guidelines include the measurement of neurological endpoints, they do not meet the requirement of the 90-day neurotoxicity study.
17. Required if either of the following are met:
(i) The use of the pesticide is likely to result in repeated human exposure over a considerable portion of the human lifespan, as determined by the Agency;
(ii) The use requires a tolerance or an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.
18. Based on the results of the acute and subchronic neurotoxicity studies, or other available data, a combined chronic toxicity and neurotoxicity study may be required.
19. Studies which are designed to simultaneously fulfill the requirements of both the chronic oral and carcinogenicity studies (
i.e.
, a combined study) may be conducted. Minimum acceptable study durations are:
(i) Chronic rodent feeding study (food use) - 24 months.
(ii) Chronic rodent feeding study (nonfood use) - 12 months.
(iii) Mouse carcinogenicity study - 18 months.
(iv) Rat carcinogenicity study - 24 months.
20. Required if any of the following, as determined by the Agency, are met:
(i) The use of the pesticide is likely to result in significant human exposure over a considerable portion of the human life span which is significant in terms of either frequency, duration, or magnitude of exposure;
(ii) The use requires a tolerance or an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance; or
(iii) The active ingredient, metabolite, degradate, or impurity (a) is structurally related to a recognized carcinogen, (b) causes mutagenic effects as demonstrated by
in vitro
or
in vivo
testing, or (c) produces a morphologic effect in any organ (e.g., hyperplasia, metaplasia) in subchronic studies that may lead to a neoplastic change.
21. If this study is modified or waived, a subchronic 90-day oral study conducted in the same species may be required.
22. Testing in two species is required for all uses.
23. The oral route, by oral intubation, is preferred unless the chemical or physical properties of the test substance or the pattern of exposure suggests a more appropriate route of exposure.
24. Additional testing by other routes may be required if the pesticide is determined to be a prenatal developmental toxicant after oral dosing.
25. May be combined with the 2-generation reproduction study in rodents by utilizing a second mating of the parental animals in either generation.
26. Required to support products intended for food uses and to support products intended for nonfood uses if use of the product is likely to result in significant human exposure over a portion of the human life span in terms of frequency, magnitude or duration of exposure.
27. An information-based approach to testing is preferred, which utilizes the best available knowledge on the chemical (hazard, pharmacokinetic, or mechanistic data) to determine whether a standard guideline study, an enhanced guideline study, or an alternative study should be conducted to assess potential hazard to the developing animal, or in some cases to support a waiver for such testing. Registrants should submit any alternative proposed testing protocols and supporting scientific rationale to the Agency prior to study initiation.
28. Study required using a weight-of-evidence approach considering:
(i) The pesticide causes treatment-related neurological effects in adult animal studies (
i.e.
, clinical signs of neurotoxicity, neuropathology, functional or behavioral effects).
(ii) The pesticide causes treatment-related neurological effects in developing animals, following pre- and postnatal exposure (
i.e.
, nervous system malformations or neuropathy, brain weight changes in offspring, functional or behavioral changes in the offspring).
(iii) The pesticide elicits a causative association between exposures and adverse neurological effects in human epidemiological studies.
(iv) The pesticide evokes a mechanism that is associated with adverse effects on the development of the nervous system (e.g., SAR relationship to known neurotoxicants, altered neuroreceptor or neurotransmitter responses).
29. The use of a combined study that utilizes the 2-generation reproduction study in rodents as a basic protocol for the addition of other endpoints or functional assessments in the immature animal is encouraged.
30. At a minimum, an initial battery of mutagenicity tests with possible confirmatory testing is required. Other relevant mutagenicity tests that may have been performed, plus a complete reference list must also be submitted.
31. Choice of assay using either:
(i) Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, thymidine kinase (tk) gene locus, maximizing assay conditions for small colony expression or detection;
(ii) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79) cells, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hgprt) gene locus, accompanied by an appropriate
in vitro
test for clastogenicity; or
(iii) CHO cells strains AS52, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (xprt) gene locus.
32. The micronucleus rodent bone marrow assay is preferred; however, rodent bone marrow assays using metaphase analysis (aberrations) are acceptable.
33. Required when chronic or carcinogenicity studies are required. May be required if significant adverse effects are seen in available toxicology studies and these effects can be further elucidated by metabolism studies.
34. May be required if the product's use will result in exposure to domestic animals through, but not limited to, direct application.
35. A risk assessment assuming that dermal absorption is equal to oral absorption must be performed to determine if the study is required, and to identify the doses and duration of exposure for which dermal absorption is to be quantified.
36. A 1-year non-rodent study (
i.e.
, 1-year dog study) would be required if the Agency finds that a pesticide chemical is highly bioaccumulating and is eliminated so slowly that it does not achieve steady state or sufficient tissue concentrations to elicit an effect during a 90-day study. EPA would require the appropriate tier II metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies to evaluate more precisely bioavailability, half-life, and steady state to determine if a longer duration dog toxicity study is needed.
§ 158.510
Tiered testing options for nonfood pesticides.
For nonfood use pesticides only, applicants have two options for generating and submitting required toxicology (§ 158.500) and human exposure (§§ 158.1020, 158.1070, and 158.1410) studies. Applicants are to select one of the following:
(a) Acute, subchronic, chronic, and other toxicological studies on the active ingredient must be submitted together. The specific makeup of the set of toxicology study requirements is based on the anticipated exposure to the pesticide as determined by the Agency. If hazards are identified based upon review of these studies, specific exposure data will be required to evaluate risk.
(b) Certain toxicological and exposure studies must be submitted simultaneously with the toxicology data submitted in a tiered system. Exposure data must be submitted along with first tier toxicology data. The requirement for additional second and third level toxicology testing will be determined by the Agency based on the results of the first tiered studies.
(1) The required first-tier toxicology studies consist of:
(i) Battery of acute studies.
(ii) A subchronic 90-day dermal study or a subchronic 90-day inhalation study.
(iii) An acute and subchronic neurotoxicity screening battery in the rat.
(iv) Prenatal developmental toxicity studies in both the rat and rabbit.
(v) Reproduction and fertility studies in rats.
(vi) Battery of mutagenicity studies.
(vii) Immunotoxicity study.
(2) The conditionally required second-tier studies include:
(i) Subchronic 90-day feeding studies in both the rodent and nonrodent.
(ii) Dermal penetration study.
(3) The conditionally required third-tier studies include:
(i) Chronic feeding studies in the rodent.
(ii) Carcinogenicity.
(iii) Metabolism study.
(iv) Additional mutagenicity testing.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to terrestrial and aquatic nontarget organisms data requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:
1. Data using the TGAI are required to support all outdoor end-use product uses including, but not limited to turf. Data are generally not required to support end-use products in the form of a gas, a highly volatile liquid, a highly reactive solid, or a highly corrosive material.
2. For greenhouse and indoor end-use products, data using the TGAI are required to support manufacturing-use products to be reformulated into these same end-use products or to support end-use products when there is no registered manufacturing-use product. Avian acute oral data are not required for liquid formulations for greenhouse and indoor uses. The study is not required if there is no potential for environmental exposure.
3. Data are required on one passerine species and either one waterfowl species or one upland game bird species for terrestrial, aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. Data are preferred on waterfowl or upland game bird species for indoor and greenhouse uses.
4. Data are required on waterfowl and upland game bird species.
5. Tests are required based on the results of lower tier toxicology studies, such as the acute and subacute testing, intended use pattern, and environmental fate characteristics that indicate potential exposure.
6. Higher tier testing may be required for a specific use pattern when a refined risk assessment indicates a concern based on laboratory toxicity endpoints and refined exposure assessments.
7. Environmental chemistry methods used to generate data associated with this study must include results of a successful confirmatory method trial by an independent laboratory. Test standards and procedures for independent laboratory validation are available as addenda to the guideline for this test requirement.
8. Data are required on one coldwater fish and one warmwater fish for terrestrial, aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. For indoor and greenhouse uses, testing with only one of either fish species is required.
9. EP or TEP testing is required for any product which meets any of the following conditions:
i. The end-use pesticide will be introduced directly into an aquatic environment (e.g., aquatic herbicides and mosquito larvicides) when used as directed.
ii. The maximum expected environmental concentration (MEEC) or the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) in the aquatic environment is ≥one-half the LC
50
or EC
50
of the TGAI when the EP is used as directed.
iii. An ingredient in the end-use formulation other than the active ingredient is expected to enhance the toxicity of the active ingredient or to cause toxicity to aquatic organisms.
10. Data are required on one freshwater aquatic invertebrate species.
11. Data are required on one estuarine/marine mollusk, one estuarine/marine invertebrate and one estuarine/marine fish species.
12. Data are generally not required for outdoor residential uses, other than turf, unless data indicate that pesticide residues from the proposed use(s) can potentially enter waterways.
13. Data are required on one freshwater fish species. If the test species is different from the two species used for the freshwater fish acute toxicity tests, a 96-hour LC
50
on that species must also be provided.
14. Data are required on one estuarine/marine invertebrate species.
15. Data are required on estuarine/marine species if the product meets any of the following conditions:
i. Intended for direct application to the estuarine or marine environment.
ii. Expected to enter this environment in significant concentrations because of its expected use or mobility patterns.
iii. If the acute LC
50
or EC
50

50
or LC
50
or if any of the following conditions exist:
A. Studies of other organisms indicate the reproductive physiology of fish and/or invertebrates may be affected.
B. Physicochemical properties indicate bioaccumulation of the pesticide.
C. The pesticide is persistent in water (e.g., half-life in water
4 days).
16. Data are required on one estuarine/marine fish species.
17. Data are required on estuarine/marine species if the product is intended for direct application to the estuarine or marine environment, or the product is expected to enter this environment in significant concentrations because of its expected use or mobility patterns.
18. Data are required on freshwater species if the end-use product is intended to be applied directly to water, or is expected to be transported to water from the intended use site, and when any of the following conditions apply:
i. If the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) is ≥0.1 of the no-observed-effect level in the fish early-life stage or invertebrate life cycle test;
ii. If studies of other organisms indicate that the reproductive physiology of fish may be affected.
19. Not required when:

24. Data are required only when the formulation contains one or more active ingredients having an acute LD
50
of
11 micrograms per bee as determined in the honey bee acute contact study and the use pattern(s) indicate(s) that honey bees may be exposed to the pesticide.
25. Required if any of the following conditions are met:

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:
1. Study is required for indoor uses in cases where environmental exposure is likely to occur. Such sites include, but are not limited to, agricultural premises, in or around farm buildings, barnyards, and beehives.
2. Not required when the electronic absorption spectra, measured at pHs 5, 7, and 9, of the chemical and its hydrolytic products, if any, show no absorption or tailing between 290 and 800 nm.
3. Not required when the chemical is to be applied only by soil injection or is incorporated in the soil.
4. Requirement based on use patterns and other pertinent factors including, but not limited to, the Henry's Law Constant of the chemical. In view of methodological difficulties with the study of photodegradation in air, prior consultation with the Agency regarding the protocol is recommended before the test is performed.
5. Required for aquatic food and nonfood crop uses for aquatic sites that are intermittently dry. Such sites include, but are not limited to, cranberry bogs and rice paddies.
6. Adsorption and desorption using a batch equilibrium method is preferred. However in some cases, for example, where the pesticide degrades rapidly, soil column leaching with unaged or aged columns may be more appropriate to fully characterize the potential mobility of the parent compound and major transformation products.
7. Environmental chemistry methods used to generate data associated with this study must include results of a successful confirmatory method trial by an independent laboratory. Test standards and procedures for independent laboratory validation are available as addenda to the guideline for this test requirement.
8. Requirement for terrestrial uses is based on potential for aquatic exposure and if pesticide residues have the potential for persistence, mobility, nontarget aquatic toxicity or bioaccumulation. Not required for aquatic residential uses. Field testing under the terrestrial field dissipation requirement may be more appropriate for some aquatic food crops, such as rice and cranberry uses, that are managed to have a dry-land period for production. The registrant is encouraged to consult with the Agency on protocols.
9. Agency approval of a protocol is necessary prior to initiation of the study.
10. This study may be triggered if there is specific evidence that the presence of one pesticide can affect the dissipation characteristics of another pesticide when applied simultaneously or serially.
11. Required if the weight-of-evidence indicates that the pesticide and/or its degradates is likely to leach to ground water, taking into account other factors such as the toxicity of the chemicals(s), available monitoring data, and the vulnerability of ground water resources in the pesticide use area.
12. If the terrestrial dissipation study cannot assess all of the major routes of dissipation, the forestry study will be required.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section.
1. Required if indoor use could result in pesticide residues in or on food or feed.
2. Material safety data sheets must accompany standards as specified by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.1200.
3. Required for residential outdoor uses on food crops if the corresponding agricultural use is not approved or the residential use is expected to produce higher residues based on the label directions.
4. Required for indoor uses where the pesticide is applied directly to food, in order to determine metabolites and/or degradates. Not required when only indirect contact with food would occur (e.g., crack and crevice treatments).
5. Data for fish are required for all pesticides applied directly to water inhabited, or which will be inhabited, by fish that may be caught or harvested for human consumption.
6. Required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to livestock, to livestock premises, to livestock drinking water, or to crops used for livestock feed. If results from the plant metabolism study show differing metabolites in plants from those found in animals, an additional livestock metabolism study involving dosing with the plant metabolite(s) may also be required.
7. Required when the Agency determines that it is reasonably foreseeable that a food or feed crop could be subsequently planted on the site of pesticide application after harvest or failure of the treated crop. Typically not required for pesticide uses in permanent food crops (e.g., various tree crops, vines) or semi-permanent crops (e.g., asparagus, pineapples).
8. A residue analytical method suitable for enforcement purposes is required whenever a numeric tolerance (including temporary and time-limited tolerances) is proposed.
9. New analytical methods to be used for enforcement purposes must include results from an independent laboratory validation.
10. A residue method, storage stability data, and crop field trials are required for the nonfood crop tobacco (green, freshly harvested). Depending on the level of residues found on the green tobacco, additional data may be required on cured/dried tobacco and pyrolysis products.
11. Data are required to determine whether FDA/USDA multiresidue methodology would detect and identify the pesticides and any metabolites.
12. Data are required for any magnitude of the residue study unless analytical samples are stored frozen for 30 days or less, and the active ingredient is not known to be volatile or labile.
13. Studies using single serving samples of a raw agricultural commodity may be needed for acutely toxic pesticides and/or their metabolites. These residue studies must be conducted using a statistical design accepted by the Agency.
14. Required for indoor uses which are direct postharvest treatments of raw agricultural commodities (e.g., fungicidal waxes or stored grain fumigants).
15. Data on the nature and level of residues in processed food/feed are required if residues could potentially concentrate on processing thus requiring the establishment of a separate tolerance higher than that of the raw agricultural commodity.
16. Required when the pesticide use is a direct application to livestock.
17. Data are required if pesticide residues are present in or on livestock feed items or intentionally added to drinking water. These studies, however, may not be required in cases where the livestock metabolism studies indicate negligible transfer of the pesticide's residues of concern to tissues, milk, and eggs at the maximum expected exposure level for the animals.
18. If results from the plant metabolism study show differing metabolites in plants from those found in animals, an additional livestock feeding study involving dosing with the plant metabolite(s) may also be required.
19. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be applied directly to water, unless it can be demonstrated that the treated water would not be available for human or livestock consumption.
20. Data are required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to water that could be used for irrigation or to irrigation facilities such as irrigation ditches.
21. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be used in a food handling or feed handling establishment.
22. Required when residues at the tolerance level may result in a risk of concern. These data may include washing, cooking, processing or degradation studies as well as market basket surveys for a more precise residue determination.
23. Typically required if pesticide residues of concern greater than 0.01 ppm are found in crops at the appropriate plant back intervals (taking into account plant back restrictions on product labels) in the confined rotational crop study. If residues of concern in the confined study are greater than 0.01 ppm but less than the limit of quantitation of the analytical method to be used on field trial samples, the Agency will consider not requiring, on a case-by-case basis, the limited field trials. If there are particular toxicological concerns with the parent pesticide or any metabolites, limited field studies may be needed if such residues are identified at levels below 0.01 ppm in the confined study.
24. Crop field trials are required to establish tolerances on rotational crops when quantifiable residues of concern are observed in the field rotational crops study.
25. Not required for an exemption from a tolerance provided that dietary exposure estimates are not needed due to low toxicity or that theoretical estimates of exposure are adequate to assess dietary risk.
26. Not required for an exemption from a tolerance.

# Subpart R—Product Performance for Products Claiming Effectiveness Against Invertebrate Pests

# Source:
87 FR 22475, Apr. 15, 2022, unless otherwise noted.
§ 158.1700
General requirements.
(a)
General.
Each applicant must ensure through testing that their product is efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency may require, as specified herein and on a case-by-case basis, submission of product performance data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration or amendment.
(1)
Test substance.
All product performance testing is performed using the end-use product.
(2)
Test organism.
All product performance testing must report the species tested.
(3)
Testing.
All products are to be tested to support the claim(s) made on the labeling of the pesticide product.
(4)
Data requirements.
To determine the specific product performance data required to support the registration of each pesticide product, the applicant must refer to the applicable sections of this subpart.
(b)
Product performance data submission.
Each product that bears a claim subject to this subpart, must be supported by submission of product performance data, as listed in this subpart. This product performance data must be submitted with any application for registration or amended registration. For the pest-specific claims listed in this subpart, data must be for the species specified to support the claim. For pests listed as part of a group or subgroup, pest-specific data would also need to be submitted to support a pest-specific claim.
§ 158.1701
Definitions.
Definitions.
The following terms are defined for purposes of this subpart.
Complete protection time (CPT)
means the time from application of a skin-applied insect repellent until efficacy failure, which is described in Product Performance Test Guideline 810.3700.
Introduction
means the intentional or unintentional escape, release, dissemination, or placement of a species into an ecosystem as a result of human activity.
Invasive species
means with respect to a particular ecosystem, any species that is not native to that ecosystem, and whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.
Performance standard
means a benchmark or reference against which the efficacy of the pesticide is compared (including, but not limited to, the ability of the pesticide product to control, kill, or repel an invertebrate pest species).
Pest group labeling claim
means a claim or statement on the labeling of the pesticide product that the product is effective against a group of related species or taxa demonstrating adequate similarity in basic biology and life history characteristics to permit identification of representative test species for the entire assemblage of taxa.
Pest-specific labeling claim
means a claim or statement on the labeling of the pesticide product that the product is effective against a particular arthropod species, such as German cockroach or house fly.
Pest sub-group labeling claim
means a claim or statement on the labeling of the pesticide product that the product is effective against a set of related species or taxa demonstrating adequate similarity in basic biology and life history characteristics to permit identification of representative test species and part of a larger identified taxonomic grouping (e.g., Biting flies) that includes other pest species, which may or may not have a specified pest group.
Skin-applied insect repellent
means a product intended to disrupt the host-seeking behavior of insects or other arthropods, driving or keeping them away from treated human skin. The repellent product, such as a liquid, lotion, or spray, is intended to be applied directly to human skin. Efficacy of skin-applied insect repellents is expressed as complete protection time.
Species
means a group of organisms all of which have a high degree of physical and genetic similarity, generally breed only among themselves, and show persistent differences from members of allied groups of organisms.
Wood-destroying
applies to pests that feed on or nest in wood, and therefore are highly destructive to wood buildings or structures, and stored lumber.
Vector
means any organism capable of transmitting the causative agent of human and/or animal disease, including
but not limited to mosquitoes and ticks.
§ 158.1703
Application categories.
The following terms are defined for purposes of this subpart.
Bait treatment
means a pesticide product intended to be ingested by the target pest that kills or controls an invertebrate pest such as ants, cockroaches, or termites. This is normally through the insect feeding on the product directly, but may also include products which the target will contact and later ingest during grooming/cleaning. The attractiveness of these products is through the use of a palatable food base, however they may also incorporate an attractant (e.g., pheromone) which is intended to attract the target pests over a greater distance.
Soil-applied termiticides
means pesticide products that are applied to the soil beneath and/or adjacent to the structure, pre- or post-construction, to kill or control termites. Treatments can be preventive (
i.e.,
to provide structural protection before a termite infestation is present) or remedial (
i.e.,
to kill and control a termite infestation when present).
Spatial repellents
include treatments of both indoor and outdoor sites where the product is applied into the air rather than onto a surface or the skin in order to drive away insects or other arthropods from that space. They are intended to repel the target pest through the dispersal of pesticide into the atmosphere of a room or other open space.
Structural protection
means the prevention of termite or other wood-destroying pest activity in an entire structure as the result of an application of a pesticide product.
Wood protectants and other non-structural protection
means the prevention of termite or other wood-destroying pest activity only to the treated wood (or other treated material), whereas structural protectants, however applied, claim to prevent damage to the structure.
§ 158.1704
Performance standards for data acceptability.
(a)
General.
The claim stated on the pesticide product labeling (such as knockdown, control, mortality, or repellency) determines the performance standard that must be met. In the absence of specific pest/labeling claims/performance standards specified in §§ 158.1708 through 158.1786, the performance standards of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply.
(b)
Skin-applied insect repellent labeling claims.
(1) For skin-applied insect repellent labeling claims, the performance standard must be greater than or equal to 2-hours complete protection time.
(2) Any testing required under this part which involves any human subjects must comply with all applicable requirements under 40 CFR part 26. For example, 40 CFR part 26 requirements are pertinent to the part 158 testing requirement if the testing involves intentional exposure of human subjects. Protocols for such testing must be submitted to EPA for review prior to study initiation. Those protocols determined by EPA to involve intentional exposure of human subjects also require review by EPA's Human Studies Review Board (HSRB)) prior to study initiation. If you are uncertain about the applicability of the 40 CFR part 26 requirements to this 40 CFR part 158 testing requirement or uncertain about the nature of your planned testing (such as, for example, whether the testing would involve intentional exposure of human subjects or whether the testing would be an observational study), you should contact the Agency prior to initiating the testing.
(c)
Labeling claims for products other than skin-applied insect repellents.
Unless otherwise specified in §§ 158.1712 through 158.1786, a minimum performance standard of 90 percent is required, except skin-applied insect repellents as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, and non-wearable spatial repellents, where a minimum performance standard of 75 percent is required.
§ 158.1705
Test guidelines.
EPA has published the Harmonized Test Guidelines, which set forth the recommended approach to generate the data required in this subpart. The Product Performance Guidelines (Series 810, Group C—Invertebrate Control Agent Test Guidelines) are available on
the Agency's website. These guidelines cover some, but not all, of the tests that would be used to generate data under this subpart. In instances where there is a conflict between one of the Harmonized Test Guidelines and the provisions of this subpart, this subpart will control.
§ 158.1707
Data requirement modifications.
The data requirements (including the performance standards associated with the data requirements) specified in this subpart as applicable to a category of products will not always be appropriate for every product in that category. Data requirements may, on a case-by-case basis, be modified by EPA in response to requests for novel technologies or products that have unusual physical, chemical, or biological properties or atypical use patterns which would make a particular data requirement, or data performance standard, inappropriate. Requests for such data requirement modifications must be submitted in the same manner as waiver requests submitted under 40 CFR 158.45. EPA will respond in writing to those requests. The Agency may grant the request if it finds such modifications are appropriate for the pesticide in question, and will ensure that sufficient data are available to make the determinations required by the applicable statutory standards.
§ 158.1708
Invasive species claims.
(a)
General.
In addition to those species specified in paragraph (b) of this section, if an application for registration or amended registration requests a labeling claim for effectiveness against an invasive invertebrate species, then on a case-by-case basis, EPA may require submission of product performance data and establish performance standards for those data to support those claims for effectiveness.
(b)
Specific.
Applications for registration or amended registration requests for a labeling claim for the emerald ash borer,
Agrilus planipennis,
or Asian longhorned beetle,
Anoplophora glabripennis,
must be accompanied by product performance data to support those claims for effectiveness.
§ 158.1709
Invertebrate disease vector claims.
If an application for registration or amended registration requests a labeling claim specific to a disease vector (such as repels mosquitoes that may carry West Nile virus), then submission of test data conducted with the species specific to the disease vector claim and meeting the specific performance standard for that species is required even if the disease vector species is not the test species required in §§ 158.1712 through 158.1786.
§ 158.1710
Structural and wood-destroying pest claims.
If an application for registration or amended registration requests a labeling claim specific to a structural or wood-destroying pest not identified in §§ 158.1782 through 158.1786, EPA may require submission of product performance data, with testing on that specific pest and subject to specific performance standards, to support those claims for effectiveness.
§ 158.1712

[Reserved]

# Subpart U—Biochemical Pesticides

# Source:
72 FR 61002, Oct. 26, 2007, unless otherwise noted.
§ 158.2000
Biochemical pesticides definition and applicability.
This subpart applies to all biochemical pesticides as defined in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.
(a)
Definitions.
The following terms are defined for the purposes of subpart U of this part.
(1) A
biochemical pesticide
is a pesticide that:
(i) Is a naturally-occurring substance or structurally-similar and functionally identical to a naturally-occurring substance;
(ii) Has a history of exposure to humans and the environment demonstrating minimal toxicity, or in the case of a synthetically-derived biochemical pesticides, is equivalent to a
naturally-occurring substance that has such a history; and
(iii) Has a non-toxic mode of action to the target pest(s).
(2) A
Pheromone
is a compound produced by a living organism or is a synthetically derived substance that is structurally similar and functionally identical to a naturally-occurring pheromone, which, alone or in combination with other such compounds, modifies the behavior of other individuals of the same species.
(i) An
Arthropod Pheromone
is a pheromone produced by a member of the taxonomic phylum Arthropoda.
(ii) A
Lepidopteran Pheromone
is an arthropod pheromone produced by a member of the insect order Lepidoptera.
(iii) A
Straight Chain Lepidopteran Pheromone
is a lepidopteran pheromone consisting of an unbranched aliphatic chain (between 9 and 18 carbons) ending in an alcohol, aldehyde, or acetate functional group and containing up to three double bonds in the aliphatic backbone.
(b)
Examples.
Biochemical pesticides include, but are not limited to:
(1) Semiochemicals (insect pheromones and kairomones),
(2) Natural plant and insect regulators,
(3) Naturally-occurring repellents and attractants, and
(4) Enzymes.
(c)
Applicability.
The Agency may review, on a case-by-case basis, naturally-occurring pesticides that do not clearly meet the definition of a biochemical pesticide in an effort to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that only the minimum testing sufficient to make scientifically sound regulatory decisions would be conducted. The Agency will review applications for registration of naturally-occurring pesticides to determine whether to review the pesticide under this subpart U.
§ 158.2010
Biochemical pesticides data requirements.
(a) Sections 158.2030 through 158.2070 identify the data requirements that are required to support registration of biochemical pesticides. Sections 158.2080 through 158.2084 identify the data requirements that are required to support Experimental Use Permits (EUPs). Variations in the test conditions are identified within the test notes. Definitions that apply to all biochemical data requirements can be found in § 158.2000.
(b) Each data table includes “use patterns” under which the individual data are required, with variations including food and nonfood uses for terrestrial and aquatic applications, greenhouse, indoor, forestry, and residential outdoor applications under certain circumstances.
(c) The categories for each data requirement are “R”, which stands for required, and “CR” which stands for conditionally required. Generally, “R” indicates that the data are more likely required than for those data requirements with “CR.” However, in each case, the regulatory text preceding the data table and the test notes following the data table must be used to determine whether the data requirement must be satisfied.
(d) Each table identifies the test substance that is required to be tested to satisfy the data requirement. Test substances may include: technical grade active ingredient (TGAI), manufacturing-use product (MP), end-use product (EP), typical end-use product (TEP), residue of concern, and pure active ingredient (PAI) or all of the above (All). Commas between the test substances (
i.e.
, TGAI, EP) indicate that data may be required on the TGAI or EP or both depending on the conditions set forth in the test note.
(e) The data requirements are organized into a tier-testing system with specified additional studies at higher tiers being required if warranted by adverse effects observed in lower tier studies. The lower tier studies are a subset of those required for conventional pesticides, and the studies overall are generally selected from those required for conventional pesticides.
(f) Two sets of guideline numbers are provided for some of the environmental fate data requirements. For ease of understanding, the current guidelines will be used as an interim measure until the new guidelines (in parentheses) are finalized.
§ 158.2030
Biochemical pesticides product chemistry data requirements table.
(a)
General.
(1) Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use this table to determine the product chemistry data requirements for a particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test and include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of the section.
(2) Definitions in § 158.300 apply to data requirements in this section.
(b)
Use patterns.
Product chemistry data are required for all pesticide products and are not use specific.
(c)
Key.
R = Required; CR = Conditionally required; NR = Not required; MP = Manufacturing-use product; EP = End-use product; TEP = Typical end-use product; TGAI = Technical grade of the active ingredient; Residue of concern = the active ingredient and its metabolites, degradates, and impurities of toxicological concern; All = All of the above.
(d)
Table.
The following table shows the data requirements for biochemical pesticides product chemistry. The test notes are shown in paragraph (e) of this section.

§ 158.2040
Biochemical pesticides residue data requirements table.
(a)
General.
Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use this table to determine the biochemical pesticides residue data requirements for a particular pesticide product and the substance that needs to be tested. These data requirements apply to all biochemical pesticides,
i.e.
, naturally occurring insect repellents and attractants, semiochemicals (e.g., insect pheromones), natural and plant growth regulators. Notes that apply to an individual test and include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Use patterns.
(1) Data are required or conditionally required for all pesticides used in or on food and for residential outdoor uses where food crops are grown. Food use patterns include products classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop use, terrestrial feed crop use, aquatic food crop use, greenhouse food crop use, and indoor food use. Data are also conditionally required for aquatic
nonfood use if there is direct application to water that could subsequently result in exposure to food.
(2) Data are conditionally required for nonfood uses if pesticide residues may occur in food or feed as a result of the use. Data requirements for these nonfood uses would be determined on a case-by-case basis. For example, most products used in or near kitchens require residue data for risk assessment purposes even though tolerances may not be necessary in all cases.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for biochemical pesticides product chemistry and are in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
1. Residue chemistry data requirements apply to biochemical pesticide products when Tier II or Tier III toxicology data are required, as specified for biochemical agents in the biochemical human health assessment data requirements, § 158.2050.
2. The same chemical identity data are required for biochemical product chemistry data requirements, § 158.2030, with an emphasis on impurities.
3. Required information includes crops to be treated, rate of application, number and timing of applications, preharvest intervals, and relevant restrictions.
4. Required for residential outdoor uses on food crops if the corresponding agricultural use is not approved or the residential use is expected to produce higher residues based on the label directions.
5. Required unless it is an arthropod pheromone applied at a rate less than or equal to 150 grams active ingredient per acre.
6. Required for indoor uses where the pesticide is applied directly to food, in order to determine metabolites and/or degradates. Not required when only indirect contact with food would occur (e.g., crack and crevice treatments).
7. Required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to livestock, to livestock premises, to livestock drinking water, or to crops used for livestock feed.
8. If results from the plant metabolism study show differing metabolites in plants from those found in animals, an additional livestock metabolism study involving dosing with the plant metabolite(s) may also be required.
9. A residue analytical method suitable for enforcement of tolerances is required whenever a numeric tolerance (including temporary and time-limited tolerances) is proposed.
10. Required if indoor use could result in pesticide residues in or on food or feed.
11. Data are required to determine whether FDA/USDA multiresidue methodology would detect and identify the pesticides and any metabolites.
12. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be applied directly to water, unless it can be demonstrated that the treated water would not be available for human or livestock consumption.
13. Data on fish are required for all pesticides applied directly to water inhabited, or which will be inhabited by fish that may be caught or harvested for human consumption.
14. Data are required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to water that could be used for irrigation or to irrigation facilities such as irrigation ditches.
15. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be used in food/feed handling establishments.
16. Data on the nature and level of residue in processed food/feed are required when detectible residues could potentially concentrate on processing thus requiring the establishment of a separate tolerance higher than that of the raw agricultural commodity.
17. Required when residues at the tolerance level may result in risk of concern. These data may include washing, cooking, processing, or degradation studies as well as market basket surveys for a more precise residue determination.
18. The proposed tolerance must reflect the maximum residue likely to occur in crops, in meat, milk, poultry, or eggs.
19. Required when a residue analytical method is required.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for biochemical pesticides human health assessment as referenced in the last column of the table in paragraph (d) of this section.
1. Required unless the test material is a gas or highly volatile (vapor pressure
10
−4
torr (mm/Hg)).
2. Required unless the test material is corrosive to skin or has pH
2 or
11.5.
3. Required when the pesticide, under conditions of use, would result in respirable material (e.g., gas, volatile substance or aerosol/particulate), unless it is a straight chain lepidopteran pheromone.
4. Required if repeated contact with human skin is likely to occur under conditions of use.
5. Hypersensitivity incidents must be reported as adverse effects data.
6. Required for non-food uses that are likely to result in repeated oral exposure to humans.
7. Required to support uses involving purposeful application to the human skin or which would result in comparable prolonged human exposure to the product (e.g., insect repellents) and if any of the following criteria are met:
i. Data from a 90-day oral study are not required.
ii. The active ingredient is known or expected to be metabolized differently by the dermal route of exposure than by the oral route and the metabolite is of toxicological concern.
iii. The use pattern is such that the dermal route would be the primary route of exposure.
8. Required if there is a likelihood of significant levels of repeated inhalation exposure to the pesticide as a gas, vapor, or aerosol.
9. Required if the use of the product under widespread and commonly recognized practice may reasonably be expected to result in significant exposure to female humans (e.g., occupational exposure or repeated application of insect repellents directly to the skin). Tier II data is required on a different test species from Tier I data when developmental effects are observed in the first study and information on species-to-species extrapolation is needed.
10. Required to support nonfood uses if either:
i. The use is likely to result in significant human exposure; or
ii. The active ingredient (or its metabolites) is structurally related to a known mutagen or belongs to any chemical class of compounds containing a known mutagen. Additional mutagenicity tests that may have been performed plus a complete reference list must also be submitted. Subsequent testing may be required based on the available evidence.
11. Choice of assay using either:
i. Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, thymidine kinase (tk) gene locus, maximizing assay conditions for small colony expression or detection;
ii. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79) cells, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hgprt) gene locus, accompanied by an appropriate
in vitro
test for clastogenicity; or
iii. CHO cells strains AS52, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (xprt) gene locus.
12. Required if there are effects on hematology, clinical chemistry, lymphoid organ weights, and histopathology are observed in the 90-day studies.
13. The micronucleus rodent bone marrow assay is preferred; however, rodent bone marrow assays using metaphase analysis (aberrations) are acceptable.
14. Required if adverse effects are observed in the Tier II immunotoxicity study. The protocol for evaluating adverse effects to the immune response should be developed after evaluating the effects noted in the immunotoxicity study.
15. These data are required when the data used for the human health assessment indicates that the biochemical may pose a potential hazard to the applicator/user.
16. Required if there is evidence of:
i. Endocrinological effects from the subchronic toxicity studies.
ii. Developmental effects in the prenatal developmental toxicity study(s), or
iii. Genotoxicity to mammals based on results from the mutagenicity tests.
The use of a combined study that utilizes the two-generation reproduction study in rodents (guideline 870.3800) as a basic protocol for the addition of other endpoints or functional assessments in the immature animal is encouraged.
17. Required if the potential for adverse chronic effects is indicated based on any of the following:
i. The subchronic effect level established in the following Tier I studies: 90-day oral toxicity study, 90-day dermal toxicity study, or 90-day inhalation toxicity study.
ii. The pesticide use pattern (e.g., rate, frequency, and site of application).
iii. The frequency and level of repeated human exposure that is expected.
18. Required if the product meets either of the following criteria:
i. The active ingredient (or any of its metabolites, degradation products, or impurities) produce(s) in Tier I subchronic studies a morphologic effect (e.g., hyperplasia or metaplasia) in any organ that potentially could lead to neoplastic change.
ii. Adverse cellular effects suggesting carcinogenic potential are observed in Tier II immunotoxicity and Tier III immune response study or in Tier II mammalian mutagenicity assays.
In addition, a 90-day range finding study in both rats and mice is required to determine the dose levels if carcinogenicity studies are required. If the mouse carcinogenicity study is not required, the 90-day mouse subchronic study is likewise not required.
19. Required if results from lower tiered mutation or reproductive studies indicate there is potential for chromosomal aberration to occur.
20. May be required if the product's use will result in exposure to domestic animals through, but not limited to, direct application or consumption of treated feed.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for biochemical pesticides nontarget organisms and environmental fate as referenced in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
1. Required for the EP when any end-use formulation may contain other ingredients that may be toxic to nontarget organisms or to support arthropod pheromones that would be available to avian wildlife, (e.g., a granular product).
2. Tests for pesticides intended solely for indoor application would be required on a case-by-case basis, depending on use pattern, physical/chemical properties, production volume, and other pertinent factors.
3. Not required for any use groups if the pesticide is highly volatile (estimated volatility
5 × 10
−5
atm m
3
/mol).
4. Preferred test species are Upland game, waterfowl, or passerine for avian acute oral toxicity studies; Upland game and waterfowl for avian dietary studies; and coldwater fish species for acute freshwater fish studies.
5. Required for the EP when the end-use formulation may contain other ingredients that may be toxic to nontarget organisms.
6. Required on a case-by-case basis when results from Tier I studies indicate adverse effects.
7. Required when results of any one or more of the nontarget organism studies in Tier I indicate potential adverse effects on nontarget organisms and the pesticide is to be applied on land. In view of methdological difficulties with the study of photodegradation in air, prior consultation with the Agency regarding the protocol is recommended before the test is performed.
8. Required when results of any one or more of the nontarget organism studies in Tier I indicate potential adverse effects on nontarget organisms and the pesticide is to be applied in a passive dispenser.
9. Required to support registration of known phytotoxicants,
i.e.
, herbicides, desiccants, defoliants, and plant growth regulators.
10. Required if environmental fate characteristics indicate that the estimated environmental concentration of the pesticide in the aquatic environment is
0.01 of any EC
50
or LC
50
determined in the aquatic nontarget organism testing.
11. Required if either of the following criteria are met:
i. Environmental fate characteristics indicate that the estimated concentration of the pesticide in the terrestrial environment is
0.20 the avian dietary LC

(converted to ppm).
ii. The pesticide or any of its metabolites or degradation products are stable in the environment to the extent that potentially toxic amounts may persist in the avian or mammalian feed.
12. Required when results of Tier I nontarget organism studies indicate potential adverse effects on nontarget insects and results of Tier II tests indicate exposure of nontarget insects. Additional insect species may have to be tested if necessary to address issues raised by use patterns and potential exposure of important nontarget insect species, (e.g., threatened or endangered species).
13. Required if the product is expected to be transported from the site of application
by air, soil, or water. The extent of movement would be determined by the results of the Tier II environmental fate studies.
14. Required depending on pesticide mode of action, method and timing of application, and results of any available efficacy data. Typically the honeybee acute toxicity guideline (guideline 850.3020) satisfies this requirement, however, additional nontarget insect species may have to be tested if necessary to address issues raised by use patterns and potential exposure of important nontarget insect species, (e.g., endangered species.)
§ 158.2070
Biochemical pesticides product performance data requirements.
(a)
General.
Product performance data must be developed for all biochemical pesticides. Each applicant must ensure through testing that the product is efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency may require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of product performance data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration or amendment.
(b)
Product performance data for each product that bears a claim against an invertebrate pest that is covered by subpart R of this part.
The product performance data requirements and performance standards of subpart R of this part apply to biochemical products covered by this subpart. Product performance data must be submitted with any application for registration or amended registration. However, data requirements and the performance standards that determine the acceptability of data may be waived or modified on a case-by-case basis pursuant to the waiver provisions in § 158.45 and modification provisions in § 158.1707.
(c)
Product performance data for each product that bears a public health pest claim, excluding those covered under paragraph (b).
Product performance data must be submitted with any application for registration or amended registration, if the product bears a claim to control public health pests, such as pest microorganisms infectious to humans in any area of the inanimate environment, or a claim to control vertebrates, including but not limited to, rodents, birds, bats, canids, and skunks.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for experimental use permit biochemical pesticides product chemistry and are referenced in the last column of the table in paragraph (d) of this section.
1. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.320.
2. If the MP and EP are produced by an integrated formulation system (non-registered source), these data are also required on TGAI.
3. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.325, § 158.330, and § 158.335.
4. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.340.
5. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.345. Also, required to support the registration of each manufacturing-use product (including registered TGAIs) and end-use products produced by an integrated formulation system. Data on other end-use products would be required on a case-by-case basis. For pesticides in the production stage, a preliminary product analytical method and data would suffice to support an experimental use permit.
6. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.350.
7. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.355.
8. If the TGAI cannot be isolated, data are required on the practical equivalent of the TGAI. EP testing may also be appropriate.
9. Required if the product contains combustible liquids.
10. Required if the product is an emulsifiable liquid and is to be diluted with petroleum solvents.
11. Required if the test substance is soluble or dispersible in water.
12. Required if the product is a liquid.
13. Required when the technical chemical is a solid at room temperature.
14. Required when the technical chemical is a liquid at room temperature.
15. Required for water insoluble test substances (
10
−6
g/l) and fibrous test substances with diameter ≥0.1 µm.
16. Required for organic chemicals unless they dissociate in water or are partially or completely soluble in water.
17. Data on the stability to metals and metal ions is required only if the active ingredient is expected to come in contact with either material during storage.
18. True density or specific density are required for all test substances. Data on bulk density is required for MPs or EPs that are solid at room temperature.
19. Not required for salts.
§ 158.2082
Experimental use permit biochemical pesticides residue data requirements table.
(a)
General.
Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use this table to determine the biochemical pesticides residue data requirements for a particular pesticide product and the substance that needs to be tested. These data requirements apply to all biochemical pesticides,
i.e.
, naturally occurring insect repellents and attractants, semiochemicals (e.g., insect pheromones), natural and plant growth regulators. Notes that apply to an individual test and include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Use patterns.
(1) Data are required or conditionally required for all pesticides used in or on food and for residential outdoor uses where food crops are grown. Food use patterns include products classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop use, terrestrial feed crop use, aquatic food crop use, greenhouse food crop use, and indoor food use. Data are also conditionally required for aquatic nonfood use if there is direct application to water that could subsequently result in exposure to food.
(2) Data are conditionally required for nonfood uses if pesticide residues may occur in food or feed as a result of the use. Data requirements for these nonfood uses would be determined on a case-by-case basis. For example, most products used in or near kitchens require residue data for risk assessment purposes even though tolerances may not be necessary in all cases.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for biochemical pesticides product chemistry and are referenced referenced in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
1. Residue chemistry data requirements apply to biochemical pesticide products when Tier II or Tier III toxicology data are required, as specified for biochemical agents in the biochemical human health assessment data requirements, § 158.2050.
2. The same chemical identity data are required for biochemical product chemistry data requirements,§ 158.2030 with an emphasis on impurities.
3. Required information includes crops to be treated, rate of application, number and timing of applications, preharvest intervals, and relevant restrictions.
4. Required for residential outdoor uses on food crops if the corresponding agricultural use is not approved or the residential use is expected to produce higher residues based on the label directions.
5. Required unless it is an arthropod pheromone applied at a rate less than or equal to 150 grams active ingredient per acre.
6. Required for indoor uses where the pesticide is applied directly to food, in order to determine metabolites and/or degradates. Not required when only indirect contact with food would occur (e.g., crack and crevice treatments).
7. Required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to livestock, to livestock premises, to livestock drinking water, or to crops used for livestock feed. If results from
the plant metabolism study show differing metabolites in plants form those found in animals, an additional livestock metabolism study involving dosing with the plant metabolite(s) may also be required.
8. Livestock feeding studies are required whenever a pesticide residue is present in livestock feed or when direct application to livestock uses occurs.
9. Required if indoor use could result in pesticide residues in or on food or feed.
10. Data are required to determine whether FDA/USDA multiresidue methodology would detect and identify the pesticides and any metabolites.
11. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be applied directly to water, unless it can be demonstrated that the treated water would not be available for human or livestock consumption.
12. Data on fish are required for all pesticides applied directly to water inhabited, or which will be inhabited, by fish that may be caught or harvested for human consumption.
13. Data are required when a pesticide is to be applied directly to water that could be used for irrigation or to irrigation facilities such as irrigation ditches.
14. Data are required whenever a pesticide may be used in food/feed handling establishments.
15. Data on the nature and level of residue in processed food/feed are required when detectible residues could potentially concentrate on processing thus requiring the establishment of a separate tolerance higher than that of the raw agricultural commodity.
16 Anticipated residue data are required when the assumption of tolerance level residues would result in predicted exposure at an unsafe level of exposure. Data, using single serving samples of a raw agricultural commodity, on the level or residue in food as consumed would be used to obtain a more precise estimate of potential dietary exposure. These data may also include washing, cooking, processing or degradation studies as well as market basket surveys for a more precise residue determination.
17. The proposed tolerance must reflect the maximum residue likely to occur in crops, in meat, milk, poultry, or eggs.
18. Required when a residue analytical method is required.

# Subpart V—Microbial Pesticides

# Source:
72 FR 61002, Oct. 26, 2007, unless otherwise noted.
§ 158.2100
Microbial pesticides definition and applicability.
(a) This subpart applies to all living or dead microbial pesticides as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b)
Definition.
Microbial pesticide
is a microbial agent intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest, or intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, that:
(1) Is a eucaryotic microorganism including, but not limited to, protozoa, algae, and fungi;
(2) Is a procaryotic microorganism, including, but not limited to, Eubacteria and Archaebacteria; or
(3) Is a parasitically replicating microscopic element, including, but not limited to, viruses.
(c)
Applicability.
(1) This subpart applies to microbial pesticides as specified in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section.
(2) Each new isolate of a microbial pesticide is a new active ingredient and must be registered independently of any similarly designated and already registered microbial pesticide active ingredient. Each new isolate for which registration is sought must have a unique identifier following the taxonomic name of the microorganism, and the registration application must be supported by data required in this subpart. This does not preclude the possibility of using data from another isolate, provided sufficient similarity is established, to support registration.
(3) Genetically modified microbial pesticides may be subject to additional data or information requirements on a case-by-case basis depending on the particular microbial agent and/or its parental strains, the proposed pesticide use pattern, and the manner and extent to which the organism has been genetically modified.
(4) Pest control organisms such as insect predators, nematodes, and macroscopic parasites are exempt from the requirements of FIFRA as authorized by section 25(b) of FIFRA and specified in § 152.20 (a) of this chapter.
[72 FR 61002, Oct. 26, 2007, as amended at 77 FR 52612, Aug. 30, 2012]
§ 158.2110
Microbial pesticides data requirements.
(a)
For all microbial pesticides.
(1) The following § 158.2120 through § 158.2150 identify the data requirements that are required to support registration of microbial pesticides. The variations in the test conditions are identified within the test notes.
(2) Each data table includes “use patterns” under which the individual data are required, with variations including all use patterns, food and nonfood uses for terrestrial and aquatic applications, greenhouse, indoor, forestry, and residential outdoor applications under certain circumstances.
(3) The categories for each data requirement are “R,” which stands for required, and “CR” which stands for conditionally required. If a bracket appears around the “R” or “CR,” the data are required for both the registration and experimental use permit requests. Generally, “R” indicates that the data are more likely required than for those data requirements with “CR.” However, in each case, the regulatory text preceding the data table and the test notes following the data table must be used to determine whether the data requirement must be satisfied.
(4) Each table identifies the test substance that is required to be tested to satisfy the data requirement. Test substances may include: technical grade active ingredient (TGAI), manufacturing-use product (MP), end-use product (EP), typical end-use product (TEP), residue of concern, and pure active ingredient (PAI) or all of the above (All). Commas between the test substances (
i.e.
, TGAI, EP) indicate that data may be required on the TGAI or EP or both depending on the conditions set forth in the test note. Data requirements which list two test substances (
i.e.
, TGAI and EP) indicate that both are required to be tested. Data requirements that list only MP as the test substance apply to products containing solely the technical grade of the active ingredient and manufacturing-use products to which other ingredients have been intentionally added. Data requirements listing the EP as the test substance apply to any EP with an ingredient in the end-use formulation other than the active ingredient that is expected to enhance the toxicity of the product.
(b)
Additional data requirements for genetically modified microbial pesticides.
Additional requirements for genetically modified microbial pesticides may include but are not limited to: genetic engineering techniques used; the identity of the inserted or deleted gene segment (base sequence data or enzyme restriction map of the gene); information on the control region of the gene in question; a description of the “new” traits or characteristics that are intended to be expressed; tests to evaluate genetic stability and exchange; and selected Tier II environmental expression and toxicology tests.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for microbial pesticides product analysis as referenced in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (c) of this section.
1. Required for each isolate of a microbial pesticide. Isolates must be deposited with an agreement to ensure that the sample will be maintained and will not be discarded for the duration of the associated registration(s).
2. Required to support registration of each manufacturing-use product and end-use product. This analysis must be conducted at the point in the production process after which there would be no potential for microbial contamination or microbial regrowth. For full registration, generally an analysis of samples is a compilation of batches, over a period of time, depending on the frequency of manufacturing.
3. Only required for emulsifiable liquid forms of microbial pesticides.
4. Required when microbial pesticides are packaged in metal, plastic, or paper containers.
5. Only required for liquid forms of microbial pesticides.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for microbial pesticides toxicology as referenced in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (c) of this section:
1. The acute oral toxicity/pathogenicity study is required to support the TGAI. However, it can be combined with the unit dose portion of the acute oral toxicity study, with an EP or MP test material to fulfill the requirement for the TGAI and the MP or EP in a single study, if the new protocol is designed to address the endpoints of concern.
2. Data not required for products whose active ingredient is a virus. For test materials whose size or consistency may prevent use of an intravenous injection, the intraperitoneal injection procedure may be employed.
3. Hypersensitivity incidents, including immediate type and delayed-type reactions of humans or domestic animals, occur during the testing or production of the TGAI, MP, or EP, or are otherwise known to the applicant must be reported if they occur.
4. Data must be submitted only for products whose active ingredient is a virus.
5. The 870 series studies for the MP and EP are intended to provide data on the acute toxicity of the product. Waivers for any or all of these studies may be granted when the applicant can demonstrate that the combination of inert ingredients is not likely to pose any significant human health risks. Where appropriate, the limit dose approach to testing is recommended.
6. Required when the product consists of, or under conditions of use would result in, an inhalable material (e.g., gas, volatile substances, or aerosol particulate).
7. Data required when significant toxicity, in the absence of pathogenicity and significant infectivity, is observed in acute oral, injection, or pulmonary studies (Tier I). Route(s) of exposure correspond to route(s) where toxicity was observed in Tier I studies. The toxic component of the TGAI is to be tested.
8. Data required when significant infectivity and/or unusual persistence is observed in the absence of pathogenicity or toxicity in Tier I studies. Routes of exposure (oral and/or pulmonary) correspond to routes in Tier I studies where adverse effects were noted. Data may also be required to evaluate adverse effects due to microbial contaminants or to toxic byproducts.
9. Data are required when one or more of the following criteria are met:
i. Significant infectivity of the microbial pest control agent (MPCA) was observed in test animals in the Tier II subchronic study and in which no significant signs of toxicity or pathogenicity were observed.
ii. The microbial pesticide is a virus which can persist or replicate in mammalian cell culture lines.
iii. The microbial pesticide is not amenable to thorough taxonomic classification, and is related to organisms known to be parasitic for mammalian cells.
iv. The microbial pesticide preparation is not well purified, and may contain contaminants which are parasitic for mammals.
10. Data may be required for products known to contain or suspected to contain carcinogenic viruses or for microbial components that are identified as having significant toxicity in Tier II testing.
11. Data may be required for products known to contain or suspected to contain viruses that can interact in an adverse manner with components of the mammalian immune system.
12. An analysis of human infectivity/pathogenicity potential using scientific literature, genomic analysis, and/or actual specific cell culture/animal data may be required for products known to contain or suspected of containing intracellular parasites of mammalian cells for products that exhibit pathogenic characteristics in Tier I and/or Tier II, for products which are closely related to known human pathogens based on the product analysis data, or for known human pathogens that have been “disarmed” or rendered non-pathogenic for humans.
13. Test standards may have to be modified depending on the characteristics of the microorganism. Requirements may vary for these studies depending on the active ingredient being tested. Consultation with the Agency is advised before performing these Tier III studies.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for microbial pesticides nontarget organism and environmental fate as referenced in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
1. Tests for pesticides intended solely for indoor application would be required on a
case-by-case basis, depending on use pattern, production volume, and other pertinent factors.
2. The preferred species for the avian oral study is either the upland game or waterfowl. The preferred species for the avian inhalation toxicity/pathogenicity study and the avian chronic toxicity/pathogenicity study is the upland game. There is also the option to test the passerine if there is a concern. The coldwater fish is preferred for freshwater fish testing. However, two species (coldwater and warmwater fish species are the preferred species) must be tested for uses involving direct freshwater exposure. Freshwater invertebrate testing is also required.
3. Data required when the nature of the microbial pesticide and/or its toxins indicates potential pathogenicity to birds.
4. Required on a case-by-case basis if results of tests required by § 158.2140 are inadequate or inappropriate for assessment of hazards to wild mammals.
5. Required when there will be significant exposure to aquatic organisms (fish and invertebrates).
6. Required if the product is intended for direct application into the estuarine or marine environment or expected to enter this environment in significant concentrations because of expected use or mobility pattern.
7. Required if the microbial pesticide is taxonomically related to a known plant pathogen.
8. Data are not required unless an active microbial ingredient controls the target insect pest by a mechanism of infectivity;
i.e.
, may create an epizootic condition in nontarget insects.
9. Required if toxic or pathogenic effects are observed in one or more of the following tests for microbial pesticides:
i. Avian acute oral or avian inhalation studies.
ii. Wild mammal studies.
iii. Nontarget plant studies (terrestrial).
iv. Honey bee studies.
v. Nontarget insect studies.
10. Required when toxic or pathogenic effects are observed in any of the following Tier I tests for microbial pest control agents:
i. Freshwater fish studies.
ii. Freshwater invertebrate studies.
iii. Nontarget plant studies (aquatic).
11. Required if product is applied on land or in fresh water or marine/estuarine environments and toxic or pathogenic effects are observed in any of the following Tier I tests for microbial pesticides:
i. Estuarine and marine animal toxicity and pathogenicity.
ii. Plant studies - estuarine or marine species.
12. An appropriate dose-response toxicity test is required when toxic effects on nontarget terrestrial wildlife or aquatic organisms (including plants) are reported in one or more Tier I tests and results of Tier II tests indicate exposure of the microbial agent to the affected nontarget terrestrial wildlife or aquatic organisms. The protocols for these tests may have to be modified in accordance with results from the nontarget organism and environmental expression studies.
13. Required when one or more of the following are present:
i. Pathogenic effects are observed in Tier I avian studies.
ii. Tier II environmental expression testing indicate that long-term exposure of terrestrial animals is likely.
14. Required when product is intended for use in water or expected to be transported to water from the intended use site, and when pathogenicity or infectivity was observed in Tier I aquatic studies.
15. Required if, after an analysis of the microbial pesticide's ability to survive and multiply in the environment and what ecological habitat it would occupy, the intended use patterns, and the results of previous nontarget organisms and environmental expression tests, it is determined that use of the microbial agent may result in adverse effects on the nontarget organisms in aquatic environments. Testing is to determine if applications of the microbial pest control would be expected to disrupt the balance of populations in the target ecosystem.
16. Tier IV studies may be conducted as a condition of registration as post-registration monitoring if the potential for unreasonable adverse effects appears to be minimal during that period of use due to implementation of mitigation measures.
17. Required when both of the following conditions occur:
i. Pathogenic effects observed at actual or expected field residue exposure levels are reported in Tier III; and
ii. The Agency determines that quarantine methods would not prevent the microbial pesticide from contaminating areas adjacent to the test area.
18. Short term simulated or actual field studies are required when it is determined that the product is likely to cause adverse short-term or acute effects, based on consideration of available laboratory data, use patterns, and exposure rates.
19. Data from a long-term simulated field test (e.g., where reproduction and growth of confined populations are observed) and/or an actual field test (e.g., where reproduction and growth of natural populations are observed) are required if laboratory data indicate that adverse long-term, cumulative, or life-cycle effects may result from intended use.
20. Since test standards would be developed on a case-by-case basis, consultation with the Agency and development of a protocol is advised before performing these Tier IV studies.
§ 158.2160
Microbial pesticides product performance data requirements.
(a)
General.
Product performance data must be developed for all microbial pesticides. Each applicant must ensure through testing that the product is efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency may require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of product performance data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration or amendment.
(b)
Product performance data for each product that bears a claim against an invertebrate pest that is covered by subpart R of this part.
The product performance data requirements and the performance standards of subpart R of this part apply to microbial products covered by this subpart. Product performance data must be submitted with any application for registration or amended registration. However, data requirements and the performance standards that determine the acceptability of data may be modified on a case-by-case basis pursuant to the waiver provisions in § 158.45 and the provisions in § 158.1707.
(c)
Product performance data for each product that bears a public health pest claim, excluding those covered under paragraph (b).
Product performance data must be submitted with any application for registration or amended registration, if the product bears a claim to control public health pests, such as pest microorganisms infectious to humans in any area of the inanimate environment, or a claim to control vertebrates, including but not limited to, rodents, birds, bats, canids, and skunks.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for experimental use permit microbial pesticides product analysis as referenced in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (c) of this section.
1. If an experimental use permit is being sought, and if the pesticide is not already under full-scale production, a schematic diagram and/or description of the manufacturing process suffices.
2. If an experimental use permit is being sought, and if the product is not already under full-scale production, a discussion of unintentional ingredients is required to be submitted to the extent this information is available.
3. Required for each isolate of a microbial pesticide. Isolates must be deposited with an agreement to ensure that the sample will be maintained and will not be discarded for the duration of the associated experimental use permit(s).
4. Required to support registration of each manufacturing-use product and end-use product. This analysis must be conducted at the point in the production process after which there would be no potential for microbial contamination or microbial regrowth. For pesticides in the production stage, a preliminary product analytical method and data would suffice to support an experimental use permit. For full registration, generally an analysis of samples is a compilation of batches, over a period of time, depending on the frequency of manufacturing.
5. Only required for emulsifiable liquid forms of microbial pesticides.
6. Required when microbial pesticides are packaged in metal, plastic, or paper containers.
7. Only required for liquid forms of microbial pesticides.

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for experimental use permit microbial pesticides toxicology as referenced in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (c) of this section:
1. The acute oral toxicity/pathogenicity study is required to support the TGAI. However, it can be combined with the unit dose portion of the acute oral toxicity study, with an EP or MP test material to fulfill the requirement for the TGAI and the MP or EP in a single study, if the new protocol is designed to address the endpoints of concern.
2. Data not required for products whose active ingredient is a virus. For test materials whose size or consistency may prevent use of an intravenous injection, the intraperitoneal injection procedure may be employed.
3. Hypersensitivity incidents, including immediate type and delayed type reactions of humans or domestic animals occur during the testing or production of the TGAI, MP, or EP, or are otherwise known to the applicant must be reported if they occur.
4. Data must be submitted only for products whose active ingredient is a virus.
5. The 870 series studies for the MP and EP are intended to provide data on the acute toxicity of the product. Waivers for any or all of these studies may be granted when the applicant can demonstrate that the combination of inert ingredients is not likely to pose any significant human health risks. Where appropriate, the limit dose approach to testing is recommended.
6. Required when the product consists of, or under conditions of use that would result in an inhalable material (e.g., gas, volatile substances, or aerosol particulate).

Test notes.
The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for microbial pesticides nontarget organism and environmental fate as referenced in the last column of the table contained in paragraph (d) of this section.
1. Tests for pesticides intended solely for indoor application would be required on a case-by-case basis, depending on use pattern, production volume, and other pertinent factors. Tests to support EUP's are based on the application timing and acreage.
2. The preferred species for the avian oral study is either the upland game or waterfowl. The preferred species for the avian inhalation toxicity/pathogenicity study and the avian chronic toxicity/pathogenicity study is the upland game. There is also the option to test a passerine species if there is a concern. The coldwater fish is preferred for freshwater fish testing. However, two species (coldwater and warmwater fish are the preferred species) must be tested for uses involving direct freshwater exposure. Freshwater invertebrates are preferred for invertebrate testing.
3. Required when there will be significant exposure to aquatic organisms (fish and invertebrates).
4. Required if the microbial pesticide is taxonomically related to a known plant pathogen.
5. Data are not required unless an active microbial ingredient controls the target insect pest by a mechanism of infectivity;
i.e.
, may create an epizootic condition in nontarget insects.

# Subpart W—Antimicrobial Pesticide Data Requirements

# Source:
78 FR 26978, May 8, 2013, unless otherwise noted.
§ 158.2200
Applicability.
Part 158, subpart W establishes data requirements for any pesticide product that is:
(a) A pesticide that is intended for use as an “antimicrobial pesticide” within the meaning of FIFRA sec. 2(mm)(1)(A), regardless of whether it also meets the criterion of FIFRA sec. 2(mm)(1)(B). That criterion excludes from the definition any antimicrobial product that is intended for a food-use requiring a tolerance or exemption under FFDCA sec. 408 or a food additive regulation or clearance under FFDCA sec. 409. EPA will apply this subpart to all products intended for an antimicrobial use, purpose or function; the exclusion in FIFRA sec. 2(mm)(1)(B) does not exclude products from the data requirements of this subpart.
(b) A product that bears both antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial uses or claims is subject to the data requirements for pesticides in subparts C through O, R, and U or V of this part with respect to its non-antimicrobial uses and claims, and to the requirements of this subpart with respect to its antimicrobial uses and claims.
(c) A wood preservative, including a product that is intended to prevent wood degradation problems due to fungal rot or decay, sapstain, or molds.
(d) An antifoulant, including a product that is intended to kill or repel organisms that can attach to underwater surfaces, such as boat bottoms.
[78 FR 26978, May 8, 2013, as amended at 87 FR 22484, Apr. 15, 2022]
§ 158.2201

The Pesticide Use Site Index for Antimicrobial Pesticides is a comprehensive list of specific antimicrobial use sites. The Index associates antimicrobial use sites with one or more of the 12 antimicrobial use patterns. It is to be used in conjunction with the data tables in this subpart to determine the applicability of data requirements to specific uses. The Antimicrobial Pesticide Use Site Index, which will be updated periodically, is available from the Agency or may be obtained from the Agency's Web site at
http://www.epa.gov/pesticides.
§ 158.2203
Definitions.
The following terms are defined for the purposes of this subpart:
Disinfectant
means a substance, or mixture of substances, that destroys or irreversibly inactivates bacteria, fungi and viruses, but not necessarily bacterial spores, in the inanimate environment.
Fungicide
means a substance, or mixture of substances, that destroys fungi (including yeasts) and fungal spores pathogenic to man or other animals in the inanimate environment.
Microbiological water purifier
means any unit, water treatment product or system that removes, kills or inactivates all types of disease-causing microorganisms from the water, including bacteria, viruses and protozoan cysts, so as to render the treated water safe for drinking.
Sanitizer
means a substance, or mixture of substances, that reduces the bacteria population in the inanimate environment by significant numbers, but does not destroy or eliminate all bacteria. Sanitizers meeting Public Health Ordinances are generally used on food contact surfaces and are termed sanitizing rinses.
Sterilant
means a substance, or mixture of substances, that destroys or eliminates all forms of microbial life in the inanimate environment, including all forms of vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, fungal spores, and viruses.
Tuberculocide
means a substance, or mixture of substances, that destroys or irreversibly inactivates tubercle bacilli in the inanimate environment.
Virucide
means a substance, or mixture of substances, that destroys or irreversibly inactivates viruses in the inanimate environment.
§ 158.2204
Public health and nonpublic health claims.
(a)
Public health claim.
An antimicrobial pesticide is considered to make a public health claim if the pesticide product bears a claim to control pest microorganisms that pose a threat to human health, and whose presence cannot readily be observed by the user, including but not limited to, microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the inanimate environment. A product makes a public health claim if one or more of the following apply:
(1) A claim is made for control of specific microorganisms that are directly or indirectly infectious or pathogenic to man (or both man and animals). Examples of specific microorganisms include, but are not limited to:
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Escherichia coli (E. coli), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
Claims for control of microorganisms infectious or pathogenic only to animals (such as canine distemper virus or hog cholera virus) are not considered public health claims.
(2) A claim is made for the pesticide product as a sterilant, disinfectant, virucide, sanitizer, or tuberculocide against microorganisms that are infectious or pathogenic to man.
(3) A claim is made for the pesticide product as a fungicide against fungi infectious or pathogenic to man, or the product does not clearly state that it is intended for use only against nonpublic health fungi.
(4) A claim is made for the pesticide product as a microbiological water purifier or microbial purification system.
(5) A non-specific claim is made that the pesticide product will beneficially impact or affect public health at the site of use or in the environment in which it is applied, and:
(i) The pesticide product contains one or more ingredients that, under the criteria in 40 CFR 153.125(a), is an active ingredient with respect to a public health microorganism and there is no other functional purpose for the ingredient in the product; or
(ii) The pesticide product is similar in composition to a registered pesticide product that makes antimicrobial public health claims.
(b)
Nonpublic health claim.
An antimicrobial pesticide is considered to make a nonpublic health claim if the pesticide product bears a claim to control microorganisms of economic or aesthetic significance, where the presence of the microorganism would not normally lead to infection or disease in humans. Examples of nonpublic health claims include, but are not limited to: Algaecides, slimicides, preservatives and products for which a pesticidal claim with respect to odor sources is made.
§ 158.2210
Product chemistry.
The product chemistry data requirements of subpart D of this part apply to antimicrobial products covered by this subpart.
§ 158.2220
Product performance.
(a)
General
—(1)
Product performance requirement for all antimicrobial pesticides.
Each applicant must ensure through testing that his product is efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency may require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of product performance data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration or amendment.
(2)
Product performance data for each product that bears a public health claim.
Each product that bears a public health claim, as described in § 158.2204(a), must be supported by product performance data, as listed in the table in paragraph (c) of this section. Product performance data must be submitted with any application for registration or amended registration.
(3)
Product performance data for each product that bears a nonpublic health claim.
Each product that bears a nonpublic health claim, as described in § 158.2204(b), must be supported by product performance data. Each registrant must ensure through testing that his product is efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly accepted practices. The Agency reserves the right to require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of product performance data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration or amendment.
(4)
Determination of data requirements.
Subpart B of this part and § 158.2201 describe how to use the table in paragraph (c) of this section to determine the product performance data requirements for antimicrobial pesticide products.

Toxicology.
(a)
General.
Subpart B of this part and § 158.2201 describe how to use the table in paragraph (g) of this section to determine the toxicology data requirements for an antimicrobial pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test, including specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions are listed in paragraph (h) of this section.
(b)
Uses.
The applicant for registration must first determine whether the use is likely to result in pesticide residues in food or water and therefore consult the “Food Use” columns of the table in paragraph (g) of this section. Generally, if the residues of the antimicrobial result from an application to a surface or if incorporated into a material that may come into contact with food or feed, and residues may be expected to transfer to such food or feed, then the “Indirect Food Uses” columns is to be consulted.
(c)
Tiering of data requirements.
Applicants for registration of antimicrobials may perform tests in a tiered fashion. After the initially required tests are conducted, additional testing may be required if results of the initial tests trigger the need for additional data. Conditions that trigger the need for additional data are given in the test notes in paragraph (h) of this section.
(d)
200 parts per billion (ppb).
The 200 ppb level was originally used by the Food and Drug Administration with respect to the concentration of residues in or on food for tiering of data requirements for indirect food use biocides. The Agency has also adopted this same residue level for determining toxicology data requirements for indirect food uses of antimicrobial pesticides. The 200 ppb level is the concentration of antimicrobial residues in the total estimated daily dietary intake.
(e)
Use of OSHA standards.
If EPA determines that industrial standards, such as the workplace standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA standards), provide adequate protection for a particular pesticide or a particular use pattern, additional toxicity data may not be required for that pesticide or the use pattern.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table to paragraph (g) of this section:
1. Not required if test material is a gas or highly volatile liquid.
2. The six end-use product (EP) acute toxicity studies are required using the product as formulated for sale and distribution. In addition, if the EP label has directions for diluting the product, then, the applicant may also need to conduct certain of the acute toxicity studies using the highest concentration labeled for dilution (
i.e.
, the least diluted product). The end-use dilution testing is in addition to the testing conducted on the EP.
3. Not required if test material is corrosive to skin or has pH less than 2 or greater than 11.5.
4. Data are required when the product consists of, or under conditions of use will result in, a respirable material (e.g., gas, vapor, aerosol or particulates).
5. Data are required if repeated dermal exposure is likely to occur under conditions of use.
6. For indirect food uses ≤200 ppb, and all other nonfood uses, data are required if the neurotoxicity screen in the 90-day oral rodent study or other data indicate neurotoxicity.
7. The 90-day dermal toxicity study and/or 90-day inhalation toxicity study are required if the Agency determines that dermal and/or inhalation exposure is the primary route of exposure.
8. All 90-day subchronic studies in the rodent can be designed to simultaneously fulfill the requirements of the 90-day neurotoxicity and/or immunotoxicity studies by adding separate groups of animals for testing of neurotoxicity and/or immunotoxicity parameters.
9. The 90-day study is required in the rodent for hazard characterization (possibly endpoint selection) and dose-setting for the chronic/carcinogenicity study. It is not required in the mouse, but the Agency would encourage the applicant to conduct a 90-day range finding study for the purposes of dose selection for the mouse carcinogenicity study to achieve adequate dosing and an acceptable study.
10. A 1-year non-rodent study (
i.e.
, 1-year dog study) may be required if the Agency finds that a pesticide chemical is highly bioaccumulative and slowly eliminated. EPA may also require the appropriate metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies to evaluate more precisely bioavailability, half life, and steady state to determine if a longer duration dog toxicity study is needed.
11. Although the subchronic toxicity testing guidelines include measurement of neurological endpoints, such screens do not meet the requirement of the 90-day neurotoxicity study. For nonfood uses, if the 90-day study does not include a neurotoxicity screen, then the acute neurotoxicity study will be required.
12. Data are required if all of the following criteria are met:
i. The intended use of the antimicrobial pesticide product is expected to result in repeated dermal human exposure to the product.
ii. Data from a 90-day dermal toxicity study are not available.
iii. The 90-day dermal toxicity study has not been triggered.
13. EP testing is required if the product or any component of the product may increase dermal absorption of the active ingredient(s) or increases its toxic or pharmacologic effects, as determined by testing using the TGAI or based on available information about the toxic effects of the product or its components.
14. Data are required if the active ingredient in the product is known or expected to be metabolized differently by the dermal route of exposure than by the oral route, and a metabolite of the active ingredient is the toxic moiety.
15. A 90-day oral toxicity test is not required for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration systems (collectively referred to as HVAC
R). Instead, two 90-day toxicity tests, one by the dermal route and one by the inhalation route are required.
16. Data are required if there is the likelihood of significant repeated inhalation exposure to the pesticide as a gas, vapor, or aerosol.
17. Based on estimates of the magnitude and duration of human exposure, studies of shorter duration, e.g.,
21- or 28-days, may be sufficient to satisfy this requirement. The prime consideration in determining the appropriateness of a shorter duration study is the likely period of time for which humans will be exposed.
18. Based on the positive results of the acute or 90-day neurotoxicity studies, or on other data indicating neurotoxicity, a chronic neurotoxicity study (
i.e.
, a chronic study with additional neurotoxicity evaluations) may be required to provide information about potential neurotoxic effects from long-term exposures.
19. Studies which are designed to simultaneously fulfill the requirements of both the chronic oral and carcinogenicity studies (
i.e.
, a combined study) may be conducted.
20. For indirect food uses ≤200 ppb, and all other nonfood uses, data are required if either of the following criteria are met:
i. The use of the pesticide is likely to result in repeated human exposure over a considerable portion of the human lifespan; or
ii. The use requires that a tolerance, tolerance exemption, or food additive regulation or clearance be established.
21. For indirect food uses ≤200 ppb, and all other nonfood uses, data are required if any of the following criteria, are met:
i. The use of the pesticide is likely to result in significant human exposure over a considerable portion of the human life span which is significant in terms of frequency, time, duration, and/or magnitude of exposure.
ii. The use requires that a tolerance, tolerance exemption, or food additive regulation or clearance be established.
iii. The active ingredient, metabolite, degradate, or impurity:
A. Is structurally related to a recognized carcinogen;
B. Causes mutagenic effects as demonstrated by
in vitro
or
in vivo
testing; or
C. Produces a morphologic effect in any organ (e.g., hyperplasia, metaplasia) in subchronic studies that may lead to a neoplastic change.
22. If the requirement for a carcinogenicity study in any species is modified or waived for any reason, then a subchronic 90-day oral study in the same species may be required.
23. Testing in two species is required for all uses.
24. The oral route, by oral intubation, is preferred, unless the chemical or physical properties of the test substance, or the pattern of human exposure, suggest a more appropriate route of exposure.
25. Additional testing by other routes of exposure may be required if the pesticide is determined to be a prenatal developmental toxicant after oral dosing.
26. The developmental toxicity study in rodents may be combined with the two-generation reproduction study in rodents by using a second mating of the parental animals in either generation. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.
27. A two-generation reproduction study is required.
28. An information-based approach to testing is preferred, which utilizes the best available knowledge on the chemical (hazard, pharmacokinetic, or mechanistic data) to determine whether a standard guideline study, an enhanced guideline study, or an alternative study should be conducted to assess potential hazard to the developing animal. Applicants must submit any alternative proposed testing protocols and supporting scientific rationale to the Agency. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.
29. The use of a combined two-generation reproduction/developmental neurotoxicity study that utilizes the two-generation reproduction study in rodents as a basic protocol for the addition of other endpoints or functional assessments in the immature animal is encouraged.
30. A DNT study is required using a weight-of-evidence approach when:
i. The pesticide causes treatment-related neurological effects in adult animal studies (
i.e.
, clinical signs of neurotoxicity, neuropathology, functional or behavioral effects).
ii. The pesticide causes treatment-related neurological effects in developing animals, following pre- or post-natal
exposure (
i.e.
, nervous system malformations or neuropathy, brain weight changes in offspring, functional or behavioral changes in the offspring).
iii. The pesticide elicits a causative association between exposures and adverse neurological effects in human epidemiological studies.
iv. The pesticide evokes a mechanism that is associated with adverse effects on the development of the nervous system (
i.e.
, structure-activity-relationship (SAR) to known neurotoxicants, altered neuroreceptor or neurotransmitter responses).
31. To facilitate the weight-of-evidence determination for the pesticide's mutagenicity, in addition to those specifically listed in this table, the Agency requires submission of other mutagenicity test results that may have been performed. A reference list of all studies and papers known to the applicant concerning the mutagenicity of the test chemical must be submitted with the required studies.
32. Due to the nature of antimicrobials, if testing with bacterial strains has not been conducted, then testing using a mammalian cell assay such as the mouse lymphoma TK ±assay is preferred. If reverse mutation assay testing with bacterial strains has already been conducted, and the testing was conducted at levels that did not cause toxicity to the bacterial strains tested, then the applicant may submit the study to fulfill this data requirement.
33. For the
in vitro
mammalian gene mutation study, there is a choice of assays using either mouse lymphoma L5178Y cell thymidine kinase (tk) gene locus, maximizing assay conditions for small colony expression and detection; Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (v79) cells, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hgprt) gene locus, accompanied by an appropriate
in vitro
test for clastogenicity; or CHO cells strains AS52, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (xprt) gene locus.
34. There is a choice of assays, but the micronucleus rodent bone marrow assay is preferred; the rodent bone marrow assays using metaphase analysis (aberrations) are acceptable.
35. Data are required when chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity studies are also required.
36. Data is required if the product label directs that it be applied to domestic animals, such as cats, dogs, cattle, pigs, and horses.
37. In the absence of dermal absorption data or a repeated dose dermal toxicity study, the assumption of 100 percent dermal absorption would be used in a risk assessment to determine if a dermal penetration study is required, and to identify the doses and duration of exposure for which dermal absorption is to be quantified.
38. Required for nonfood uses, if oral exposure could occur.
39. Data may be required if significant adverse effects are seen in available toxicology studies and these effects can be further elucidated by metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies.

§ 158.2260
Applicator exposure.
(a)
General.
Subpart B of this part and § 158.2201 describe how to use the table in paragraph (d) of this section to determine the applicator exposure data requirements for antimicrobial pesticide products. Notes that apply to an individual test including specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.
(1) The Agency may accept surrogate exposure data estimations and/or modeling estimations from other sources to satisfy exposure data requirements. The surrogate data must meet the basic quality assurance, quality control, good laboratory practice, and other scientific requirements set by EPA. To be acceptable, the Agency must find that the surrogate exposure data estimations have adequate information to address the applicable exposure data requirements and contain adequate monitoring events of acceptable quality. The data must reflect the specific use prescribed on the label and the activity of concern, including formulation type, application methods and rates, type of activity, and other pertinent information.
(2) Occupational uses include not only handlers, mixers, loaders, and applicators, but also commercial applications to residential sites. Residential uses are limited to non-occupational,
i.e.
, non-professional, antimicrobial applications. Both occupational and residential applicator data may be required for the same product.
(b)
Criteria for testing.
Applicator exposure data described in the table to paragraph (d) of this section are required based on toxicity and exposure criteria. Data are required if at least one of the toxicity criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and at least one of the exposure criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met.
(1)
Toxicity criteria.
(i) Evidence of potentially significant adverse effects have been observed in any applicable toxicity studies.
(ii) Scientifically sound epidemiological or poisoning incident data with a clear cause-effect relationship indicating that adverse health effects may have resulted from exposure to the pesticide.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:
1. Prior to initiation of the study, protocols involving intentional exposure of human subjects must be submitted for review by EPA and then the Human Studies Review Board (HSRB) according to 40 CFR 26.1125. Examples of proposed human study research can be found in various reviews provided by the Human Studies Review Board (
http://www.epa.gov/osa/hsrb/index.htm
).
2. Biological monitoring data may be submitted in addition to, or in lieu of, dermal and inhalation passive dosimetry exposure data, provided the human pharmacokinetics of the pesticide or metabolite/analog compounds (
i.e.,
whichever method is selected as an indicator of body burden or internal dose) allow for the back calculation to the total internal dose.
3. For products with both indoor and outdoor uses, and similar conditions of use, data are generally required for the indoor applications only. However, data for outdoor uses are required if the Agency expects outdoor uses to result in greater exposure than indoor uses (e.g., higher use rates and application frequency, or longer exposure duration, or application methods/equipment create potential for increased dermal or inhalation exposure in outdoor versus indoor use sites). In certain cases, when a pesticide may be used both indoors and outdoors under dissimilar conditions of use, the Agency may require submission of applicator exposure data for both use patterns.
4. EPA will consider waiving this data requirement for antimicrobials applied via closed loading systems if the antimicrobial has a low vapor pressure.
5. Data reporting and calculations are required only if handler exposure data are required.
§ 158.2270
Post-application exposure.
(a)
General.
Subpart B of this part and § 158.2201 describe how to use the table in paragraph (d) of this section to determine the post-application exposure data requirements for antimicrobial pesticide products. The data generated during these studies are used to determine the quantity of pesticide to which people may be exposed after application. Notes that apply to an individual test, including specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test, are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.
(1) Post-application exposure data are required when certain toxicity criteria are met and the human activities associated with the pesticide's use pattern can lead to potential adverse exposures.
(2) The Agency may accept surrogate exposure data estimations and/or modeling estimations from other sources to satisfy exposure data requirements. The surrogate data must meet the basic quality assurance, quality control, good laboratory practice, and other scientific requirements set by EPA. To be acceptable, the Agency must find that the surrogate exposure data estimations have adequate information to address the applicable exposure data requirements and contain adequate monitoring events of acceptable quality. The data must reflect the specific use prescribed on the label and the activity of concern, including formulation type, application methods and rates, type of activity, and other pertinent information.
(b)
Criteria for testing.
Post-application exposure data described in the table to paragraph (d) of this section are required based on toxicity and exposure criteria. Data are required if at least one of the toxicity criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and at least one of the exposure criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met.
(1)
Toxicity criteria.
(i) Evidence of potentially significant adverse effects have been observed in any applicable toxicity studies.
(ii) Scientifically sound epidemiological or poisoning incident data with a clear cause-effect relationship indicating that adverse health effects may have resulted from exposure to the pesticide.
(2)
Exposure criteria
—(i)
Outdoor uses.
(A) Occupational human post-application or bystander exposure to residues of antimicrobial pesticides could occur as the result of, but is not limited to, worker reentry into treatment sites, clean-up and equipment maintenance tasks, handling wood preservative-treated wood, or other work-related activity.
(B) Residential human post-application or bystander exposure to residues of antimicrobial pesticides could occur following the application of antimicrobial pesticides to outdoor areas and spaces at residential sites, such as, but not limited to homes, daycare centers, and other public buildings.
(ii)
Indoor uses.
(A) Occupational human post-application or bystander exposure to pesticide residues could occur following the application of the antimicrobial pesticide to indoor spaces or surfaces.
(B) Residential human post-application or bystander exposure to pesticide residues could occur following the application of the antimicrobial pesticide to indoor spaces or surfaces at residential sites, such as, but not limited to homes, daycare centers, hospitals, schools, and other public buildings.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:
1. Prior to initiation of the study, protocols involving intentional exposure of human subjects must be submitted for review by EPA and then the Human Studies Review Board (HSRB) according to 40 CFR 26.1125. Examples of proposed human study research can be found in various reviews provided by the Human Studies Review Board (HSRB) (
http://www.epa.gov/osa/hsrb/index.htm).
2. For residential wood preservative uses, data may be required if soil has the potential to be an important exposure pathway, and soil is in contact with or adjacent to treated wood, including but not limited to decks, play sets, and gazebos,
3. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.
4. For wood preservatives, data are required for treated wood surfaces where post-application contact with treated wood is anticipated.
5. For occupational uses, data are required if the pesticide may be applied to or around surfaces, and if the human activity data indicate that workers are likely to have post-application dermal contact with treated surfaces while participating in typical activities.
6. Data are required for residential use sites, schools, and daycare institutions. This includes but is not limited to the following: Residential and public access premises; material preservatives (including those used in residential products, including but not limited to clothing and plastic toys) and wood preservatives (when contact with treated wood is likely to occur).
7. Data are required for occupational and residential uses if the human activity data indicate the potential for post-application dermal and/or inhalation exposures while participating in typical activities and no acceptable modeling options are available.
8. Biological monitoring data may be submitted in addition to, or in lieu of, dermal and inhalation passive dosimetry exposure data provided the human pharmacokinetics of the pesticide or metabolite/analog compounds (
i.e.,
whichever method is selected as an indicator of body burden or internal dose) allow for a back-calculation to the total internal dose.
9. Data are required for occupational and residential uses if there is the potential for bystander exposure and the pesticide use could result in respirable and/or inhalable material (e.g., gas, vapor, aerosol, or particulates).
10. Data reporting and calculations are required only if post-application exposure data are required.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table in paragraph (c) of this section:
1. For testing antifoulant paints and coatings, testing is to be performed separately with both sterile buffered distilled water and sterile synthetic seawater at pHs 5, 7, and 9.
2. Not required if:
i. The electronic absorption spectra, measured at pHs 5, 7 and 9, of the chemical and its hydrolytic products, if any, show no absorption or tailing between 290 and 800 nm, inclusive; or
ii. The results of the hydrolysis study at all three pHs (5, 7, and 9) demonstrates a half-life of less than 30 days.
3. The results of the activated sludge, respiration inhibition (ASRI) test determine which of the following tests are required: Ready biodegradability, porous pot, the biodegradation in activated sludge study as described in the “Simulation Tests to Assess the Biodegradability of Chemicals Discharged in Wastewater,” or simulation test—aerobic sewage treatment: A. activated sludge units.
i. If the ASRI test EC
50
is equal to or less than 20 mg/L, then the applicant must choose either to:
A. Conduct the biodegradation in activated sludge study as described in the “Simulation Tests to Assess the Biodegradability of Chemicals Discharged in Wastewater”;
B. Conduct the porous pot test; or
C. Conduct the simulation test—aerobic sewage treatment: A. activated sludge units.
ii. If the ASRI test EC
50
is greater than 20 mg/L, then the applicant must choose either to:
A. Conduct a ready biodegradability study; or
B. Conduct one of the following studies: The biodegradation in activated sludge study as described in the “Simulation Tests to Assess the Biodegradability of Chemicals Discharged in Wastewater,” the porous pot test, or the simulation test—aerobic sewage treatment: A. activated sludge units.
4. Pass criteria for the ready biodegradability study are: 70 percent removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 60 percent removal of theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) or theoretical carbon dioxide (ThCO
2
) production for respirometric methods. These pass levels must be reached in a 10-day window within the 28-day period of the test. If the antimicrobial passes the ready biodegradability study, then no further testing is required. If the antimicrobial fails the ready biodegradability study, then the applicant must conduct one of the following studies: The biodegradation in activated sludge study as described in the “Simulation Tests to Assess the Biodegradability of Chemicals Discharged in Wastewater,” the porous pot test, or the simulation test—aerobic sewage treatment: A. activated sludge units.
5. For the all other use patterns category (as specified in § 158.2280(a)(3)), data are required based on a weight-of-evidence evaluation of the results of the hydrolysis, photodegradation in water, activated sludge sorption isotherm, biodegradability, and activated sludge, respiration inhibition tests.
6. Adsorption and desorption using a batch equilibrium method is preferred. In some cases, as when the antimicrobial pesticide degrades rapidly, soil column leaching with unaged or aged columns may be more appropriate to fully characterize the potential mobility of the parent compound and major transformation products.
7. For industrial processes and water systems, aquatic areas, and the all other use patterns category (as specified in § 158.2280(a)(3)), data are required based on a weight-of-evidence evaluation of the results of the hydrolysis, photodegradation in water, activated sludge sorption isotherm, biodegradability, and activated sludge, respiration inhibition tests.
8. The environmental media (soil, water, hydrosoil, and biota) to be utilized in these studies must be collected from areas representative of potential use sites.
9. For industrial processes and water systems, and aquatic areas, data are required for use sites that are intermittently dry.
10. Data are not required if the antimicrobial is an inorganic substance or a metal salt; or if the standardized soil
profiles demonstrate that the antimicrobial is likely to readily degrade either microbially or via redox reactions (chemically) and no transformation/degradate/leachate products of concern (as described under § 158.2280(a)(2)) are produced.
11. Analytical methods used to generate data associated with this study must include results of a successful confirmatory method trial by an independent laboratory.
12. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.
13. For industrial processes and water systems, wood preservatives, and the all other use patterns category (as specified in § 158.2280(a)(3)), data are required based on the potential for aquatic exposure and if the weight-of-evidence indicates that the active ingredient or principal transformation products are likely to have the potential for persistence, mobility, nontarget aquatic toxicity, or bioaccumulation.
14. Data are required if the weight-of-evidence indicates that the active ingredient or principal transformation products are likely to occur in nontarget freshwater, estuarine, or marine waters such that human or environmental exposures are likely to occur. In making that determination, the Agency takes into account other factors such as the toxicity of the chemical(s), available monitoring data and the vulnerability of the freshwater, estuarine, or marine water resources in the antimicrobial use area.
15. For wood preservatives, an aquatic leaching study is required. A soil leaching study is required if human or environmental exposures are likely to occur from leachates that contain the active ingredient or principal transformation products from wood treated with a preservative product. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.
16. For antifoulant paints and coatings, a leaching study is required. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.
17. Protocols, which include the residues of concern (such as parent, degradate/transformation product, and/or leachate residues) that would be monitored, must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.
18. A biodegradation study is not required if the antimicrobial meets one or more of the following criteria:
i. Classified as a metal,
ii. Relatively volatile, but not hydrophobic,
iii. Highly reactive,
iv. Both the parent and all transformation/degradate products (as described under § 158.2280(a)(2)) have half-lives of less than 3 hours,
v. None of the registered or proposed product uses would result in transport of the parent and its transformation/degradate products (as described under § 158.2280(a)(2)) to a wastewater treatment plant.
19. The activated sludge sorption isotherm test is not required if the antimicrobial is:
i. Relatively volatile, but not hydrophobic;
ii. Highly reactive; or
iii. The log K
ow
is less than 3.0.
20. If the criteria of test note 19 of this paragraph are not met, then the activated sludge sorption isotherm test is required if one or more of the following criteria are also met:
i. The antimicrobial is a metal,
ii. The log K
ow
is greater than or equal to 3.0,
iii. The antimicrobial is positively charged or polycationic,
iv. The EC
50
in the activated sludge, respiration inhibition test is less than or equal to 20 mg/L,
v. The EC
50
in the activated sludge, respiration inhibition test is greater than 20 mg/L, and the antimicrobial fails the ready biodegradability study.
21. The activated sludge respiration inhibition study is not required if none of the registered or proposed product uses would result in transport of the parent and its transformation/degradate products (as described under § 158.2280(a)(2)) to a wastewater treatment plant.

Test notes.
The following test notes apply to the data requirements in the table to paragraph (h) of this section:
1. A petition proposing a numerical tolerance or a tolerance exemption is required for any food or feed use subject to section 408 of FFDCA if the use is not covered by an existing tolerance or tolerance exemption. If the use is subject to FFDCA section 409, the applicant must identify to EPA an applicable section 409 food additive regulation or clearance, or submit a copy of a petition to FDA requesting a section 409 food additive regulation or clearance for the food or feed use.
2. An analytical reference standard is required for any food or feed use requiring a numeric tolerance or exemption. Material safety data sheets as specified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 29 CFR 1910.1200 must accompany analytical standards.
3. Data are required if a pesticide may be used in a food-handling establishment unless data including, but not limited to, theoretical (high-end) estimates, radiolabeled laboratory data, or the nature of the residue on surfaces study show that residues will not occur in food or feed.
4. If an antimicrobial pesticide may be applied to a food-contact surface or impregnated into a food-contact material and if theoretical (high-end) estimates of exposure exceed EPA's risk level of concern, then the nature of the residue on surfaces study is required. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.
5. Based on the results of the nature of the residue on surfaces study, if residues of concern are identified, then the migration study will be required. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.
6. If a magnitude of the residue study, as specified in § 158.2290(d), is required, then a residue analytical method suitable for collecting data is also required. The method must be capable of determining all residues of concern, to permit calculation of dietary risk or to establish a tolerance or tolerance exemption.
7. If a magnitude of the residue study, as specified in § 158.2290(d), is required, then storage stability data are also required, unless analytical samples are stored for 30 days or less. If, during hazard characterization, a residue has been identified as “of concern” and is known to be volatile or labile, then storage stability data are required regardless of sample storage time.
8. If crop plants or metabolically active raw agricultural commodities of food crops may be directly or indirectly exposed to an antimicrobial, plant metabolism studies are required to determine the transformation products that may enter the human diet. Such exposure could include, but is not limited to:
i. Treatment of storage or shipping containers,
ii. Postharvest fruit and vegetable treatment prior to shipping or storage,
iii. Use of antimicrobial-treated water for irrigation, and
iv. Any direct food contact use.
9. If livestock may be exposed to an antimicrobial, then hen and ruminant metabolism studies are required to determine the identities of residues of concern that may enter the human diet from consumption of livestock commodities. Livestock may be exposed via the oral, dermal, or inhalation route following treatment or contamination of sites including, but not limited to, livestock premises, feed, and drinking water. Shell eggs and other metabolically active livestock products may also be treated. If livestock may be exposed to one or more residues of concern differing from those found in animals, then one or more additional livestock metabolism studies involving dosing with these residues may be required.
10. If there is a numerical tolerance or tolerance exemption level to enforce, then a residue analytical method suitable for enforcement purposes is required. The method must be supported by an independent laboratory validation.
11. If there is a numerical tolerance or tolerance exemption level to enforce, then testing is required to determine whether the Food and Drug Administration/United States Department of Agriculture multiresidue methodology would detect and identify
the antimicrobial and its residues of concern, as part of programs to monitor pesticides in the U.S. food supply.
12. Data are required if an antimicrobial may be applied directly to water or if there is the potential that the antimicrobial-treated water could be used directly for drinking water purposes by humans or animals or that contaminated water could run-off, leach, or be discharged from treated sites or materials and make its way into potable water.
13. Data are required if an antimicrobial may be applied directly to water inhabited by fish or that will be inhabited by fish or if contaminated water could run-off, leach, or be discharged from treated sites or materials and make its way into bodies of water containing fish that may be used for human consumption.
14. Data are required if an antimicrobial may be applied directly to water used for irrigation of food crops or such that contaminated water could run-off, leach, or be discharged from treated sites or materials to make its way into water used for irrigation of food crops.
15. If the antimicrobial may be applied directly to livestock, metabolically-active livestock commodities (e.g., eggs), livestock feed or drinking water, or livestock premises, or a livestock metabolism study indicates that residues of the antimicrobial may result in livestock commodities, studies are required to determine the magnitude of the residues of concern in fat, meat, meat by-products, milk, poultry, and eggs that may be consumed by humans. These studies, however, may not be required in cases where the livestock metabolism studies indicate that transfer of pesticide residues of concern to tissues, milk, and eggs is not expected to occur at the maximum expected exposure level for the animals.
16. If food crops or raw agricultural commodities of food crops may be exposed to an antimicrobial, then residue studies are required to determine the magnitude of the residues of concern that may enter the human diet. Such exposures include, but are not limited to, postharvest fruit and vegetable treatments and application of antimicrobial chemicals to field crops, mushroom houses, empty or occupied beehives, or wood used to construct beehives.
17. Data on the nature and magnitude of residues in processed food or feed are required if antimicrobial residues could potentially concentrate on processing. If so, the establishment of a separate tolerance higher than that in the raw agricultural commodity may be required.
18. Data are required when dietary exposure values at the tolerance level or screening-level (high-end) result in estimates of dietary or aggregate risk that meet or exceed the Agency's level of concern. These data may include, but are not limited to, washing, cooking, processing, or degradation studies as well as market basket surveys for a more realistic residue determination. Protocols must be approved by the Agency prior to the initiation of the study.

(1) The registrant is aware, or has been informed that a person or non-target organism may have been exposed to a pesticide.
(2) The registrant is aware, or has been informed that the person or non-target organism suffered a toxic or adverse effect, or may suffer a delayed or chronic adverse effect in the future.
(3) The registrant has or could obtain information concerning where the incident occurred, the pesticide or product involved, and the name of a person to contact regarding the incident.
(b)
Exceptions.
Information regarding an incident need not be submitted if any of the following conditions are met:
(1) The registrant is aware of facts which clearly establish that the reported toxic effect, or reported exposure, did not or will not occur.
(2) The registrant has been notified in writing by the Agency that the reporting requirement has been waived for this incident or category of incidents, and the registrant has not been notified in writing by the Agency that the waiver is rescinded.
(3) It concerns a toxic effect to non-target plants, which were at the use site at the time the pesticide was applied, if the label provides adequate notice of such a risk.
(4) It concerns non-lethal phytotoxicity to the treated crop if the label provides an adequate notice of such a risk.
(5) It concerns a toxic effect to pests not specified on the label, provided that such pests are similar to pests specified on the label.
(6) It concerns minor skin or eye irritation effects warned of on the label of a product which is registered for use in residential use sites, and the effects occurred as a result of use in a residential site.
(c)
Required information on individual incidents.
To the extent that the registrant has any of the information listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section, the registrant must supply the information on each pesticide incident that meets the requirements outlined in paragraph (a) of this section. If the registrant acquires additional information concerning an incident previously reported to the Agency under this part, such information shall be reported if it meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. In the future, the Agency may by notice specify a format for such submissions. The Administrative, Pesticide, Circumstance and Exposure Type(s) of information must be reported for individual incidents, except where the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section allow for aggregated summary forms of reporting, or if EPA in the future grants permission in writing for alternative reporting formats. The registrant must also provide one or more Exposure Type and Severity categories and their designations for each incident as set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, depending on the applicability of the criteria listed below. The
criteria listed should be used in assigning a category. For example, an incident which allegedly caused serious but non-fatal effects to human beings and domestic animals might be designated “H-B: D-B.” When a single incident involves multiple pesticides, the registrant need only report on their specific product. However, if a single incident involves more than one type of non-target organism—for example, both humans and domestic animals are involved—all appropriate available information dealing with each of the victims must also be reported.

(ii) A State may register a new product only if each of the active ingredients in the new product is present because of the use of one or more federally registered products and if each of the inert ingredients in the new product is contained in a federally registered product.
(iii) A State may not register a new manufacturing-use product.
(iv) A State may register any use of a new product containing an ingredient described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if the new product registration is for a formulation or a use not included in the denial, disapproval, suspension, or cancellation, or if the federally registered use was voluntarily cancelled without a prior notice of intent to cancel by the Administrator. However, a formulation or use of such a new product which was not considered by the Administrator during such proceedings, or which was not the subject of a notice of intent to cancel, may be registered by a State only after the State consults with appropriate EPA personnel regarding the registration application.
(c)
Effect of State registration.
(1) A State registration issued under FIFRA sec. 24(c) which meets the conditions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and which is not disapproved by the Administrator under § 162.154, shall be considered a federal registration, but shall authorize distribution and use only within that State. Accordingly, such registrations are subject to all provisions of FIFRA which apply to currently registered products, including provisions for cancellation and suspension of registrations, and reregistration of products.
(2) A State may require, as a condition of distribution or use of a pesticide product within the State, that the pesticide product be registered under State law as well as under FIFRA. Neither FIFRA sec. 24(c) nor §§ 162.150-162.156 affects a State's right under its own law to revoke, suspend, cancel, or otherwise affect such a registration issued under State law. However, the federal registration, whether issued under FIFRA sec. 3 or 24(c), is not affected by such a State action.
[46 FR 2014, Jan. 7, 1981, as amended at 73 FR 75597, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 162.153
State registration procedures.
(a)
Application for registration.
States shall require all applicants for registration to submit the following information:
(1) Name and address of the applicant and any other person whose name will appear on the labeling or in the directions for use.
(2) The name of the pesticide product, and, if the application is for an amendment to a federally registered product, the EPA registration number of that product.
(3) A copy of proposed labeling, including all claims made for the product as well as directions for its use to meet the special local need, consisting of:
(i) For a new product, a copy of the complete proposed labeling; or,
(ii) For an additional use of a federally registered product, a copy of proposed supplemental labeling and a copy of the labeling for the federally registered product.
(4) The complete formula of the product, if the application is for a new product registration.
(5) Any other information which is required to be reviewed prior to registration under this section.
(b)
Special local need determination.
In reviewing any application for registration, the State shall determine whether there is a special local need for the registration. Situations which a State may consider as not involving a special local need may include, but are not limited to, applications for registrations to control a pest problem present on a nationwide basis, or for use of a pesticide product registered by other
States on an interregional or nationwide basis.
(c)
Unreasonable adverse effects determination.
(1) Prior to issuing a registration in the following cases, the State shall determine that use of the product for which registration is sought will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on man or the environment, when used in accordance with labeling directions or widespread and commonly recognized practices:
(i) For use of a product which has a composition not similar to any federally registered product.
(ii) For use of a project involving a use pattern not similar to any federally registered use of the same product or of a product with a similar composition.
(iii) For use of a product for which other uses of the same product, or of a product with a similar composition, have had registration denied, disapproved, suspended, or cancelled by the Administrator.
(2) Determinations required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be based on data and criteria consistent with those sections of part 152 of this chapter, applicable to the type of product or use under consideration. Such determinations may also involve consideration of the effect of the anticipated classification of the product or use under paragraph (g) of this section.
(d)
Efficacy determination.
Prior to registration of any use of a product for public health purposes—that is, a use which could result in substantial harm to the public health if the product does not perform its intended function, the State shall determine that the product warrants the claims made for it in the registration application. Such determinations shall be based on criteria specified in applicable sections of part 152 of this chapter and on any additional criteria established by the State.
(e)
Labeling requirements.
(1) Prior to issuing any registration, the State shall review the proposed labeling submitted with the application to determine compliance with this paragraph. In addition, the State shall review a copy of the final printed labeling as soon as practical after a registration is issued in order to verify compliance with this paragraph.
(2) For a new product, the State must, as a condition of the registration, require that the product be accompanied from the time it enters the stream of commerce by labeling meeting all applicable criteria of § 156.10 of this chapter. New product labeling must all contain:
(i) A statement identifying the State where registration is to be valid.
(ii) The special local need registration number assigned by the State.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, as a condition for a registration of an additional use of a federally registered product, the State must require that at the time of sale to users, labeling from the federally registered product be accompanied by supplemental labeling which contains:
(i) A statement identifying the State where registration is valid.
(ii) Directions for use to meet the special local need which satisfy the criteria of § 156.10(i) of this chapter.
(iii) The trade name of the product.
(iv) The name and address of the section 24(c) registrant.
(v) The EPA registration number of the federally registered product.
(vi) The special local need registration number assigned by the State.
(vii) A statement prohibiting use of the product in a manner inconsistent with all applicable directions, restrictions, and precautions found in the labeling of the federally registered product and accompanying supplemental labeling.
(4) When a federally registered product is already in the stream of commerce at the time the State issues a registration for an additional use of that product, the State must ensure that supplemental labeling for the additional use, meeting the criteria of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, is made available to purchasers and users of the product within 45 days of the date on which the State approves the final printed supplemental labeling.
(5) If a State classifies for restricted use a product or use registered by the State, which is not required to be so classified by paragraph (g) of this section, then the State may require supplemental labeling for the product or
use containing additional appropriate precautions, and a statement that the product or use is for restricted use within that State.
(f)
Packaging and coloration standards.
All products registered by a State must meet all appropriate packaging standards prescribed by the Administrator under sec. 25(c)(3) of FIFRA. State registered products must also meet all appropriate standards for coloration, or discoloration, established by regulation under sec. 25(c) of FIFRA, including the standards contained in subpart H of part 153 of this chapter. Prior to issuing any registration, the State shall determine that the product will conform to these requirements.
(g)
Classification.
(1) As part of the registration of any product or use, a State shall classify the product or use as a restricted use pesticide if:
(i) The product is identical or similar in composition to a federally registered product:
(A) For which all federally registered uses have been classified as restricted by the Administrator; or
(B) For which a use similar to the State registered use has been classified as restricted by the Administrator; or
(ii) The State registered product or use meets the criteria for classification as a restricted use pesticide under the applicable provisions of § 152.170 of this chapter.
(2) [Reserved]
(h)
Notification and submission of data.
(1) Within ten working days from the date a State issues, amends, or revokes a registration, the State shall notify EPA, in writing, of the action. Notification of State registrations, or amendments thereto, shall include the effective date of the registration or amendment, a confidential statement of the formula of any new product, and a copy of the draft labeling reviewed and approved by the State, provided that labeling previously approved by the Administrator as part of a federal registration need not be submitted.
(2) Notification of State registrations or amendments shall be supplemented by the State sending to EPA a copy of the final printed labeling approved by the State within 60 days after the effective date of the registration or amendment.
(3) Notification of revocation of a registration by a State shall indicate the effective date of revocation, and shall state the reasons for revocation.
(4) The Administrator or his designee may request, when appropriate, that a State submit to EPA any data used by the State to determine that unreasonable adverse effects will not be caused when the State registers any use described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Within 15 working days of receipt of such a request from EPA, the State shall submit two copies of the requested data.
(i)
Federal Register publication.
The Administrator shall publish in the
Federal Register,
on a regular basis, a summary of all State registrations made under sec. 24(c) during a previous reporting period established by the Administrator. For each product or use registered, the notice shall indicate:
(1) The name of the product.
(2) The name of the registrant.
(3) The registered use(s) of the product.
(4) The effective date of the State registration.
(5) If the registration is for an additional use of a federally registered product, whether the State registration involves a changed use pattern.
(j)
Electronic reporting under State registration of pesticide products for special local needs.
States that choose to receive electronic documents under the regulations pertaining to state registration of pesticides to meet special local needs, must ensure that the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3—(Electronic reporting) are satisfied by their state procedures for such registrations.
[46 FR 2014, Jan. 7, 1981, as amended at 53 FR 15999, May 4, 1988; 60 FR 32097, June 19, 1995; 70 FR 59888, Oct. 13, 2005; 73 FR 75597, Dec. 12, 2008]
§ 162.154
Disapproval of State registrations.
(a)
General disapprovals.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator may disapprove, on any reasonable grounds, any state registration which, when compared to a federally registered product, does not have both a similar composition and a similar use pattern; provided that the Administrator may
not disapprove such a registration solely because of a lack of essentiality. Grounds for disapproval of State registrations not involving similar products may include, but are not limited to:
(i) Probable creation of unreasonable adverse effects on man or the environment by the registered use.
(ii) Refusal of the registering State to submit information supporting the registration as required by § 162.153(h).
(iii) Failure of information submitted by the State to support the State's decision to issue the registration under standards established by § 162.153.
(2) Prior to disapproval of any State registration under this paragraph, the Administrator shall notify the registering State, in writing, of the Administrator's intent to disapprove, and of the reasons for disapproval. The notice of intent will provide a reasonable time, not less than ten days from the date the notice is received by the State, for the State to respond, and will invite the State to consult with the Administrator or his designee. If the grounds for disapproval are based on actions or omissions by the State, the notice will, if possible, also provide the State with a reasonable amount of time in which to take corrective action, not to exceed the time allowed for disapproval under paragraph (c) of this section.
(3) The registering State may, within ten days of receipt of a notice of intent to disapprove, request that the Administrator, or his designee, consult with appropriate State officials prior to the Administrator's final decision on disapproval. The Administrator will consider any relevant information presented at such a consultation, or in any other timely and appropriate fashion, in deciding whether to withdraw the notice of intent to disapprove.
(b)
Special disapprovals.
(1) The Administrator may disapprove any State registration, including a registration for a similar product, at any time, if the Administrator determines that use of the product under the State registration:
(i) Would constitute an imminent hazard.
(ii) May result in a residue on food or feed exceeding, or not covered by, a tolerance, exemption, or other clearance under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a
et seq.
).
(2) If the Administrator disapproves a registration under this paragraph, the Administrator shall provide the registering State with written notification of disapproval, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, as soon thereafter as practicable. Such notification will specify the grounds for disapproval and invite the State to comment on the decision.
(3) If requested by the State within ten days of its receipt of a notice of disapproval, the Administrator, or his designee, will consult with appropriate State officials. The Administrator may consider any information presented at such a consultation, or in any other appropriate fashion, in determining whether the disapproval should be rescinded.
(c)
Decision and notification of disapproval.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator will make a final decision on disapproval of a State registration, and provide written notification thereof to the State, within 90 days of the effective date of the registration; provided that, if the State does not notify the Agency of a registration within ten days of its effective date, then the Administrator will make a final decision on disapproval within 90 days of the date on which EPA receives notification of the State registration. The notice of disapproval will specify an appropriate date on which the disapproval will become effective. Disapproval may become effective immediately, or at anytime within the period allowed for the Administrator to make a final decision on disapproval. The notice of disapproval will also, when appropriate, give instructions for use or disposal of the pesticide. Each notice of disapproval will be published in the
Federal Register.
(d)
Effect of disapproval.
If a registration issued by a State is disapproved by the Administrator, that registration will not be valid for any purpose under FIFRA, as of the date the disapproval becomes effective. Thereafter, distribution or sale of the pesticide, in either interstate or intrastate commerce, for
uses subject to the disapproval will be a violation of sec. 12(a)(1) of FIFRA.
(e)
Rescission of disapproval.
If the Administrator determines, after consultation with the State lead agency, that a registration, previously issued by the State and disapproved by the Administrator, should not have been disapproved under FIFRA, then the Administrator shall rescind the disapproval. The Administrator shall send written notification of the rescission to the State. In addition, the Administrator shall publish notice of any rescission of disapproval in the
Federal Register.
(f)
Notification of registrants.
Any State that issues a registration which has been disapproved, or which is subject to a notice of intent to disapprove, shall be responsible for notifying the affected registrant of any such notice of intent or disapproval, and of any recession of disapproval by the Administrator.
§ 162.155
Suspension of State registration authority.
(a)
General.
(1) If the Administrator finds that a State is not capable of exercising, or has failed to exercise, adequate control over its registration program, so that the State cannot ensure that registrations issued by it will be in accord with the purposes of FIFRA, then the Administrator may suspend the State's authority to register pesticides under sec. 24(c) of the Act. Registrations issued by the State after suspension of its authority will not be considered valid under FIFRA. Registrations issued by the State prior to suspension will not be affected by the suspension.
(2) The Administrator may suspend all or any part of a State's registration authority, as appropriate.
(b)
Grounds for suspension.
(1) The Administrator may suspend a State's registration authority due to lack of, or failure to exercise, adequate control by the State over its sec. 24(c) registration program. Adequate control includes, but is not limited to, all of the following:
(i) Access to appropriate scientific and technical personnel to review data and make determinations as required by § 162.153.
(ii) Registration procedures satisfying § 162.153.
(iii) Complete and accurate records of State registrations.
(iv) Adequate legal authority. (A) To deny, suspend, revoke, or amend a State registration when the registration is not in compliance with FIFRA, this subpart, or State law, or when necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
(B) To enter, at reasonable times, by consent, warrant, or other legal means, any establishment where pesticides are produced or held for distribution or sale, to inspect, sample, and observe whether pesticides are being produced or distributed in compliance with FIFRA, this subpart, State law, and the terms of any State registration.
(2) The Administrator may suspend a State's registration authority if the State fails to exercise the controls specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or if the State refuses to correct within a reasonable time any other significant deficiencies in its regulatory program, as specified by the Administrator in a notice of intent to suspend.
(c)
Procedures for suspension.
(1) Prior to suspending the registration authority of any State, the Administrator will notify the State lead agency, in writing, of the Administrator's intent to suspend, and of the specific grounds for suspension. The notice of intent will specify whether the suspension will be complete or partial, and will provide the State an opportunity to respond and a reasonable amount of time, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is received, in which to correct the deficiencies specified in the notice. If the State does not correct the specified deficiencies within the reasonable time allowed by the notice, or if the Administrator has not withdrawn the notice of intent before that time, the notice of intent will be published in the
Federal Register,
and the public given an opportunity to comment thereon.
(2) If requested by the affected State lead agency within 30 days of receipt of the notice of intent to suspend, an informal consultation between appropriate State and EPA officials will be held to discuss the proposed suspension. In such a case, the Administrator
shall not make a final decision on the proposed suspension until after the consultation. The Administrator shall consider all relevant information presented at the consultation, or in any other appropriate manner, in determining whether to suspend the State's authority. If the Administrator determines, on the basis of such information, that the deficiencies listed in the notice of intent no longer exist, or will be corrected in a reasonable time, then the Administrator will withdraw, in writing, the notice of intent to suspend.
(3) Within ten days of the date a notice of intent to suspend is published in the
Federal Register,
a State may request a public hearing to consider the proposed suspension. If a hearing is requested, the Administrator will:
(i) Schedule a public hearing to be held in that State.
(ii) Publish in the
Federal Register
a notice announcing the date, time, and location of the hearing.
(iii) Appoint a presiding officer who shall preside over the hearing.
(iv) Prescribe additional, appropriate procedures for the conduct of the hearing, including procedures for the presentation of relevant material evidence from the State, EPA, or members of the public who would be affected by the outcome of the hearing. Evidence may be presented in either oral or written form, at the discretion of the Administrator.
(4) Following the close of any hearing held under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the presiding officer shall make a recommended decision that the State's authority to register pesticides under sec. 24(c) of FIFRA be suspended, in whole or in part, or that the State's authority not be suspended and that the notice of intent to suspend be withdrawn.
(5) Any recommended decision made by a presiding officer under paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be appealed to the Administrator within 30 days after its issuance by the State or by EPA. Any recommended decision which is not appealed, or which the Administrator does not review on his own initiative, will become a final Agency action 30 days after its issuance.
(6) If no hearing is requested under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or if a recommended decision is appealed to the Administrator under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the Administrator shall issue a final order either suspending the State's authority to register pesticides under section 24(c) of FIFRA, in whole or in part, or withdrawing the notice of intent to suspend.
(7) Any final order suspending State registration authority, issued under paragraph (c) (5) or (6) of this section, will specify the grounds therefor and an effective date for the suspension. If the suspension is merely partial, the notice of suspension will specify the types of registrations which will not be recognized as valid under sec. 24(c). All final orders issued under paragraph (c) (5) or (6) will be published in the
Federal Register.
(d)
Termination of suspension.
Suspension of a State's authority will be effective for the period specified in the notice of suspension, or if no period was specified, until such time as the Administrator is satisfied that the State can and will exercise adequate control over its program. In the latter case, the Administrator will notify the State that the suspension is terminated, or that it will be terminated on a specific date. In either case, the Administrator will publish a notice of the termination of suspension in the
Federal Register.
(e)
Judicial review.
Any State whose authority to register pesticides has been finally suspended by the Administrator may seek judicial review of the Administrator's decision under sec. 16 of FIFRA, at any time prior to termination of the suspension. Such suspension shall remain in effect during the period of judicial review unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.
§ 162.156
General requirements.
(a)
Requirements for distribution and use.
(1) Any product whose State registration has been issued in accordance with §§ 162.152 and 162.153 may be distributed and used in that State, subject to the following provisions of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder:
(i) Sec. 12(a)(1) (A) through (E), in accordance with:
(A) Sec. 2(q)(1) (A) through (G).
(B) Sec. 2(q)(2) (A) through (D).
(ii) Sec. 12(a)(2) (A) through (G) and (I) through (P).
(2) A product or use classified by a State for restricted use under § 162.153(g) may be used only by, or under the direct supervision of, an applicator certified under a plan approved by EPA in accordance with sec. 4 of FIFRA.
(3) State registrations which are not issued in accordance with § 162.152 (a) and (b)(2) (i), (ii) and (iii) are not authorized by section 24(c) and are not considered valid for any purposes under FIFRA. When the Administrator determines that a registration is invalid, the Administrator shall notify the registering State that the registration is invalid, and may specify the reason for the invalidity.
(b)
Establishment registration requirements.
No person may produce any pesticide, including any pesticide registered by a State under section 24(c), unless the establishment in which it is produced is registered by the Administrator in accordance with sec. 7 of FIFRA and 40 CFR part 167.
(c)
Books and records requirements.
All producers of pesticides, including those producers of pesticides registered by States under sec. 24(c), must maintain records in accordance with the requirements imposed under sec. 8 of FIFRA and 40 CFR part 169.

§ 164.20
Commencement of proceeding.
(a) A proceeding shall be commenced whenever a hearing is requested by any person adversely affected by a notice of the Administrator of his refusal to register or of his intent to cancel the registration or to change the classification of a pesticide. A proceeding shall likewise be commenced whenever the Administrator decides to call a hearing to determine whether or not the registration of a pesticide should be canceled or its classification changed. Such request or notice of intent to hold a hearing shall be timely filed with the hearing clerk, and the matter shall be docketed and assigned a FIFRA docket number.

Amendments to contents of denials and notices.
Such documents under this section may be amended or enlarged by the Administrator at any time prior to the commencement of the public hearing. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that additional time is necessary to permit a party to prepare for matters raised by such amendments, the commencement of the hearing shall be delayed for an appropriate period.
§ 164.22
Contents of document setting forth objections.
(a)
Concise statement required.
Any document containing objections to an order of the Administrator of his refusal to register, or his intent to cancel the registration, or change the classification of a pesticide, shall clearly and concisely set forth such objections and the basis for each objection, including relevant allegations of fact concerning the pesticide under consideration. The document shall indicate the registration number of the pesticide, if applicable, a copy of the currently accepted and/or proposed labeling and a list of the currently registered or proposed uses of said pesticide.
(b)
Amendments to objections byleave.
Objections may be amended at any time prior to the commencement of the public hearing by leave of the Administrative Law Judge or by written consent of all parties. The Administrative Law Judge shall freely grant such leave when justice so requires. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that additional time is necessary to permit a party to prepare for matters raised by amendments to objections, the commencement of the hearing shall be delayed for an appropriate period. This subsection shall not permit the addition, beyond the statutory deadline, of registered pesticides which are not included in the objections filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Amendments to objections as a matter of right.
Objections may be amended as a matter of right within 30 days, or in such time as the Administrator shall designate, after the Administrator amends his notice of intent to cancel a registration, change a classification, or his refusal to register a pesticide.
§ 164.23
Contents of the statement of issues to accompany notice of intent to hold a hearing.
(a)
Concise statement required.
The statement of issues by the Administrator shall set a time in which any person wishing to participate in the hearing shall file a written response to the statement of issues as provided by § 164.24. The statement of issues shall include questions as to which evidence shall be taken at the hearing. Those questions may include questions concerning whether a pesticide's registration should be canceled or its classification changed, whether its composition is such as to warrant the claims for it, whether its labeling and other material submitted comply with the requirements of the Act, whether it will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects
on the environment, and whether, when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, it will or will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
(b)
Amendment to statement of issues.
The statement of issues may be amended or enlarged by the Administrator at any time prior to the commencement of the public hearing.

§ 164.24
Response to the Administrator's notice of intention to hold a hearing.
Any person wishing to participate in any proceeding commenced pursuant to any notice by the Administrator of intention to hold a hearing, shall file with the hearing clerk, within the time set by the Administrator in the notice (in no case less than 30 days from the date of the notice), a written response to the statement of issues which shall include the position and interest of such person with respect thereto.

§ 164.31
Intervention.
(a)
Motion.
Any person may file a motion for leave to intervene in a hearing conducted under this subpart. A motion must set forth the grounds for the proposed intervention, the position and interest of the movant in the proceeding and the documents proposed to be filed pursuant to either § 164.22 or § 164.24.
(b)
When filed.
A motion for leave to intervene in a hearing must ordinarily be filed prior to the commencement of the first prehearing conference. Any motion filed after that time must contain, in addition to the information set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, a statement of good cause for the failure to file the motion prior to the commencement of the first prehearing conference, and shall be granted only upon a finding (1) that extraordinary circumstances justify the granting of the motion, or (2) that the intervenor shall be bound by agreements, arrangements, and other matters previously made in the proceeding.
(c)
Disposition.
Leave to intervene will be freely granted but only insofar as such leave raises matters which are pertinent to and do not unreasonably broaden the issues already presented. If leave is granted, the movant shall thereby become a party with the full status of the original parties to the proceedings. If leave is denied, the movant may request that the ruling be certified to the Environmental Appeals Board, pursuant to § 164.100 for a speedy appeal.
(d)
Amicus curiae.
Persons not parties to the proceedings wishing to file briefs may do so by leave of the Administrative Law Judge granted on motion. A motion for leave shall identify the interest of the applicant and shall state the reasons why the proposed amicus
brief is desirable. Unless all parties otherwise consent, an amicus curiae shall file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position the brief will support. Upon a showing of good cause, the Administrator or Administrative Law Judge may grant permission for later filing.
[38 FR 19371, July 20, 1973, as amended at 57 FR 5342, Feb. 13, 1992]
§ 164.32
Consolidation.
The Chief Administrative Law Judge, by motion or sua sponte, may consolidate two or more proceedings whenever it appears that this will expedite or simplify consideration of the issues. Consolidation shall not affect the right of any party to raise issues that could have been raised if consolidation had not occurred. At the conclusion of proceedings consolidated under this section, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue one decision under § 164.90 unless one or more of the consolidated proceedings have been dismissed pursuant to § 164.91.

Qualifications and duties of Administrative Law Judge.
(a)
Qualifications.

(b)
Disqualification of the Administrative Law Judge.
(1) Any party may, by motion made to the Administrative Law Judge, as soon as practicable, request that he disqualify himself and withdraw from the proceeding. The Administrative Law Judge shall then rule upon the motion and, upon request of the movant, shall certify an adverse ruling for appeal.
(2) Withdrawal sua sponte. The Administrative Law Judge may at any time withdraw from any proceedings in which he deems himself disqualified for any reason.
(c)
Conduct.
The Administrative Law Judge shall conduct the proceeding in a fair and impartial manner subject to the precepts of the Canons of Judicial Ethics of the American Bar Association.

# Prehearing Procedures and Discovery
§ 164.50
Prehearing conference and primary discovery.
(a)
Purpose of the prehearing conference.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrative Law Judge shall, prior to the commencement of the hearing and for the purpose of expediting the hearing, file with the hearing clerk an order for a prehearing conference. More than one such conference may be held. Such order or orders shall direct the parties or their counsel to appear at a specified time and place to consider:
(1) The simplification of issues including listing of specific uses to be contested;
(2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to the objections or statement of issues, or any document filed in response thereto;
(3) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and documents which will avoid unnecessary delay;
(4) Matters of which official notice may be taken;
(5) The limitation of the number of expert and other witnesses;
(6) Procedure at the hearing except as so provided in § 164.80(a);
(7) The use of verified written statements in lieu of oral direct testimony;
(8) The intent of any party to request a scientific advisory committee as defined in § 164.2(f);
(9) The issuance of subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum for discovery and hearing purposes;
(10) A setting of a time and place for the public hearing, after giving careful consideration to the convenience of all the parties, the witnesses, the public interest and the necessity for notice in the
Federal Register
as provided by § 164.8; and
(11) Any other matter that may expedite the hearing or aid in the disposition of the proceeding.
(b)
Primary discovery
(
Exchange of witness lists and documents
). At a prehearing conference or within some reasonable time set by the Administrative Law Judge prior to the hearing, each party shall make available to the other parties the names of the expert and other witnesses the party expects to call, together with a brief narrative summary of their expected testimony and a list of all documents and exhibits which the party expects to introduce into evidence. Thereafter, witnesses, documents, or exhibits may be added and narrative summaries of expected testimony amended upon motion by a party.
(c)
Record of the prehearing conference.
No transcript of any prehearing conference shall be made unless a request therefor by one of the parties is granted by the Administrative Law Judge. Such party shall bear the cost of the taking of the transcript unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge shall prepare and file for the record a written report of the action taken at each conference, which shall incorporate any stipulations or agreements made by the parties at or as a result of such conference, all rulings upon matters considered at such conference and appropriate orders.
(d)
Unavailability of a prehearing conference.
Upon a finding that circumstances render a prehearing conference unnecessary, or impracticable, or upon a finding that a prehearing conference would serve primarily to delay the proceedings rather than to expedite them, the Administrative Law Judge, on motion or sua sponte, may order that the prehearing conference not be held. In these circumstances he may request the parties to correspond with him for the purpose of accomplishing any of the objectives set forth in this section. Such correspondence shall not be made a part of the record, but the Administrative Law Judge shall submit a written summary for the record if any action is taken.
(e)
Submission of questions to an advisory committee
—(1)
General.
At any prehearing conference, or if none is held prior to the public hearing, except as herein provided, the Administrative Law Judge shall determine whether any party desires that questions of scientific fact be referred to a committee designated by the National Academy of Sciences.
(2)
Preparation of questions.
On determining an affirmative intent, the Administrative Law Judge shall direct all parties to file and serve, within a time period subject to his discretion, proposed questions of scientific fact accompanied by reasons supporting their submission to said committee. Within 10 days of the service of such proposed questions, together with their supporting reasons, any party may respond in writing to the proposed submission of the questions to the said committee. The Administrative Law Judge shall determine whether or not a reference of questions of scientific fact to said committee is necessary or desirable. In the event he decides such reference is necessary or desirable, he shall so inform the National Academy in writing, and shall prepare in his discretion appropriate questions. If any of the questions prepared are not in substance based upon the submissions of the parties, the Administrative Law Judge shall permit any party 10 days after their preparation to respond in writing to the proposed submission of said question or questions. He shall then determine whether such questions should be referred to the committee.
(3)
Reference and report.
Not less than 30 days after he has informed the National Academy that questions of scientific fact will be referred to it, the Administrative Law Judge shall refer the questions of scientific fact as prepared. The committee shall report in writing to the Administrative Law Judge within 60 days after such referral on these questions of scientific fact and the report, its record and any other matter transmitted as provided for by the Administrator's agreement with the National Academy of Sciences shall be made public and considered as part of the hearing record.
(4)
Request and submission subsequent to prehearing conference.
At any time before the hearing is closed, the Administrative Law Judge or a party by motion may request that questions of scientific fact not previously referred be referred, or that questions previously referred be amended or expanded. The Administrative Law Judge may refer such questions if he finds that good cause exists and that reference of such questions is necessary or desirable.
[38 FR 19371, July 20, 1973, as amended at 39 FR 11884, Apr. 1, 1974]
§ 164.51
Other discovery.
(a)
General.
Except as so provided by § 164.50(b)
supra,
further discovery, under this subpart, shall be permitted only upon determination by the Administrative Law Judge (1) that such discovery shall not in any way unreasonably delay the proceeding, (2) that the information to be obtained is not otherwise obtainable and (3) that such information has significant probative value. The Administrative Law Judge shall be guided by the procedures set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where practicable, and the precedents thereunder, except that no discovery shall be undertaken except upon order of the Administrative Law Judge or upon agreement of the parties.
(b)
Depositions upon oral questions.
The Administrative Law Judge shall order depositions upon oral questions only upon a showing of good cause and upon a finding that (1) the information sought cannot be obtained by alternative methods, or (2) there is a substantial reason to believe that relevant and probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a witness at the hearing.
(c)
Procedure.
(1) Any party to the proceeding desiring discovery shall make a motion or motions therefor. Such a motion shall set forth (i) the circumstances warranting the taking of the discovery, (ii) the nature of the information expected to be discovered and (iii) the proposed time and place where it will be taken.

Otherwise, such decision shall await the answering papers and reply papers if permitted. The Environmental Appeals Board shall rule upon all motions filed after the filing of the initial or accelerated decision. Oral argument of motions will be permitted only if the
Administrative Law Judge or the Environmental Appeals Board deems it necessary.
[38 FR 19371, July 20, 1973, as amended at 57 FR 5343, Feb. 13, 1992]

# Subpoenas and Witness Fees
§ 164.70
Subpoenas.
(a) The attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary evidence may, by subpoena, be required at any designated place of hearing or place of discovery. Subpoenas may be issued by the Administrative Law Judge sua sponte or upon a showing by an applicant that evidence sought for hearing is relevant and material to the issues involved in the hearing or that the sought discovery pursuant to § 164.51 meets the standards set forth therein. The Administrative Law Judge shall be guided by the principles of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in making any order for the protection of a witness or the content of the documents produced.
(b)
Motion for subpoena duces tecum.

Fees shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witness appears or the deposition is taken.

# The Hearings
§ 164.80
Order of proceeding and burden of proof.
(a) At the hearing, the proponent of cancellation or change in classification has the burden of going forward to present an affirmative case for the cancellation or change in classification of the registration. In the case of the denial of an application for registration, the applicant shall have the burden of going forward. In the case of a hearing called by the Administrator, the Respondent has the burden of going forward to present an affirmative case as to the statement of issues. The party having the burden of going forward shall have the opportunity to submit evidence on rebuttal.
(b) On all issues arising in connection with the hearing, the ultimate burden of persuasion shall rest with the proponent of the registration.
(c) If any party, other than Respondent, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Law Judge to dismiss the proceeding with or without prejudice, as the Administrative Law Judge may determine, unless a motion excusing the failure to appear has been made and granted. In the event that a party appears at the hearing and no representative of the Agency appears, the Administrative Law Judge shall proceed
ex parte
to hear the evidence of the party:
Provided,
That failure on the part of Respondent to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of Respondent's right to file proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and orders, to be served with a copy of the Administrative Law Judge's initial or accelerated decision, and to file exceptions with and to submit argument before the Administrator with respect thereto.
§ 164.81
Evidence.
(a)
General.
The Administrative Law Judge shall admit all relevant, competent and material evidence, except evidence that is unduly repetitious. Relevant, competent and material evidence may be received at any hearing even though inadmissible under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The weight to be given evidence shall be determined by its reliability and probative value. In all hearings the testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally, except as otherwise provided by these rules or by the
Administrative Law Judge. Parties, however, shall have the right to cross-examine a witness who appears at the hearing, provided that such cross examination is not unduly repetitious.
(b)
Report of a committee of the National Academy of Sciences.
If questions have been submitted to a committee designated by the National Academy pursuant to § 164.50(e), the report of the committee, other material that may be required by the Administrator and a list of witnesses and evidence relied upon shall be received into evidence and made part of the record of the hearing. Objections to the report may also be made part of the record and go to the weight of its evidentiary value.
(c)
Objections.
If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence or the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination, he shall state briefly the grounds for such objection. The transcript shall include any argument or debate thereon, unless the Administrative Law Judge, with the consent of all parties, orders that such argument not be transcribed. The ruling and the reasons given therefor by the Administrative Law Judge on any objection shall be a part of the transcript. An automatic exception to that ruling will follow.
(d)
Exhibits.
Except where the Administrative Law Judge finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of each exhibit filed with the Administrative Law Judge shall be furnished to each other party. A true copy of an exhibit may, in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, be substituted for the original.
(e)
Official Notice.
Official notice may be taken of Agency proceedings, any matter judicially noticed in the Federal courts, and of other facts within the specialized knowledge and experience of the Agency. Any active party shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed by presenting evidence to the contrary.
(f)
Offer of proof.
Whenever evidence is deemed inadmissible, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript. The offer of proof for excluded oral testimony shall consist of a brief statement describing the nature of the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a document or exhibit, it shall be inserted in the record in total. In the event the Environmental Appeals Board decides that the Administrative Law Judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, the hearings may be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence, or where appropriate, the Environmental Appeals Board may evaluate the evidence and proceed to a final decision.
(g)
Verified statements.
With the approval of the Administrative Law Judge, a witness may insert into the record, as his testimony, statements of fact or opinion prepared by him or written answers to interrogatories of counsel, or may submit as an exhibit his prepared statement, provided that such statements or answers must not include legal argument. Before any such statement or answer is read or admitted into evidence the witness shall deliver to the Administrative Law Judge, the reporter, and opposing counsel a copy of such. The admissibility of the evidence contained in such statement shall be subject to the same rules as if such testimony were produced in the usual manner and the witness shall be subject to oral cross-examination on the contents of such statements. Approval for such a procedure may be denied when it appears to the Administrative Law Judge that the memory or the demeanor of the witness is of importance.
[38 FR 19371, July 20, 1973, as amended at 40 FR 25815, June 19, 1975; 57 FR 5343, Feb. 13, 1992]
§ 164.82
Transcripts.
(a)
Filing and certification.
Hearings shall be stenographically reported, transcribed and made available to the public as required by statute or Agency regulations. As soon as practicable after the taking of the last evidence, the Administrative Law Judge shall certify (1) that the original transcript is a true transcript of the testimony offered or received at the hearing, except in such particulars as he shall specify and (2) that the exhibits accompanying the transcript are all the exhibits introduced at the hearing, with such exceptions as he shall specify. A copy of
such certificate shall be attached to each of the copies of the transcript.
(b) [Reserved]

# Initial or Accelerated Decision
§ 164.90
Initial decision.
(a)
Proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and order.
Within 20 days after the last evidence is taken in a hearing, each party may file with the hearing clerk proposed orders, findings of fact, and conclusions of law based solely on the record, and a brief in support thereof. Within 10 days thereafter, each party may file a reply brief. The Administrative Law Judge may, in his discretion, extend the total time period for filing any proposed findings, conclusions, orders or briefs for an additional 30 days. In such instances, briefs and replies shall be due at such time as the Administrative Law Judge may fix by order. The hearing shall be deemed closed at the conclusion of the briefing period.
(b)
Initial decision.
The Administrative Law Judge, within 25 days after the close of the hearing, shall evaluate the record before him, and prepare and file his initial decision with the hearing clerk. A copy of the initial decision shall be served upon each of the parties, and the hearing clerk shall immediately transmit a copy to the Environmental Appeals Board. The initial decision shall become the decision of the Environmental Appeals Board without further proceedings unless an appeal is taken from it or the Environmental Appeals Board orders review of it, pursuant to § 164.101.
[38 FR 19371, July 20, 1973, as amended at 57 FR 5343, Feb. 13, 1992]
§ 164.91
Accelerated decision.
(a)
General.
The Administrative Law Judge, in his discretion, may at any time render an accelerated decision in favor of Respondent as to all or any portion of the proceeding, including dismissal without further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence such as affidavits as he may receive, under any of the following conditions:
(1) Untimely or insufficient objections filed pursuant to § 164.20;
(2) Failure to comply with discovery orders;
(3) Failure to comply with prehearing orders;
(4) Failure to appear or to proceed at prehearing conferences;
(5) Failure to appear at the hearing;
(6) Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or direct or collateral estoppel.
(7) Theat there is no genuine issue of any material fact and that the respondent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; or
(8) Such other and further reasons as are just.
(b)
Effect.
A decision rendered under this section shall have the same force and effect as an initial decision entered under § 164.90.

# Appeals
§ 164.100
Appeals from or review of interlocutory orders or rulings.
Except as provided herein, appeals as a matter of right shall lie to the Environmental Appeals Board only from an initial or accelerated decision of the Administrative Law Judge. Appeals from other orders or rulings shall, except as provided in this section, lie only if the Administrative Law Judge certifies such orders or rulings for appeal, or otherwise as provided. The Administrative Law Judge may certify an order or ruling for appeal to the Environmental Appeals Board when: (a) The order or ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and (b) either (1) an immediate appeal from the order and ruling will materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or (2) review after the final judgment is issued will be inadequate or ineffective. The Administrative Law Judge shall certify orders or rulings for appeal only upon the request of a party. If the Environmental Appeals Board determines that certification was improvidently granted, or takes no action within thirty (30) days of the certification, the appeal shall be deemed dismissed. When an order or ruling is not certified by the Administrative Law Judge, it shall be reviewed by the Environmental Appeals Board only upon appeal from the initial or accelerated decision except when the Environmental Appeals
Board determines, upon request of a party and in exceptional circumstances, that delaying review would be deleterious to vital public or private interests. Except in extraordinary circumstances proceedings will not be stayed pending an interlocutory appeal; where a stay is granted, a stay of more than 30 days must be approved by the Environmental Appeals Board. Ordinarily, the interlocutory appeal will be decided on the basis of the submission made to the Administrative Law Judge, but the Environmental Appeals Board may allow further briefs and oral argument.
[57 FR 5343, Feb. 13, 1992]
§ 164.101
Appeals from or review of initial decisions.
(a)
Exceptions and request for oral argument.
(1) Within 20 days after the filing of the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision, each party may take exception to any matter set forth in such decision or to any adverse order or ruling to which he objected during the hearing and may appeal such exceptions to the Environmental Appeals Board for decision by filing them in writing with the hearing clerk, including a section containing proposed findings of fact, conclusions, orders, or rulings. Within the same period of time each party filing exceptions and amicus curiae shall file with the hearing clerk a brief concerning each of the exceptions being appealed. The party shall include, in its brief, page references to the relevant portions of the record and to the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision.
(2) Within 7 days of the service of exceptions, and of a brief under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any other party or amicus curiae may file and serve a brief responding to exceptions or arguments raised by any other party. Such brief shall include references to the relevant portions of the record. Such brief shall not, however, raise additional exceptions.
(3) Five copies of all material filed under this section shall be filed with the hearing clerk.
(b)
Review by Administrator when no exceptions are filed.
If no exceptions are filed within the time provided, the hearing clerk shall notify the Administrator 30 days from the date of filing of the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision. Within 10 days after said notification, the Environmental Appeals Board shall issue an order either declining review of the initial decision or expressing its intent to review said initial decision. Such order may include a statement of issues to be briefed by the parties and a time schedule concerning service and filing of briefs adequate to allow the Environmental Appeals Board to issue a final order within 90 days from the close of the hearing.
(c)
Argument before the Environmental Appeals Board.
(1) A party, if he files exceptions and a brief, shall state in writing whether he desires to make an oral argument thereon before the Environmental Appeals Board; otherwise, he shall be deemed to have waived such oral argument. The Environmental Appeals Board shall, however, on its own initiative, have the right to set an appeal for oral argument.
(2) If the Environmental Appeals Board determines that additional exceptions should be argued, counsel for the parties shall be given reasonable written notice of such determination so as to permit preparation of adequate argument on all of the exceptions to be argued.
[38 FR 19371, July 20, 1973, as amended at 57 FR 5343, Feb. 13, 1992]
§ 164.102
Appeals from accelerated decisions.
(a) Within 20 days after filing of an accelerated decision by the Administrative Law Judge, any party may file exceptions and a supporting brief with the hearing clerk, stating with particularity the grounds upon which he asserts that the decision is incorrect. The party shall include in its brief page references to the relevant portions of the record, if applicable.
(b) Within 7 days of the service of exceptions and brief under paragraph (a) of this section, any other party or amicus curiae may file and serve a brief responding thereto, with appropriate page references to the relevant portions of the record, if applicable.
(c) Ordinarily, the appeal from an accelerated decision will be decided on the basis of the submission of briefs, but the Environmental Appeals Board
may allow additional briefs and oral argument.
[38 FR 19371, July 20, 1973, as amended at 57 FR 5343, Feb. 13, 1992]
§ 164.103
Final decision or order on appeal or review.
Within 90 days after the close of the hearing or within 90 days from the filing of an accelerated decision, unless otherwise stipulated by the parties, the Environmental Appeals Board shall, on appeal or review from an initial or accelerated order of the Administrative Law Judge, issue its final decision and order, including its rulings on any exceptions filed by the parties; such final order may accept or reject all or part of the initial or accelerated decision of the Administrative Law Judge even if acceptable to the parties.

§ 164.110
Motion for reopening hearings; for rehearing; for reargument of any proceeding; or for reconsideration of order.
(a)
Filing; service.
A motion for reopening the hearing to take further evidence, or for rehearing or reargument of any proceeding or for reconsideration of the order, must be made by motion to the Environmental Appeals Board filed with the hearing clerk. Every such motion must state specifically the grounds relied upon.
(b)
Motion to reopen hearings.
A motion to reopen a hearing to take further evidence may be filed at any time prior to the issuance of the Administrator's final order. Every such motion shall state briefly the nature and purpose of the evidence to be adduced, shall show that such evidence is not merely cumulative, and shall set forth good reason why such evidence was not adduced at a hearing.
(c)
Motions to rehear or reargue proceedings, or to reconsider final orders.
A motion to rehear or reargue the proceeding or to reconsider the final order shall be filed within 10 days after the date of service of the final order. Every such motion must state specifically the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided, and alleged errors must be briefly stated. Motions to rehear or reargue proceedings or to reconsider final orders shall be directed to, and heard by, the Environmental Appeals Board. Motions under this section directed to the Administrator will not be considered, except in cases that the Environmental Appeals Board has referred to the Administrator pursuant to § 164.2(g) and in which the Administrator has issued the final order. A motion for reconsideration shall not stay the effective date of the final order unless specifically so ordered by the Environmental Appeals Board.

§ 164.111
Procedure for disposition of motions.
Within 7 days following the service of any motion provided for in § 164.110, any other party to the proceeding may file with the hearing clerk an answer thereto. As soon as practicable thereafter, the Environmental Appeals Board shall announce its decision whether to grant or to deny the motion. Unless the Environmental Appeals Board shall determine otherwise, operation of the order shall not be stayed pending the decision to grant or to deny the motion. In the event that any such motion is granted by the Environmental Appeals Board, the applicable rules of practice, as set out elsewhere herein, shall be followed.

# Subpart D—Rules of Practice for Applications Under Sections 3 and 18 To Modify Previous Cancellation or Suspension Orders

# Authority:
Sec. 25(a) and 6 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended by the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972 (86 Stat. 997).

# Source:
40 FR 12265, Mar. 18, 1975, unless otherwise noted.
§ 164.130
General.
EPA has determined that any application under section 3 or section 18 of the Act to allow use of a pesticide at a site and on a pest for which registration has been finally cancelled or suspended by the Administrator constitutes a petition for reconsideration of such order. Because of the extensive notice and hearing opportunities mandated by FIFRA and the Administrative Procedures Act before a final cancellation or suspension order may be issued, EPA has determined that such orders may not be reversed or modified without affording interested parties—who may in fact have participated in lengthy cancellation proceedings—similar notice and hearing opportunities. The procedures set forth in this subpart D shall govern all such applications.
§ 164.131
Review by Administrator.
(a) The Administrator will review applications subject to this subpart D and supporting data submitted by the applicant to determine whether reconsideration of the Administrator's prior cancellation or suspension order is warranted. The Administrator shall determine that such reconsideration is warranted when he finds that: (1) The applicant has presented substantial new evidence which may materially affect the prior cancellation or suspension order and which was not available to the Administrator at the time he made his final cancellation or suspension determination and (2) such evidence could not, through the exercise of due diligence, have been discovered by the parties to the cancellation or suspension proceeding prior to the issuance of the final order.
(b) If after review of the application and other supporting data submitted by the applicant, the Administrator determines, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, that reconsideration of his prior order is not warranted, then the application will be denied without requirement for an administrative hearing. The Administrator shall publish notice in the
Federal Register
of the denial briefly describing the basis for his determination as soon as practicable. Such denial shall constitute final agency action.
(c) If after review of the application and other supporting data submitted by the applicant, the Administrator determines, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, that reconsideration of his prior order is warranted, he will then publish notice in the
Federal Register
setting forth his determination and briefly describing the basis for the determination. Such notice shall announce that a formal public hearing will be held in accordance with 5 U.S.C. section 554. The notice shall specify: (1) The date on which the hearing will begin and end, (2) the issues of fact and law to be adjudicated at the hearing, (3) the date on which the presiding officer shall submit his recommendations, including findings of fact and conclusions, to the Administrator, and (4) the date on which a decision by the Administrator is anticipated.
§ 164.132
Procedures governing hearing.
(a) The burden of proof in the hearing convened pursuant to § 164.131 shall be on the applicant and he shall proceed first. The issues in the hearing shall be whether: (1) Substantial new evidence exists and (2) such substantial new evidence requires reversal or modification of the existing cancellation or suspension order. The determination of these issues shall be made taking into account the human and environmental risks found by the Administrator in his cancellation or suspension determination and the cumulative effect of all past and present uses, including the requested use, and uses which may reasonably be anticipated to occur in the future as a result of granting the requested reversal or modification. The granting of a particular petition for use may not in itself pose a significant risk to man or the environment, but the cumulative impact of each additional use of the cancelled or suspended pesticide may re-establish, or serve to maintain, the significant risks previously found by the Administrator.
(b) The presiding officer shall make recommendations, including findings of fact and conclusions and to the extent feasible, as determined by the presiding officer, the procedures at the hearing shall follow the Rules of Practice, set forth in subparts A and B of this part 164.
§ 164.133
Emergency waiver of hearing.
(a) In the case of an application subject to this subpart D which is filed under section 18 of FIFRA, and regulations thereunder, and for which a hearing is required pursuant to § 164.131, the Administrator may dispense with the requirement of convening such a hearing in any case in which he determines:
(1) That the application presents a situation involving need to use the pesticide to prevent an unacceptable risk: (i) To human health, or (ii) to fish or wildlife populations when such use would not pose a human health hazard; and
(2) That there is no other feasible solution to such risk; and
(3) That the time available to avert the risk to human health or fish and wildlife is insufficient to permit convening a hearing as required by § 164.131; and
(4) That the public interest requires the granting of the requested use as soon as possible.
(b) Notice of any determination made by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be published in the
Federal Register
as soon as practicable after granting the requested use and shall set forth the basis for the Administrator's determination.

# Subpart A—General
§ 165.1
Scope.
The part 165 regulations establish standards and requirements for pesticide containers, repackaging pesticides, and pesticide containment structures.
§ 165.3
Definitions.
Terms used in this part have the same meaning as in the Act and part 152 of this chapter. In addition, as used in this part, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below.
Act
means the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
Agricultural pesticide
means any pesticide product labeled for use in or on a farm, forest, nursery, or greenhouse.
Appurtenance
means any equipment or device which is used for the purpose of transferring a pesticide from a stationary pesticide container or to any refillable container, including but not limited to, hoses, fittings, plumbing, valves, gauges, pumps and metering devices.
Capacity
means, as applied to containers, the rated capacity of the container.
Container
means any package, can, bottle, bag, barrel, drum, tank, or other containing-device (excluding any application tanks) used to enclose a pesticide. Containers that are used to sell or distribute a pesticide product and that also function in applying the product (such as spray bottles, aerosol cans and containers that become part of a direct injection system) are considered to be containers for the purposes of this part.
Containment pad
means any structure that is designed and constructed to intercept and contain pesticides, rinsates, and equipment wash water at a pesticide dispensing area.
Containment structure
means either a secondary containment unit or a containment pad.
Custom blending
means the service of mixing pesticides to a customer's specifications, usually a pesticide(s)-fertilizer(s), pesticide-pesticide, or a pesticide-animal feed mixture, when:
(1) The blend is prepared to the order of the customer and is not held in inventory by the blender;
(2) The blend is to be used on the customer's property (including leased or rented property);
(3) The pesticide(s) used in the blend bears end-use labeling directions which do not prohibit use of the product in such a blend;
(4) The blend is prepared from registered pesticides; and
(5) The blend is delivered to the end-user along with a copy of the end-use labeling of each pesticide used in the blend and a statement specifying the composition of the mixture.
Dilutable
means that the pesticide product's labeling allows or requires the pesticide product to be mixed with a liquid diluent prior to application or use.
Dry pesticide
means any pesticide that is in solid form and that has not been combined with liquids; this includes formulations such as dusts, wettable powders, dry flowables, water-soluble powders, granules, and dry baits.
Establishment
means any site where a pesticidal product, active ingredient, or device is produced, regardless of whether such site is independently owned or operated, and regardless of whether such site is domestic and producing a pesticidal product for export only, or whether the site is foreign and producing any pesticidal product for import into the United States.
Facility
means all buildings, equipment, structures, and other stationary items which are located on a single site or on contiguous or adjacent sites and which are owned or operated by the same person (or by any person who controls, who is controlled by, or who is under common control with such person).
Nonrefillable container
means a container that is not a refillable container and that is designed and constructed for one-time use and is not intended to be filled again with a pesticide for sale or distribution. Reconditioned containers are considered to be nonrefillable containers.
One-way valve
means a valve that is designed and constructed to allow virtually unrestricted flow in one direction and no flow in the opposite direction, thus allowing the withdrawal of material from, but not the introduction of material into, a container.
Operator
means any person in control of, or having responsibility for, the daily operation of a facility at which a containment structure is located.
Owner
means any person who owns a facility at which a containment structure is required.
Pesticide compatible as applied to containers
means that the container construction materials will not chemically react with the formulation. A container is not compatible with the formulation if, for example, the formulation:
(1) Is corrosive to the container;
(2) Causes softening, premature aging, or embrittlement of the container;
(3) Otherwise causes the container to weaken or to create the risk of discharge;
(4) Reacts in a significant chemical, electrolytic, or galvanic manner with the container, or
(5) Interacts in a way, such as the active ingredient permeating the container wall, that would cause the formulation to differ from its composition as described in the statement required in connection with its registration under FIFRA section 3.
Pesticide compatible as applied to containment
means that the containment construction materials are able to withstand anticipated exposure to stored or transferred substances without losing the capability to provide the required containment of the same or other substances within the containment area.
Pesticide dispensing area
means an area in which pesticide is transferred out of or into a container.
Portable pesticide container
means a refillable container that is not a stationary pesticide container.
Produce
means to manufacture, prepare, propagate, compound, or process any pesticide, including any pesticide produced pursuant to section 5 of the
Act, and any active ingredient or device, or to package, repackage, label, relabel, or otherwise change the container of any pesticide or device.
Producer
means any person, as defined by the Act, who produces any pesticide, active ingredient, or device (including packaging, repackaging, labeling and relabeling).
Refillable container
means a container that is intended to be filled with pesticide more than once for sale or distribution.
Refiller
means a person who engages in the activity of repackaging pesticide product into refillable containers. This could include a registrant or a person operating under contract to a registrant.
Refilling establishment
means an establishment where the activity of repackaging pesticide product into refillable containers occurs.
Repackage
means, for the purposes of this part, to transfer a pesticide formulation from one container to another without a change in the composition of the formulation, the labeling content, or the product's EPA registration number, for sale or distribution.
Rinsate
means the liquid resulting from the rinsing of the interior of any equipment or container that has come in direct contact with any pesticide.
Runoff
means surface water leaving the target site.
Secondary containment unit
means any structure, including rigid diking, that is designed and constructed to intercept and contain pesticide spills and leaks and to prevent runoff and leaching from stationary pesticide containers.
Stationary pesticide container
means a refillable container that is fixed at a single facility or establishment or, if not fixed, remains at the facility or establishment for at least 30 consecutive days, and that holds pesticide during the entire time.
Suspension concentrate
means a stable suspension of solid particulate active ingredients in a liquid intended for dilution with water before use.
Tamper-evident device

The requirements in this paragraph apply to the pesticide product as it is packaged for transportation in commerce.
(b)
What DOT standards do my nonrefillable containers have to meet under this part if my pesticide product is a DOT hazardous material?
(1) If your pesticide product meets the definition of a hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8, the DOT requires your pesticide product to be packaged according to 49 CFR parts 171-180 or, if subject to a special permit, according to the applicable requirements of 49 CFR part 107 subpart B.
(2) For the purposes of these regulations, a pesticide product that meets the definition of a hazardous material in 49 CFR 171.8 must be packaged in a nonrefillable container that, if portable, is designed, constructed, and marked to comply with the requirements of 49 CFR parts 171-180 or, if subject to a special permit, according to the applicable requirements of 49 CFR part 107 subpart B. The requirements in this paragraph apply to the pesticide product as it is packaged for transportation in commerce.
(c)
What will EPA do if DOT proposes to change any of the cross-referenced regulations?
If the DOT proposes to change any of the regulations that are incorporated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, EPA will provide notice of the proposed changes and an opportunity to comment in the
Federal Register.
Following notice and comment, EPA will take final action regarding whether or not to revise its rules, and the extent to which any such revision will correspond with revised DOT regulations.
(d)
What standards for closures do my nonrefillable containers have to meet?
If your nonrefillable container is a rigid container with a capacity equal to or greater than 3.0 liters (0.79 gallons), if the container is not an aerosol container or a pressurized container, and if the container is used to distribute or sell a liquid agricultural pesticide, each nonrefillable container must have at least one of the following standard closures:
(1) Bung, 2 inch pipe size (2.375 inches in diameter), external threading, 11.5
threads per inch, National Pipe Straight (NPS) standard.
(2) Bung, 2 inch pipe size (2.375 inches in diameter), external threading, 5 threads per inch, buttress threads.
(3) Screw cap, 63 millimeters, at least one thread revolution at 6 threads per inch.
(4) Screw cap, 38 millimeters, at least one thread revolution at 6 threads per inch. The cap may fit on a separate rigid spout or on a flexible pull-out plastic spout.
(e)
What standards for dispensing do my nonrefillable containers have to meet?
If your nonrefillable container has a capacity of 5 gallons (18.9 liters) or less, if the container is not an aerosol container, a pressurized container, or a spray bottle, and if the container holds a liquid pesticide, your nonrefillable container must do both of the following:
(1) Allow the contents of the nonrefillable container to pour in a continuous, coherent stream.
(2) Allow the contents of the nonrefillable container to be poured with a minimum amount of dripping down the outside of the container.
(f)
What standards for residue removal do my nonrefillable containers have to meet?
Each nonrefillable container and pesticide formulation combination must meet the applicable residue removal standard of this section.
(1) If the nonrefillable container is rigid and has a capacity less than or equal to 5 gallons (18.9 liters) for liquid formulations or 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms) for solid formulations and if the pesticide product's labeling allows or requires the pesticide product to be mixed with a liquid diluent prior to application (that is, if the pesticide is dilutable), each container/formulation combination must be capable of attaining at least 99.99 percent removal of each active ingredient when tested using the EPA test procedure “Rinsing Procedures for Dilutable Pesticide Products in Rigid Containers.”
(2) The test must be conducted only if the pesticide product is a suspension concentrate or if EPA specifically requests the records on a case by case basis.
(3) For the rigid container/dilutable product standard in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, percent removal represents the percent of the original concentration of the active ingredient in the pesticide product when compared to the concentration of that active ingredient in the fourth rinse. Percent removal is calculated by the formula:
percent removal = [1.0 - RR] x 100.0, where
RR = rinsate ratio = Active ingredient concentration in fourth rinsate/Original concentration of active ingredient in the product
(g)
Can I obtain a waiver from or a modification to any of the nonrefillable container standards?
Yes, it is possible for you to obtain a waiver from or a modification to the nonrefillable container standards, as follows:
(1) EPA may waive or modify the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section regarding the DOT standards for pesticide products that are not DOT hazardous materials if EPA determines that an alternative (partial or modified) set of standards or pre-existing requirements achieves a level of safety that is at least equal to that specified in the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) EPA may waive or modify the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section regarding the DOT standards for pesticide products that are DOT hazardous materials if EPA determines that an alternative (partial or modified) set of standards or pre-existing requirements achieves a level of safety that is at least equal to that specified in the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. EPA will modify or waive the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section only after consulting with DOT to ensure consistency with DOT regulations and exemptions.
(3) EPA may approve a non-standard closure (that is, a closure not listed in paragraph (d) of this section) if EPA determines that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) The non-standard closure is necessary for the proper mixing, loading, or application of the pesticide product.
(ii) The non-standard closure offers exposure protection to handlers during mixing and loading that is the same or greater than that provided by the standard closures.

How must I clean a refillable container that has a broken (non-intact) tamper-evident device or one-way valve?
As
required in paragraph (g) of this section, you must clean each refillable container that has a tamper-evident device or one-way valve that is not intact by conducting the pesticide product's refilling residue removal procedure before repackaging the pesticide product into the refillable container. In addition, other procedures may be necessary to assure that product integrity is maintained in such cases.
(i)
How must I label refillable containers?
Before distributing or selling a pesticide product in a refillable container, you must ensure that the label of the pesticide product is securely attached to the refillable container such that the label can reasonably be expected to remain affixed during the foreseeable conditions and period of use. The label and labeling must comply in all respects with the requirements of part 156 of this chapter. In particular, you must ensure that the net contents statement and EPA establishment number appear on the label.
(j)
What recordkeeping must I do?
You must maintain all of the records listed in this section in addition to the applicable records identified in parts 167 and 169 of this chapter. You must furnish these records for inspection and copying upon request by an employee of EPA or any entity designated by EPA, such as a State, another political subdivision or a Tribe.
(1) For each pesticide product distributed or sold in refillable containers, all of the following records must be maintained for the current operating year and for 3 years after that:
(i) The written contract from the pesticide product's registrant for the pesticide product.
(ii) The written refilling residue removal procedure for the pesticide product.
(iii) The written description of acceptable containers for the pesticide product.
(2) Each time you repackage a pesticide product into a refillable container and distribute or sell the product, the following records must be generated and maintained for at least 3 years after the date of repackaging:
(i) The EPA registration number of the pesticide product distributed or sold in the refillable container.

# Subpart E—Standards for Pesticide Containment Structures
§ 165.80
General provisions.
(a)
What is the purpose of the regulations in this subpart?
The purpose of the containment regulations in this subpart is to protect human health and the environment from exposure to agricultural pesticides which may spill or leak from stationary pesticide containers. This protection is achieved by the construction of secondary containment units or pads at certain facilities handling agricultural pesticides. These regulations will also reduce waste generation associated with:
(1) Storage and handling of large quantities of pesticide products.
(2) Pesticide dispensing and container-refilling operations.
(b)
Do I have to comply with the regulations in this subpart?
You must comply with the regulations in this subpart if you are an owner or operator of one of the following businesses and if you also have a stationary pesticide container or a pesticide dispensing (including container refilling) area:
(1) Refilling establishments who repackage agricultural pesticides and whose principal business is retail sale (
i.e.
, more than 50% of total annual revenue comes from retail operations).
(2) Custom blenders of agricultural pesticides.
(3) Businesses which apply an agricultural pesticide for compensation (other than trading of personal services between agricultural producers).
(c)
When do I have to comply?
You must comply with all applicable containment regulations for new and existing structures as of August 17, 2009.
[71 FR 47422, Aug. 16, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 64227, Oct. 29, 2008]
§ 165.81
Scope of stationary pesticide containers included.
(a)
What is a stationary pesticide container?
A stationary pesticide container is a refillable container that is fixed at a single facility or establishment, or, if not fixed, remains at the facility or establishment for at least 30 consecutive days, and that holds pesticide during the entire time.
(b)
What stationary pesticide containers are subject to the regulations in this subpart?
Stationary pesticide containers designed to hold undivided quantities of agricultural pesticides equal to or greater than 500 gallons (1,890 liters) of liquid pesticide or equal to or greater than 4,000 pounds (1,818 kilograms) of dry pesticide are subject to the regulations in this subpart and must have a secondary containment unit that complies with the provisions of this subpart unless any of the following conditions exists:
(1) The container is empty, that is, all pesticide that can be removed by methods such as draining, pumping or aspirating has been removed (whether or not the container has been rinsed or washed).
(2) The container holds only pesticide rinsates or wash waters, and is labeled accordingly.
(3) The container holds only pesticides which would be gaseous when released at atmospheric temperature and pressure.
(4) The container is dedicated to non-pesticide use, and is labeled accordingly.
§ 165.82
Scope of pesticide dispensing areas included.

What pesticide dispensing areas are subject to the regulations in this subpart?
A pesticide dispensing area is subject to the containment regulations in this subpart and must have a containment pad that complies with the requirements of this subpart if any of the following activities occur:
(1) Refillable containers of agricultural pesticide are emptied, cleaned or rinsed.
(2) Agricultural pesticides are dispensed from a stationary pesticide container designed to hold undivided quantities of agricultural pesticides equal to or greater than 500 gallons (1,890 liters) of liquid pesticide or equal to or greater than 4,000 pounds (1,818 kilograms) of dry pesticide for any purpose, including refilling or emptying for cleaning. This applies when pesticide is dispensed from the container into any vessel, including, but not limited to:
(i) Refillable containers;
(ii) Service containers;
(iii) Transport vehicles;
(iv) Application equipment.
(3) Agricultural pesticides are dispensed from a transport vehicle for purposes of filling a refillable container.
(4) Agricultural pesticides are dispensed from any other container for the purpose of refilling a refillable container for sale or distribution. Containment requirements do not apply if the agricultural pesticide is dispensed from such a container for use, application or purposes other than refilling for sale or distribution.
(b)
What pesticide dispensing areas are exempt from the regulations in this subpart?
A pesticide dispensing area is exempt from the regulations in this subpart if any of the following conditions exist:
(1) The only pesticides in the dispensing area would be gaseous when released at atmospheric temperature and pressure.
(2) The only pesticide containers refilled or emptied within the dispensing area are stationary pesticide containers which are already protected by a secondary containment unit that complies with the provisions of this subpart.
(3) The pesticide dispensing area is used solely for dispensing pesticide from a rail car which does not remain at a facility long enough to meet the definition of a stationary pesticide container; that is, 30 days.
§ 165.83

The letter must be signed by the designated State Lead Agency.
(c)
How will EPA notify the State if its request is granted?
EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs will review the State's correspondence and determine whether the State program is adequate to provide environmental protection equivalent to or more protective than these Federal regulations for new and existing containment structures. EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs will inform the State of its determination through a letter authorizing or declining to authorize the State to continue implementing its containment regulations and will detail any reasons for declining authorization.
(d)
How must a State inform EPA of revisions to its containment regulations?
Any state that has received authorization to continue implementing its state containment regulations must inform EPA by letter signed by the designated State Lead Agency within 6 months of any revision to the State's containment regulations. EPA will inform the state by letter if it determines that the State's containment regulations are no longer adequate based on the revisions. The State's containment regulations will remain in effect, unless and until EPA sends the state a letter making this determination.
