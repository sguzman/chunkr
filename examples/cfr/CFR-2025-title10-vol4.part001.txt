—(1) Disposition of application. The petitioner shall be notified in writing as soon as practicable of the disposition of each petition for waiver. DOE shall issue a decision on the petition as soon as is practicable following receipt and review of the Petition for Waiver and other applicable documents, including, but not limited to, comments and rebuttal statements.
(2) Criteria for granting. DOE will grant a waiver from the test procedure requirements if DOE determines either that the basic model(s) for which the waiver was requested contains a design characteristic that prevents testing of the basic model according to the prescribed test procedures, or that the prescribed test procedures evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy or water consumption characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. DOE may grant a waiver subject to conditions, which may include adherence to alternate test procedures specified by DOE. DOE will promptly publish in the
Federal Register
notice of each waiver granted or denied, and any limiting conditions of each waiver granted.
(g)
Extension to additional basic models.
A petitioner may request that DOE extend the scope of a waiver or an interim waiver to include additional basic models employing the same technology as the basic model(s) set forth in the original petition. The petition for extension must identify the particular basic model(s) for which a waiver extension is requested, each brand name under which the identified basic model(s) will be distributed in commerce, and documentation supporting the claim that the additional basic models employ the same technology as the basic model(s) set forth in the original petition. DOE will publish any such extension in the
Federal Register
.
(h)
Duration.
(1) Within one year of issuance of an interim waiver, DOE will either:
(i) Publish in the
Federal Register
a final determination on the petition for waiver; or
(ii) Publish in the
Federal Register
a new or amended test procedure that addresses the issues presented in the waiver.
(2) When DOE publishes a decision and order on a petition for waiver in the
Federal Register
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the interim waiver will terminate upon the date specified in the decision and order, in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.
(3) When DOE amends the test procedure to address the issues presented in a waiver, the waiver or interim waiver will automatically terminate on the date on which use of that test procedure is required to demonstrate compliance.
(4) When DOE publishes a decision and order in the
Federal Register
to modify a waiver pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section, the existing waiver will terminate upon the date specified in the decision and order, in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.
(i)
Compliance certification and representations.
(1) If the interim waiver test procedure methodology is different than the decision and order test procedure methodology, certification reports to DOE required under 10 CFR 429.12 and any representations must be based on either of the two methodologies until 180-360 days after the publication date of the decision and order, as specified by DOE in the decision and order. Thereafter, certification reports and any representations must be based on the decision and order test procedure methodology, unless otherwise
specified by DOE. Once a manufacturer uses the decision and order test procedure methodology in a certification report or any representation, all subsequent certification reports and any representations must be made using the decision and order test procedure methodology while the waiver is valid.
(2) When DOE publishes a new or amended test procedure, certification reports to DOE required under 10 CFR 429.12 and any representations must be based on the testing methodology of an applicable waiver or interim waiver, or the new or amended test procedure until the date on which use of such test procedure is required to demonstrate compliance, unless otherwise specified by DOE in the test procedure final rule. Thereafter, certification reports and any representations must be based on the test procedure final rule methodology. Once a manufacturer uses the test procedure final rule methodology in a certification report or any representation, all subsequent certification reports and any representations must be made using the test procedure final rule methodology.
(3) If DOE publishes a decision and order modifying an existing waiver, certification reports to DOE required under 10 CFR 429.12 and any representations must be based on either of the two methodologies until 180-360 days after the publication date of the decision and order modifying the waiver, as specified by DOE in the decision and order. Thereafter, certification reports and any representations must be based on the modified test procedure methodology unless otherwise specified by DOE. Once a manufacturer uses the modified test procedure methodology in a certification report or any representation, all subsequent certification reports and any representations must be made using the modified test procedure methodology while the modified waiver is valid.
(j)
Petition for waiver required of other manufactures.
Any manufacturer of a basic model employing a technology or characteristic for which a waiver was granted for another basic model and that results in the need for a waiver (as specified by DOE in a published decision and order in the
Federal Register
) must petition for and be granted a waiver for that basic model. Manufacturers may also submit a request for interim waiver pursuant to the requirements of this section.
(k)
Rescission or modification.
(1) DOE may rescind or modify a waiver or interim waiver at any time upon DOE's determination that the factual basis underlying the petition for waiver or interim waiver is incorrect, upon a determination that the results from the alternate test procedure are unrepresentative of the basic model(s)' true energy consumption characteristics, or for other appropriate reason. Waivers and interim waivers are conditioned upon the validity of statements, representations, and documents provided by the requestor; any evidence that the original grant of a waiver or interim waiver was based upon inaccurate information will weigh against continuation of the waiver. DOE's decision will specify the basis for its determination and, in the case of a modification, will also specify the change to the authorized test procedure.
(2) A person may request that DOE rescind or modify a waiver or interim waiver issued to that person if the person discovers an error in the information provided to DOE as part of its petition, determines that the waiver is no longer needed, or for other appropriate reasons. In a request for rescission, the requestor must provide a statement explaining why it is requesting rescission. In a request for modification, the requestor must explain the need for modification to the authorized test procedure and detail the modifications needed and the corresponding impact on measured energy consumption.
(3) DOE will publish a proposed rescission or modification (DOE-initiated or at the request of the original requestor) in the
Federal Register
for public comment. A requestor may, within 10 working days of the close of the comment period specified in the proposed rescission or modification published in the
Federal Register,
submit a rebuttal statement to DOE. A requestor may rebut more than one comment in a single rebuttal statement.
(4) DOE will publish its decision in the
Federal Register.
DOE's determination will be based on relevant information contained in the record and any comments received.
(5) After the effective date of a rescission, any basic model(s) previously subject to a waiver must be tested and certified using the applicable DOE test procedure in 10 CFR part 431.
(l)
Revision of regulation.
As soon as practicable after the granting of any waiver, DOE will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend its regulations so as to eliminate any need for the continuation of such waiver. As soon thereafter as practicable, DOE will publish in the
Federal Register
a final rule.
(m) To exhaust administrative remedies, any person aggrieved by an action under this section must file an appeal with the DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals as provided in 10 CFR part 1003, subpart C.

# Subpart W—Petitions To Exempt State Regulation From Preemption; Petitions To Withdraw Exemption of State Regulation

# Source:
69 FR 61941, Oct. 21, 2004, unless otherwise noted. Redesignated at 70 FR 60417, Oct. 18, 2005.
§ 431.421
Purpose and scope.
(a) The regulations in this subpart prescribe the procedures to be followed in connection with petitions requesting a rule that a State regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard or other requirement respecting energy use or energy efficiency of a type (or class) of covered equipment not be preempted.
(b) The regulations in this subpart also prescribe the procedures to be followed in connection with petitions to withdraw a rule exempting a State regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard or other requirement respecting energy use or energy efficiency of a type (or class) of covered equipment.
§ 431.422
Prescriptions of a rule.
(a)
Criteria for exemption from preemption.
Upon petition by a State which has prescribed an energy conservation standard or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal energy conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary
shall prescribe a rule that such standard not be preempted if he/she determines that the State has established by a preponderance of evidence that such requirement is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energy interests. For the purposes of this regulation, the term “unusual and compelling State or local energy interests” means interests which are substantially different in nature or magnitude from those prevailing in the U.S. generally, and are such that when evaluated within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy savings resulting from the State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of alternative approaches to energy savings or production, including reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in efficiency of all equipment subject to the State regulation. The Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the State's regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, distribution, sale or servicing of the covered equipment on a national basis. In determining whether to make such a finding, the Secretary shall evaluate all relevant factors including: The extent to which the State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of manufacturers, distributors, and others; the extent to which the State regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered equipment in the State; the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden to manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered equipment type (or class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation would result in a reduction in the current models, or in the projected availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and within the U.S., or in the current or projected sales volume of the covered equipment type (or class) in the State and the U.S.; and the extent to which the State regulation is likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State commercial and industrial equipment efficiency requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements would have. The Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he/she finds that such a rule will result in the unavailability in the State of any covered equipment (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for other classes (or types).
(1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption. A petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption shall include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition for a rule and correspondence relating to such petition shall be available for public review except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004.
(i) The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner;
(ii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule exempting such standard is sought;
(iii) A copy of the State's energy plan and forecast;
(iv) Specification of each type or class of covered equipment for which a rule exempting a standard is sought;
(v) Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the petitioner; and
(vi) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
(b)
Criteria for exemption from preemption when energy emergency conditions exist within State.
Upon petition by a State which has prescribed an energy conservation standard or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal energy conservation standard is applicable,
the Secretary may prescribe a rule, effective upon publication in the
Federal Register,
that such regulation not be preempted if he determines that in addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Section the State has established that: an energy emergency condition exists within the State that imperils the health, safety, and welfare of its residents because of the inability of the State or utilities within the State to provide adequate quantities of gas or electric energy to its residents at less than prohibitive costs; and cannot be substantially alleviated by the importation of energy or the use of interconnection agreements; and the State regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.
(1) Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption when energy emergency conditions exist within a State. A petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption when energy emergency conditions exist within a State shall include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition shall also include the information prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section, and shall be available for public review except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
(i) A description of the energy emergency condition which exists within the State, including causes and impacts.
(ii) A description of emergency response actions taken by the State and utilities within the State to alleviate the emergency condition;
(iii) An analysis of why the emergency condition cannot be alleviated substantially by importation of energy or the use of interconnection agreements;
(iv) An analysis of how the State standard can alleviate substantially such emergency condition.
(c)
Criteria for withdrawal of a rule exempting a State standard.
Any person subject to a State standard which, by rule, has been exempted from Federal preemption and which prescribes an energy conservation standard or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment, when the Federal energy conservation standard for such equipment subsequently is amended, may petition the Secretary requesting that the exemption rule be withdrawn. The Secretary shall consider such petition in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to demonstrate that the exemption rule received by the State should be withdrawn as a result of the amendment to the Federal standard. The Secretary shall withdraw such rule if he determines that the petitioner has shown the rule should be withdrawn.
(1) Requirements of petition to withdraw a rule exempting a State standard. A petition for a rule to withdraw a rule exempting a State standard shall include the information prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vii) of this section, and shall be available for public review, except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
(i) The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner;
(ii) A statement of the interest of the petitioner for which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;
(iii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;
(iv) Specification of each type or class of covered equipment for which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;
(v) A discussion of the factors contained in paragraph (a) of this section;
(vi) Such other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the petitioner; and
(vii) Such other information as the Secretary may require.

§ 431.442
Definitions.
The following definitions are applicable to this subpart:
Alternative efficiency determination method,
or AEDM, means, with respect to a small electric motor, a method of calculating the total power loss and average full-load efficiency.
Average full-load efficiency
means the arithmetic mean of the full-load efficiencies of a population of small electric motors of duplicate design, where the full-load efficiency of each motor in the population is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the motor's useful power output to its total power input when the motor is operated at its full rated load, rated voltage, and rated frequency.
Basic model
means, with respect to a small electric motor, all units of a given type of small electric motor (or class thereof) manufactured by a single manufacturer, and which have the same rating, have electrical characteristics that are essentially identical, and do not have any differing physical or functional characteristics that affect energy consumption or efficiency. For the purpose of this definition, “rating” means a combination of the small electric motor's group (i.e., capacitor-start, capacitor-run; capacitor-start, induction-run; or polyphase), horsepower rating (or standard kilowatt equivalent), and number of poles with respect to which § 431.446 prescribes nominal full load efficiency standards.
Breakdown torque
means the maximum torque that the motor will develop with rated voltage and frequency applied without an abrupt drop in speed. The breakdown torque is the local maximum of the torque-speed plot of the motor, closest to the synchronous speed of the motor, determined in accordance with NEMA MG 1-2016 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.443).
CSA
means Canadian Standards Association.
DOE
or
the Department
means the U.S. Department of Energy.
EPCA
means the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6291-6317.
IEC
means International Electrotechnical Commission.
IEEE
means Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.
NEMA
means National Electrical Manufacturers Association.
Rated frequency
means 60 hertz.
Rated load
(or
full load, full rated load,
or
rated full load
) means the rated output power of a small electric motor.
Rated output power
means the mechanical output power that corresponds to the small electric motor's breakdown torque as specified in NEMA MG 1-2016 Table 10-5 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.443) for single-phase motors or 140 percent of the breakdown torque values specified in NEMA MG 1-2016 Table 10-5 for polyphase motors. For purposes of this definition, NEMA MG 1-2016 Table 10-5 is applied regardless of whether elements of NEMA MG 1-2016 Table 10-5 are identified as for small or medium motors.
Rated voltage
means the input voltage of a small electric motor used when making representations of the performance characteristics of a given small
electric motor and selected by the motor's manufacturer to be used for testing the motor's efficiency.
Small electric motor
means a NEMA general purpose alternating current single-speed induction motor, built in a two-digit frame number series in accordance with NEMA Standards Publication MG1-1987, including IEC metric equivalent motors.

§ 431.445
Determination of small electric motor efficiency.
(a)
Scope.
When a party determines the energy efficiency of a small electric motor to comply with an obligation imposed on it by or pursuant to Part A-1 of Title III of EPCA, 42 U.S.C. 6311-6317, this section applies.
(b)
Provisions applicable to all small electric motors
—(1)
General requirements.
The average full-load efficiency of each basic model of small electric motor
must be determined either by testing in accordance with § 431.444 of this subpart, or by application of an alternative efficiency determination method (AEDM) that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, provided, however, that an AEDM may be used to determine the average full-load efficiency of one or more of a manufacturer's basic models only if the average full-load efficiency of at least five of its other basic models is determined through testing.
(2)
Alternative efficiency determination method.
An AEDM applied to a basic model must be:
(i) Derived from a mathematical model that represents the mechanical and electrical characteristics of that basic model, and
(ii) Based on engineering or statistical analysis, computer simulation or modeling, or other analytic evaluation of performance data.
(3)
Substantiation of an alternative efficiency determination method.
Before an AEDM is used, its accuracy and reliability must be substantiated as follows:
(i) The AEDM must be applied to at least five basic models that have been tested in accordance with § 431.444; and
(ii) The predicted total power loss for each such basic model, calculated by applying the AEDM, must be within plus or minus 10 percent of the mean total power loss determined from the testing of that basic model.
(4)
Subsequent verification of an AEDM.
(i) Each manufacturer that has used an AEDM under this section shall have available for inspection by the Department of Energy records showing the method or methods used; the mathematical model, the engineering or statistical analysis, computer simulation or modeling, and other analytic evaluation of performance data on which the AEDM is based; complete test data, product information, and related information that the manufacturer has generated or acquired pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and the calculations used to determine the efficiency and total power losses of each basic model to which the AEDM was applied.
(ii) If requested by the Department, the manufacturer shall conduct simulations to predict the performance of particular basic models of small electric motors specified by the Department, analyses of previous simulations conducted by the manufacturer, sample testing of basic models selected by the Department, or a combination of the foregoing.
(5)
Use of a certification program.
(i) A manufacturer may use a certification program, that DOE has classified as nationally recognized under § 431.447, to certify the average full-load efficiency of a basic model of small electric motor, and issue a certificate of conformity for the small electric motor.
(ii) For each basic model for which a certification program is not used as described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, any testing of a motor to determine its energy efficiency must be carried out in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Additional testing requirements applicable when a certification program is not used
—(1)
Selection of basic models for testing.
(i) Basic models must be selected for testing in accordance with the following criteria:
(A) Two of the basic models must be among the five basic models that have the highest unit volumes of production by the manufacturer in the prior year, or during the prior 12 calendar month period beginning in 2015, whichever is later, and comply with the standards set forth in § 431.446;
(B) The basic models should be of different horsepowers without duplication;
(C) At least one basic model should be selected from each of the frame number series for which the manufacturer is seeking compliance; and
(D) Each basic model should have the lowest average full-load efficiency among the basic models with the same rating (“rating” as used here has the same meaning as it has in the definition of “basic model”).
(ii) In any instance where it is impossible for a manufacturer to select basic models for testing in accordance with all of these criteria, the criteria shall be given priority in the order in which they are listed. Within the limits imposed by the criteria, basic models shall be selected randomly.
(2)
Selection of units for testing within a basic model.
For each basic model selected for testing,
1
a sample of units shall be selected at random and tested. The sample shall be comprised of production units of the basic model, or units that are representative of such production units. The sample size shall be no fewer than five units, except when fewer than five units of a basic model would be produced over a reasonable period of time (approximately 180 days). In such cases, each unit produced shall be tested.
1
Components of similar design may be substituted without requiring additional testing if the represented measures of energy consumption continue to satisfy the applicable sampling provision.
(3)
Applying results of testing.
When applying the test results to determine whether a motor complies with the required average efficiency level:
The average full-load efficiency of the sample, X
which is defined by
ER04MY12.000
where X
i
is the measured full-load efficiency of unit i and n is the number of units tested, shall satisfy the condition:
ER04MY12.001
where RE is the required average full-load efficiency.

General.
To determine the constant load pump energy index (PEI
CL
) for bare pumps and pumps sold with electric motors or the variable load pump energy index (PEI
VL
) for pumps sold with electric motors and continuous or non-continuous controls, perform testing in accordance with HI 40.6-2021, except section 40.6.5.3, “Test report”, including the applicable provisions of HI 9.6.1-2017, HI 9.6.6-2016, HI 9.8-2018, HI 14.1-14.2-2019, the HI Engineering Data Book, ASME MFC-3M-2004, ASME MFC-5M-1985, ASME MFC-8M-2001, ASME MFC-12M-2006, ASME MFC-16-2014, ASME MFC-22-2007, AWWA E103-2015, CSA C390-10, IEEE 112-2017, IEEE 114-2010-A, ISO 1438:2017, ISO 2186:2007, ISO 2715:2017, ISO 3354:2008, ISO 3966:2020, ISO 5167-1:2003, ISO 5198:1987, ISO 6416:2017, and ISO 20456:2017, as referenced in HI 40.6, with the modifications and additions as noted throughout the provisions below. Where HI 40.6-2021 refers to “pump,” the term refers to the “bare pump,” as defined in § 431.462. Also, for the purposes of applying this appendix, the term “volume per unit time,” as defined in section 40.6.2, “Terms and definitions,” of HI 40.6-2021 shall be deemed to be synonymous with the term “flow rate” used throughout that standard and this appendix. In addition, the specifications in section 40.6.4.1 of HI 40.6-2021, “Vertically suspended pumps,” do not apply
to ST pumps and the performance of ST bare pumps considers bowl performance only. However, the specifications in the first paragraph of section 40.6.4.1 of HI 40.6-2021 (including the applicable provisions of HI 14.1-14.2-2019, the HI Engineering Data Book, and AWWA E103-2015, as referenced in section 40.6.4.1 of HI 40.6), “Vertically suspended pumps,” do apply to VT pumps and the performance of VT bare pumps considers bowl performance only.

For ST pumps, head measurements must be based on the bowl assembly total head as described in section A.5 of 40.6-2021, including the applicable provisions of the HI Engineering Data Book and AWWA E103-2015 as referenced in ins section A.5 of HI 40.6-2021, and the pump power input or driver power input, as applicable, must be based on the measured input power to the driver or bare pump, respectively; section 40.6.4.1, “Vertically suspended pumps,” does not apply to ST pumps.
C.1 Nominal Speed of Rotation. Determine the nominal speed of rotation based on the range of speeds of rotation at which the pump is designed to operate, in accordance with sections I.C.1.1, I.C.1.2, and I.C.1.3 of this appendix, as applicable. When determining the range of speeds at which the pump is designed to operate, DOE will refer to published data, marketing literature, and other publicly-available information about the pump model and motor, as applicable.
C.1.1 For pumps sold without motors, select the nominal speed of rotation based on the speed for which the pump is designed.
C.1.1.1 For bare pumps designed for speeds of rotation including 2,880 to 4,320 revolutions per minute (rpm), the nominal speed of rotation shall be 3,600 rpm.
C.1.1.2 For bare pumps designed for speeds of rotation including 1,440 to 2,160 rpm, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 1,800 rpm.
C.1.1.3 For bare pumps designed for speeds of rotation including 960 to 1,439 rpm, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 1,200 rpm.
C.1.2 For pumps sold with induction motors, select the appropriate nominal speed of rotation.
C.1.2.1 For pumps sold with 6-pole induction motors, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 1,200 rpm.
C.1.2.2 For pumps sold with 4-pole induction motors, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 1,800 rpm.
C.1.2.3 For pumps sold with 2-pole induction motors, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 3,600 rpm.
C.1.3 For pumps sold with non-induction motors, select the appropriate nominal speed of rotation.

C.1.3.3 Where the operating range of the pump and motor includes speeds of rotation between 960 and 1,439, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 1,200 rpm.
C.2 Multi-Stage Pumps. Perform testing on the pump with three stages for RSH and RSV pumps, and nine stages for ST and VT pumps. If the basic model of pump being tested is only available with fewer than the required number of stages, test the pump with the maximum number of stages with which the basic model is distributed in commerce in the United States. If the basic model of pump being tested is only available with greater than the required number of stages, test the pump with the lowest number of stages with which the basic model is distributed in commerce in the United States. If the basic model of pump being tested is available with both fewer and greater than the required number of stages, but not the required number of stages, test the pump with the number of stages closest to the required number of stages. If both the next lower and next higher number of stages are equivalently close to the required number of stages, test the pump with the next higher number of stages.
C.3 Twin-Head Pumps. For twin-head pumps, perform testing on an equivalent single impeller IL or SVIL pump as applicable, constructed by incorporating one of the driver and impeller assemblies of the twin-head pump being rated into an adequate IL-style or SVIL-style, single impeller volute and casing. An adequate IL-style or SVIL-style, single impeller volute and casing means a volute and casing for which any physical and functional characteristics that affect energy consumption and energy efficiency are the same as their corresponding characteristics for a single impeller in the twin-head pump volute and casing.
D.
Data Collection and Analysis.
D.1 Damping Devices. Use of damping devices, as described in section 40.6.3.2.2 of HI 40.6-2021, are only permitted to integrate up to the data collection interval used during testing.
D.2 Stabilization. Record data at any tested load point only under stabilized conditions, as defined in HI 40.6-2021 section 40.6.5.5.1, including the applicable provisions of HI 9.6.1-2017 as referenced in section 40.6.5.5.1 of HI 40.6, where a minimum of two measurements are used to determine stabilization.
D.3 Calculations and Rounding. Normalize all measured data to the nominal speed of rotation of 3,600 or 1,800 or 1,200 rpm based on the nominal speed of rotation selected for the pump in section I.C.1 of this appendix, in accordance with the procedures specified in section 40.6.6.1.1 of HI 40.6-2021. Except for the “expected BEP flow rate,” all terms and quantities refer to values determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this appendix for the rated pump. Perform all calculations using raw measured values without rounding. Round PER
CL
and PER
VL
to three significant digits, and round PEI
CL
, and PEI
VL
values, as applicable, to the hundredths place (
i.e.,
0.01).
D.4 Pumps with BEP at Run Out. Test pumps for which the expected BEP corresponds to a volume rate of flow that is within 20 percent of the expected maximum flow rate at which the pump is designed to operate continuously or safely (
i.e.,
pumps with BEP at run-out) in accordance with the test procedure specified in this appendix, but with the following exceptions:
D.4.1 Use the following seven flow points—40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent of the expected maximum flow rate for determination of BEP in sections III.D, IV.D, V.D, VI.D, and VII.D of this appendix instead of the flow points specified in those sections.
D.4.2 Use flow points of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent of the expected maximum flow rate of the pump to determine pump power input or driver power input instead of the flow points of 60, 75, 90, 100, 110, and 120 percent of the expected BEP flow rate specified in sections III.E.1.1, IV.E.1, V.E.1.1, VI.E.1, and VII.E.1.1 of this appendix.
D.4.3 To determine PER
CL
in sections III.E, IV.E, and V.E and to determine PER
STD
in section II.B, use load points of 65, 90, and 100 percent of the BEP flow rate determined with the modified flow points specified in this section I.D.4 of this appendix instead of 75, 100, and 110 percent of BEP flow. In section II.B.1.1, where alpha values are specified for the load points 75, 100, and 110 percent of BEP flow rate, instead apply the alpha values to the load points of 65, 90, and 100 percent of the BEP flow rate determined with the modified flow points specified in this section I.D.4 of this appendix. However, in sections II.B.1.1.1 and II.B.1.1.1.1 of this appendix, use 100 percent of the BEP flow rate as specified to determine η
pump,STD
and Ns as specified. To determine motor sizing for bare pumps in sections II.B.1.2.1.1 and III.E.1.2.1.1 of this appendix, use a load point of 100 percent of the BEP flow rate instead of 120 percent.

# Appendix B to Subpart Y of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Energy Efficiency of Dedicated-Purpose Pool Pumps

# Note:
On February 5, 2018 but before July 19, 2021, any representations made with respect to the energy use or efficiency of dedicated-purpose pool pumps subject to testing pursuant to 10 CFR 431.464(b) must be made in accordance with the results of testing pursuant to this appendix. Any optional representations of energy factor (EF) must be accompanied by a representation of weighted energy factor (WEF).

# I. Test Procedure for Dedicated-Purpose Pool Pumps

# A. General
A.1 Test Method. To determine the weighted energy factor (WEF) for dedicated-purpose pool pumps, perform “wire-to-water” testing in accordance with HI 40.6-2014-B, except section 40.6.4.1, “Vertically suspended pumps”; section 40.6.4.2, “Submersible pumps”; section 40.6.5.3, “Test report”; section 40.6.5.5, “Test conditions”; section 40.6.5.5.2, “Speed of rotation during testing”; section 40.6.6.1, “Translation of test results to rated speed of rotation”; section 40.6.6.2, “Pump efficiency”; section 40.6.6.3, “Performance curve”; section A.7, “Testing at temperatures exceeding 30 °C (86 °F)”; and appendix B, “Reporting of test results”; (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) with the modifications and additions as noted throughout the provisions below. Do not use the test points specified in section 40.6.5.5.1, “Test procedure” of HI 40.6-2014-B and instead use those test points specified in section D.3 of this appendix for the applicable dedicated-purpose pool pump variety and speed configuration. When determining overall efficiency, best efficiency point, or other applicable pump energy performance information, section 40.6.5.5.1, “Test procedure”; section 40.6.6.2, “Pump efficiency”; and section 40.6.6.3, “Performance curve” must be used, as applicable. For the purposes of applying this appendix, the term “volume per unit time,” as defined in section 40.6.2, “Terms and definitions,” of HI 40.6-2014-B
shall be deemed to be synonymous with the term “flow rate” used throughout that standard and this appendix.
A.2. Calculations and Rounding. All terms and quantities refer to values determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this appendix for the rated pump. Perform all calculations using raw measured values without rounding. Round WEF, EF, maximum head, vertical lift, and true priming time values to the tenths place (
i.e.,
0.1) and rated hydraulic horsepower to the thousandths place (
i.e.,
0.001). Round all other reported values to the hundredths place unless otherwise specified.

# B. Measurement Equipment
B.1 For the purposes of measuring flow rate, speed of rotation, temperature, and pump power output, the equipment specified in HI 40.6-2014-B Appendix C (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) necessary to measure head, speed of rotation, flow rate, and temperature must be used and must comply with the stated accuracy requirements in HI 40.6-2014-B Table 40.6.3.2.3, except as specified in section B.1.1 and B.1.2 of this appendix. When more than one instrument is used to measure a given parameter, the combined accuracy, calculated as the root sum of squares of individual instrument accuracies, must meet the specified accuracy requirements.
B.1.1 Electrical measurement equipment for determining the driver power input to the motor or controls must be capable of measuring true root mean squared (RMS) current, true RMS voltage, and real power up to the 40th harmonic of fundamental supply source frequency, and have a combined accuracy of ±2.0 percent of the measured value at the fundamental supply source frequency.
B.1.2 Instruments for measuring distance (
e.g.,
height above the reference plane or water level) must be accurate to and have a resolution of at least ±0.1 inch.
B.2 Calibration. Calibration requirements for instrumentation are specified in appendix D of HI 40.6-2014-B (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463). Historical calibration data may be used to justify time periods up to three times longer than those specified in table D.1 of HI 40.6-2014-B provided the supporting historical data shows maintenance of calibration of the given instrument up to the selected extended calibration interval on at least two unique occasions, based on the interval specified in HI 40.6-2014-B.

# C. Test Conditions and Tolerances
C.1 Pump Specifications. Conduct testing at full impeller diameter in accordance with the test conditions, stabilization requirements, and specifications of HI 40.6-2014-B section 40.6.3, “Pump efficiency testing”; section 40.6.4, “Considerations when determining the efficiency of a pump”; section 40.6.5.4 (including appendix A), “Test arrangements”; and section 40.6.5.5, “Test conditions” (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463).
C.2 Power Supply Requirements. The following conditions also apply to the mains power supplied to the DPPP motor or controls, if any:
(1) Maintain the voltage within ±5 percent of the rated value of the motor,
(2) Maintain the frequency within ±1 percent of the rated value of the motor,
(3) Maintain the voltage unbalance of the power supply within ±3 percent of the value with which the motor was rated, and
(4) Maintain total harmonic distortion below 12 percent throughout the test.
C.3 Test Conditions. Testing must be carried out with water that is between 50 and 107 °F with less than or equal to 15 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU).
C.4 Tolerances. For waterfall pumps, multi-speed self-priming and non-self-priming pool filter pumps, and variable-speed self-priming and non-self-priming pool filter pumps all measured load points must be within ±2.5 percent of the specified head value and comply with any specified flow values or thresholds. For all other dedicated-purpose pool pumps, all measured load points must be within the greater of ±2.5 percent of the specified flow rate values or ±0.5 gpm and comply with any specified head values or thresholds.

# D. Data Collection and Stabilization
D.1 Damping Devices. Use of damping devices, as described in section 40.6.3.2.2 of HI 40.6-2014-B (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463), are only permitted to integrate up to the data collection interval used during testing.
D.2 Stabilization. Record data at any tested load point only under stabilized conditions, as defined in HI 40.6-2014-B section 40.6.5.5.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463), where a minimum of two measurements are used to determine stabilization.
D.3 Test Points. Measure the flow rate in gpm, pump total head in ft, the driver power input in W, and the speed of rotation in rpm at each load point specified in Table 1 of this appendix for each DPPP variety and speed configuration:

# F. Determination of Self-Priming Capability
F.1 Test Method. Determine the vertical lift and true priming time of non-self-priming pool filter pumps and self-priming pool filter pumps that are not already certified as self-priming under NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) by testing such pumps pursuant to section C.3 of appendix C of NSF/ANSI 50-2015, except for the modifications and exceptions listed in the following sections F.1.1 through F.1.5 of this appendix:
F.1.1 Where section C.3.2, “Apparatus,” and section C.3.4, “Self-priming capability test method,” of NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) state that the “suction line must be essentially as shown in annex C, figure C.1;” the phrase “essentially as shown in Annex C, figure C.1” means:
• The centerline of the pump impeller shaft is situated a vertical distance equivalent to the specified vertical lift (VL), calculated in accordance with section F.1.1.1. of this appendix, above the water level of a water tank of sufficient volume as to maintain a constant water surface level for the duration of the test;

i.e.,
3 pipe diameters);
• The suction inlet of the pump is at least 5 pipe diameters from any obstructions, 90° bends, valves, or fittings; and

# Appendix C to Subpart Y of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Energy Efficiency of Dedicated-Purpose Pool Pumps

# Note:
Any representations made on or after July 19, 2021, with respect to the energy use or efficiency of dedicated-purpose pool pumps subject to testing pursuant to 10 CFR 431.464(b) must be made in accordance with the results of testing pursuant to this appendix.

# I. Test Procedure for Dedicated-Purpose Pool Pumps

# A. General
A.1 Test Method. To determine the weighted energy factor (WEF) for dedicated-purpose pool pumps, perform “wire-to-water” testing in accordance with HI 40.6-2014-B, except section 40.6.4.1, “Vertically suspended pumps”; section 40.6.4.2, “Submersible pumps”; section 40.6.5.3, “Test report”; section 40.6.5.5, “Test conditions”; section 40.6.5.5.2, “Speed of rotation during testing”; section 40.6.6.1, “Translation of test results to rated speed of rotation”; section 40.6.6.2, “Pump efficiency”; section 40.6.6.3, “Performance curve”; section A.7, “Testing at temperatures exceeding 30 °C (86 °F)”; and appendix B, “Reporting of test results”; (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) with the modifications and additions as noted throughout the provisions below. Do not use the test points specified in section 40.6.5.5.1, “Test procedure” of HI 40.6-2014-B and instead use those test points specified in section D.3 of this appendix for the applicable dedicated-purpose pool pump variety and speed configuration. When determining overall efficiency, best efficiency point, or other applicable pump energy performance information, section 40.6.5.5.1, “Test procedure”; section 40.6.6.2, “Pump efficiency”; and section 40.6.6.3, “Performance curve” must be used, as applicable. For the purposes of applying this appendix, the term “volume per unit time,” as defined in section 40.6.2, “Terms and definitions,” of HI 40.6-2014-B shall be deemed to be synonymous with the term “flow rate” used throughout that standard and this appendix .
A.2 Calculations and Rounding. All terms and quantities refer to values determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this appendix for the rated pump. Perform all calculations using raw measured values without rounding. Round WEF, maximum head, vertical lift, and true priming time values to the tenths place (
i.e.,
0.1) and rated hydraulic horsepower to the thousandths place (
i.e.,
0.001). Round all other reported values to the hundredths place unless otherwise specified.

# B. Measurement Equipment
B.1 For the purposes of measuring flow rate, speed of rotation, temperature, and pump power output, the equipment specified in HI 40.6-2014-B Appendix C (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) necessary to measure head, speed of rotation, flow rate, and temperature must be used and must comply with the stated accuracy requirements in HI 40.6-2014-B Table 40.6.3.2.3, except as specified in sections B.1.1 and B.1.2 of this appendix. When more than one instrument is used to measure a given parameter, the combined accuracy, calculated as the root sum of squares of individual instrument accuracies, must meet the specified accuracy requirements.
B.1.1 Electrical measurement equipment for determining the driver power input to the motor or controls must be capable of measuring true root mean squared (RMS) current, true RMS voltage, and real power up to the 40th harmonic of fundamental supply source frequency, and have a combined accuracy of ±2.0 percent of the measured value at the fundamental supply source frequency.
B.1.2 Instruments for measuring distance (
e.g.,
height above the reference plane or water level) must be accurate to and have a resolution of at least ±0.1 inch.
B.2 Calibration. Calibration requirements for instrumentation are specified in appendix D of HI 40.6-2014-B (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463). Historical calibration data may be used to justify time periods up to three times longer than those specified in table D.1 of HI 40.6-2014-B provided the supporting historical data shows maintenance of calibration of the given instrument up to the selected extended calibration interval on at least two unique occasions, based on the interval specified in HI 40.6-2014-B.

# C. Test Conditions and Tolerances
C.1 Pump Specifications. Conduct testing at full impeller diameter in accordance with the test conditions, stabilization requirements, and specifications of HI 40.6-2014-B section 40.6.3, “Pump efficiency testing”; section 40.6.4, “Considerations when determining the efficiency of a pump”; section 40.6.5.4 (including appendix A), “Test arrangements”; and section 40.6.5.5, “Test conditions” (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463).
C.2 Power Supply Requirements. The following conditions also apply to the mains power supplied to the DPPP motor or controls, if any:
(1) Maintain the voltage within ±5 percent of the rated value of the motor,
(2) Maintain the frequency within ±1 percent of the rated value of the motor,
(3) Maintain the voltage unbalance of the power supply within ±3 percent of the value with which the motor was rated, and
(4) Maintain total harmonic distortion below 12 percent throughout the test.
C.3 Test Conditions. Testing must be carried out with water that is between 50 and 107 °F with less than or equal to 15 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU).
C.4 Tolerances. For waterfall pumps, multi-speed self-priming and non-self-priming pool filter pumps, and variable-speed self-priming and non-self-priming pool filter pumps all measured load points must be within ±2.5 percent of the specified head value and comply with any specified flow values or thresholds. For all other dedicated-purpose pool pumps, all measured load points must be within the greater of ±2.5 percent of the specified flow rate values or ±0.5 gpm and comply with any specified head values or thresholds.

# D. Data Collection and Stabilization
D.1 Damping Devices. Use of damping devices, as described in section 40.6.3.2.2 of HI 40.6-2014-B (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463), are only permitted to integrate up to the data collection interval used during testing.
D.2 Stabilization. Record data at any tested load point only under stabilized conditions, as defined in HI 40.6-2014-B section 40.6.5.5.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463), where a minimum of two measurements are used to determine stabilization.

F.1 Test Method. Determine the vertical lift and true priming time of non-self-priming pool filter pumps and self-priming pool filter pumps that are not already certified as self-priming under NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) by testing such pumps pursuant to section C.3 of appendix C of NSF/ANSI 50-2015, except for the modifications and exceptions listed in the following sections F.1.1 through F.1.5 of this appendix:
F.1.1 Where section C.3.2, “Apparatus,” and section C.3.4, “Self-priming capability test method,” of NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) state that the “suction line must be essentially as shown in annex C, figure C.1;” the phrase “essentially as shown in Annex C, figure C.1” means:
(1) The centerline of the pump impeller shaft is situated a vertical distance equivalent to the specified vertical lift (VL), calculated in accordance with section F.1.1.1. of this appendix, above the water level of a water tank of sufficient volume as to maintain a constant water surface level for the duration of the test;

i.e.,
3 pipe diameters);

In addition, the true priming time (TPT) is equivalent to the MPT.
F.1.5 The maximum true priming time for each test run must not exceed 10.0 minutes. Disregard section C.3.5 of NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463).

# 2. Scope
2.1 This appendix is applicable to all circulator pumps and describes how to calculate the circulator energy index (CEI; section F) based on the pump energy rating for the minimally compliant reference circulator pump (CER
STD
) and the circulator energy rating (CER) determined in accordance with one of the test methods listed in Table I of this appendix based on a control variety with which the circulator pump is distributed in commerce.

HI 41.5-2022 Section 41.5.3.4.5.
2.2 If a given circulator pump model is distributed in commerce with multiple control varieties available, the manufacturer may select a control variety (or varieties) among those available with which to test the circulator pump, including the test method for circulator pumps at full speed or circulator pumps without external input signal, manual, pressure, or temperature controls).

# 3. Measurement Equipment
For the purposes of measuring flow rate, head, driver power input, and pump power output, the equipment specified in HI 40.6-2021 Appendix C must be used and must comply with the stated accuracy requirements in HI 40.6-2021 Table 40.6.3.2.3. When more than one instrument is used to measure a given parameter, the combined accuracy, calculated as the root sum of squares of individual instrument accuracies, must meet the specified accuracy requirements.

# 4. Test Conditions
4.1 Pump specifications. Conduct testing in accordance with the test conditions, stabilization requirements, and specifications of HI 40.6-2021 section 40.6.3, “Pump efficiency testing”; section 40.6.4, “Considerations when determining the efficiency of a pump,” including section 40.6.4.4, “Determination of pump overall efficiency”; section 40.6.5.4 (including Appendix A), “Test arrangements”; and section 40.6.5.5, “Test conditions.”
4.2 Twin head circulator pump. To test twin head circulator pumps, one of the two impeller assemblies should be incorporated into an adequate, single impeller volute and casing. An adequate, single impeller volute and casing means a volute and casing for which any physical and functional characteristics that affect energy consumption and energy efficiency are essentially identical to their corresponding characteristics for a single impeller in the twin head circulator pump volute and casing.
4.3 Circulator-less-volute. To determine the CEI for a circulator-less-volute, test each circulator-less-volute with each volute for which the circulator-less-volute is offered for sale or advertised to be paired for that circulator pump model according to the testing and calculations described in the applicable test method listed in Table 1 of this appendix, depending on the variety of control with which the circulator pump model is distributed in commerce. Alternatively, each circulator-less-volute may be tested with the most consumptive volute with which is it offered for sale or advertised to be paired for that circulator pump model.

# 5. Data Collection and Analysis

Determine the BEP of the circulator pump at maximum speed as specified in Appendix E of HI 40.6-2021 including sections 40.6.5.5.1 and 40.6.6 as modified. Determine the BEP flow rate at maximum speed as the flow rate at the operating point of maximum overall efficiency on the circulator pump curve, as determined in accordance with section 40.6.6.3 of HI 40.6-2021 as modified by Appendix E, where overall efficiency is the ratio of the circulator pump power output divided by the driver power input, as specified in Table 40.6.2.1 of HI 40.6-2021. For the purposes of this test procedure, all references to “driver power input” in this appendix or HI 40.6-2021 shall refer to the input power to the controls, or to the motor if no controls are present.
5.3 Rounding. All terms and quantities refer to values determined in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this appendix for the rated circulator pump. Perform all calculations using raw measured values without rounding. Round CER to three significant figures. Round CEI to the hundredths decimal place. Round rated hydraulic horsepower to the less precise of the following two values: three significant figures; the fourth decimal place when expressed in units of horsepower.

# 6. Calculation of CEI
Determine CEI using the following equation:
ER19SE22.033
Where:
CEI = the circulator energy index (dimensionless);
CER = the circulator energy rating determined in accordance with Table 1 of this appendix (hp); and
CER
STD
= the CER for a circulator pump that is minimally compliant with DOE's energy conservation standards with the same hydraulic horsepower as the tested pump, as determined in accordance with the specifications at paragraph (i) of § 431.465.

# 7. Determination of Additional Circulator Performance Parameters
7.1 To determine flow and head at BEP; pump power output (hydraulic horsepower) and driver power input at load points used in the calculation of CEI, including the rated hydraulic horsepower; and any other reported performance parameters, conduct testing according to section 1 of this appendix.
7.2 Determine the rated hydraulic horsepower as the pump power output measured at BEP and full impeller diameter for the rated pump.
7.3 Determine the true power factor at each applicable load point specified in the applicable test method listed in Table 1 of this appendix for each circulator pump control variety as a ratio of driver power input to the motor (or controls, if present) (
P
i

Mixed-use buildings.
(i) For Federal buildings subject to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section that combine two or more building types identified in Tables 1a to 2a or Tables 1b to 2b of appendix A of this subpart, the maximum allowable fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building is equal to the averaged applicable building type values in Tables A-1a to A-2a or Tables A-1b to A-2b weighted by floor area of the two or more building types. The equation which follows shall be used for mixed use buildings.
Equation 1: Scope 1 Fossil fuel-generated energy consumption for a mixed-use building = the sum across all building uses of (the fraction of total floor building floor area for building use i times the allowable fossil fuel-generated energy consumption for building use i)
Equation 1 may be rewritten as:
ER01MY24.000
(ii) For example, if a proposed building for which design for construction began in FY 2026 that is to be built in climate zone 4a has a total of 200 square feet—100 square feet of which qualifies as College/University and 100 square feet of which qualifies as Laboratory—the maximum allowable Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption is equal to:
[(100 sqft. × 3 kBtu/yr.-sqft.) + (100 sqft × 10 kBtu/yr.-sqft.)]/200 sqft. = 6.5 kBtu/yr.-sqft.
(d)
Federal buildings that are of the type not included in Appendix A of this subpart
—
(1)
Process load buildings.
For building types that are not included in any of the building types listed in Tables A-1a to A-2a or A-1b to A-2b of appendix A of this subpart, or for building types in these tables that contain significant process loads that are not likely to be found in the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and qualify for exemption per § 433.202, Federal agencies must select the applicable building type, climate zone, and fiscal year in which design for construction began from Tables 1a to 2a or 1b to 2b of appendix A of this subpart that most closely corresponds to the proposed building without the process load. The estimated Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the process load must be added to the maximum allowable Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the applicable building type for the appropriate fiscal year and climate zone to calculate the maximum allowable Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption for the building. The same estimated Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the process load that is added to the maximum allowable Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the applicable building must also be used in determining the Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building.
(2)
Mixed-use buildings.
For buildings that combine two or more building types with process loads or, alternatively, that combine one or more building types with process loads with one or more building types in Tables A-1a to A-2a or A-1b to A-2b of appendix A of this subpart, the maximum allowable Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building is equal to the averaged process load building values determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the applicable building type values in Tables A-1a to A-2a or A-1b to A-2b of appendix A of this subpart, weighted by floor area.

§ 433.201
Scope 1 Fossil fuel-generated energy consumption determination.
(a) The fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of a proposed building is calculated as follows:
Equation 2: Fossil fuel-generated energy consumption = Direct Scope 1 Fossil Fuel-Generated Consumption of Proposed Building/Floor Area
Where:
Direct Scope 1 Fossil Fuel-Generated Energy Consumption of Proposed Building
equals the total Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building calculated in accordance with the method required in § 433.101(a)(5) and measured in thousands of British thermal units per year (kBtu/yr), except that this term does not include fossil fuel consumption for emergency electricity generation. Agencies must include all on-site fossil fuel use or Scope 1 emissions associated with non-emergency generation from backup generators (such as those for peak shaving or peak shifting). Any energy generation or Scope 1 emissions associated with biomass fuels are excluded. Any emissions associated with natural gas for alternatively fueled vehicles (“AFVs”) (or any other alternative fuel defined at 42 U.S.C. 13211 that is provided at a Federal building) is excluded. For buildings with manufacturing or industrial process loads, the process loads should be accounted for in the analysis for the building's fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions, but are not subject to the phase down targets.
Floor Area
is the area enclosed by the exterior walls of a building, both finished and unfinished, including indoor parking facilities, basements, hallways, lobbies, stairways, and elevator shafts.

§ 434.99
Explanation of numbering system for codes.
(a) For purposes of this part, a derivative of two different numbering systems will be used.
(1) For the purpose of designating a section, the system employed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) will be employed. The number “434” which signifies part 434 in chapter II of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, is used as a prefix for all section headings. The suffix is a two or three digit section number. For example the lighting section of the standards is designated § 434.401.
(2) Within each section, a numbering system common to many national voluntary consensus standards is used. A decimal system is used to denote paragraphs and subparagraphs within a section. For example, in § 434.401, “401.2.1” refers to subsection 401, paragraph 2, subparagraph 1.
(b) The hybrid numbering system is used for two purposes:
(1) The use of the Code of Federal Regulations' numbering system allows the researcher using the CFR easy access to the standards.
(2) The use of the second system allows the builder, designer, architect or engineer easy access because they are familiar to this system numbering. This system was chosen because of its commonality among the building industry.

Lighting Power Control Credits.
The interior connected lighting power determined in accordance with § 434.401.3.2 can be decreased for luminaries that are automatically controlled for occupancy, daylight, lumen
maintenance, or programmable timing. The adjusted interior connected lighting power shall be determined by subtracting the sum of all lighting power control credits from the interior connected lighting power. Using Table 401.3.3, the lighting power control credit equals the power adjustment factor times the connected lighting power of the controlled lighting. The lighting power adjustment shall be applied with the following limitations:
(a) It is limited to the specific area controlled by the automatic control device.
(b) Only one lighting power adjustment may be used for each building space or luminaire, and 50 percent or more of the controlled luminaire shall be within the applicable space.
(c) Controls shall be installed in series with the lights and in series with all manual switching devices.
(d) When sufficient daylight is available, daylight sensing controls shall be capable of reducing electrical power consumption for lighting (continuously or in steps) to 50 percent or less of maximum power consumption.
(e) Daylight sensing controls shall control all luminaires to which the adjustment is applied and that direct a minimum of 50 percent of their light output into the daylight zone.
(f) Programmable timing controls shall be able to program different schedules for occupied and unoccupied days, be readily accessible for temporary override with automatic return to the original schedule, and keep time during power outages for at least four hours.

404.1.1
Testing Electric and Oil Storage Water Heaters for Standby Loss.
(a) When testing an electric storage water heater, the procedures of Z21.10.3-1990 (RS-39, incorporated by reference, see § 434.701), Section 2.9, shall be used. The electrical supply voltage shall be maintained with ±1% of the center of the voltage range specified on the water heater nameplate. Also, when needed for calculations, the thermal efficiency (E
t
) shall be 98%.
When testing an oil-fired water heater, the procedures of Z21.10.3-1990 (RS-39 incorporated by reference, see § 434.701), Sections 2.8 and 2.9, shall be used.
(b) The following modifications shall be made: A vertical length of flue pipe shall be connected to the flue gas outlet of sufficient height to establish the minimum draft specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions. All measurements of oil consumption shall be taken by instruments with an accuracy of ±1% or better. The burner rate shall be adjusted to achieve an hourly Btu input rate within ±2% of the manufacturer's specified input rate with the CO
2
reading as specified by the manufacturer with smoke no greater than 1 and the fuel pump pressure within ±1% of the manufacturer's specification.
404.1.2
Unfired Storage Tanks.
The heat loss of the tank surface area Btu/(h·ft
2
) shall be based on an 80 °F water-air temperature difference.
404.1.3
Storage Volume Symbols in Table 404.1.
The symbol “V” is the rated storage volume in gallons as specified by the manufacturer. The symbol “V
T
” is the storage volume in gallons as measured during the test to determine the standby loss. V
T
may differ from V, but it is within tolerances allowed by the applicable Z21 and Underwriters Laboratories standards. Accordingly, for the purpose of estimating the standby loss requirement using the rated volume shown on the rating plate, V
T
should be considered as no less than 0.95V for gas and oil water heaters and no less than 0.90V for electric water heaters.
404.1.4
Electric Water Heaters.
In applications where water temperatures not greater than 145 °F are required, an economic evaluation shall be made on the potential benefit of using an electric heat pump water heater(s) instead of an electric resistance water heater(s). The analysis shall compare the extra installed costs of the heat pump unit with the benefits in reduced energy costs (less increased maintenance costs) over the estimated service life of the heat pump water heater. Exceptions are as follows: Electric water heaters used in conjunction with site-recovered or site-solar energy sources that provide 50% or more of the water heating load or off-peak heating with thermal storage.
404.2
Service Hot Water Piping Insulation.
Circulating system piping and noncirculating systems without heat traps, the first eight feet of outlet piping from a constant-temperature noncirculating storage system, and the inlet pipe between the storage tank and a heat trap in a noncirculating storage system shall meet the provisions of subsection 403.2.9.
404.2.1 Vertical risers serving storage water heaters not having an integral heat trap and serving a noncirculating system shall have heat traps on both the inlet and outlet piping as close as practical to the water heater.
404.3
Service Water Heating System Controls.
Temperature controls that allow for storage temperature adjustment from 110 °F to a temperature compatible with the intended use shall be provided in systems serving residential dwelling units and from 90 °F for other systems. When designed to maintain usage temperatures in hot water pipes, such as circulating hot water systems or heat trace, the system shall be equipped with automatic time switches or other controls that can be set to turn off the system.
404.3.1 The outlet temperature of lavatory faucets in public facility restrooms shall be limited to 110 °F.
404.4
Water Conservation.
Showerheads and lavatory faucets must meet the requirements of 10 CFR 430.32 (o)-(p).
404.4.1 Lavatory faucets in public facility restrooms shall be equipped with a foot switch, occupancy sensor, or similar device or, in other than lavatories for physically handicapped persons, limit water delivery to 0.25 gal/cycle.
404.5

(b) The input to the combined boiler is less than 150,000 Btuh.

# Subpart E—Building Energy Cost Compliance Alternative
§ 434.501
General.
501.1 Subpart E permits the use of the Building Energy Cost Compliance Alternative as an alternative to many elements of subpart D. When this subpart is used, it must be used with subpart C and subpart D, 401.1, 401.2, 401.3.4 and in conjunction with the minimum requirements found in subsections 402.1, 402.2, and 402.3., 403.1, 403.2.1-7, 403.2.9 and 404.
501.2
Compliance.
Compliance under this method requires detailed energy analyses of the entire Proposed Design, referred to as the Design Energy Consumption; an estimate of annual energy cost for the proposed design, referred to as the Design Energy Cost; and comparison against an Energy Cost Budget. Compliance is achieved when the estimated Design Energy Cost is less than or equal to the Energy Cost Budget. This subpart provides instructions for determining the Energy Cost Budget and for calculating the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy Cost. The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined through the calculation of monthly energy consumption and energy cost of a Prototype or Reference Building design configured to meet the requirements of subsections 401 through 404.
501.3 Designers are encouraged to employ the Building Energy Cost Budget compliance method set forth in this section for evaluating proposed design alternatives to using the elements prescribed in subpart D. The Building Energy Cost Budget establishes the relative effectiveness of each design alternative in energy cost savings, providing an energy cost basis upon which the building owner and designer may select one design over another. This Energy Cost Budget is the highest allowable calculated energy cost for a specific building design. Other alternative designs are likely to have lower annual energy costs and life cycle costs than those used to minimally meet the Energy Cost Budget.
501.4 The Energy Cost Budget is a numerical reference for annual energy cost. Its purpose is to assure neutrality with respect to choices such as HVAC system type, architectural design and fuel choice by providing a fixed, repeatable budget that is independent of any of these choices wherever possible (
i.e.,
for the prototype buildings). The Energy Cost Budget for a given building size and type will vary only with climate, the number of stories, and the choice of simulation tool. The specifications of the prototypes are necessary to assure repeatability, but have no other significance. They are not necessarily recommended energy conserving practice, or even physically reasonable practice for some climates or buildings, but represent a reasonable worst case of energy cost resulting from compliance with the provisions of subsections 401 through 404.
§ 434.502
Determination of the annual energy cost budget.
502.1 The annual Energy Cost Budgets shall be determined in accordance with the Prototype Building Procedure in § 434.503 and § 434.504 or the Reference Building Procedure in § 434.505. Both methods calculate an annual Energy Cost by summing the 12 monthly Energy Cost Budgets. Each monthly Energy Cost Budget is the product of the monthly Building Energy Consumption of each type of energy used multiplied by the monthly Energy Cost per unit of energy for each type of energy used.
502.2 The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined in accordance with Equation 502.2.a as follows:
ER06OC00.025
Based on:
ER06OC00.026
Where:
ECB = The annual Energy Cost Budget
ECB
m
= The monthly Energy Cost Budget
BECON
mi
= The monthly Budget Energy Consumption of the i
th
type of energy
ECOS
mi
= The monthly Energy Cost, per unit of the i
th
type of energy
502.3 The monthly Energy Cost Budget shall be determined using current rate schedules or contract prices available at the building site for all types of energy purchased. These costs shall include demand charges, rate blocks, time of use rates, interruptible service rates, delivery charges, taxes, and all other applicable rates for the type, location, operation, and size of the proposed design. The monthly Budget Energy Consumption shall be calculated from the first day through the last day of each month, inclusive.
§ 434.503
Prototype building procedure.
503.1 The Prototype Building procedure shall be used for all building types listed below. For mixed-use buildings the Energy Cost Budget is derived by allocating the floor space of each building type within the floor space of the prototype building. For buildings not listed below, the Reference Building procedure of § 434.505 shall be used. Prototype buildings include:
(a) Assembly;
(b) Office (Business);
(c) Retail (Mercantile);
(d) Warehouse (Storage);
(e) School (Educational);
(f) Hotel/Motel;
(g) Restaurant;
(h) Health/Institutional; and
(i) Multi-Family.
§ 434.504
Use of the prototype building to determine the energy cost budget.
504.1 Determine the building type of the Proposed Design using the categories in subsection 503.1. Using the appropriate Prototype Building characteristics from all of the tables contained in subpart E, the building shall be simulated using the same gross floor area and number of floors for the Prototype Building as in the Proposed Design.
504.2 The form, orientation, occupancy and use profiles for the Prototype Building shall be fixed as described in subsection 511. Envelope, lighting, other internal loads and HVAC systems and equipment shall meet the requirements of subsection 301, 401, 402, 403, and 404 and are standardized inputs.
§ 434.505
Reference building method.
505.1 The Reference Building procedure shall be used only when the Proposed Design cannot be represented by one or a combination of the Prototype Building listed in subsection 503.1 or the assumptions for the Prototype Building in Subsection 510, such as occupancy and use-profiles, do not reasonably represent the Proposed Design.
§ 434.506
Use of the reference building to determine the energy cost budget.
506.1 Each floor shall be oriented in the same manner for the Reference Building as in the Proposed Design. The form, gross and conditioned floor areas of each floor and the number of floors shall be the same as in the Proposed Design. All other characteristics, such as lighting, envelope and HVAC systems and equipment, shall meet the requirements of subsections 301, 401, 402, 403 and 404.
§ 434.507
Calculation procedure and simulation tool.
507.1 The Prototype or Reference Buildings shall be modeled using the
criteria of subsections 510 and 521. The modeling shall use a climate data set appropriate for both the site and the complexity of the energy conserving features of the design. ASHRAE Weather Year for Energy Calculations (WYEC) data or bin weather data shall be used in the absence of other appropriate data.
§ 434.508
Determination of the design energy consumption and design energy cost.
508.1 The Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by modeling the Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, and simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Cost Budget, except as explicitly stated in 509 through 534. The Design Energy Cost shall be calculated per Equation 508.1.

§ 434.509
Compliance.
509.1 If the Design Energy Cost is less than or equal to the Energy Cost Budget, and all of the minimum requirements of subsection 501.2 are met, the Proposed Design complies with the standards.
§ 434.510
Standard calculation procedure.
510.1 The Standard Calculation Procedure consists of methods and assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget for the Prototype or Reference Building and the Design Energy Consumption and Design Energy Cost of the Proposed Design. In order to maintain consistency between the Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Cost, the input assumptions to be used are stated below. These inputs shall be used to determine the Energy Cost Budget and the Design Energy Consumption.
510.2 Prescribed assumptions shall be used without variation. Default assumptions shall be used unless the designer can demonstrate that a different assumption better characterizes the building's energy use over its expected life. The default assumptions shall be used in modeling both the Prototype or Reference Building and the Proposed Design, unless the designer demonstrates clear cause to modify these assumptions. Special procedures for speculative buildings are discussed in subsection 503. Shell buildings may not use subpart E.
§ 434.511
Orientation and shape.
511.1 The Prototype Building shall consist of the same number of stories, and gross and conditioned floor area as the Proposed Design, with equal area per story. The building shape shall be rectangular, with a 2.5:1 aspect ratio. The long dimensions of the building shall face East and West. The fenestration shall be uniformly distributed in proportion to exterior wall area. Floor-to-floor height for the Prototype Building shall be 13 ft. except for dwelling units in hotels/motels and multi-family high-rise residential buildings where floor-to-floor height shall be 9.5 ft.
511.2 The Reference Building shall consist of the same number of stories, and gross floor area for each story as the Proposed Design. Each floor shall be oriented in the same manner as the Proposed Design. The geometric form shall be the same as the Proposed Design.
§ 434.512
Internal loads.
512.1 The systems and types of energy specified in this section are provided only for purposes of calculating the Energy Cost Budget. They are not requirements for either systems or the type of energy to be used in the Proposed Design or for calculation of Design Energy Cost.
512.2 Internal loads for multi-family high-rise residential buildings are prescribed in Tables 512.2.a and b, Multi-Family High Rise Residential Building Schedules. Internal loads for other building types shall be modeled as noted in this subsection.

Lighting.
514.1 Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA), for calculating the Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from subsection 401.3.2. The lighting power used to calculate the Design Energy Consumption shall be the actual adjusted power for lighting in the Proposed Design. If the lighting controls in the Proposed Design are more effective at saving energy than those required by subsection 401.3.1 and 401.3.2, the actual installed lighting power shall be used along with the schedules reflecting the action of the controls to calculate the Design Energy Consumption. This actual installed lighting
power shall not be adjusted by the Power Adjustment Factors listed in Table 514.1.

514.2 Table 513.2.b establishes default assumptions for the percentage of the lighting load switched-on in each Prototype or Reference Building by hour of the day. These default assumptions can be changed when calculating the Energy Cost Budget to provide, for example, a 12-hour rather than an 8-hour workday.
§ 434.515
Receptacles.
515.1 Receptacle loads and profiles are default assumptions. The same assumptions shall be made in calculating Design Energy Consumption as were used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.
515.2 Receptacle loads include all general service loads that are typical in a building. These loads exclude any process electrical usage and HVAC primary or auxiliary electrical usage. Table 515.2, Receptacle Power Densities, establishes the density, in W/ft

§ 434.516
Building exterior envelope.
516.1
Insulation and Glazing.
The insulation and glazing characteristics of the Prototype and Reference Building envelope shall be determined by using the first column under “Base Case”, with no assumed overhangs, for the appropriate Alternate Component Tables (ACP) in Table 402.4.1.2, as defined by climate range. The insulation and glazing characteristics from this ACP are prescribed assumptions for Prototype and Reference Buildings for calculating the Energy Cost Budget. In calculating the Design Energy Consumption of the Proposed Design, the envelope characteristics of the Proposed Design shall be used.
516.2
Infiltration.
For Prototype and Reference Buildings, the infiltration assumptions in subsection 516.2.1 shall be prescribed assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget and default assumptions for the Design Energy Consumption. Infiltration shall impact perimeter zones only.
516.2.1 When the HVAC system is switched “on,” no infiltration shall be assumed. When the HVAC system is switched “off,” the infiltration rate for buildings with or without operable windows shall be assumed to be 0.038 cfm/ft
2
of gross exterior wall. Hotels/motels and multi-family high-rise residential buildings shall have infiltration rates of 0.038 cfm/ft
2
of gross exterior wall area at all times.
516.3
Envelope and Ground Absorptivities.
For Prototype and Reference Buildings, absorptivity assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions for computing the Energy Cost Budget and default assumptions for computing the Design Energy Consumption. The solar absorptivity of opaque elements of the building envelope is assumed to be 70%. The solar absorptivity of ground surfaces is assumed to be 80% (20% reflectivity).
516.4
Window Management.
For the Prototype and Reference Building, window management drapery assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions for setting the Energy Cost Budget. No draperies shall be the default assumption for computing the Design Energy Consumption. Glazing is assumed to be internally shaded by medium-weight draperies, closed one-half time. The
draperies shall be modeled by assuming that one-half the area in each zone is draped and one-half is not. If manually-operated draperies, shades, or blinds are to be used in the Proposed Design, the Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by assuming they are effective over one-half the glazing area in each zone.
516.5
Shading.
For Prototype and Reference buildings and the Proposed Design, shading by permanent structures, terrain, and vegetation shall be taken into account for computing energy consumption, whether or not these features are located on the building site. A permanent fixture is one that is likely to remain for the life of the Proposed Design.
§ 434.517
HVAC systems and equipment.
517.1 The specifications and requirements for the HVAC systems of the Prototype and Reference Buildings shall be those in Table 517.1.1, HVAC Systems for Prototype and Reference Buildings. For the calculation of the Design Energy Consumption, the HVAC systems and equipment of the Proposed Design shall be used.
517.2 The systems and types of energy presented in Table 517.1.1 are assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget. They are not requirements for either systems or the type of energy to be used in the Proposed Building or for the calculation of the Design Energy Cost.

The system and energy types presented in this Table are not intended as requirements or recommendations for the proposed design. Floor areas below are the total conditioned floor areas for the listed occupancy type in the building. The number of floors indicated below is the total number of occupied floors for the listed occupancy type.
517.3
HVAC Zones.
HVAC zones for calculating the Energy Cost Budget of the Prototype or Reference Building shall consist of at least four perimeter and one interior zones per floor. Prototype Buildings shall have one perimeter zone facing each cardinal direction. The perimeter zones of Prototype and Reference Buildings shall be 15 ft in width, or one-third the narrow dimension of the building, when this dimension is between 30 ft and 45 ft inclusive, or one-half the narrow dimension of the building when this dimension is less than 30 ft. Zoning requirements shall be a default assumption for calculating the Energy Cost Budget. For multi-family high-rise residential
buildings, the prototype building shall have one zone per dwelling unit. The proposed design shall have one zone per unit unless zonal thermostatic controls are provided within units; in this case, two zones per unit shall be modeled. Building types such as assembly or warehouse may be modeled as a single zone if there is only one space.
517.4 For calculating the Design Energy Consumption, no fewer zones shall be used than were in the Prototype and Reference Buildings. The zones in the simulation shall correspond to the zones provided by the controls in the Proposed Design. Thermally similar zones, such as those facing one orientation on different floors, may be grouped together for the purposes of either the Design Energy Consumption or Energy Cost Budget simulation.

# Numbered Notes for Table 517.4.1

# HVAC System Descriptions for Prototype and Reference Buildings
Notes:
1. For occupancies such as restaurants, assembly and retail which are part of a mixed use building which, according to Table 517.4.1, includes a central chilled water plant (systems 3, 5, or 6), chilled water system type 3 or 5, as indicated in the Table, shall be used.
2. Constant volume may be used in zones where pressurization relationships must be maintained by code. VAV shall be used in all other areas, in accordance with § 517.4
3. Provide run-around heat recovery systems for all fan systems with minimum outside air intake greater than 75%. Recovery effectiveness shall be 0.60.
4. If a warehouse is not intended to be mechanically cooled, both the Energy Cost Budgets and Design Energy Costs, may be calculated assuming no mechanical cooling.
5. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public areas and back-of-house areas shall be served by system 4. Other areas such as offices and retail shall be served by the systems listed in Table 517.4.1 for those occupancy types.
6. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public areas and back-of-house areas shall be served by System 5. Other areas such as offices and retail shall be served by the systems listed in Table 517.4.1.1 for those occupancy types.
7. System 2 shall be used for Energy Cost Budget calculation except in areas with design heating outside air temperatures less than 10 °F.
8. Prototype energy budget cost calculations shall be made using both electricity and natural gas. If natural gas is not available at the site, electricity and #2 fuel oil shall be used. The Energy Cost Budget shall be the lower of these results. Alternatively, the Energy Cost Budget may be based on the fuel source that minimizes total operating, maintenance, equipment, and installation costs for the prototype over the building lifetime. Equipment and installation cost estimates shall be prepared using professionally recognized cost estimating tools, guides, and techniques. The methods of analysis shall conform to those of subpart A of 10 CFR part 436. Energy costs shall be based on actual costs to the building as defined in this Section.
9. Design supply air circulation rate shall be based on a supply air to room air temperature differences of 20 °F. A higher supply air temperature may be used if required to maintain a minimum circulation rate of 4.5 air changes per hour or 15 cfm per person at design conditions to each zone served by the system. If return fans are specified, they shall be sized from the supply fan capacity less the required minimum ventilation with outside air, or 75% or the supply air capacity, whichever is larger. Except where noted, supply and return fans shall be operated continually during occupied hours.
10. Fan System Energy when included in the efficiency rating of the unit as defined in § 403.2.4.3 need not be modeled explicitly for this system. The fan shall cycle with calls for heating or cooling.
11. Chilled water systems shall be modeled using a reciprocating chiller for systems with total cooling capacities less than 175 tons, and centrifugal chillers for systems
with cooling capacities of 175 tons or greater. For systems with cooling or 600 ton or more, the Energy Cost Budget shall be calculated using two centrifugal chillers lead/lag controlled. Chilled water pumps shall be sized using a 12 °F temperature rise, from 44 °F to 56 °F operating at 65 feed of head and 65% combined impeller and motor efficiency. Condenser water pumps shall be sized using a 10 °F temperature rise, operating at 60 feet of head and 60% combined impeller and motor efficiency. The cooling tower shall be an open circuit, centrifugal blower type sized for the larger of 85 °F leaving water temperature or 10 °F approach to design wet bulb temperature. The tower shall be controlled to provide a 65 °F leaving water temperature whenever weather conditions permit, floating up to design leaving water temperature at design conditions. Chilled water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with § 434.518.
12. Hot water system shall include a natural draft fossil fuel or electric boiler per Note 8. The hot water pump shall be sized based on a 30 °F temperature drop, for 18 °F to 150 °F, operating at 60 feet of head and a combined impeller and motor efficiency of 60%. Hot water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with § 434.518.
517.5
Equipment Sizing and Redundant Equipment.
For calculating the Energy Cost Budget of Prototype or Reference Buildings, HVAC equipment shall be sized to meet the requirements of subsection 403.2.2, without using any of the exceptions. The size of equipment shall be that required for the building without process loads considered. Redundant or emergency equipment need not be simulated if it is controlled so that it will not be operated during normal operations of the building. The designer shall document the installation of process equipment and the size of process loads.
517.6 For calculating the Design Energy Consumption, actual air flow rates and installed equipment size shall be used in the simulation, except that excess capacity provided to meet process loads need not be modeled unless the process load was not modeled in setting Energy Cost Budget. Equipment sizing in the simulation of the Proposed Design shall correspond to the equipment actually selected for the design and the designer shall not use equipment sized automatically by the simulation tool.
517.6.1 Redundant or emergency equipment need not be simulated if it is controlled to not be operated during normal operations of the building.
§ 434.518
Service water heating.
518.1 The service water loads for Prototype and Reference Buildings are defined in terms of Btu/h per person in Table 518.1.1, Service Hot Water Quantities. The service water heating loads from Table 518.1.1 are prescribed assumptions for multi-family high-rise residential buildings and default assumptions for all other buildings. The same service water heating load assumptions shall be made in calculating Design Energy Consumption as were used in calculating the Energy Cost Budget.

This value is the number to be multiplied by the percentage multipliers of the Building Profile Schedules in Table 513.2.b. See Table 513.2.a for occupancy levels.

Total hot water use per dwelling unit for each hour shall be 3,400 Btu/h times the multi-family high rise residential building SWH system multiplier from Table 513.2.b.
518.2 The service water heating system, including piping losses for the Prototype Building, shall be modeled using the methods of the RS-47 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) using a system that meets all requirements of subsection 404. The service water heating equipment for the Prototype or Reference Building shall be either an electric heat pump or natural gas, or if natural gas is not available at the site, #2 fuel oil. Exception: If electric resistance service water heating is preferable to an electric heat pump when analyzed according to the criteria of § 434.404.1.4 or when service water temperatures exceeding 145 °F are required for a particular application, electric resistance water heating may be used.
§ 434.519
Controls.
519.1 All occupied conditioned spaces in the Prototype, Reference and Proposed Design Buildings in all climates shall be simulated as being both heated and cooled. The assumptions in this subsection are prescribed assumptions. If the Proposed Design does not include equipment for cooling or heating, the Design Energy Consumption shall be determined by the specifications for calculating the Energy Cost Budget as described in Table 517.4.1 HVAC System Description for Prototype and Reference Buildings. Exceptions to 519.1 are as follows:
519.1.1 If a building is to be provided with only heating or cooling, both the Prototype or Reference Building and the Proposed Design shall be simulated, using the same assumptions. Such an assumption cannot be made unless the building interior temperature meets the comfort criteria of RS-2 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) at least 98% of the occupied hours during the year.
519.1.2 If warehouses are not intended to be mechanically cooled, both the Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Consumption shall be modeled assuming no mechanical cooling; and
519.1.3 In climates where winter design temperature (97.5% occurrence) is greater than 59 °F, space heating need not be modeled.
519.2 Space temperature controls for the Prototype or Reference Building, except multi-family high-rise residential buildings, shall be set at 70 °F for space heating and 75 °F for space cooling with a deadband per subsection 403.2.6.3. The system shut off during off-hours shall be according to the schedule in Table 515.2, except that the heating system shall cycle on if any space should drop below the night setback setting of 55 °F. There shall be no similar setpoint during the cooling season. Lesser deadband ranges may be used in calculating the Design Energy Consumption. Exceptions to 519.2 are as follows:
(a) Setback shall not be modeled in determining either the Energy Cost Budget or Design Energy Cost if setback is not realistic for the Proposed Design, such as 24-hour/day operations. Health facilities need not have night setback during the heating season; and
(b) Hotel/motels and multi-family high-rise residential buildings shall have a night setback temperature of 60 °F from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. during the heating season; and
(c) If deadband controls are not to be installed, the Design Energy Cost shall be calculated with both heating and cooling thermostat setpoints set to the same value between 70 °F and 75 °F inclusive, assumed to be constant for the year.
519.2.1 For multi-family buildings, the thermostat schedule for the dwelling units shall be as in Table 519.1.2, Thermostat Settings for Multi-Family High-rise Buildings. The Prototype Building shall use the single zone schedule. The Proposed Design shall use the two-zone schedule only if zonal thermostatic controls are provided. For Proposed Designs that use heat pumps employing supplementary heat, the controls used to switch on the auxiliary heat source during morning warm-up periods shall be simulated accurately. The thermostat assumptions for multi-family high-rise buildings are prescribed assumptions.
519.3 When providing for outdoor air ventilation in calculating the Energy Cost Budget, controls shall be assumed to close the outside air intake to reduce the flow of outside air to 0 cfm during setback and unoccupied periods. Ventilation using inside air may still be required to maintain scheduled setback temperature. Outside air ventilation, during occupied periods, shall be as required by RS-41, (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) or the Proposed Design, whichever is greater.
519.4 If humidification is to be used in the Proposed Design, the same level of humidification and system type shall be used in the Prototype or Reference Building. If dehumidification requires subcooling of supply air, then reheat for the Prototype or Reference Building shall be from recovered waste heat such as condenser waste heat.

§ 434.520
Speculative buildings.
520.1 Lighting. The interior lighting power allowance (ILPA) for calculating the Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from Table 401.3.2a. The Design Energy Consumption may be based on an assumed adjusted lighting power for future lighting improvements.
520.2 The assumption about future lighting power used to calculate the Design Energy Consumption must be documented so that the future installed lighting systems may be in compliance with these standards. Documentation must be provided to enable future lighting systems to use either the Prescriptive method or the Systems Performance method of subsection 401.3.
520.3 Documentation for future lighting systems that use subsection 401.3 shall be stated as a maximum adjusted lighting power for the tenant spaces. The adjusted lighting power allowance for tenant spaces shall account for the lighting power provided for the common areas of the building.
520.4 Documentation for future lighting systems that use subsection 401.3 shall be stated as a required lighting adjustment. The required lighting adjustment is the whole building lighting power assumed in order to calculate the Design Energy Consumption minus the ILPA value from Table 401.3.2c that was used to calculate the Energy Cost Budget. When the required lighting adjustment is less than zero, a complete lighting design must be developed for one or more representative tenant spaces, demonstrating acceptable lighting within the limits of the assumed lighting power allowance.
520.5 HVAC Systems and Equipment. If the HVAC system is not completely specified in the plans, the Design Energy Consumption shall be based on reasonable assumptions about the construction of future HVAC systems and equipment. These assumptions shall be documented so that future HVAC systems and equipment may be in compliance with these standards.
§ 434.521
The simulation tool.
521.1 Annual energy consumption shall be simulated with a multi-zone, 8760 hours per year building energy model. The model shall account for:
521.1.1 The dynamic heat transfer of the building envelope such as solar and internal gains;
521.1.2 Equipment efficiencies as a function of load and climate;
521.1.3 Lighting and HVAC system controls and distribution systems by simulating the whole building;
521.1.4 The operating schedule of the building including night setback during various times of the year; and
521.1.5 Energy consumption information at a level necessary to determine the Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Cost through the appropriate utility rate schedules.
521.1.6 While the simulation tool should simulate an entire year on an hour by hour basis (8760 hours), programs that approximate this dynamic analysis procedure and provide equivalent results are acceptable.
521.1.7 Simulation tools shall be selected for their ability to simulate accurately the relevant features of the building in question, as shown in the tool's documentation. For example, a single-zone model shall not be used to simulate a large, multi-zone building, and a steady-state model such as the degree-day method shall not be used to simulate buildings when equipment efficiency or performance is significantly affected by the dynamic patterns of
weather, solar radiation, and occupancy. Relevant energy-related features shall be addressed by a model such as daylighting, atriums or sunspaces, night ventilation or thermal storage, chilled water storage or heat recovery, active or passive solar systems, zoning and controls of heating and cooling systems, and ground-coupled buildings. In addition, models shall be capable of translating the Design Energy Consumption into energy cost using actual utility rate schedules with the coincidental electrical demand of a building. Examples of public domain models capable of handling such complex building systems and energy cost translations available in the United States are DOE—2.1C and BLAST 3.0 and in Canada, Energy Systems Analysis Series.
521.1.8 All simulation tools shall use scientifically justifiable documented techniques and procedures for modeling building loads, systems, and equipment. The algorithms used in the program shall have been verified by comparison with experimental measurements, loads, systems, and equipment.

# Subpart F—Building Energy Compliance Alternative
§ 434.601
General.
601.1 This subpart provides an alternative path for compliance with the standards that allow for greater flexibility in the design of energy efficient buildings using an annual energy use method. This path provides an opportunity for the use of innovative designs, materials, and equipment such as daylighting, passive solar heating, and heat recovery, that may not be adequately evaluated by methods found in subpart D.
601.2 The Building Energy Compliance Alternative shall be used with subpart C and subpart D, 401.1, 401.2, 401.3.4 and in conjunction with the minimum requirements found in subsections 402.1, 402.2, and 402.3., 403.1, 403.2.1-7, 403.2.9 and 404.
601.3 Compliance under this section is demonstrated by showing that the calculated annual energy usage for the Proposed Design is less than or equal to a calculated Energy Use Budget. (See Figure 601.3, Building Energy Compliance Alternative). The analytical procedures in this subpart are only for determining design compliance, and are not to be used either to predict, document or verify annual energy consumption.
ER06OC00.017
601.4 Compliance under the Building Energy Use Budget method requires a detailed energy analysis, using a conventional simulation tool, of the Proposed Design. A life cycle cost analysis shall be used to select the fuel source for the HVAC systems, service hot water, and process loads from available alternatives. The Annual Energy Consumption of the Proposed Design with the life cycle cost-effective fuel selection is calculated to determine the modeled energy consumption, called the Design Energy Use.
601.5 The Design Energy Use is defined as the energy that is consumed within the five foot line of a proposed building per ft
2
over a 24-hour day, 365-
day year period and specified operating hours. The calculated Design Energy Use is then compared to a calculated Energy Use Budget.
601.6
Compliance.
The Energy Use Budget is determined by calculating the annual energy usage for a Reference or Prototype Building that is configured to comply with the provisions of subpart E for such buildings, except that the fuel source(s) of the Prototype or Reference Building shall be the same life cycle cost-effective source(s) selected for the Proposed Design. If the Design Energy Use is less than or equal to the Energy Use Budget then the proposed design complies with these standards.
601.7 This section provides instructions for determining the Design Energy Use and for calculating the Energy Use Budget. The Energy Use Budget is the highest allowable calculated annual energy consumption for a specified building design. Designers are encouraged to design buildings whose Design Energy Use is lower than the Energy Use Budget.
§ 434.602
Determination of the annual energy budget.
602.1 The Energy Use Budget shall be calculated for the appropriate Prototype or Reference Building in accordance with the procedures prescribed in subsection 502 with the following exceptions: The Energy Use Budget shall be stated in units of Btu/ft
2
/yr and the simulation tool shall segregate the calculated energy consumption by fuel type producing an Energy Use Budget for each fuel (the fuel selections having been made by a life cycle cost analysis in determining the proposed design).
602.2 The Energy Use Budget is calculated similarly for the Reference or Prototype Building using equation 602.2.

are the energy conversion factors given in Table 602.2, Fuel Conversion Factors for Computing Design Annual Energy Uses. In lieu of case by case calculation of the Energy Use Budget, the designer may construct Energy Use Budget tables for the combinations of energy source(s) that may be considered in a set of project designs, such as electric heating, electric service water, and gas cooling or oil heating, gas service water and electric cooling. The values in such optional Energy Use Budget tables shall be equal to or less than the corresponding Energy Use Budgets calculated on a case by case basis according to this section. Energy Use Budget tables shall be constructed to correspond to the climatic regions and building types in accordance with provisions for Prototype or Reference Building models in subpart E of this part.

Note:
At specific locations where the energy source Btu content varies significantly from the value presented above then the local fuel value may be used provided there is supporting documentation from the fuel source supplier stating this actual energy value and varifying that this value will remain consistent for the foreseeable future. The fuel content for fuels not given this table shall be determined from the best available source.
§ 434.603
Determination of the design energy use.
603.1 The Design Energy Use shall be calculated by modeling the Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, and simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Use Budget, but with the design features that will be used in the final building design. The simulation tool used shall segregate the calculated energy consumption by fuel type giving an annual Design Energy Use for each fuel. The sum of the Design Energy Uses multiplied by the fuel conversion factors in Table 602.2 yields the Design Energy Use for the proposed design:

603.2
Required Life Cycle Cost Analysis for Fuel Selection.
603.2.1 Fuel sources selected for the Proposed Design and Prototype or Reference buildings shall be determined by considering the energy cost and other costs and cost savings that occur during the expected economic life of the alternative.
603.2.2 The designer shall use the procedures set forth in subpart A of 10 CFR part 436 to make this determination. The fuel selection life cycle cost analysis shall include the following steps:
603.2.2.1 Determine the feasible alternatives for energy sources of the Proposed Design's HVAC systems, service hot water, and process loads.
603.2.2.2 Model the Proposed Design including the alternative HVAC and service water systems and conduct an annual energy analysis for each fuel source alternative using the simulation tool specified in this section. The annual energy analysis shall be computed on a monthly basis in conformance with subpart E with the exception that all process loads shall be included in the calculation. Separate the output of the analysis by fuel type.
603.2.2.3 Determine the unit price of each fuel using information from the utility or other reliable local source. During rapid changes in fuel prices it is recommended that an average fuel price for the previous twelve months be used in lieu of the current price. Calculate the annual energy cost of each energy source alternative in accordance with procedures in subpart E for the Design Energy Cost. Estimate the initial cost of the HVAC and service water systems and other initial costs such as energy distribution lines and service connection fees associated with each fuel source alternative. Estimate other costs and benefits for each alternative including, but not necessarily limited to, annual maintenance and repair, periodic and one time major repairs and replacements and salvage of the energy and service water systems. Cost estimates shall be prepared using professionally recognized cost estimating tools, guides and techniques.
603.2.2.4 Perform a life cycle cost analysis using the procedure specified in subsection 603.2.
603.2.2.5 Compare the total life cycle cost of each energy source alternative. The alternative with the lowest total life cycle cost shall be chosen as the energy source for the proposed design.
§ 434.604
Compliance.
604.1 Compliance with this section is demonstrated if the Design Energy Use is equal to or less than the Energy Use Budget.
ER06OC00.031
604.2 The energy consumption shall be measured at the building five foot line for all fuels. Energy consumed from non-depletable energy sources and heat recovery systems shall not be included in the Design Energy Use calculations. The thermal efficiency of fixtures, equipment, systems or plants in the proposed design shall be simulated by the selected calculation tool.
§ 434.605
Standard Calculation Procedure.
605.1 The Standard Calculation Procedure consists of methods and assumptions for calculating the Energy Use Budgets for Prototype and Reference Buildings and the Energy Use for the Proposed Design. In order to maintain consistency between the Energy Use Budgets and the Design Energy Use, the input assumptions stated in subsection 510.2 are to be used.
605.2 The terms Energy Cost Budget and Design Energy Cost or Design Energy Consumption used in subpart E of this part correlate to Energy Use Budget and Design Energy Use, respectively, in subpart F of this part.
§ 434.606
Simulation tool.
606.1 The criteria established in subsection 521 for the selection of a simulation tool shall be followed when using the compliance path prescribed in subpart F of this part.
§ 434.607
Life cycle cost analysis criteria.
607.1 The following life cycle cost criteria applies to the fuel selection requirements of this subpart and to option life cycle cost analyses performed to evaluate energy conservation design alternatives. The fuel source(s) selection shall be made in accordance with the requirements of subpart A of 10 CFR part 436. When performing optional life cycle cost analyses of energy conservation opportunities the designer may use the life cycle cost procedures of subpart A of 10 CFR part 436 or OMB Circular 1-94 or an equivalent procedure that meets the assumptions listed below:
607.1.1 The economic life of the Prototype Building and Proposed Design shall be 25 years. Anticipated replacements or renovations of energy related features and systems in the Prototype or Reference Building and Proposed Design during this period shall be included in their respective life cycle cost calculations.
607.1.2 The designer shall follow established professional cost estimating practices when determining the costs and benefits associated with the energy related features of the Prototype or Reference Building and Proposed Design.
607.1.3 All costs shall be expressed in current dollars. General inflation shall be disregarded. Differential escalation of prices (prices estimated to rise faster or slower than general inflation) for energy used in the life cycle cost calculations shall be those in effect at the time of the latest “Annual Energy Outlook” (DOE/EIA-0383) as published by the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration.
607.1.4 The economic effects of taxes, depreciation and other factors not consistent with the practices of subpart A of 10 CFR part 436 shall not be included in the life cycle cost calculation.

§ 435.2
Definitions.
For purposes of this part, the following terms, phrases and words shall be defined as follows:
Construction cost
means all costs associated with the construction of a new Federal building. It includes, but not limited to, the cost of preliminary planning, engineering, architectural, permitting, fiscal, and economic investigations and studies, surveys, designs, plans, working drawings, specifications, procedures, and other similar actions necessary for the construction of a new Federal building. It does not include the cost of acquiring the land.
Design for construction
means the stage when the energy efficiency and sustainability details (such as insulation levels, HVAC systems, water-using

# Source:
89 FR 35434, May 1, 2024, unless otherwise noted.
§ 435.200
Scope 1 Fossil fuel-generated energy consumption requirement.
(a)
New EISA-Subject buildings.
(1) New Federal buildings that are low-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after May 1, 2025, must be designed to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if:
(i) For all leased buildings, the construction cost of the new building exceeds GSA's Annual Prospectus Thresholds that are found at
www.gsa.gov/real-estate/design-construction/gsa-annual-prospectus-thresholds.
(ii) For all Federally owned non-public buildings, the cost of the building is at least $2,500,000 (in 2007 dollars, adjusted for inflation). For the purposes of calculating this threshold, agencies must set the Bureau of Labor and Statistics CPI Inflation calculator to $2,500,000 in October of 2006 (to represent the value of the original cost threshold) and then set for October of the FY during which the design for construction of the project began or is set to begin.
(b)
Major renovations of EISA-Subject buildings.
(1) Major renovations to Federal buildings that are low-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after May 1, 2025, must be designed to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if the cost of the major renovation is at least $2,500,000 (in 2007 dollars, adjusted for inflation). For the purposes of calculating this threshold, projects should set the Bureau of Labor and Statistics CPI Inflation calculator to $2,500,000 in October of 2006 (to represent the value of the original cost threshold) and then set for October of the FY during which the design for construction of the project began or is set to begin.
(2) This subpart applies only to the portions of the proposed building or proposed building systems that are being renovated and to the extent that the scope of the renovation permits compliance with the applicable requirements in this subpart. Unaltered portions of the proposed building or proposed building systems are not required to comply with this subpart.
(3) For leased buildings, this subpart applies to major renovations only if the proposed building was originally built for the use of any Federal agency, including for the purpose of being leased by a Federal agency.
(c)
Federal buildings that are of the type included in Appendix A of this subpart
—(1)
New Construction and Major Renovations of all Scope 1 Fossil Fuel-Using Systems in an EISA-Subject Building.
(i) Design for construction began during FY 2024 through FY 2029. For new construction or major renovations of all fossil fuel-using systems in an EISA-subject building, for which design for construction or renovation, as applicable, began during FY 2024 through 2029, the Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building, based on the building design and calculated according to § 435.201(a), must not exceed the value identified in Tables A-1a to A-2a (if targets based on Scope 1 emissions are used) or Tables A-1b to A-2b (if targets based on kBtu of fossil fuel usage are used) of Appendix A of this subpart for the associated building type, climate zone, and fiscal year in which design for construction began.
(A) Federal agencies may apply a shift adjustment multiplier to the values in Tables A-1a to A-2a or Tables A-1b to A-2b based on the following baseline hours of operation assumed in Tables A-1a to A-2a or Tables A-1b to A-2b.
(B) To calculate the shift adjustment multiplier, agencies shall estimate the number of shifts for their new building and multiply by the appropriate factor shown below in Table 1 for their building type. The Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption target for the building would be the value in either Tables A-1a to A-2a or Tables A-1b to A-2b multiplied by the multiplier calculated in the previous sentence.

(ii) Design for construction began during or after FY 2030. For new construction and major renovations of all Scope 1 fossil fuel-using systems in an EISA-subject building, the Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building, based on building design and calculated according to § 435.201(a), must be zero.
(2) Major Renovations of a Scope 1 Fossil Fuel-Using Building System or Component within an EISA-Subject Building shall follow the renovation requirements in section 4.2.1.3 of the applicable building baseline energy efficiency standards listed in § 435.4 substituting the term “design for construction” with “design for renovation” for the relevant date, and shall replace all equipment that is included in the renovation with all electric or non-fossil fuel-using ENERGY STAR or FEMP designated products as defined in § 436.42. For component level renovations, Agencies shall replace all equipment that is part of the renovation with all electric or non-fossil fuel-using ENERGY STAR or FEMP designated products as defined in § 436.42.
(d)
EISA-Subject buildings that are of the type not included in Appendix A of this subpart
—(1)
Process load buildings.
For building types that are not included in any of the building types listed in Tables A-1a to A-2a or A-1b to A-2b of appendix A of this subpart, or for building types in these tables that contain significant process loads, Federal agencies must select the applicable building type, climate zone, and fiscal year in which design for construction began from Tables A-1a to A-2a or A-1b to A-2b of appendix A of this subpart that most closely corresponds to the proposed building without the process load. The estimated Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the process load must be added to the maximum allowable Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the applicable building type for the appropriate fiscal year and climate zone to
calculate the maximum allowable Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption for the building. The same estimated Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the process load that is added to the maximum allowable Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the applicable building must also be used in determining the Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building.
(2)
Mixed-use buildings.
For buildings that combine two or more building types with process loads or, alternatively, that combine one or more building types with process loads with one or more building types in Tables A-1a toA-2a or A-1b to A-2b of appendix A of this subpart, the maximum allowable Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building is equal to the averaged process load building values determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the applicable building type values in Tables A-1a toA-2a or A-1b to A-2b of appendix A of this subpart, weighted by floor area. Equation 1 shall be used for mixed use buildings.
Equation 1: Scope 1 Fossil fuel generated energy consumption for a mixed-use building = the sum across all building uses of (the fraction of total floor building floor area for building use i times the allowable fossil fuel-generated energy consumption for building use i)
Equation 1 may be rewritten as:
ER01MY24.013
§ 435.201
Scope 1 Fossil fuel-generated energy consumption determination.
(a) The Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of a proposed design is calculated as follows:
Equation: Scope 1 Fossil Fuel-Generated Energy Consumption = Direct Fossil Fuel Consumption of Proposed Building/Floor Area
Where:
Direct Scope 1 Fossil Fuel-Generated Energy Consumption of Proposed Building
equals the total site Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building calculated in accordance with the method required in § 435.5(d), and measured in thousands of British thermal units per year (kBtu/yr), except that this term does not include fossil fuel consumption for emergency electricity generation. Agencies must include all on-site fossil fuel use or Scope 1 emissions associated with non-emergency generation from backup generators (such as those for peak shaving or peak shifting). Any energy generation or Scope 1 emissions associated with biomass fuels are excluded. Any emissions associated with natural gas for alternatively fueled vehicles (“AFVs”) (or any other alternative fuel defined at 42 U.S.C. 13211 that is provided at a Federal building) is excluded. For buildings with manufacturing or industrial process loads, such process loads shall be accounted for in the analysis for the building's fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions, but the process loads are not subject to the phase down targets.
Floor Area
is the floor area of the structure that is enclosed by exterior walls, including finished or unfinished basements, finished or heated space in attics, and garages if they have an uninsulated wall in common with the house. Not included are crawl spaces, and sheds and other buildings that are not attached to the house.

(c) Each Federal agency shall assume that the price of energy or water in the base year is the actual price charged for energy or water delivered to the Federal building and may use actual component prices as provided by the energy or water supplier.
(d) Each Federal agency shall assume that the appropriate study period is as follows:
(1) For evaluating and ranking alternative retrofits for an existing Federal building, the study period is the expected life of the retrofit, or 40 years from the beginning of beneficial use, whichever is shorter.
(2) For determining the life cycle costs or net savings of mutually exclusive alternatives for a given building energy system or building water system (e.g., alternative designs for a particular system or size of a new or retrofit building energy system or building water system), a uniform study period for all alternatives shall be assumed which is equal to—
(i) The estimated life of the mutually exclusive alternative having the longest life, not to exceed 40 years from the
beginning of beneficial use with appropriate replacement and salvage values for each of the other alternatives; or
(ii) The lowest common multiple of the expected lives of the alternative, not to exceed 40 from the beginning of beneficial use with appropriate replacement and salvage values for each alternative.
(3) For evaluating alternative designs for a new Federal building, the study period extends from the base year through the expected life of the building or 40 years from the beginning of beneficial use, whichever is shorter.
(e) Each Federal agency shall assume that the expected life of any building energy system or building water system is the period of service without major renewal or overhaul, as estimated by a qualified engineer or architect, as appropriate, or any other reliable source except that the period of service of a building energy or water system shall not be deemed to exceed the expected life of the owned building, or the effective remaining term of the leased building (taking into account renewal options likely to be exercised).
(f) Each Federal agency may assume that investment costs are a lump sum occurring at the beginning of the base year, or may discount future investment costs to present value using the appropriate present worth factors under paragraph (a) of this section.
(g) Each Federal agency may assume that energy or water costs and non-fuel or non-water operation and maintenance costs begin to accrue at the beginning of the base year or when actually projected to occur.
(h) Each Federal agency may assume that costs occur in a lump sum at any time within the year in which they are incurred.
(i) This section shall not apply to calculations of estimated simple payback time under § 436.22 of this part.

§ 436.15
Formatting cost data.
In establishing cost data under §§ 436.16 and 436.17 and measuring cost effectiveness by the modes of analysis described by § 436.19 through § 436.22, a format for accomplishing the analysis which includes all required input data and assumptions shall be used. Subject to § 436.18(b), Federal agencies are encouraged to use worksheets or computer software referenced in the Life Cycle Cost Manual for the Federal Energy Management Program.
§ 436.16
Establishing non-fuel and non-water cost categories.
(a) The relevant non-fuel cost categories are—
(1) Investment costs;
(2) Non-fuel operation and maintenance cost;
(3) Replacement cost; and
(4) Salvage value.
(b) The relevant non-water cost categories are—
(1) Investment costs;
(2) Non-water operation and maintenance cost;
(3) Replacement cost; and
(4) Salvage value.
(c) The present value of recurring costs is the product of the base year value of recurring costs as multiplied by the appropriate uniform present worth factor under § 436.14, or as calculated by computer software indicated in § 436.18(b) and used with the official discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under § 436.14. When recurring costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value of recurring costs over the delay, calculated using the appropriate uniform present worth factor for the period of the delay, from the present value of recurring costs over the study period or, if using computer software, indicate a delayed beneficial occupancy date.
(d) The present value of non-recurring cost under § 436.16(a) is the product of the non-recurring costs as multiplied by appropriate single present worth factors under § 436.14 for the respective years in which the costs are expected to be incurred, or as calculated by computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under § 436.14.
[55 FR 48220, Nov. 20, 1990, as amended at 61 FR 32650, June 25, 1996]
§ 436.17
Establishing energy or water cost data.
(a) Each Federal agency shall establish energy costs in the base year by multiplying the total units of energy used in the base year by the price per unit of energy in the base year as determined in accordance with § 436.14(c).
(b) When energy costs begin to accrue in the base year, the present value of energy costs over the study period is the product of energy costs in the base year as established under § 436.17(a), multiplied by the appropriate modified uniform present worth factor adjusted for energy price escalation for the applicable region, sector, fuel type, and study period consistent with § 436.14, or as calculated by computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under § 436.14. When energy costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value of energy costs over the delay, calculated using the adjusted, modified uniform present worth factor for the period of delay, from the present value of energy costs over the study period or, if using computer software, indicate a delayed beneficial occupancy date.
(c) Each Federal agency shall establish water costs in the base year by multiplying the total units of water used in the base year by the price per unit of water in the base year as determined in accordance with § 436.14(c).
(d) When water costs begin to accrue in the base year, the present value of water costs over the study period is the product of water costs in the base year as established under § 436.17(a), or as calculated by computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official discount rate and assumptions under § 436.14. When water costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value of water costs over the delay, calculated using the uniform present worth factor for the period of delay, from the present value of water costs over the study period or, if using computer software, indicate a delayed beneficial occupancy date.
[55 FR 48220, Nov. 20, 1990, as amended at 61 FR 32650, June 25, 1996]
§ 436.18
Measuring cost-effectiveness.
(a) In accordance with this section, each Federal agency shall measure cost-effectiveness by combining cost data established under §§ 436.16 and 436.17 in the appropriate mode of analysis as described in § 436.19 through § 436.22.
(b) Federal agencies performing LCC analysis on computers shall use either the Federal Buildings Life Cycle Costing (FBLCC) software provided by DOE or software consistent with this subpart.
(c) Replacement of a building energy or water system with an energy or water conservation measure by retrofit to an existing Federal building or by substitution in the design for a new Federal building shall be deemed cost-effective if—
(1) Life cycle costs, as described by § 436.19, are estimated to be lower; or
(2) Net savings, as described by § 436.20, are estimated to be positive; or
(3) The savings-to-investment ratio, as described by § 436.21, is estimated to be greater than one; or
(4) The adjusted internal rate of return, as described by § 436.22, is estimated to be greater than the discount rate as set by DOE.
(d) As a rough measure, each Federal agency may determine estimated simple payback time under § 436.23, which indicates whether a retrofit is likely to be cost effective under one of the four calculation methods referenced in § 436.18(c). An energy or water conservation measure alternative is likely to be cost-effective if estimated payback time is significantly less than the useful life of that system, and of the Federal building in which it is to be installed.
(e) Mutually exclusive alternatives for a given building energy or water system, considered in determining such matters as the optimal size of a solar energy system, the optimal thickness of insulation, or the best choice of double-glazing or triple-glazing for windows, shall be compared and evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs or net savings over equivalent study periods. The alternative which is estimated to result in the lowest life cycle costs or the highest net savings shall be deemed the most cost-effective because it tends
to minimize the life cycle cost of Federal building.
(f) When available appropriations will not permit all cost-effective energy or water conservation measures to be undertaken, they shall be ranked in descending order of their savings-to-investment ratios, or their adjusted internal rate of return, to establish priority. If available appropriations cannot be fully exhausted for a fiscal year by taking all budgeted energy or water conservation measures according to their rank, the set of energy or water conservation measures that will maximize net savings for available appropriations should be selected.
(g) Alternative building designs for new Federal buildings shall be evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs. The alternative design which results in the lowest life cycle costs for a given new building shall be deemed the most cost-effective.
[55 FR 48220, Nov. 20, 1990, as amended at 61 FR 32650, June 25, 1996]
§ 436.19
Life cycle costs.
Life cycle costs are the sum of the present values of—
(a) Investment costs, less salvage values at the end of the study period;
(b) Non-fuel operation and maintenance costs:
(c) Replacement costs less salvage costs of replaced building systems; and
(d) Energy and/or water costs.
[55 FR 48220, Nov. 20, 1990, as amended at 61 FR 32651, June 25, 1996]
§ 436.20
Net savings.
For a retrofit project, net savings may be found by subtracting life cycle costs based on the proposed project from life cycle costs based on not having it. For a new building design, net savings is the difference between the life cycle costs of an alternative design and the life cycle costs of the basic design.
§ 436.21
Savings-to-investment ratio.
The savings-to-investment ratio is the ratio of the present value savings to the present value costs of an energy or water conservation measure. The numerator of the ratio is the present value of net savings in energy or water and non-fuel or non-water operation and maintenance costs attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation measure. The denominator of the ratio is the present value of the net increase in investment and replacement costs less salvage value attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation measure.
[61 FR 32651, June 25, 1996]
§ 436.22
Adjusted internal rate of return.
The adjusted internal rate of return is the overall rate of return on an energy or water conservation measure. It is calculated by subtracting 1 from the nth root of the ratio of the terminal value of savings to the present value of costs, where n is the number of years in the study period. The numerator of the ratio is calculated by using the discount rate to compound forward to the end of the study period the yearly net savings in energy or water and non-fuel or non-water operation and maintenance costs attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation measure. The denominator of the ratio is the present value of the net increase in investment and replacement costs less salvage value attributable to the proposed energy or water conservation measure.
[61 FR 32651, June 25, 1996]
§ 436.23
Estimated simple payback time.
The estimated simple payback time is the number of years required for the cumulative value of energy or water cost savings less future non-fuel or non-water costs to equal the investment costs of the building energy or water system, without consideration of discount rates.
[61 FR 32651, June 25, 1996]
§ 436.24
Uncertainty analyses.
If particular items of cost data or timing of cash flows are uncertain and are not fixed under § 436.14, Federal agencies may examine the impact of uncertainty on the calculation of life cycle cost effectiveness or the assignment of rank order by conducting additional analyses using any standard engineering economics method such as
sensitivity and probabilistic analysis. If additional analysis casts substantial doubt on the life cycle cost analysis results, a Federal agency should consider obtaining more reliable data or eliminating the building energy or water system alternative.

(e) A firm not designated by DOE or a Federal agency pursuant to the procedures in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section as qualified to provide energy cost savings performance services shall receive a written decision and may request a debriefing.
(f) Any firm receiving an adverse final decision under this section shall apply to the Board of Contract Appeals of the General Services Administration in order to exhaust administrative remedies.
§ 436.33
Procedures and methods for contractor selection.
(a)
Competitive selection.
Competitive selections based on solicitation of firms are subject to the following procedures—
(1) With respect to a particular proposed energy cost savings performance project, Federal agencies shall publish a Commerce Business Daily notice which synopsizes the proposed contract action.
(2) Each competitive solicitation—
(i) Shall request technical and price proposals and the text of any third-party financing agreement from interested firms;
(ii) Shall consider DOE model solicitations and should use them to the maximum extent practicable;
(iii) May provide for a two-step selection process which allows Federal agencies to make an initial selection based, in part, on proposals containing estimated energy cost savings and energy unit savings, with contract award conditioned on confirmation through a detailed energy survey that the guaranteed energy cost savings are within a certain percentage (specified in the solicitation) of the estimated amount; and
(iv) May state that if the Federal agency requires a detailed energy survey which identifies life cycle cost effective energy conservation measures not in the initial proposal, the contract may include such measures.
(3) Based on its evaluation of the technical and price proposals submitted, any applicable financing agreement (including lease-acquisitions, if any), statements of qualifications submitted under § 436.32 of this subpart, and any other information determines to be relevant, the Federal agency may select a firm on a qualified list to conduct the project.
(4) If a proposed energy cost savings project involves a large facility with too many contiguously related buildings and other structures at one site for proposing firms to assume the costs of a preliminary energy survey of all such structures, the Federal agency—
(i) May request technical and price proposals for a representative sample of buildings and other structures and may select a firm to conduct the proposed project; and
(ii) After selection of a firm, but prior to award of an energy savings performance contract, may request the selected firm to submit technical and price proposals for all or some of the remaining buildings and other structures at the site and may include in the award for all or some of the remaining buildings and other structures.
(5) After selection under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section, but prior to award, a Federal agency may require the selectee to conduct a detailed energy survey to confirm that guaranteed energy cost savings are within a certain percentage (specified in the solicitation) of estimated energy cost savings in the selectee's proposal. If the detailed energy survey does not confirm that guaranteed energy savings are within the fixed percentage of estimated savings, the Federal agency may select another firm from those within the competitive range.
(b)
Unsolicited proposals.
Federal agencies may—
(1) Consider unsolicited energy savings performance contract proposals from firms on a qualified contractor list under this subpart which include
technical and price proposals and the text of any financing agreement (including a lease-acquisition) without regard to the requirements of 48 CFR 15.602 and 15.602-2(a)(1); 48 CFR 15.603; and 48 CFR 15.607(a), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5).
(2) Reject an unsolicited proposal that is too narrow because it does not address the potential for significant energy conservation measures from other than those measures in the proposal.
(3) After requiring a detailed energy survey, if appropriate, and determining that technical and price proposals are adequate, award a contract to a firm on a qualified contractor list under this subpart on the basis of an unsolicited proposal, provided that the Federal agency complies with the following procedures—
(i) An award may not be made to the firm submitting the unsolicited proposal unless the Federal agency first publishes a notice in the Commerce Business Daily acknowledging receipt of the proposal and inviting other firms on the qualified list to submit competing proposals.
(ii) Except for unsolicited proposals submitted in response to a published general statement of agency needs, no award based on such an unsolicited proposal may be made in instances in which the Federal agency is planning the acquisition of an energy conservation measure through an energy savings performance contract.
(c)
Certified cost or pricing data.
(1) Energy savings performance contracts under this part are firm fixed-price contracts.
(2) Pursuant to the authority provided under section 304A(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1049, the heads of procuring activities shall waive the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data. However, this does not exempt offerors from submitting information (including pricing information) required by the Federal agency to ensure the impartial and comprehensive evaluation of proposals.

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, Federal agencies may enter into a multiyear energy savings performance contract for a period not to exceed 25 years, as authorized by 42 U.S.C. 8287, without funding of cancellation charges, if:
(1) The multiyear energy savings performance contract was awarded in a competitive manner using the procedures and methods established by this subpart;
(2) Funds are available and adequate for payment of the scheduled energy cost for the first fiscal year of the multiyear energy savings performance contract;
(3) Thirty days before the award of any multiyear energy savings performance contract that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $750,000, the head of the awarding Federal agency gives written notification of the proposed contract and the proposed cancellation ceiling for the contract to the appropriate authorizing and appropriating committees of the Congress; and
(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the multiyear energy savings performance contract is subject to 48 CFR part 17, subpart 17.1, including the requirement that the contracting officer establish a cancellation ceiling.
(b) Neither this subpart nor any provision of the Act requires, prior to contract award or as a condition of a contract award, that a Federal agency have appropriated funds available and adequate to pay for the total costs of an energy savings performance contract for the term of such contract.
§ 436.35
Standard terms and conditions.
(a)
Mandatory requirements.
In addition to contractual provisions otherwise required by the Act or this subpart, any energy savings performance contract shall contain clauses—
(1) Authorizing modification, replacement, or changes of equipment, at no cost to the Federal agency, with the prior approval of the contracting officer who shall consider the expected level of performance after such modification, replacement or change;
(2) Providing for the disposition of title to systems and equipment;
(3) Requiring prior approval by the contracting officer of any financing agreements (including lease-acquisitions) and amendments to such an agreement entered into after contract award for the purpose of financing the acquisition of energy conservation measures;
(4) Providing for an annual energy audit and identifying who shall conduct such an audit, consistent with § 436.37 of this subpart; and
(5) Providing for a guarantee of energy cost savings to the Federal agency, and establishing payment schedules reflecting such guarantee.
(b)
Third party financing.
If there is third party financing, then an energy savings performance contract may contain a clause:
(1) Permitting the financing source to perfect a security interest in the installed energy conservation measures, subject to and subordinate to the rights of the Federal agency; and
(2) Protecting the interests of a Federal agency and a financing source, by authorizing a contracting officer in appropriate circumstances to require a contractor who defaults on an energy savings performance contract or who does not cure the failure to make timely payments, to assign to the financing source, if willing and able, the contractor's rights and responsibilities under an energy savings performance contract;
§ 436.36
Conditions of payment.
(a) Any amount paid by a Federal agency pursuant to any energy savings performance contract entered into under this subpart may be paid only from funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the agency for the payment of energy expenses and related operation and maintenance expenses which would have been incurred without an energy savings performance contract. The amount the agency would have paid is equal to:
(1) The energy baseline under the energy savings performance contract (adjusted if appropriate under § 436.37), multiplied by the unit energy cost; and
(2) Any related operations and maintenance cost prior to implementation of energy conservation measures, adjusted for increases in labor and material price indices.
(b) Federal agencies may incur obligations pursuant to energy savings performance contracts to finance energy conservation measures provided guaranteed energy cost savings exceed the contractor's debt service requirements.
§ 436.37
Annual energy audits.
(a) After contractor implementation of energy conservation measures and annually thereafter during the contract term, an annual energy audit shall be conducted by the Federal agency or the contractor as determined by the contract. The annual energy audit shall verify the achievement of annual energy cost savings performance guarantees provided by the contractor.
(b) The energy baseline is subject to adjustment due to changes beyond the contractor's control, such as—
(1) Physical changes to building;
(2) Hours of use or occupancy;
(3) Area of conditioned space;
(4) Addition or removal of energy consuming equipment or systems;
(5) Energy consuming equipment operating conditions;
(6) Weather (i.e., cooling and heating degree days); and
(7) Utility rates.
(c) In the solicitation or in the contract, Federal agencies shall specify requirements for annual energy audits, the energy baseline, and baseline adjustment procedures.
§ 436.38
Terminating contracts.
(a) Except as otherwise provided by this subpart, termination of energy savings performance contracts shall be subject to the termination procedures of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in 48 CFR part 49.
(b) In the event an energy savings performance contract is terminated for the convenience of a Federal agency, the termination liability of the Federal agency shall not exceed the cancellation ceiling set forth in the contract, for the year in which the contract is terminated.

§ 436.100
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to provide guidelines for use by Federal agencies in their development of overall 10-year energy management plans to establish energy conservation goals, to reduce the rate of energy consumption, to promote the efficient use of energy, to promote switching for petroleum-based fuels and natural gas to coal and other energy sources, to provide a methodology for reporting their progress in meeting the goals of those plans, and to promote emergency energy conservation planning to assuage the impact of a sudden disruption in the supply of oil-based fuels, natural gas or electricity. The plan is intended to provide the cornerstone for a program to conserve energy in the general operations of an agency.
(b)
Scope.
This subpart applies to all general operations of Federal agencies and is applicable to management of all energy used by Federal agencies that is excluded from coverage pursuant to section 543(a)(2) of part 3 of title V of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 8251-8261).

Appendix A to Part 436—Energy Conservation Standards for General Operations [Reserved]
Pt. 436, App. B

# Appendix B to Part 436—Goal Setting Methodology
In establishing and updating agency goals for energy conservation, the following methodology or an equivalent method should be utilized:
(a) For overall energy consumption—
(1) An analysis shall be made to determine what factors have the most significant impact upon the amount of each fuel type used by the agency in performing functions in support of its overall mission. Consideration is to be given, but not limited to, the following factors: Number of people using energy; number of vehicles using gasoline; amounts of other equipment using energy; tempo of operations (one, two, or three shifts); the type of operations (degree of equipment or labor intensity); equipment fuel limitations; environmental conditions (tropical versus arctic, etc.); budget levels for fuel, operations, maintenance, and equipment acquisition; and phase-out schedule (of older equipment or plants which may be inefficient). After identifying these factors, a further analysis shall be made to identify any projected workload changes in the quality or quantity of these factors on a yearly basis up to 1990.
(2) Based upon the analysis in (a)(1) and an evaluation of available information on past energy usage, a baseline of energy use by fuel type by functional category shall be established beginning with FY 1975. In addition to “General Transportation,” other functional categories should be selected to enhance energy management. Total fuel use for a particular activity may be allocated to the functional category for which the preponderance of fuel is used. Figure B-1 is an example of one such baseline.
EC04OC91.241
This example shows an increase in energy use, for a specific fuel type, during the period 1975-1981, with a further increase from 1981 to 1984 and a leveling off and no growth from 1984-1990. A justification, based on factors as discussed above, shall accompany each baseline.
(3) Thereafter, analyses should be made of the measures available for reducing the energy consumption profiles without adverse impact on mission accomplishment. Finding viable opportunities for reducing energy use, increasing energy efficiency and switching energy sources, will require consultation with specialists in the fields of operations, maintenance, engineering, design, and economics, and consideration of the measures identified in appendix C. The DOE Federal Energy Management Programs Office can, upon request, provide information on where such resources can be located. Once these measures are identified, they are to be incorporated into a time-phased investment program, (using where appropriate, the life cycle costing factors and methodology in subpart A of this part). If investment and other costs for implementing a measure are insignificant, a Federal agency may presume that a measure is cost-effective without further analysis. An estimate must then be made as to the lead time required to implement the program and realize energy reductions.
Figure B-2 shows a summarized investment program, which should be accompanied by a detailed description of the measures, projects, and programs making up the total planned investments for each year. This summary need not be by function or fuel type.
EC04OC91.242
These analyses should enable the agency to project an energy consumption goal, with the assumption that funds for executing the planned projects will be approved. Figure B-3 shows a new energy use profile, with planned initiatives and related investments taken into consideration, and the resulting goal entitled “Energy Use With A Plan” superimposed on Figure B-1. Included are the anticipated effects on consumption cause by improvements in energy efficiency and fuel switching.
EC04OC91.243
A comparison of these projections will show the energy use avoidance resulting from the investment program as depicted in Figure B-2. Using the prices of fuel contained in appendix C to subpart A, the dollars saved can be projected against the dollars invested. Life cycle costing methodology pursuant to subpart A, will be used to determine priorities for submitting individual initiatives into the appropriate budget year.
(b) For energy efficiencies—Energy efficiency baselines and goals for each fuel type shall be calculated using the same consumption factors and similar methodology to that outlined in paragraph (a). Energy consumption by fuel type shall be linked to mission through the functional categories listed in § 436.106(a)(2). This will identify a rate which will indicate energy efficiency trends. This linkage may be accomplished through the following algorithm:
Step 1:
Determine functional categories from section 436.106(a)(2) which best describe the Agency overall mission.
Step 2:
Determine types of fuels used to support the functions selected in Step 1.
Step 3:
Determine quantities of fuel consumed or planned for consumption over a specific period of time.
Step 4:
Determine quantity of output of function for same period of time used in Step 3. Quantify output in a standard measure which best describes functional category.
Step 5:
Determine the energy efficiency ratio by dividing quantity from Step 4 by quantity from Step 3.
This ratio of fuel consumed to a unit measure of output will be used to develop a projection of a baseline and goals through 1990, and used in reporting variance. Examples of ratios that should be considered are:
• Production or industrial process type operations
Ton of product
Cu. ft. of natural gas
• Services, such as postal delivery
Customers served or
pounds delivered
Gallons of automotive
gasoline
• General transportation
Passenger miles
Gallons of automotive gasoline
• Training
Persons trained
or in training
Gallons of navy special
Agencies shall select one or more of these ratios, which shall be used throughout the planning period, or use more appropriate energy efficiency ratios, to describe their overall functions. Figure B-4 illustrates the planning baseline and goal resulting from this type of analysis.
EC04OC91.244
(c) For fuel switching—Fuel switching goals for gasoline other oil-based fuel and natural gas may be calculated as follows:
Step 1:
For each fiscal year, identify investments, where appropriate, in fuel switching
from gasoline, other oil-based fuel and natural gas to alternate renewable or nonrenewable fuel sources.
Step 2:
Project for each fiscal year, the avoidance in the use of gasoline, other oil-based fuel and natural gas resulting from previous fuel switching investments.
Completion of these steps will permit the formulation of charts such as that shown in Figure B-5.

# Appendix D to Part 436—Energy Program Conservation Elements
(a) In all successful energy conservation programs, certain key elements need to be present. The elements listed below must be incorporated into each agency conservation program and must be reflected in the 10-year plan prescribed in § 436.102. Those organizations that have already developed programs should review them to determine whether the present management systems incorporate these elements.
(1)
Top Management Control.
Top management must have a personal and sustained commitment to the program, provide active direction and motivation, and require regular review of overall energy usage at senior staff meetings.
(2)
Line Management Accountability.
Line managers must be accountable for the energy conservation performance of their organizations and should participate in establishing realistic goals and developing strategies and budgets to meet these goals.
(3)
Formal Planning.
An overall 10-year plan for the period 1980-1990 must be developed and formalized which sets forth performance-oriented conservation goals, including the categorized reduction in rates of energy consumption that the program is expected to realize. The plan will be supplemented by guidelines enumerating specific conservation procedures that will be followed. These procedures and initiatives must be life cycle cost-effective as well as energy efficient.
(4)
Goals.
Goals must be established in a measurable manner to answer questions of “Where are we?” “Where do we want to go?” “Are we getting there?” and “Are our initiatives for getting there life cycle cost-effective?”
(5)
Monitoring.
Progress must be reviewed periodically both at the agency headquarters and at local facility levels to identify program weakness or additional areas for conservation actions. Progress toward achievement of goals should be assessed, and explanations should be required for non-achievement or unusual variations in energy use. Monitoring should include personal inspections and staff visits, management information reporting and audits.
(6)
Using Technical Expertise.
Personnel with adequate technical background and knowledge of programmatic objectives should be used to help management set technical goals and parameters for efficient planning and implementation of energy conservation programs. These technicians should work in conjunction with the line managers who are accountable for both mission accomplishment and energy conservation.
(7)
Employee Awareness.
Employees must gain an awareness of energy conservation through formal training and employee information programs. They should be invited to participate in the process of developing an energy conservation program, and to submit definitive suggestions for conservation of energy.
(8)
Energy Emergency Planning.
Every energy management plan must provide for programs to respond to contingencies that may occur at the local, state or National level. Programs must be developed for potential energy emergency situations calling for reductions of 10 percent, 15 percent and 20 percent for up to 12 months. Emergency plans must be tested to ascertain their effectiveness.
(9)
Budgetary and Fiscal Support.
Resources necessary for the energy conservation program must be planned and provided for, and the fiscal systems adjusted to support energy management investments and information reporting.
(10)
Environmental Considerations.
Each agency shall fulfill its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act in developing its plan.

§ 440.1
Purpose and scope.
This part implements a weatherization assistance program to increase the energy efficiency of dwellings owned or occupied by low-income persons or to provide such persons renewable energy systems or technologies, reduce their total residential expenditures, and improve their health and safety, especially low-income persons who are particularly vulnerable such as the elderly, persons with disabilities, families with children, high residential energy users, and households with high energy burden.

§ 440.2
Administration of grants.
Grant awards under this part shall comply with applicable law including, without limitation, the requirements of:
(a) Executive Order 12372 entitled “Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs”, 48 FR 3130, and the DOE Regulation implementing this Executive Order entitled “Intergovernmental Review of Department of Energy Programs and Activities” (10 CFR part 1005);
(b) Office of Management and Budget Circular A-97, entitled “Rules and Regulations Permitting Federal Agencies to Provide Specialized or Technical Services to State and Local Units of Government under Title III of the Inter-Governmental Coordination Act of 1968;”
(c) Unless in conflict with provisions of this part, the DOE Financial Assistance Rule (10 CFR part 600); and
(d) Such other procedures applicable to this part as DOE may from time to time prescribe for the administration of financial assistance.
(e)(1) States, Tribes and their subawardees, including, but not limited to subrecipients, subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors that participate in the program established under this Part are required to treat all requests for information concerning applicants and recipients of WAP funds in a manner consistent with the Federal Government's treatment of information requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, including the privacy protections contained in Exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6). Under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6), information relating to an individual's eligibility application or the individual's participation in the program, such as name, address, or income information, are generally exempt from disclosure.
(2) A balancing test must be used in applying Exemption (b)(6) in order to determine:
(i) Whether a significant privacy interest would be invaded;
(ii) Whether the release of the information would further the public interest by shedding light on the operations or activities of the Government; and
(iii) Whether in balancing the privacy interests against the public interest, disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.
(3) A request for personal information including but not limited to the names, addresses, or income information of WAP applicants or recipients
would require the State or other service provider to balance a clearly defined public interest in obtaining this information against the individuals' legitimate expectation of privacy.
(4) Given a legitimate, articulated public interest in the disclosure, States and other service providers may release information regarding recipients in the aggregate that does not identify specific individuals. However, a State or service provider must apply an FOIA Exemption (b)(6) balancing test to any request for information that can not be satisfied by such less-intrusive methods.

§ 440.11
Native Americans.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Support Office Director may determine, after taking into account the amount of funds made available to a State to carry out the purposes of this part, that:
(1) The low-income members of an Indian tribe are not receiving benefits under this part equivalent to the assistance provided to other low-income persons in the State under this part and
(2) The low-income members of such tribe would be better served by means of a grant made directly to provide such assistance.
(b) In any State for which the Support Office Director shall have made the determination referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the Support Office Director shall reserve from the sums that would otherwise be allocated to the State under this part not less than 100 percent, or more than 150 percent, of an amount which bears the same ratio to the State's allocation for the fiscal year involved as the population of all low-income Native Americans for whom a determination under paragraph (a) of this section has been made bears to the population of all low-income persons in the State.
(c) The Support Office Director shall make the determination prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section in the event a State:
(1) Does not apply within the sixty-day time period prescribed in § 440.12(a);
(2) Recommends that direct grants be made for low-income members of an Indian tribe as provided in § 440.12(b)(5);
(3) Files an application which DOE determines, in accordance with the procedures in § 440.30, not to make adequate provision for the low-income members of an Indian tribe residing in the State; or
(4) Has received grant funds and DOE determines, in accordance with the procedures in § 440.30, that the State has failed to implement the procedures required by § 440.16(6).
(d) Any sums reserved by the Support Office Director pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be granted to the tribal organization serving the individuals for whom the determination has been made, or where there is no tribal organization, to such other entity as the Support Office Director determines is able to provide adequate weatherization assistance pursuant to this part. Where the Support Office Director intends to make a grant to an organization to perform services benefiting more than one Indian tribe, the approval of each Indian tribe shall be a prerequisite for the issuance of a notice of grant award.
(e) Within 30 days after the Support Office Director has reserved funds pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Support Office Director shall give written notice to the tribal organization or other qualified entity of the amount of funds reserved and its eligibility to apply therefor.
(f) Such tribal organization or other qualified entity shall thereafter be treated as a unit of general purpose local government eligible to apply for
funds hereunder, pursuant to the provisions of § 440.13.

§ 440.21
Weatherization materials standards and energy audit procedures.
(a) Paragraph (b) of this section describes the required standards for weatherization materials. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section describes the performance and quality standards for renewable energy systems. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section specifies the procedures and criteria that are used for considering a petition from a manufacturer requesting the Secretary to certify an item as a renewable energy system. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section describe the cost-effectiveness tests that weatherization materials must pass before they may be installed in an eligible dwelling unit. Paragraph (f) of this section lists the other energy audit requirements that do not pertain to cost-effectiveness tests of weatherization materials. Paragraphs (g) and
(h) of this section describe the use of priority lists and presumptively cost-effective general heat waste reduction materials as part of a State's energy audit procedures. Paragraph (i) of this section explains that a State's energy audit procedures and priority lists must be re-approved by DOE every five years.
(b) Only weatherization materials which are listed in appendix A to this part and which meet or exceed standards prescribed in appendix A to this part may be purchased with funds provided under this part. However, DOE may approve an unlisted material upon application from any State.
(c)(1) A system or technology shall not be considered by DOE to be a renewable energy system under this part unless:
(i) It will result in a reduction in oil or natural gas consumption;
(ii) It will not result in an increased use of any item which is known to be, or reasonably expected to be, environmentally hazardous or a threat to public health or safety;
(iii) Available Federal subsidies do not make such a specification unnecessary or inappropriate (in light of the most advantageous allocation of economic resources); and
(iv) If a combustion rated system, it has a thermal efficiency rating of at least 75 percent; or, in the case of a solar system, it has a thermal efficiency rating of at least 15 percent.
(2) Any manufacturer may submit a petition to DOE requesting the Secretary to certify an item as a renewable energy system.
(i) Petitions should be submitted to: Weatherization Assistance Program, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable, Mail Stop EE-2K, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.
(ii) A petition for certification of an item as a renewable energy system must be accompanied by information demonstrating that the item meets the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(iii) DOE may publish a document in the
Federal Register
that invites public comment on a petition.
(iv) DOE shall notify the petitioner of the Secretary's action on the request within one year after the filing of a complete petition, and shall publish notice of approvals and denials in the
Federal Register.
(d) Except for materials to eliminate health and safety hazards allowable under § 440.18(c)(15), each individual weatherization material and package of weatherization materials installed in an eligible dwelling unit must be cost-effective. These materials must result in energy cost savings over the lifetime of the measure(s), discounted to present value, that equal or exceed the cost of materials, installation, and on-site supervisory personnel as defined by the Department. States have the option of requiring additional related costs to be included in the determination of cost-effectiveness. The cost of incidental repairs must be included in the cost of the package of measures installed in a dwelling.
(e) The energy audit procedures must assign priorities among individual weatherization materials in descending order of their cost-effectiveness according to paragraph (d) of this section after:
(1) Adjusting for interaction between architectural and mechanical weatherization materials by using generally accepted engineering methods to decrease the estimated fuel cost savings for a lower priority weatherization material in light of fuel cost savings for a related higher priority weatherization material; and
(2) Eliminating any weatherization materials that are no longer cost-effective, as adjusted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(f) The energy audit procedures also must—
(1) Compute the cost of fuel saved per year by taking into account the climatic data of the area where the dwelling unit is located, where the base temperature that determines the number of heating or cooling degree days (if used) reasonably approximates conditions when operation of heating and cooling equipment is required to maintain comfort, and must otherwise use reasonable energy estimating methods and assumptions;
(2) Determine existing energy use and energy requirements of the dwelling
unit from actual energy bills or by generally accepted engineering calculations;
(3) Address significant heating and cooling needs;
(4) Make provision for the use of advanced diagnostic and assessment techniques which DOE has determined are consistent with sound engineering practices;
(5) Identify health and safety hazards to be abated with DOE funds in compliance with the State's DOE-approved health and safety procedures under § 440.16(h);
(6) Treat the dwelling unit as a whole system by examining its heating and cooling system, its air exchange system, and its occupants' living habits and needs, and making necessary adjustments to the priority of weatherization materials with adequate documentation of the reasons for such an adjustment; and
(7) Be specifically approved by DOE for use on each major dwelling type that represents a significant portion of the State's weatherization program in light of the varying energy audit requirements of different dwelling types including single-family dwellings, multi-family buildings, and mobile homes.
(g) For similar dwelling units without unusual energy-consuming characteristics, energy audits may be accomplished by using a priority list developed by conducting, in compliance with paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, site-specific energy audits of a representative subset of these dwelling units. For DOE approval, States must describe how the priority list was developed, how the subset of similar homes was determined, and circumstances that will require site-specific audits rather than the use of the priority lists. States also must provide the input data and list of weatherization measures recommended by the energy audit software or manual methods for several dwelling units from the subset of similar units.
(h) States may use, as a part of an energy audit, general heat waste reduction weatherization materials that DOE has determined to be generally cost-effective. States may request approval to use general heat waste materials not listed in DOE policy guidance by providing documentation of their cost-effectiveness and a description of the circumstances under which such materials will be used.
(i) States must resubmit their energy audit procedures (and priority lists, if applicable, under certain conditions) to DOE for approval every five years. States must also resubmit to DOE, for approval every five years, their list of general heat waste materials in addition to those approved by DOE in policy guidance, if applicable. Policy guidance will describe the information States must submit to DOE and the circumstances that reduce or increase documentation requirements.

§ 451.9
Procedures for processing applications.
(a)
Supplemental information.
DOE may request supplementary information relating to the application.
(b)
Audits.
DOE may require the applicant to conduct at its own expense and submit an independent audit, or DOE may conduct an audit, to verify the number of kilowatt-hours claimed to have been generated and sold by the qualified renewable energy facility and for which an incentive payment has been requested or made.
(c)
DOE determinations.
The Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy shall determine the extent to which appropriated funds are available to be obligated under this program for each fiscal year. Upon evaluating each application and any other relevant information, DOE shall further determine:
(1) Eligibility of the applicant for receipt of an incentive payment, based on the criteria for eligibility specified in this part;
(2) The number of kilowatt-hours to be used in calculating a potential incentive payment, based on the net electric energy generated from a qualified

(3) The number of kilowatt-hours to be used in calculating a potential additional incentive payment, based on the total quantity of accrued energy generated during prior fiscal years;
(4) The amounts represented by 60 percent of available funds and by 40 percent of available funds; and
(5) Whether justification exists for altering the 60:40 payment ratio specified in paragraph (e) of this section. If DOE intends to modify the 60:40 ratio, the Department shall notify Congress, setting forth reasons for such change.
(d)
Calculating payments.
Subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, potential incentive payments under this part shall be determined by multiplying the number of kilowatt-hours determined under § 451.9(c)(2) by 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and adjusting that product for inflation for each fiscal year beginning after calendar year 1993 in the same manner as provided in section 29(d)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, except that in applying such provisions calendar year 1993 shall be substituted for calendar year 1979. Using the same procedure, a potential additional payment shall be determined for the number of kilowatt-hours determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If the sum of these calculated payments does not exceed the funds determined to be available by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under § 451.9(c), DOE shall make payments to all qualified applicants.
(e)
Insufficient funds.
If funds are not sufficient to make full incentive payments to all qualified applicants, DOE shall—
(1) Calculate potential incentive payments, if necessary on a
pro rata
basis, not to exceed 60 percent of available funds to owners or operators of qualified renewable energy facilities using solar, wind, ocean, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass technologies based on prior year energy generation;
(2) Calculate potential incentive payments, if necessary on a
pro rata
basis, not to exceed 40 percent of available funds to owners or operators of all other qualified renewable energy facilities based on prior year energy generation;
(3) If the amounts calculated in paragraph (e)(1) and (2) of this section result in one owner group with insufficient funds and one with excess funds, allocate excess funds to the owner group with insufficient funds and calculate additional incentive payments, on a
pro rata
basis if necessary, to such owners or operators based on prior year energy generation.
(4) If potential payments calculated in paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section do not exceed available funding, allocate 60% of remaining funds to paragraph (e)(1) recipients and 40% to paragraph (e)(2) recipients and calculate additional incentive payments, if necessary on a
pro rata
basis, to owners or operators based on accrued energy;
(5) If the amounts calculated in paragraph (e)(4) of this section result in one owner group with insufficient funds and one with excess funds, allocate excess funds to the owner group with insufficient funds and calculate additional incentive payments, on a
pro rata
basis if necessary, to such owners or operators based on accrued energy.
(6) Notify Congress if potential payments resulting from paragraphs (e)(3) or (5) of this section above will result in alteration of the 60:40 payment ratio;
(7) Make incentive payments based on the sum of the amounts determined in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section for each applicant;
(8) Treat the number of kilowatt-hours for which an incentive payment is not made as a result of insufficient funds as accrued energy for which future incentive payment may be made; and
(9) Maintain a record of each applicant's accrued energy.
(f)
Notice to applicant.
After calculating the amount of the incentive payment under paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, the DOE Deciding Official shall then issue a written notice of the determination to the applicant—
(1) Approving the application as eligible for payment and forwarding a copy to the DOE Finance Office with a request to pay;
(2) Setting forth the calculation of the approved amount of the incentive payment; and
(3) Stating the amount of accrued energy, measured in kilowatt-hours, for each qualified renewable energy facility, if any, and the energy source for same.
(g)
Disqualification.
If the application does not meet the requirements of this part or some of the kilowatt-hours claimed in the application are disallowed as unqualified, the Deciding Official shall issue a written notice denying the application in whole or in part with an explanation of the basis for denial.
[60 FR 36964, July 19, 1995, as amended at 71 FR 46387, Aug. 14, 2006]
§ 451.10
Administrative appeals.
(a) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, an applicant who receives a notice denying an application in whole or in part shall appeal, on or before 45 days from date of the notice issued by the DOE Deciding Official, to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585, in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart C of 10 CFR part 1003.
(b) If an applicant does not appeal under paragraph (a) of this section, the determination of the DOE Deciding Official shall become final for DOE and judicially unreviewable.
(c) If an applicant appeals on a timely basis under paragraph (a) of this section, the decision and order of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be final for DOE.

§ 452.5
Bidding procedures.
DOE shall conduct an electronic reverse auction through a limited duration single bid per producer auction process open only to pre-auction eligible cellulosic biofuels producers. The following procedures shall be used:
(a) DOE shall accept only electronic bids received from pre-auction eligible cellulosic biofuels producers during the open window established in the solicitation. The open window shall consist of a single continuous period of at least four hours for each auction.
(b) Bids shall identify an estimated annual production amount from an eligible cellulosic biofuels production facility on a per gallon, site, entity, and year specific basis for a consecutive six year production period. A bid also may be submitted for additional incentives for uncovered production volumes at a site where an award was made in an earlier auction round.
(c) All bids must set forth the methodology used to derive the estimates of annual production volumes covered by the bid and the bid shall be calculated on a gasoline equivalent volumetric basis using the lower heating Btu value of the fuel compared to the lower heating Btu value of gasoline.
(d) All bids will be confidential until 45 days after the close of the window for submission of bids for the reverse auction.
(e) Bid evaluation and incentive awards selection procedures include the following:
(1) After DOE evaluates the bids received during the open window, it shall, within 45 days following the close of the open window for submission of bids for the reverse auction, announce on DOE's website and by direct mail the names of the successful bidders and the terms of their bids.
(2) DOE shall issue awards for the bid production amounts beginning with the bidder that submitted the bid for the lowest level of production incentive on a per gallon basis.
(3) In the event of a tie among the lowest bids, preference will be given to the lowest tied bidder based on DOE's evaluation of the extent to which the tied bids meet the following criteria:
(i) Demonstrates outstanding potential for local and regional economic development;
(ii) Includes agricultural producers or cooperatives of agricultural producers as equity partners in the ventures; and
(iii) Has a strategic agreement in place to fairly reward feedstock suppliers.
(4) In the event more than one lowest tied bid equally meets the standards in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the award will be distributed equally on a per capita basis among those lowest tied bidders meeting the standards.
§ 452.6
Incentive award terms and limitations.
(a)
Amount of incentive.
Subject to the availability of appropriated funds and the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section, an eligible cellulosic biofuels producer selected to receive an award
shall receive the amount of the production incentive on the per gallon basis requested in the auction solicitation for each gallon produced and sold by the entity during the first six years of operation of its eligible cellulosic biofuels production facility.
(b)
Failure to commence production.
Except in the circumstance of a force majeure event, as solely determined by DOE, failure by an eligible cellulosic biofuels producer that made a successful bid to commence production of cellulosic biofuels, at the eligible cellulosic biofuels production facility that was the subject of the successful bid, by the end of the third year after the close of submission of the open window of bids for the reverse auction in which it submitted a successful bid, shall result in immediate revocation of DOE's award to that producer.
(c)
Failure of the successful bidder to meet annual production obligations.
Except in the circumstance of a force majeure event, as solely determined by DOE, a successful bidder's failure to produce at least 50 percent of the volumes specified in its production agreement by December 31 of any year covered by the bid shall result in immediate revocation of DOE's award; if the successful bidder produces 50 percent or more of the volumes set forth in the production agreement on an annual basis by December 31 of any year covered by the agreement, any production shortfall will be carried forward and added to the successful bidder's production obligations for next year covered by the agreement.
(d)
Shortfalls remaining at the end of the production period.
If, for any reason, by December 31 of the last year of the production agreement, the bidder has failed to produce the total production volumes for all years covered by the agreement, any such remaining shortfall shall be awarded to the bidder with the next lowest bid in the auction round for which the award was made. If, however, the next best bidder is unable to enter into a production agreement with DOE within 30 days after being notified of its award, the shortfall shall be allocated instead to the next reverse auction.
(e)
Incentive award limitations.
The following limits shall apply to awards of cellulosic biofuels production incentives under this part:
(1) During the first four years after the commencement of the program, the incentive shall be limited to $1.00 per gallon. For purposes of this limitation, the program shall be deemed to have commenced on the date that the first solicitation for a reverse auction is issued;
(2) A per gallon cap over the remaining lifetime of the program of $.95 per gallon provided that—
(i) This cap shall be lowered by $.05 each year commencing the first year after annual cellulosic biofuels production in the United States exceeds 1 billion gallons;
(ii) Not more than 25 percent of the funds committed within each reverse auction shall be awarded to any single project;
(iii) Not more than $100 million in production incentives shall be awarded in any one calendar year; and
(iv) Not more than $1 billion in production incentives shall be awarded over the lifetime of the program.
(f)
Participation in subsequent auctions.
A successful bidder in a reverse auction under this part may participate in subsequent reverse auctions if the incentives sought will assist the addition of plant production capacity for the eligible cellulosic biofuels production facility associated with its previously successful bid.
(g)
Transferability of awards.
A production incentive award under this part may be transferred to a successor entity at the same production facility for which the award was made, provided that the successor entity meets all eligibility requirements of this part, including execution of an agreement with DOE to commence production of cellulosic biofuels in commercially significant quantities not later than three years of the date that bidding closes on the reverse auction in which the predecessor entity submitted a successful bid.

§ 455.63
Cost-effectiveness testing.
(a) This paragraph applies to calculation of the simple payback period of energy conservation measures.
(1) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure (except measures to shift demand, or renewable resource measures) shall be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure (adjusted for demand charges), as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(vi), provided that:
(i) At least 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this calculation shall be from the cost of the energy to be saved or a higher percent if required by a State in its State Plan pursuant to § 455.20(u)(3); and
(ii) No more than 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this calculation shall be from other cost savings, such as those resulting from energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures related to particular energy conservation measures, or from changes in type of fuel used, or a lower percent if required by a State in its State Plan pursuant to § 455.20(u)(3).
(2) The simple payback period of each renewable resource energy conservation measure shall be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure taking into account at least the annual cost of the non-renewable fuels displaced less the annual cost of the renewable fuel, if any, and the annual cost of any backup non-renewable fuel needed to operate the system, adjusted for demand charges, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(vi).
(3) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure designed to shift demand to a period of lower demand and lower cost shall be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure taking into account at least the annual cost of the energy used before the measure is installed less the estimated annual cost of the energy to be used after the measure is installed, adjusted for demand charges, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(vi).
(b) This paragraph applies, in addition to paragraph (a) of this section, if the State plan requires the cost effectiveness of an energy conservation measure to be determined by life-cycle
cost analysis or if the applicant requests such an analysis.
(1) A life-cycle cost analysis, showing a savings-to-investment ratio greater than or equal to one over the useful life of the energy conservation measure or 15 years, whichever is less, shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth in the State Plan pursuant to §§ 455.20(u)(2), 455.20(u)(3) and § 455.64.
(2) The resulting savings-to-investment ratio shall be used for the purpose of ranking applications.
§ 455.64
Life-cycle cost methodology.
(a) The life-cycle cost methodology under § 455.63(b) of this part is a systematic comparison of the relevant significant cost savings and costs associated with an energy conservation measure over its expected useful life, or other appropriate study period with future cost savings and costs discounted to present value. The format for displaying life-cycle costs shall be a savings-to-investment ratio.
(b) An energy conservation measure must be cost effective, and its savings-to-investment ratio must be greater than or equal to one no earlier than the end of the second year of the study period.
(c) A savings-to-investment ratio is the ratio of the present value of net cost savings attributable to an energy conservation measure to the present value of the net increase in investment, maintenance and operating, and replacement costs less salvage value or disposal cost attributable to that measure over a study period.
(d) Except for energy conservation measures to shift demand or to use renewable energy resources, the numerator of the savings-to-investment ratio shall include net cost savings, appropriately discounted and adjusted for energy cost escalation consistent with paragraph (g) of this section, subject to the limitation that the cost of the energy to be saved shall constitute at least 50 percent of the net cost savings unless the State specifies a higher percent in its State plan pursuant to § 455.20(u)(3).
(e) With respect to energy conservation measures to shift demand or to use renewable energy resources, the numerator of the savings-to-investment ratio shall be net cost savings appropriately discounted and adjusted for energy cost escalation consistent with paragraph (g) of this section.
(f) The study period for a life-cycle cost analysis, which may not exceed 15 years, shall be the useful life of the energy conservation measure or of the energy conservation measure with the longest life (for purposes of ranking buildings with multiple energy conservation measures).
(g) The discount rate must equal or exceed the discount rate annually provided by DOE under 10 CFR part 436. The energy cost escalation rates must not exceed those annually provided by DOE under 10 CFR part 436.
(h) Investment costs may be assumed to be a lump sum occurring at the beginning of the base year, or to the extent that there are future investment costs, discounted to present value.
(i) The cost of energy and maintenance and operating costs may be assumed to begin to accrue at the beginning of the base year or when they are actually projected to occur.
(j) It may be assumed that costs occur in a lump sum at any time within the year in which they are incurred.

# Subpart I—Cost Sharing
§ 455.100
Limits to Federal share.
Amounts made available under this part, together with any other amounts made available from other Federal sources, may not be used to pay more than 50 percent of the costs of technical assistance programs and energy conservation measures unless the grantee qualifies for the exceptions specified in §§ 455.141(a), 455.142(a), 455.142(b), or for severe hardship assistance specified in § 455.142(c). In cases of severe hardship, the Federal share of the cost cannot exceed 90 percent.
§ 455.101
Borrowing the non-Federal share/title to equipment.
The non-Federal share of the costs of acquiring and installing energy conservation measures may be provided by using financing or other forms of borrowed funds, such as those provided by loans and performance contracts, even if such financing does not provide for the grantee to receive clear title to the equipment being financed until after the grant is closed out. However, grantees in such cases must otherwise meet all the requirements of this part, and financing and loan agreements and performance contracts under this section are subject to the requirements of 10 CFR part 600 and the certification requirements under § 455.111(e).

§ 455.103
Requirements for applications for credit.
(a) If a State has provided for credit in its State Plan pursuant to § 455.20(w), applications for credit will be considered only when the technical assistance programs or updates and the energy conservation measure projects for which credit is sought meet the applicable program requirements, such as those specified in § 455.61, § 455.62, § 455.71, and the relevant sections of 10 CFR part 600, except that the project need not comply with the Davis-Bacon Act regarding labor standards or wage rates.
(b) Credit for energy conservation measures will be considered only when supported by a technical assistance analysis that meets the requirements of § 455.62 and that was performed prior to the installation of the energy conservation measures.
§ 455.104
Rebates from utilities and other entities.
(a) Grantees which receive rebates or other monetary considerations from utilities or other entities for installing the energy conservation measures funded by a grant under this part may use such funds to meet their cost- sharing obligations pursuant to § 455.100.
(b) Where the rebate or monetary consideration does not exceed the non-Federal share of the cost of the measures applied for in a grant application, grantees are not required to deduct the amount of the rebate or monetary consideration from the cost of the measures, and DOE does not consider such rebates or monetary considerations to be program income which would have to be remitted to DOE upon receipt by the grantee.
(c) Where the rebate or monetary consideration does exceed the non-Federal share of the cost of the measures applied for in a grant application, grantees may use the excess to fund additional measures if such measures have been recommended in the technical assistance report. If it is not possible to use the excess funding in this way, the grantee must reduce the cost—and DOE will reduce the Federal share—by the amount of the excess above the non-Federal share.

# Subpart J—Applicant Responsibilities—Grants to Institutions and Coordinating Agencies
§ 455.110
Grant application submittals for technical assistance and energy conservation measures.
(a) Each eligible applicant desiring to receive financial assistance (either from DOE directly, through a State serving as a coordinating agency, or through another organization serving as a coordinating agency) shall file an application in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and the approved State Plan of the State in which such building is located. The application, which may be amended in accordance with applicable State procedures at any time prior to the State's final determination thereon, shall be filed with the State energy agency designated in the State Plan. Coordinating agencies shall file a single application with DOE which includes all of the information required below for each building for which assistance has been requested and to which is attached a copy of each application from each building owner.

# Subpart L—State Responsibilities
§ 455.130
State evaluation of grant applications.
(a) If an application received by a State is reviewed and evaluated by that State and determined to be in compliance with subparts E, F, and J of this part, § 455.130(b), any additional requirements of the approved State Plan, State environmental laws, and other applicable laws and regulations, then such application will be eligible for financial assistance.
(b) Concurrent with its evaluation and ranking of grant applications pursuant to § 455.131, the State will forward applications for technical assistance or for energy conservation measures for schools to the State school facilities agency for review and certification that each school application is consistent with related State programs for educational facilities. For hospitals the certification requirement applies only if there is a State requirement for it in which case the procedure should be described in the State Plan.
§ 455.131
State ranking of grant applications.
(a) Except as provided by § 455.92 of this part, all eligible applications received by the State will be ranked by the State in accordance with its approved State Plan.
(b) For technical assistance programs, buildings shall be ranked in descending priority based upon the energy conservation potential, on a savings percentage basis, of the building as determined in the energy audit or energy use evaluation pursuant to § 455.20(k). Each State shall develop separate rankings for all buildings covered by eligible applications for:
(1) Technical assistance programs for units of local government and public care institutions and
(2) Technical assistance programs for schools and hospitals.
(c) All eligible applications for energy conservation measures received will be ranked by the State on building-by-building or a measure-by-measure basis. If a State ranks on a building-by-building basis, several buildings may be ranked as a single building if the application proposes a single energy conservation measure which is physically connected to all of the buildings. If a State ranks on a measure-by-measure basis, a measure that is physically connected to a number of buildings may be ranked as a single measure. Buildings or measures shall be ranked in accordance with the procedures established by the State Plan on the basis of the information developed during a technical assistance program (or its equivalent) for the building and the criteria for ranking applications. The criterion set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall receive at least 50 percent of the weight given to the criteria used to rank applications. Each State may assign weights to the other criteria as set forth in the State Plan pursuant to § 455.20(e). The criteria for ranking applications are:
(1) Simple payback or a life-cycle cost analysis, calculated in accordance with § 455.63 and § 455.64, as applicable;
(2) The types and quantities of energy to be saved, including oil, natural gas, or electricity, in a priority as established in the approved State Plan;
(3) The types of energy sources to which conversion is proposed, including renewable energy;
(4) The quality of the technical assistance program report; and
(5) Other factors as determined by the State.
(d) A State is exempt from the ranking requirements of this section when:
(1) The total amount requested by all applications for schools and hospitals for technical assistance and energy conservation measures in a given grant program cycle for grants up to 50 percent is less than or equal to the funds available to the State for such grants and the total amount recommended for
hardship funding is less than or equal to the amounts available to the State for such grants and
(2) The total amount requested by all applications for buildings owned by units of local government and public care institutions in a given grant program cycle is less than or equal to the total amount allocated to the State for technical assistance program grants in the State;
(e) If a State elects to permit applications for credit pursuant to § 455.102, such applications for completed or partially completed energy conservation measures shall reflect both the work done and the work to be done and will be reviewed and ranked on the basis of the cost of all of the measures in the project. The credit shall not exceed the non-Federal share of the proposed additional energy conservation measures (and the Federal share shall not exceed the cost of the work remaining to be done).
(f) Within the rankings of school and hospital buildings for technical assistance and energy conservation measures including renewable resource measures to the extent that approvable applications are submitted, a State shall initially assure that:
(1) Schools receive at least 30 percent of the total funds allocated for schools and hospitals to the State in any grant program cycle and
(2) Hospitals receive at least 30 percent of the total funds allocated for schools and hospitals to the State in any grant program cycle.
(g) If there are insufficient applications from schools or hospitals to cover the respective 30 percent requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section, then the State may recommend use of the remaining funds in those allocations for other qualified applicants.
§ 455.132
State evaluation of requests for severe hardship assistance.
(a) To the extent provided in § 455.30(d), financial assistance will be initially available for schools and hospitals experiencing severe hardship based upon an applicant's inability to provide the non-Federal share as specified in the State plan pursuant to § 455.20(g). This financial assistance will be available only to the extent necessary to enable such institutions to participate in the program.
(b) The State shall recommend funds for severe hardship applications wholly or partially from the funds reserved in accordance with § 455.30(d) and as stated in an approved State Plan.
(c) Applications for Federal funding in excess of the non-Federal share in the State plan pursuant to § 455.20(x) based on claims of severe hardship shall be given an additional evaluation by the State to assess on a quantifiable basis to the maximum extent practicable the relative need among eligible institutions. The minimum amount of additional Federal funding necessary for the applicant to participate in the program will be determined by the State in accordance with the procedures established in the State Plan. The primary consideration shall be the institution's inability to provide the non-Federal share of the project cost as specified in the State plan pursuant to § 455.20(x). Secondary criteria such as climate, fuel cost and fuel availability, borrowing capacity, median family income in the area, and other relevant factors as determined by the State may be addressed in the State Plan as specified in § 455.20(g).
(d) A State shall indicate, for those schools and hospitals with the highest rankings, determined pursuant to § 455.131(b) and (c):
(1) The amount of additional hardship funding requested by each eligible applicant for each building determined to be in a class of severe hardship and
(2) The amount of hardship funding recommended by the State based upon relative need, as determined in accordance with the State Plan, to the limit of the hardship funds available. The State must decide on a case-by-case basis whether, and to what extent, it will recommend hardship funding.
(e) If there are insufficient applications from hardship applicants to cover the 10 percent allocation provided for in § 455.30(d), then the State may recommend use of the remaining funds for other qualified applicants. The total amount recommended for hardship grants cannot exceed the 10 percent limit.
§ 455.133
Forwarding of applications from institutions and coordinating agencies for technical assistance and energy conservation measure grants.
(a) Except as provided by § 455.92 of this part, each State shall forward all applications recommended for funding within its allocation to DOE once each program cycle along with a listing of buildings or measures covered by eligible applications for schools, hospitals, units of local government, and public care institutions ranked by the State if necessary pursuant to the provisions of § 455.131. If ranking has been employed, the list shall include the standings of buildings or measures.
(1) Measure-by-measure rankings will be recombined for the respective buildings with more than one recommended measure and
(2) Buildings will be consolidated under one grantee application.
(b) The State shall indicate the amount of financial assistance requested by the applicant for each eligible building and, for those buildings recommended for funding within the limits of the State's allocation, the amount recommended for funding. If the amount recommended is less than the amount requested by the applicant, the list shall also indicate the reason for that recommendation.
(c) The State shall indicate that it has reviewed and evaluated all of the submitted applications and that those applications meet the relevant requirements of the program, and shall certify that applications submitted are eligible pursuant to § 455.130(a).
§ 455.134
Forwarding of applications for State grants for technical assistance, program assistance, and marketing.
A State eligible to apply for grants for technical assistance, program assistance, or marketing, as described in § 455.121, may submit such an application to DOE any time after the allocations have been announced as part of, or in lieu of, an application for a grant for State administrative expenses. Such applications shall provide separate narrative descriptions, budgets and appropriate milestone dates, covering each activity or program, that are sufficiently detailed to enable DOE to reasonably evaluate the application.
§ 455.135
State liaison, monitoring, and reporting.
Each State shall be responsible for:
(a) Consulting with eligible institutions and coordinating agencies representing such institutions in the development of its State Plan;
(b) Notifying eligible institutions and coordinating agencies of the content of the approved State Plan and any amendment to a State Plan;

§ 474.1
Purpose and Scope.
This part contains procedures for calculating a value for the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles, as required by 49 U.S.C. 32904(a)(2). The petroleum-equivalent fuel economy value is intended to be used by the Environmental Protection Agency in calculating corporate average fuel economy values pursuant to regulations at 40 CFR Part 600—Fuel Economy of Motor Vehicles.
§ 474.2
Definitions.
For the purposes of this part, the term:
Combined energy consumption value
means the weighted average of the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption values (weighted 55/45 percent, respectively), as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with 40 CFR parts 86 and 600.
Electric vehicle
means a vehicle that is powered by an electric motor drawing current from rechargeable storage batteries or other portable electrical energy storage devices, provided that:
(1) Recharge energy must be drawn from a source off the vehicle, such as residential electric service; and
(2) The vehicle must comply with all provisions of the Zero Emission Vehicle definition found in 40 CFR 88.104-94(g).
Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value
means the average number of watt-hours of electrical energy required for an electric vehicle to travel one mile of the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule, as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Petroleum equivalency factor
means the values specified in § 474.3, paragraphs (b) through (f) of this part, which incorporate the parameters listed in 49 U.S.C. 32904(a)(2)(B) and are used to calculate petroleum-equivalent fuel economy.
Petroleum-equivalent fuel economy
means the value, expressed in miles per gallon, that is calculated for an electric vehicle in accordance with § 474.3(a) of this part, and reported to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for use in determining the vehicle manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy.
Petroleum-powered accessory
means a vehicle accessory (e.g., a cabin heater, defroster, and/or air conditioner) that:
(1) Uses gasoline or diesel fuel as its primary energy source; and
(2) Meets the requirements for fuel, operation, and emissions in 40 CFR part 88.104-94(g).
Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value
means the average number of Watt-hours of electrical energy required for an electric vehicle to travel one mile of the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency.
[65 FR 36991, June 12, 2000, as amended at 89 FR 22059, Mar. 29, 2024]
§ 474.3
Petroleum-equivalent fuel economy calculation.
(a) The petroleum-equivalent fuel economy for an electric vehicle is calculated as follows:
(1) Determine the electric vehicle's Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value in units of Watt-hours per mile;
(2) Determine the combined energy consumption value by averaging the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value using a weighting of 55 percent urban/45 percent highway; and
(3) Calculate the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy by dividing the appropriate petroleum-equivalency factor (depending on whether any petroleum-powered accessories are installed; see paragraph (b) of this section) by the combined energy consumption value, and round to the nearest 0.01 miles per gallon.
(b) For model year (MY) 2024, MY 2025, and MY 2026 electric vehicles, the petroleum-equivalency factors are as follows:
(1) If the electric vehicle does not have any petroleum-powered accessories installed, the value of the petroleum equivalency factor is 82,049 Watt-hours per gallon.
(2) If the electric vehicle has any petroleum-powered accessories installed, the value of the petroleum-equivalency factor is 73,844 Watt-hours per gallon.
(c) For MY 2027 electric vehicles, the petroleum-equivalency factor is 79,989 Watt-hours per gallon.
(d) For MY 2028 electric vehicles, the petroleum-equivalency factor is 50,427 Watt-hours per gallon.
(e) For MY 2029 electric vehicles, the petroleum-equivalency factor is 36,820 Watt-hours per gallon.
(f) For MY 2030 and later electric vehicles, the petroleum-equivalency factor is 28,996 Watt-hours per gallon.
[65 FR 36991, June 12, 2000, as amended at 89 FR 22059, Mar. 29, 2024]
§ 474.4
Test procedures.
(a) The electric vehicle energy consumption values used in the calculation of petroleum-equivalent fuel economy under § 474.3 of this part will be determined by the Environmental Protection Agency using the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule and Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule test cycles at 40 CFR parts 86 and 600.
(b) The “Special Test Procedures” provisions of 40 CFR 86.090-27 may be used to accommodate any special test procedures required for testing the energy consumption of electric vehicles.
§ 474.5
[Reserved]
Pt. 474, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 474—Sample Petroleum-Equivalent Fuel Economy Calculations

# Example 1: Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)
A battery electric vehicle is tested in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency procedures and is found to have an Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value of 265 Watt-hours per mile and a Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value of 220 Watt-hours per mile. The vehicle is not equipped with any petroleum-powered accessories. The combined electrical energy consumption value is determined by averaging the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value using weighting factors of 55 percent urban, and 45 percent highway:
combined electrical energy consumption value = (0.55 * urban) + (0.45 * highway) = (0.55 * 265) + (0.45 * 220) = 244.75 Wh/mile
The petroleum-equivalent fuel economy is:
PEF ÷ combined electrical energy consumption value
Thus, fuel economy for the example vehicle in MY 2030 would be:
ER29MR24.055
where MPGe is miles per gallon equivalent.

# Example 2: Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle
A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle is tested in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency procedures and is found to have an Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value of 265 Watt-hours per mile and a Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value of 220 Watt-hours per mile in charge depleting mode, a combined gasoline fuel economy of 50.0 miles per gallon in charge sustaining mode, and an all-electric range corresponding to a percentage utilization of 60 percent travel on electricity and 40 percent travel on gasoline.
The combined electrical energy consumption value is determined by averaging the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule energy consumption value and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule energy consumption value using weighting factors of 55 percent urban, and 45 percent highway to be 244.75 Wh/mile, which corresponds to 118.47 miles/gal equivalent as shown above for a BEV (using the MY 2030-and-beyond PEF value of 28,997 Wh/gal).
The PHEV fuel economy is calculated by dividing one by the sum of the percentage utilization for petroleum and electricity divided by their respective fuel economy.
In this case:
ER29MR24.056

# Subpart C—Mandatory State Fleet Program
§ 490.200
Purpose and scope.
This subpart sets forth rules implementing the provisions of Section 507(o) of the Act which requires, subject to some exemptions, that certain percentages of new light duty motor vehicles acquired for State fleets be alternative fueled vehicles.
§ 490.201
Alternative fueled vehicle acquisition mandate schedule.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, of the new light duty motor vehicles acquired annually for State government fleets, including agencies thereof but excluding municipal fleets, the following percentages shall be alternative fueled vehicles for the following model years;
(1) 10 percent for model year 1997;
(2) 15 percent for model year 1998;
(3) 25 percent for model year 1999;
(4) 50 percent for model year 2000; and
(5) 75 percent for model year 2001 and thereafter.
(b) Each State shall calculate its alternative fueled vehicle acquisition requirements for the State government fleets, including agencies thereof, by applying the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition percentages for each model year to the total number of new light duty motor vehicles to be acquired during that model year for those fleets.
(c) If the calculation performed under paragraph (b) of this section produces a number that requires the acquisition of a partial vehicle, an adjustment to the acquisition number will be made by rounding the number of vehicles down the next whole number if the fraction is less than one half and by rounding the number of vehicles up to the next whole number if the fraction is equal to or greater than one half.
(d) A State fleet that first becomes subject to this part after model year 1997 shall acquire alternative fueled vehicles in the next model year at the percentage applicable to that model year according to the schedule in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the State is granted an exemption or reduction of the acquisition percentage pursuant to the procedures and criteria in section 490.204.
§ 490.202
Acquisitions satisfying the mandate.
The following actions within a model year qualify as acquisitions for the purpose of compliance with the requirements of section 490.201 of this part:
(a) The purchase or lease of an Original Equipment Manufacturer light duty vehicle (regardless of the model year of manufacture) that is an alternative fueled vehicle and that was not previously under the control of the State or State agency;
(b) The purchase or lease of an after-market converted light duty vehicle (regardless of model year of manufacture), that was not previously under control of the State or State agency;
(c) The conversion of a newly purchased or leased light duty vehicle to operate on alternative fuels within four months after the vehicle is acquired for a State fleet; and
(d) The application of alternative fueled vehicle credits allocated under subpart F of this part.

§ 490.803
Waiver requirements.
DOE grants a State or covered person a waiver:
(a) If DOE determines that the State or covered person will achieve a reduction in petroleum consumption, through eligible reductions as specified in § 490.804 of this subpart, equal to the amount of alternative fuel used if the following vehicles were operated 100 percent of the time on alternative fuel during the model year for which a waiver is requested:
(1) Previously required alternative fueled vehicles in the fleet's inventory at the start of the model year for which a waiver is requested;
(2) Alternative fueled vehicles that the State or covered person would have been required to acquire in the model year for which a waiver is requested, and in previous model years in which a waiver was granted, absent any waivers;
(b) The State or covered person is in compliance with all applicable vehicle emission standards established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401
et seq.
); and
(c) The State or covered person is in compliance with all applicable requirements of this subpart.
§ 490.804
Eligible reductions in petroleum consumption.
(a)
Motor vehicles.
Demonstrated reductions in petroleum consumption during the model year for which a waiver is requested that are attributable to motor vehicles owned, operated, leased or otherwise under the control of a State or covered person are applicable towards the petroleum fuel reduction required in § 490.803(a) of this subpart.
(b)
Qualified nonroad vehicles.
Demonstrated reductions in petroleum consumption during the model year for which a waiver is requested that are attributable to nonroad vehicles owned, operated, leased or otherwise under the control of a State or covered person acquired during waiver years are applicable towards the petroleum fuel reduction required in § 490.803(a) of this subpart:
(1) If acquisition of the nonroad vehicles leads directly to the establishment or upgrading of refueling or recharging infrastructure during a waiver year that would also allow for increased petroleum replacement by serving the fleet's on-road light-duty vehicles; and
(2) To the extent that additional reductions attributable to motor vehicles are not reasonably available.
(c)
Rollover of excess petroleum reductions.
(1) Upon approval by DOE, petroleum fuel use reductions achieved by a fleet in excess of the amount required for alternative compliance in a previous model year may be applied towards the petroleum fuel use reduction requirement under § 490.803(a) in a model year for which a waiver is granted and for which the fleet experiences a shortfall.
(2)(i) A fleet seeking to roll over for future use the petroleum fuel use reductions that it achieved in excess of the amount required for alternative compliance in a particular model year must make a written request to DOE as part of the fleet's annual report required under § 490.807 for the model year in which the excess reductions were achieved.
(ii) Following receipt of a request under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, DOE will notify the requesting fleet of the amount of excess petroleum
fuel use reductions that DOE has approved for rollover and potential application towards the petroleum fuel use reduction requirement in a future model year.
(iii) A fleet seeking to apply excess petroleum fuel use reductions rolled over pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section in a model year for which a waiver is granted and for which the fleet experiences a shortfall in achieving the petroleum fuel use reduction requirement under § 490.803(a) must make a written request to DOE as part of the fleet's annual report required under § 490.807. The written request must specify the amount of the rollover reductions (in GGE) the fleet wishes to have applied and the total balance of rollover reductions (in GGE) the fleet possesses.
(3)(i) In considering a written request to apply rollover reductions under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, DOE may seek from the fleet additional information about the fleet and its operations.
(ii) Upon approving a request to apply rollover reductions, DOE will apply the approved rollover reductions only to the extent that other reductions in petroleum consumption through any of the means set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section were not reasonably achievable.
(4) Excess petroleum reductions are not tradable.
(d)
Ineligible reductions.
The petroleum reduction plan required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section must not include reductions in petroleum attributable to incentives for third parties to reduce their petroleum use, petroleum reductions that are not transportation-related, or petroleum reductions attributable to non-qualified nonroad vehicles.
[72 FR 12964, Mar. 20, 2007, as amended at 79 FR 15907, Mar. 21, 2014]
§ 490.805
Application for waiver.
(a) A State or covered person must apply for a waiver applicable to an entire fleet for a full model year in accordance with the deadlines specified in paragraph (b) of this section. DOE will not grant a waiver for less than an entire fleet or less than a full model year.
(b)(1) A State or covered person must register a preliminary intent to apply for a waiver by March 31 prior to the model year for which a waiver is sought.
(2) A complete waiver application must be received by DOE no later than July 31 prior to the model year for which a waiver is sought.
(c) A waiver application must include verifiable data that is sufficient to enable DOE to determine whether the State or covered person is likely to achieve the amount of petroleum reduction required for alternative compliance and whether the fleet is in compliance with Clean Air Act vehicle emission standards. At a minimum, the State entity or covered person must provide DOE with the following information:
(1) The model year for which the waiver is requested;
(2) The total number of required alternative fueled vehicle acquisitions in the fleet including:
(i) The number of alternative fueled vehicle acquisitions that the State or covered person would, without a waiver, be required to acquire during the model year for which the waiver is requested;
(ii) The number of alternative fueled vehicle acquisitions that the State or covered person would, without a waiver, have been required to acquire during the model years for which waivers were previously granted;
(iii) The number of required alternative fueled vehicles existing in the fleet that were acquired during years in which no waiver was in force; and excluding
(iv) Any required alternative fuel vehicles acquired during a waiver or non-waiver year or light-duty vehicles acquired in lieu of alternative fuels vehicles during a waiver year that are to be retired before the beginning of the waiver year;
(3) The anticipated amount of gasoline and diesel and alternative fuel (calculated in gasoline gallon equivalents (gge)) to be used by the covered light-duty vehicles in the fleet for the waiver year including an estimate of per vehicle average fuel use in these vehicles;
(4) A petroleum reduction plan as described in paragraph (d) of this section; and
(5) Documents, or a certification by a responsible official of the State or covered person, demonstrating that the fleet is in compliance with all applicable vehicle emission standards established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act.
(d) The petroleum reduction plan required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section must contain a documented explanation as to how the State or covered person will meet the reduction in petroleum consumption required by § 490.803(a) of this subpart.
(1) The planned actions must:
(i) Be verifiable;
(ii) Demonstrate a reduction in petroleum use by motor vehicles or qualified nonroad vehicles owned, operated, leased or otherwise controlled by the State or covered person;
(iii) Provide for a net reduction in petroleum consumption as specified in § 490.803(a) of this subpart.
(2) The documentation for the plan may include, but is not limited to, published data on fuel efficiency, Government data, letters from manufacturers, and data on actual usage.
(e) A State or covered person must send its report, and two copies, to DOE on official company or agency letterhead, and the report must be signed by a responsible company or agency official. Send to: Regulatory Manager, Alternative Fuel Transportation Program, FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program, EE-2G/Forrestal Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.
[72 FR 12964, Mar. 20, 2007, as amended at 79 FR 15907, Mar. 21, 2014]
§ 490.806
Action on an application for waiver.
(a) DOE grants or denies a complete waiver application within 45 business days after receipt of a complete application.
(b) If DOE determines that an application is not complete in that sufficient information is not provided for DOE to make a determination, DOE notifies the State or covered person of the information that must be submitted to complete the application.
(c) If DOE denies a waiver, and the State or covered person wishes to exhaust administrative remedies, the State or covered person must appeal within 30 days of the date of the determination, pursuant to 10 CFR part 1003, subpart C, to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585. DOE's determination shall be stayed during the pendency of an appeal under this paragraph.
§ 490.807
Reporting requirement.
(a) By December 31 following a model year for which an alternative compliance waiver is granted, a State or covered person must submit a report to DOE that includes:
(1) A statement certifying:
(i) The total number of petroleum gallons and/or alternative fuel gge used by the fleet during the waiver year in its covered light-duty vehicles; and
(ii) The amount of petroleum motor fuel reduced by the fleet in the waiver year through alternative compliance.
(b) A State or covered person must send its report to DOE on official company or agency letterhead, and the report must be signed by a responsible company or agency official. Send to: Regulatory Manager, Alternative Fuel Transportation Program, FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program, EE-2G/Forrestal Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.
§ 490.808
Use of credits to offset petroleum reduction shortfall.
(a) If a State or covered person granted a waiver under this subpart wants to use alternative fueled vehicle credits purchased or earned pursuant to subpart F of this part to offset any shortfall in meeting the petroleum reduction required under § 490.803(a) of this subpart, it must make a written request to DOE.
(1) The State or covered person must provide details about the particular circumstances that led to the shortfall and provide documentation that shows a good faith effort to meet the requirements.
(2) DOE may request that a State or covered person supply additional information about the fleet and its operations if DOE deems such information necessary for a decision on the request.
(b) If DOE grants the request, it notifies the State or covered person of the credit amount required to offset the shortfall. DOE derives the credit amount using the fleet's fuel use per vehicle data.
(c) DOE gives the State entity or covered person until March 31 following the model year for which the waiver is granted, to acquire the number of credits required for compliance with this subpart.
§ 490.809
Violations.
If a State or covered person that received a waiver under this subpart fails to comply with the petroleum motor fuel reduction or reporting requirements of this subpart, DOE will revoke the waiver and may impose on the State or covered person a penalty under subpart G of this part. A State or covered person whose waiver has been revoked by DOE is precluded from requesting an exemption under § 490.204 or § 490.307 from the vehicle acquisition mandate for the model year of the revoked waiver.
[79 FR 15907, Mar. 21, 2014]
§ 490.810
Record retention.
A State or covered person that receives a waiver under this subpart must retain documentation pertaining to its waiver application and alternative compliance, including petroleum fuel reduction by its fleet, for a period of three years following the model year for which the waiver is granted.
