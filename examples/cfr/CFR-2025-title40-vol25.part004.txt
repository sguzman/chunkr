BIA
—The “Bureau of Indian Affairs,” United States Department of Interior.
Casing
—a pipe or tubing of varying diameter and weight, lowered into a borehole during or after drilling in order to support the sides of the hole and, thus, prevent the walls from caving, to prevent loss of drilling mud into porous ground, or to prevent water, gas, or other fluid from entering the hole.
Cementing
—the operation whereby a cement slurry is pumped into a drilled hole and/or forced behind the casing.
Class II Wells
—wells which inject fluids:
(a) Which are brought to the surface in connection with conventional oil or natural gas production and may be commingled with waste waters from gas plants which are an integral part of production operations, unless those waters would be classified as a hazardous waste at the time of injection;
(b) For enhanced recovery of oil or natural gas; and
(c) For storage of hydrocarbons which are liquid at standard temperature and pressure.
Existing Class II Wells
—wells that were authorized by BIA and constructed and completed before the effective date of this program.
New Class II Wells
—wells constructed or converted after the effective date of this program, or which are under construction on the effective date of this program.
Confining bed
—a body of impermeable or distinctly less permeable material stratigraphically adjacent to one or more aquifers.
Confining zone
—a geologic formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that is capable of limiting fluid movement above an injection zone.

—the owner or operator of any facility or activity subject to regulation under the Osage UIC program.
Packer
—a device lowered into a well to produce a fluid-tight seal within the casing.
Permit
—an authorization issued by EPA to implement UIC program requirements. Permit does not include the UIC authorization by rule or any permit which has not yet been the subject of final Agency action.
Plugging
—the act or process of stopping the flow of water, oil or gas into or out of a formation through a borehole or well penetrating that formation.
Pressure
—the total load or force per unit area acting on a surface.
Regional Administrator
—the Regional Administrator of Region 6 of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or an authorized representative.
Subsidence
— the lowering of the natural land surface in response to: Earth movements; lowering of fluid pressure;
removal of underlying supporting material by mining or solution solids, either artificially or from natural causes; compaction due to wetting (hydrocompaction); oxidation of organic matter in soils; or added load on the land surface.
Underground source of drinking water
— an aquifer or its portion:
(a)(1) Which supplies any public water system; or
(2) Which contains a sufficient quantity of ground water to supply a public water system; and
(i) Currently supplies drinking water for human consumption; or

(b) Which is not an exempted aquifer.
USDW
—underground source of drinking water.
Well
—a bored, drilled, or driven shaft, or a dug hole whose depth is greater than the largest surface dimension.
Well injection
—the subsurfac emplacement of fluids through a bored, drilled, or driven well; or through a dug well, where the depth of the dug well is greater than the largest surface dimension.
Well workover
—any reentry of an injection well; including, but not limited to, the pulling of tubular goods, cementing or casing repairs; and excluding any routine maintenance (e.g. re-seating the packer at the same depth, or repairs to surface equipment).
§ 147.2903
Prohibition of unauthorized injection.
(a) Any underground injection, except as authorized by permit or rule issued under the UIC program, is prohibited. The construction or operation of any well required to have a permit is prohibited until the permit has been issued.
(b) No owner or operator shall construct, operate, maintain, convert, plug, or abandon any injection well, or conduct any other injection activity, in a manner that allows the movement of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water, if the presence of that contaminant may cause the violation of any primary drinking water regulation under 40 CFR part 142 or may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons. The applicant for a permit shall have the burden of showing that the requirements of this paragraph are met.
(c) Injection between the outermost casing protecting underground sources of drinking water and the well bore is prohibited.
§ 147.2904
Area of review.
(a) The area of review for an injection well or project will be a fixed radius of one-forth of a mile from the well, field or project.
(b) The zone of endangering influence is the lateral area around the injection well or project in which the injection zone pressures may cause movement of fluid into an underground source of drinking water (USDW) if there are improperly sealed, completed or abandoned wells present. A zone of endangering influence may be determined by EPA through the use of an appropriate formula that addresses the relevant geologic, hydrologic, engineering and operational features of the well, field, or project.

(1) Type and number of plugs;
(2) Elevation of top and bottom of each plug;
(3) Method of plug placement; and
(4) Type, grade and quantity of cement to be used.
(b) In addition to the permit conditions specified in §§ 144.51 and 144.52 of this chapter, each owner and operator shall submit and each permit shall contain the following information (in conformance with § 146.3108 of this subpart):
(1) Type and number of plugs;
(2) Elevation of top and bottom of each plug;
(3) Method of plug placement; and
(4) Type, grade and quantity of cement to be used.
§ 147.3105
Plugging and abandonment report.
(a) In lieu of the time periods for submitting a plugging report in § 144.28(k) of this chapter, owners and operators of Class I and III wells shall submit the report within 15 days of plugging the well and owners or operators of Class II wells within 30 days of plugging, or at the time of the next required operational report (whichever is less.) If the required operational report is due less than 15 days following completion of plugging, then the plugging report shall be submitted within 30 days for Class II wells and 15 days for Class I and III wells.
(b) In addition to the requirement of § 144.28(k)(1) of this chapter, owners and operators of Class II wells shall include a statement that the well was plugged in accordance with § 146.10 of this chapter and § 147.3109 of this subpart, and, if the actual plugging differed, specify the actual procedures used.

# Subpart C—Petition Standards and Procedures
§ 148.20
Petitions to allow injection of a waste prohibited under subpart B.
(a) Any person seeking an exemption from a prohibition under subpart B of this part for the injection of a restricted hazardous waste into an injection well or wells shall submit a petition to the Director demonstrating that, to a reasonable degree of certainty, there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the injection zone for as long as the waste remains hazardous. This demonstration requires a showing that:
(1) The hydrogeological and geochemical conditions at the sites and the physiochemical nature of the waste stream(s) are such that reliable predictions can be made that:
(i) Fluid movement conditions are such that the injected fluids will not migrate within 10,000 years:
(A) Vertically upward out of the injection zone; or
(B) Laterally within the injection zone to a point of discharge or interface with an Underground Source of Drinking Water (USDW) as defined in 40 CFR part 146; or
(ii) Before the injected fluids migrate out of the injection zone or to a point of discharge or interface with USDW, the fluid will no longer be hazardous because of attenuation, transformation, or immobilization of hazardous constituents within the injection zone by hydrolysis, chemical interactions or other means; and
(2) For each well the petition has:
(i) Demonstrated that the injection well's area of review complies with the substantive requirements of § 146.63;
(ii) Located, identified, and ascertained the condition of all wells
within the injection well's area of review (as specified in § 146.63) that penetrate the injection zone or the confining zone by use of a protocol acceptable to the Director that meets the substantive requirements of § 146.64;
(iii) Submitted a corrective action plan that meets the substantive requirements of § 146.64, the implementation of which shall become a condition of petition approval; and
(iv) Submitted the results of pressure and radioactive tracer tests performed within one year prior to submission of the petition demonstrating the mechanical integrity of the well's long string casing, injection tube, annular seal, and bottom hole cement. In cases where the petition has not been approved or denied within one year after the initial demonstration of mechanical integrity, the Director may require the owner or operator to perform the tests again and submit the results of the new tests.

# Note:
The requirements of § 148.20(a)(2) need not be incorporated in a permit at the time of petition approval.
(b) A demonstration under § 148.20(a)(1)(i) shall identify the strata within the injection zone which will confine fluid movement above the injection interval and include a showing that this strata is free of known transmissive faults of fractures and that there is a confining zone above the injection zone.
(c) A demonstration under § 148.20(a)(1)(ii) shall identify the strata within the injection zone where waste transformation will be accomplished and include a showing that this strata is free of known transmissive faults or fractures and that there is a confining zone above the injection zone.
(d) A demonstration may include a showing that:
(1) Treatment methods, the implementation of which shall become a condition of petition approval, will be utilized that reduce the toxicity or mobility of the wastes; or
(2) A monitoring plan, the implementation of which shall become a condition of petition approval, will be utilized to enhance confidence in one or more aspects of the demonstration.
(e) Any person who has been granted an exemption pursuant to this section may submit a petition for reissuance of the exemption to include an additional restricted waste or wastes or to modify any conditions placed on the exemption by the Director. The Director shall reissue the petition if the petitioner complies with the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.
(f) Any person who has been granted an exemption pursuant to this section may submit a petition to modify an exemption to include an additional (hazardous) waste or wastes. The Director may grant the modification if he determines, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the additional waste or wastes will behave hydraulically and chemically in a manner similar to previously included wastes and that it will not interfere with the containment capability of the injection zone.
§ 148.21
Information to be submitted in support of petitions.
(a) Information submitted in support of § 148.20 must meet the following criteria:
(1) All waste analysis and any new testing performed by the petitioner shall be accurate and reproducible and performed in accordance with quality assurance standards;
(2) Estimation techniques shall be appropriate, and EPA-certified test protocols shall be used where available and appropriate;
(3) Predictive models shall have been verified and validated, shall be appropriate for the specific site, waste streams, and injection conditions of the operation, and shall be calibrated for existing sites where sufficient data are available;
(4) An approved quality assurance and quality control plan shall address all aspects of the demonstration;
(5) Reasonably conservative values shall be used whenever values taken from the literature or estimated on the basis of known information are used instead of site-specific measurements; and
(6) An analysis shall be performed to identify and assess aspects of the demonstration that contribute significantly to uncertainty. The petitioner shall conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect that significant
uncertainty may contribute to the demonstration. The demonstration shall then be based on conservative assumptions identified in the analysis.
(b) Any petitioner under § 148.20(a)(1)(i) shall provide sufficient site-specific information to support the demonstration, such as:
(1) Thickness, porosity, permeability and extent of the various strata in the injection zone;
(2) Thickness, porosity, permeability, extent, and continuity of the confining zone;
(3) Hydraulic gradient in the injection zone;
(4) Hydrostatic pressure in the injection zone; and
(5) Geochemical conditions of the site.
(c) In addition to the information in § 148.21(b), any petitioner under § 148.20(a)(1)(ii) shall provide sufficient waste-specific information to ensure reasonably reliant predictions about the waste transformation. The petitioner shall provide the information necessary to support the demonstration, such as:
(1) Description of the chemical processes or other means that will lead to waste transformation; and
(2) Results of laboratory experiments verifying the waste transformation.
§ 148.22
Requirements for petition submission, review and approval or denial.
(a) Any petition submitted to the Director pursuant to § 148.20(a) shall include the following components:

(2) A waste analysis to describe fully the chemical and physical characteristics of the subject wastes;
(3) Such additional information as is required by the Director to support the petition under §§ 148.20 and 148.21; and
(4) This statement signed by the petitioner or an authorized representative:
I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted in this petition and all attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that submitted information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.
(b) The Director shall provide public notice and an opportunity for public comment in accordance with the procedures in § 124.10 of the intent to approve or deny a petition. The final decision on a petition will be published in the
Federal Register.
(c) If an exemption is granted it will apply only to the underground injection of the specific restricted waste or wastes identified in the petition into a Class I hazardous waste injection well or wells specifically identified in the petition (unless the exemption is modified or reissued pursuant to § 148.20(e) or (f).
(d) Upon request by any petitioner who obtains an exemption for a well under this subpart, the Director shall initiate and reasonably expedite the necessary procedures to issue or reissue a permit or permits for the hazardous waste well or wells covered by the exemption for a term not to exceed ten years.
§ 148.23
Review of exemptions granted pursuant to a petition.
(a) When considering whether to reissue a permit for the operation of a Class I hazardous waste injection well, the Director shall review any petition filed pursuant to § 148.20 and require a new demonstration if information shows that the basis for granting the exemption may no longer be valid.
(b) Whenever the Director determines that the basis for approval of a petition may no longer be valid, the Director shall require a new demonstration in accordance with § 148.20.
§ 148.24
Termination of approved petition.
(a) The Director may terminate an exemption granted under § 148.20 for the following causes:
(1) Noncompliance by the petitioner with any condition of the exemption;
(2) The petitioner's failure in the petition or during the review and approval to disclose fully all relevant facts, or the petitioner's misrepresentation of any relevant facts at any time; or

(b) The Director shall terminate an exemption granted under § 148.20 for the following causes:
(1) The petitioner's willful withholding during the review and approval of the petition of facts directly and materially relevant to the Director's decision on the petition;
(2) A determination that there has been migration from the injection zone or the well that is not in accordance with the terms of the exemption, except that the Director may at his discretion decide not to terminate where:
(i) The migration resulted from a mechanical failure of the well that can be corrected promptly through a repair to the injection well itself or from an undetected well or conduit that can be plugged promptly; and
(ii) The requirements of § 146.67(i) are satisfied.
(c) The Director shall follow the procedures in § 124.5 in terminating any exemption under this section.

Actions performed for the Federal government by contractors, such as construction of roads on Federal lands by a contractor under the supervision of the Bureau of Land Management, should be distinguished from contracts entered into specifically for the purpose of providing financial assistance, and will not be considered programs or actions receiving Federal financial assistance. Federal financial assistance is limited to benefits earmarked for a specific program or action and directly awarded to the program or action. Indirect assistance, e.g., in the form of a loan to a developer by a lending institution which in turn receives Federal assistance not specifically related to the project in question is not Federal financial assistance under section 1424(e).
(h)
Commitment of Federal financial assistance
means a written agreement entered into by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government to provide financial assistance as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. Renewal of a commitment which the issuing agency determines has lapsed shall not constitute a new commitment unless the Regional Administrator determines that the project's impact on the aquifer has not been previously reviewed under section 1424(e). The determination of a Federal agency that a certain written agreement constitutes a commitment shall be conclusive with respect to the existence of such a commitment.
(i)
Streamflow source zone
means the upstream headwaters area which drains
into the recharge zone as defined in the December 16, 1975, Notice of Determination.
(j)
Significant hazard to public health
means any level of contaminant which causes or may cause the aquifer to exceed any maximum contaminant level set forth in any promulgated National Primary Drinking Water Standard at any point where the water may be used for drinking purposes or which may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons, or which may require a public water system to install additional treatment to prevent such adverse effect.
(k)
Aquifer
means the Edwards Underground Reservoir.

§ 149.102
Project review authority.
(a) Once an area is designated, no subsequent commitments of Federal financial assistance may be made to projects which the Administrator determines may contaminate the aquifer so as to create a significant hazard to public health.
(b) The Regional Administrator is hereby delegated the authority and assigned responsibility for carrying out the project review process assigned to the Administrator under section 1424(e) of the Act, except the final determination that a project may contaminate the aquifer through its recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health.
(c) The Regional Administrator may review any project which he considers may potentially contaminate the aquifer through its recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health.
§ 149.103
Public information.
After the area is designated under section 1424(e), Federal agencies, for projects, located in the recharge zone and streamflow source zones, are required to:
(a) Maintain a list of projects for which environmental impact statements will be prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA);
(b) Revise the list at regular intervals and submit to EPA; and
(c) Make the list available to the public upon request.
§ 149.104
Submission of petitions.
Any person may submit a petition requesting the Regional Administrator to review a project to determine if such project may contaminate the aquifer through its recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health. Any such petition shall identify:
(a) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual, organization, or other entity submitting the petition;
(b) A brief statement of the requesting person's interest in the Regional Administrator's determination;
(c) The name of the project and Federal agency involved;
In addition, the petitioner is requested to submit to EPA available information on:
(d) Applicable action already taken by State and local agencies including establishment of regulations to prevent contamination of the aquifer and why, in the petitioner's judgment, the action was inadequate.
(e) Any actions taken under the National Environmental Policy Act and why, in the petitioner's judgment, that action was inadequate in regard to evaluation of potential effect on the aquifer.
(f) The potential contaminants involved;
(g) The means by which the contaminant might enter the aquifer; and
(h) The potential impact of the proposed project.
§ 149.105
Decision to review.
(a) The Regional Administrator shall review under section 1424(e) all projects located in the recharge or streamflow source zone of the aquifer for which a draft or final EIS is submitted which may have an impact on ground water quality and which involve Federal financial assistance as defined in these regulations.
(b) Upon receipt of a public petition, the Regional Administrator shall decide whether the project which is the subject of the petition should be reviewed under section 1424(e).
(c) The Regional Administrator may decide to review a project upon his own motion.
(d) In determining whether to review a project upon receipt of a public petition or upon his own motion, the Regional Administrator shall consider whether the project is likely to directly or indirectly cause contamination of the aquifer through its recharge zone, taking into account any factors he deems relevant, including:
(1) The location of the project, and
(2) The nature of the project.
(e) In determining whether to review a project upon receipt of a public petition or upon his own motion, the Regional Administrator may consult with, or request information from, the Federal agency to which the project application has been made, the applicant seeking Federal assistance, appropriate State and local agencies, and other appropriate persons or entities.
(f) In determining whether to review a project which is the subject of a public petition, the Regional Administrator may request such additional information from the petitioner as he deems necessary.
§ 149.106
Notice of review.
(a)
Notice to Federal agency.
If the Regional Administrator decides upon receipt of a public petition or upon his own motion to review a project under section 1424(e), he shall give written notification of the decision to the Federal agency from which financial assistance is sought. The notification shall include a description and identification of the project.
(b)
Notice to public.
When the Regional Administrator undertakes to review a project pursuant to § 149.13 above, he shall provide public notice of project review by such means as he deems appropriate. The notice shall set forth the availability for public review of all data and information available, and shall solicit comments, data and information with respect to the determination of impact under section 1424(e). The period for public comment shall be 30 days after public notice unless the Regional Administrator extends the period at his discretion or a public hearing is held under § 149.16.
§ 149.107
Request for information.
In reviewing a project under section 1424(e), the Regional Administrator may request any additional information from the funding Federal agency which is pertinent to reaching a decision. If full evaluation of the groundwater impact of a project has not been submitted in accordance with the agency's NEPA procedures, the Regional Administrator may specifically request that the Federal agency submit a groundwater impact evaluation of whether the proposed project may contaminate the aquifer through its recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health.
§ 149.108
Public hearing.
If there is significant public interest, the Regional Administrator may hold a public hearing with respect to any project or projects to be reviewed if he finds that such a hearing is necessary and would be helpful in clarifying the issues. Public hearings held under this section should be coordinated, if possible, with other Federal public hearings held pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. Any such hearing shall be conducted by the Regional Administrator or designee in an informal, orderly and expeditious manner. Where appropriate, limits may be placed upon the time allowed for oral statements, and statements may be required to be submitted in writing. The record will be held open for further public comment for seven (7) days following the close of the public hearing.
§ 149.109
Decision under section 1424(e).
(a) As soon as practicable after the submission of public comments under section 1424(e) and information requested by the Environmental Protection Agency from the originating Federal agency, on the basis of such information as is available to him, the Regional Administrator shall review the project taking all relevant factors into account including:
(1) The extent of possible public health hazard presented by the project;
(2) Planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring measures included in the project
which would prevent or mitigate the possible health hazard;
(3) The extent and effectiveness of State or local control over possible contaminant releases to the aquifer;
(4) The cumulative and secondary impacts of the proposed project; and
(5) The expected environmental benefits of the proposed project.
(b) After reviewing the available information, the Regional Administrator shall:
(1) Determine that the risk of contamination of the aquifer through the recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health is not sufficiently great so as to prevent commitment of Federal funding to the project; or
(2) Forward the information to the Administrator with his recommendation that the project may contaminate the aquifer through the recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health.
(c) After receiving the available information forwarded by the Regional Administrator, the Administrator shall:
(1) Determine that the risk of contamination of the aquifer through the recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health is not sufficiently great so as to prevent commitment of Federal funding to the project; or
(2) Determine that the project may contaminate the aquifer through the recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health.
(d) Notice of any decisions by the Regional Administrator under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or by the Administrator under paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section to prevent a commitment of Federal funding shall be published in the
Federal Register.
Such notices shall include a description of the propsed project, and a statement of decision with an accompanying statement of facts and reasons.
§ 149.110
Resubmittal of redesigned projects.
If a project is redesigned in response to EPA's objections, the applicant for Federal financial assistance or the grantor agency may file a petition with the Regional Administrator for withdrawal of the determination that the project may contaminate the aquifer through the recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health. Any such petition shall demonstrate how the project has been redesigned so as to justify the withdrawal of EPA's objections. If appropriate, the Regional Administrator may request public comments or hold an informal public hearing to consider the petition. After review of pertinent information, the Regional Administrator shall either deny the petition or recommend to the Administrator that the initial determination that a project may contaminate the aquifer be vacated. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Regional Administrator that a determination be vacated, the Administrator shall either deny the petition or order that the initial determination be vacated. The final decision regarding a petition shall be published in the
Federal Register
with an accompanying statement of reasons.
§ 149.111
Funding to redesigned projects.
After publication of a decision that a proposed project may contaminate a sole or principal source aquifer in a designated area through its recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, a commitment for Federal financial assistance may be entered into, if authorized under another provision of law, to plan or redesign such project to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer.
