11.2.9 Observe the presence of peaks in the EIPs that would confirm the presence of any target aromatic compounds. Using the EIP areas and EIP linear regression calibrations compare the abundance of the aromatic peaks, and if appropriate, determine approximate crude oil contamination in the sample for each of the target ions.
11.3 Qualitative Identification—See Section 17 of this method for schematic flowchart.
11.3.1 Qualitative identification shall be accomplished by comparison of the TIC and EIP area data from an authentic sample to the TIC and EIP area data from the calibration standards (
see
Section 10.4). Crude oil shall be identified by the presence of C
10
to C
13
n-alkanes and corresponding target aromatics.
11.3.2 Using the calibration data, establish the identity of the C
8
to C
13
peaks in the chromatogram of the sample. Using the calibration data, establish the identity of any target aromatics present on the extracted ion scans.
11.3.3 Crude oil is not present in a detectable amount in the sample if there are no target aromatics seen on the extracted ion scans. The experience of the analyst shall weigh heavily in the determination of the presence of peaks at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 or greater.
11.3.4 If the chromatogram shows n-alkanes from C
8
to C
13
and target aromatics to be present, contamination by crude oil or diesel shall be suspected and quantitative analysis shall be determined. If there are no n-alkanes present that are not seen on the blank, and no target aromatics are seen, the sample can be considered to be free of contamination.
11.4 Quantitative Identification—
11.4.1 Determine the area of the peaks from C
8
to C
13
as outlined in the calibration section (10.4.1 of this appendix). If the area of the peaks for the sample is greater than that for the clean NAF (base fluid) use the crude oil/drilling fluid calibration TIC linear regression curve to determine approximate crude oil contamination.
11.4.2 Using the EIPs outlined in Section 10.4.2 of this appendix, determine the presence of any target aromatics. Using the integration techniques outlined in Section 10.4.2 of this appendix, obtain the EIP areas for m/z 91 and 105. Use the crude oil/drilling fluid calibration EIP linear regression curves to determine approximate crude oil contamination.
11.5 Complex Samples—
11.5.1 The most common interferences in the determination of crude oil can be from mineral oil, diesel oil, and proprietary additives in drilling fluids.
11.5.2 Mineral oil can typically be identified by its lower target aromatic content, and narrow range of strong peaks.
11.5.3 Diesel oil can typically be identified by low amounts of n-alkanes from C
7
to C
9
, and the absence of n-alkanes greater than C
25
.
11.5.4 Crude oils can usually be distinguished by the presence of high aromatics, increased intensities of C
8
to C
13
peaks, and/ or the presence of higher hydrocarbons of C
25
and greater (which may be difficult to see in some synthetic fluids at low contamination levels).
11.5.4.1 Oil condensates from gas wells are low in molecular weight and will normally produce strong chromatographic peaks in the C
8
-C
13
range. If a sample of the gas condensate crude oil from the formation is available, the oil can be distinguished from other potential sources of contamination by using it to prepare a calibration standard.
11.5.4.2 Asphaltene crude oils with API gravity
20 may not produce chromatographic peaks strong enough to show contamination at levels of the calibration. Extracted ion peaks should be easier to see than increased intensities for the C8 to C13 peaks. If a sample of asphaltene crude from the formation is available, a calibration standard shall be prepared.
11.6 System and Laboratory Performance—
11.6.1 At the beginning of each 8-hour shift during which analyses are performed,
GC crude oil/drilling fluid calibration and system performance test mixes shall be verified. For these tests, analysis of the medium-level calibration standard (1-% Reference Oil in IO Lab drilling fluid, and 1.25 mg/mL SPTM with internal standard) shall be used to verify all performance criteria. Adjustments and/or re-calibration (per Section 10 of this appendix) shall be performed until all performance criteria are met. Only after all performance criteria are met may samples and blanks be analyzed.
11.6.2 Inject 1.0 µL of the medium-level GC/MS crude oil/drilling fluid calibration standard into the GC instrument according to the procedures in Section 11.2 of this appendix. Verify that the linear regression curves for both TIC area and EIP areas are still valid using this continuing calibration standard.
11.6.3 After this analysis is complete, inject 1.0 µL of the 1.25 mg/mL SPTM (containing internal standard) into the GC instrument and verify the proper retention times are met (
see
Table 2 of this appendix).
11.6.4 Retention times—Retention time of the internal standard. The absolute retention time of the TCB internal standard shall be within the range 21.0 ±0.5 minutes. Relative retention times of the n-alkanes: The retention times of the n-alkanes relative to the TCB internal standard shall be similar to those given in Table 2 of this appendix.

# 12.0 Calculations
The concentration of oil in NAFs drilling fluids shall be computed relative to peak areas between C
8
and C
13
(using the Total Area Integration method) or total peak areas from extracted ion profiles (using the Extracted Ion Profile Method). In either case, there is a measurable amount of peak area, even in clean drilling fluid samples, due to spurious peaks and electrometer “noise” that contributes to the total signal measured using either of the quantification methods. In this procedure, a correction for this signal is applied, using the blank or clean sample correction technique described in American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) Method D-3328-90, Comparison of Waterborne Oil by Gas Chromatography. In
this method, the “oil equivalents” measured in a blank sample by total area gas chromatography are subtracted from that determined for a field sample to arrive at the most accurate measure of oil residue in the authentic sample.
12.1 Total Area Integration Method
12.1.1 Using C
8
to C
13
TIC area, the TCB area in the clean NAF sample and the TIC linear regression curve, compute the oil equivalent concentration of the C
8
to C
13
retention time range in the clean NAF.

# Note:
The actual TIC area of the C
8
to C
13
is equal to the C
8
to C
13
area minus the area of the TCB.
12.1.2 Using the corresponding information for the authentic sample, compute the oil equivalent concentration of the C
8
to C
13
retention time range in the authentic sample.
12.1.3 Calculate the concentration (% oil) of oil in the sample by subtracting the oil equivalent concentration (% oil) found in the clean NAF from the oil equivalent concentration (% oil) found in the authentic sample.
12.2 EIP Area Integration Method
12.2.1 Using either m/z 91 or 105 EIP areas, the TCB area in the clean NAF sample, and the appropriate EIP linear regression curve, compute the oil equivalent concentration of the in the clean NAF.
12.2.2 Using the corresponding information for the authentic sample, compute its oil equivalent concentration.
12.2.3 Calculate the concentration (% oil) of oil in the sample by subtracting the oil equivalent concentration (% oil) found in the clean NAF from the oil equivalent concentration (% oil) found in the authentic sample.

8.4 All samples must be analyzed within 28 days of the date and time of collection (40 CFR part 136, Table II).

# 9.0 Quality Control
9.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality assurance program (Reference 16.3). The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability, and ongoing analyses of blanks and spiked duplicates to assess accuracy and precision and to demonstrate continued performance. Each field sample is analyzed in duplicate to demonstrate representativeness.
9.1.1 The analyst shall make an initial demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 9.2 of this appendix.
9.1.2 Preparation and analysis of a set of spiked duplicate samples to document accuracy and precision. The procedure for the preparation and analysis of these samples is described in Section 9.4 of this appendix.
9.1.3 Analyses of laboratory reagent blanks are required to demonstrate freedom from contamination. The procedure and criteria for preparation and analysis of a reagent blank are described in Section 9.5 of this appendix.
9.1.4 The laboratory shall maintain records to define the quality of the data that is generated.
9.1.5 Accompanying QC for the determination of oil in NAF is required per analytical batch. An analytical batch is a set of samples extracted at the same time, to a maximum of 10 samples. Each analytical batch of 10 or fewer samples must be accompanied by a laboratory reagent blank (Section 9.5 of this appendix), corresponding NAF reference blanks (Section 9.6 of this appendix), a set of spiked duplicate samples blank (Section 9.4 of this appendix), and duplicate analysis of each field sample. If greater than 10 samples are to be extracted at one time, the samples must be separated into analytical batches of 10 or fewer samples.
9.2 Initial demonstration of laboratory capability. To demonstrate the capability to perform the test, the analyst shall analyze two representative unused drilling fluids (e.g., internal olefin-based drilling fluid, vegetable ester-based drilling fluid), each prepared separately containing 0.1%, 1%, and 2% or a representative oil. Each drilling fluid/concentration combination shall be analyzed 10 times, and successful demonstration will yield the following average results for the data set:
0.1% oil—Detected in
20% of samples
1% oil—Detected in
75% of samples
2% oil—Detected in
90% of samples
9.3 Sample duplicates.
9.3.1 The laboratory shall prepare and analyze (Section 11.2 and 11.4 of this appendix) each authentic sample in duplicate, from a given sampling site or, if for compliance monitoring, from a given discharge.
9.3.2 The duplicate samples must be compared versus the prepared corresponding NAF blank.
9.3.3 Prepare and analyze the duplicate samples according to procedures outlined in Section 11 of this appendix.
9.3.4 The results of the duplicate analyses are acceptable if each of the results give the same response (fluorescence or no fluorescence). If the results are different, sample non-homogenicity issues may be a concern.
Prepare the samples again, ensuring a well-mixed sample prior to extraction. Analyze the samples once again.
9.3.5 If different results are obtained for the duplicate a second time, the analytical system is judged to be out of control and the problem shall be identified and corrected, and the samples re-analyzed.
9.4 Spiked duplicates—Laboratory prepared spiked duplicates are analyzed to demonstrate acceptable accuracy and precision.
9.4.1 Preparation and analysis of a set of spiked duplicate samples with each set of no more than 10 field samples is required to demonstrate method accuracy and precision and to monitor matrix interferences (interferences caused by the sample matrix). A field NAF sample expected to contain less than 0.5% crude oil (and documented to not fluoresce as part of the sample batch analysis) shall be spiked with 1% (by volume) of suitable reference crude oil and analyzed as field samples, as described in Section 11 of this appendix. If no low-level drilling fluid is available, then the unused NAF can be used as the drilling fluid sample.
9.5 Laboratory reagent blanks—Laboratory reagent blanks are analyzed to demonstrate freedom from contamination.
9.5.1 A reagent blank is prepared by passing 4 mL of the isopropyl alcohol through a Teflon syringe filter and collecting the filtrate in a 4-mL glass vial. A Sep Pak ® C
18
cartridge is then preconditioned with 3 mL of isopropyl alcohol. A 0.5-mL aliquot of the filtered isopropyl alcohol is added to the syringe barrel along with 3.0 mL of isopropyl alcohol. The solvent is passed through the preconditioned Sep Pak ® cartridge. An additional 2-mL of isopropyl alcohol is eluted through the cartridge. The cartridge is now considered the “reagent blank” cartridge and is ready for viewing (analysis). Check the reagent blank cartridge under the black light for fluorescence. If the isopropyl alcohol and filter are clean, no fluorescence will be observed.
9.5.2 If fluorescence is detected in the reagent blank cartridge, analysis of the samples is halted until the source of contamination is eliminated and a prepared reagent blank shows no fluorescence under a black light. All samples shall be associated with an uncontaminated method blank before the results may be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
9.6 NAF reference blanks—NAF reference blanks are prepared from the NAFs sent from the supplier (NAF that has not been circulated downhole) and used as the reference when viewing the fluorescence of the test samples.
9.6.1 A NAF reference blank is prepared identically to the authentic samples. Place a 0.1 mL aliquot of the “clean” NAF into a 25-mL glass vial. Add 10 mL of isopropyl alcohol to the vial. Cap the vial. Vortex the vial for approximately 10 sec. Allow the solids to settle for approximately 15 minutes. Using a 5-mL syringe, draw up 4 mL of the extract and filter it through a PTFE syringe filter, collecting the filtrate in a 4-mL glass vial. Precondition a Sep Pak ® C
18
cartridge with 3 mL of isopropyl alcohol. Add a 0.5-mL aliquot of the filtered extract to the syringe barrel along with 3.0 mL of isopropyl alcohol. Pass the extract and solvent through the preconditioned Sep Pak ® cartridge. Pass an additional 2-mL of isopropyl alcohol through the cartridge. The cartridge is now considered the NAF blank cartridge and is ready for viewing (analysis). This cartridge is used as the reference cartridge for determining the absence or presence of fluorescence in all authentic drilling fluid samples that originate from the same NAF. That is, the specific NAF reference blank cartridge is put under the black light along with a prepared cartridge of an authentic sample originating from the same NAF material. The fluorescence or absence of fluorescence in the authentic sample cartridge is determined relative to the NAF reference cartridge.
9.6.2 Positive control solution, equivalent to 1% crude oil contaminated mud extract, is prepared by dissolving 87 mg of standard crude oil into 10.00 mL of methylene chloride. Then mix 40 µL of this solution into 10.00 mL of IPA. Transfer 0.5 mL of this solution into a preconditioned C18 cartridge, followed by 2 ml of IPA.

11.3 Reagent blank fluorescence testing.
11.3.1 Place the reagent blank cartridge in a black box, under a black light.
11.3.2 Determine the presence or absence of fluorescence for the reagent blank cartridge. If fluorescence is detected in the blank, analysis of the samples is halted until the source of contamination is eliminated and a prepared reagent blank shows no fluorescence under a black light. All samples must be associated with an uncontaminated method blank before the results may be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
11.4 Sample fluorescence testing.
11.4.1 Place the respective NAF reference blank (Section 9.6 of this appendix) onto the tray inside the black box.

# Appendix 7 to Subpart A of Part 435—Determination of the Amount of Non-Aqueous Drilling Fluid (NAF) Base Fluid From Drill Cuttings by a Retort Chamber (Derived From API Recommended Practice 13B-2) (EPA Method 1674)

# 1. Description
a. This procedure is specifically intended to measure the amount of non-aqueous drilling fluid (NAF) base fluid from cuttings generated during a drilling operation. This procedure is a retort test which measures all oily material (NAF base fluid) and water released from a cuttings sample when heated in a calibrated and properly operating “Retort” instrument.
b. In this retort test a known mass of cuttings is heated in the retort chamber to vaporize the liquids associated with the sample. The NAF base fluid and water vapors are then condensed, collected, and measured in a precision graduated receiver.

# Note:
Obtaining a representative sample requires special attention to the details of sample handling (e.g., location, method, frequency). See Addendum A and B for minimum requirements for collecting representative samples. Additional sampling procedures in a given area may be specified by the NPDES permit controlling authority.

# 3. Procedure
a. Clean and dry the retort assembly and condenser.
b. Pack the retort body with steel wool.
c. Apply lubricant/sealant to threads of retort cup and retort stem.
d. Weigh and record the total mass of the retort cup, lid, and retort body with steel wool. This is mass (A), grams.
e. Collect a representative cuttings sample (
see
note in section 1 of this appendix).
f. Partially fill the retort cup with cuttings and place the lid on the cup.
g. Screw the retort cup (with lid) onto the retort body, weigh and record the total mass. This is mass (B), grams.
h. Attach the condenser. Place the retort assembly into the heating jacket.
i. Weigh and record the mass of the clean and dry liquid receiver. This is mass (C), grams. Place the receiver below condenser outlet.
j. Turn on the retort. Allow it to run a minimum of 1 hour.

# Note:
If solids boil over into receiver, the test shall be rerun. Pack the retort body with a greater amount of steel wool and repeat the test.
k. Remove the liquid receiver. Allow it to cool. Record the volume of water recovered. This is (V), cm
3
.

# Note:
If an emulsion interface is present between the oil and water phases, heating the interface may break the emulsion. As a suggestion, remove the retort assembly from the heating jacket by grasping the condenser. Carefully heat the receiver along the emulsion band by gently touching the receiver for short intervals with the hot retort assembly. Avoid boiling the liquids. After the emulsion interface is broken, allow the liquid receiver to cool. Read the water volume at the lowest point of the meniscus.
l. Weigh and record the mass of the receiver and its liquid contents (oil plus water). This is mass (D), grams.
m. Turn off the retort. Remove the retort assembly and condenser from the heating jacket and allow them to cool. Remove the condenser.
n. Weigh and record the mass of the cooled retort assembly without the condenser. This is mass (E), grams.
o. Clean the retort assembly and condenser.

# 4. Calculations
a. Calculate the mass of oil (NAF base fluid) from the cuttings as follows:
1. Mass of the wet cuttings sample (M
w
) equals the mass of the retort assembly with the wet cuttings sample (B) minus the mass of the empty retort assembly (A).
M
w
= B−A [1]
2. Mass of the dry retorted cuttings (M
D
) equals the mass of the cooled retort assembly (E) minus the mass of the empty retort assembly (A).
M
D
= E−A [2]
3. Mass of the NAF base fluid (M
BF
) equals the mass of the liquid receiver with its contents (D) minus the sum of the mass of the dry receiver (C) and the mass of the water (V).
M
BF
= D−(C + V) [3]

# Note:
Assuming the density of water is 1 g/cm
3
, the volume of water is equivalent to the mass of the water.
b. Mass balance requirement:
The sum of M
D
, M
BF
, and V shall be within 5% of the mass of the wet sample.
(M
D
+ M
BF
+ V)/M
w
= 0.95 to 1.05 [4]
The procedure shall be repeated if this requirement is not met.
c. Reporting oil from cuttings:
1. Assume that all oil recovered is NAF base fluid.
2. The mass percent NAF base fluid retained on the cuttings (%BF
i
) for the sampled discharge “i” is equal to 100 times the mass of the NAF base fluid (M
BF
) divided by the mass of the wet cuttings sample (M
w
).
%BF
i
= (M
BF
/M
w
) × 100 [5]
Operators discharging small volume NAF-cuttings discharges which do not occur during a NAF-cuttings discharge sampling interval (
i.e.
, displaced interfaces, accumulated solids in sand traps, pit clean-out solids, or centrifuge discharges while cutting mud weight) shall either: (a) Measure the mass percent NAF base fluid retained on the cuttings (%BF
SVD
) for each small volume NAF-cuttings discharges; or (b) use a default value of 25% NAF base fluid retained on the cuttings.
3. The mass percent NAF base fluid retained on the cuttings is determined for all cuttings wastestreams and includes fines discharges and any accumulated solids discharged [
see
Section 4.c.6 of this appendix for procedures on measuring or estimating the mass percent NAF base fluid retained on the cuttings (%BF) for dual gradient drilling seafloor discharges performed to ensure proper operation of subsea pumps].
4. A mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction (X, unitless) is calculated for all NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharges every time a set of retorts is performed (
see
Section 4.c.6 of this appendix for procedures on measuring or estimating the mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction (X) for dual gradient drilling seafloor discharges performed to ensure proper operation of subsea pumps). The mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction (X) combines the mass of NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharged from a particular discharge over a set period of time with the total mass of NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharged into the ocean during the same period of time (
see
Addendum A and B of this appendix). The mass NAF-cuttings discharge
fraction (X) for each discharge is calculated by direct measurement as:
X
i
= (F
i
)/(G) [6]
where:
X
i
= Mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction for NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharge “i”, (unitless)
F
i
= Mass of NAF-cuttings discharged from NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharge “i” over a specified period of time (
see
Addendum A and B of this appendix), (kg)
G = Mass of all NAF-cuttings discharges into the ocean during the same period of time as used to calculate F
i
, (kg)
If an operator has more than one point of NAF-cuttings discharge, the mass faction (X
i
) must be determined by: (a) Direct measurement (
see
Equation 6 of this appendix); (b) using the following default values of 0.85 and 0.15 for the cuttings dryer (e.g., horizontal centrifuge, vertical centrifuge, squeeze press, High-G linear shakers) and fines removal unit (e.g., decanting centrifuges, mud cleaners), respectively, when the operator is only discharging from the cuttings dryer and the fines removal unit; or (c) using direct measurement of “F
i
” (
see
Equation 6 of this appendix) for fines and accumulated solids, using Equation 6A of this appendix to calculate “G
EST
” for use as “G” in Equation 6 of this Appendix, and calculating the mass (kg) of NAF-cuttings discharged from the cuttings dryer (F
i
) as the difference between the mass of “G
EST
” calculated in Equation 6A of this appendix (kg) and the sum of all fines and accumulated solids mass directly measured (kg) (
see
Equation 6 of this appendix).
G
EST
= Estimated mass of all NAF-cuttings discharges into the ocean during the same period of time as used to calculate F
i
(
see
Equation 6 of this appendix), (kg) [6A]
where:
G
EST
= Hole Volume (bbl) × (396.9 kg/bbl) × (1 + Z/100)
Z = The base fluid retained on cuttings limitation or standard (%) which apply to the NAF being discharge (
see
§§ 435.13. and 435.15).
Hole Volume (bbl) = [Cross-Section Area of NAF interval (in
2
)] × Average Rate of Penetration (feet/hr) × period of time (min) used to calculate F
i
(
see
Equation 6 of this appendix) × (1 hr/60 min) × (1 bbl/5.61 ft
3
) × (1 ft/12 in)
2
Cross-Section Area of NAF interval (in
2
) = (3.14 × [Bit Diameter (in)]
2
)/4
Bit Diameter (in) = Diameter of drilling bit for the NAF interval producing drilling cuttings during the same period of time as used to calculate F
i
(
see
Equation 6 of this appendix)
Average Rate of Penetration (feet/hr) = Arithmetic average of rate of penetration into the formation during the same period of time as used to calculate F
i
(
see
Equation 6 of this appendix)

# Note:
Operators with one NAF-cuttings discharge may set the mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction (X
i
) equal to 1.0.
5. Each NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharge has an associated mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BF) and mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction (X) each time a set of retorts is performed. A single total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BF
T
) is calculated every time a set of retorts is performed. The single total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BF
T
) is calculated as:
%BF
T,j
= Σ(X
i
) × (%BF
i
) [7]
where:
%BF
T,j
= Total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value for retort set “j” (unitless as percentage, %)
X
i
= Mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction for NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharge “i”, (unitless)
%BF
i
= Mass percent NAF base fluid retained on the cuttings for NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharge “i” , (unitless as percentage, %)

# Note:
ΣX
i
= 1.
Operators with one NAF-cuttings discharge may set %BF
T,j
equal to %BF
i
.
6. Operators performing dual gradient drilling operations may require seafloor discharges of large cuttings (
1/4
′) to ensure the proper operation of subsea pumps (e.g., electrical submersible pumps). Operators performing dual gradient drilling operations which lead to seafloor discharges of large cuttings for the proper operation of subsea pumps shall either: (a) Measure the mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BF) and mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction (X) for seafloor discharges each time a set of retorts is performed; (b) use the following set of default values, (%BF = 14%; X = 0.15); or (c) use a combination of (a) and (b) (e.g., use a default value for %BF and measure X).
Additionally, operators performing dual gradient drilling operations which lead to seafloor discharges of large cuttings for the proper operation of subsea pumps shall also perform the following tasks:
(a) Use side scan sonar or shallow seismic to determine the presence of high density chemosynthetic communities. Chemosynthetic communities are assemblages of tube worms, clams, mussels, and bacterial mats that occur at natural hydrocarbon seeps or vents, generally in water depths of 500 meters or deeper. Seafloor discharges of large cuttings for the proper operation of subsea pumps shall not be permitted
within 1000 feet of a high density chemosynthetic community.
(b) Seafloor discharges of large cuttings for the proper operation of subsea pumps shall be visually monitored and documented by a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) within the tether limit (approximately 300 feet). The visual monitoring shall be conducted prior to each time the discharge point is relocated (cuttings discharge hose) and conducted along the same direction as the discharge hose position. Near-seabed currents shall be obtained at the time of the visual monitoring.
(c) Seafloor discharges of large cuttings for the proper operation of subsea pumps shall be directed within a 150 foot radius of the wellbore.
7. The weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BF
well
) is the compliance value that is compared with the “maximum weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections” BAT discharge limitations (
see
the table in § 435.13 and footnote 5 of the table in § 435.43) or the “maximum weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections” NSPS discharge limitations (
see
the table in § 435.15 and footnote 5 of the table in § 435.45). The weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BF
well
) is calculated as the arithmetic average of all total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings values (%BF
T
) and is given by the following expression:
%BF
well
= [j = 1 to j = n Σ (%BF
T,j
)]/n [8]
where:
%BF
well
= Weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (unitless as percentage, %)
%BF
T,j
= Total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value for retort set “j” (unitless as percentage, %)
n = Total number of retort sets performed over all NAF well sections (unitless)
Small volume NAF-cuttings discharges which do not occur during a NAF-cuttings discharge sampling interval (
i.e.
, displaced interfaces, accumulated solids in sand traps, pit clean-out solids, or centrifuge discharges while cutting mud weight) shall be mass averaged with the arithmetic average of all total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings values (see Equation 8 of this appendix). An additional sampling interval shall be added to the calculation of the weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BF
well
). The mass fraction of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (X
SVD
) will be determined by dividing the mass of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (F
SVD
) by the total mass of NAF-cuttings discharges for the well drilling operation (G
WELL
+ F
SVD
).
X
SVD
= F
SVD
/ (G
WELL
+ F
SVD
) [9]
where:
X
SVD
= mass fraction of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (unitless)
F
SVD
= mass of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (kg)
G
WELL
= mass of total NAF-cuttings from the well (kg)
The mass of small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (F
SVD
) shall be determined by multiplying the density of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (ρ
svd
) times the volume of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (V
SVD
).
F
SVD
= ρ
svd
× V
SVD
[10]
where:
F
SVD
= mass of small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (kg)
ρ
svd
= density of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (kg/bbl)
V
SVD
= volume of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges (bbl)
The density of the small volume NAF-cuttings discharges shall be measured. The volume of small volume discharges (V
SVD
) shall be either: (a) Be measured or (b) use default values of 10 bbl of SBF for each interface loss and 75 bbl of SBM for pit cleanout per well.
The total mass of NAF-cuttings discharges for the well (G
WELL
) shall be either: (a) Measured; or (b) calculated by multiplying 1.0 plus the arithmetic average of all total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings values [see Equation 8 of this appendix] times the total hole volume (V
WELL
) for all NAF well sections times a default value for the density the formation of 2.5 g/cm
3
(396.9 kg/bbl).
ER08JN01.001
where:
G
WELL
= total mass of NAF-cuttings discharges for the well (kg)
[j = 1 to j = n Σ(%BF
T,j
)]/n = see Equation 8 of this appendix (unitless as a percentage)
V
WELL
= total hole volume (V
WELL
) for all NAF well sections (bbl)
The total hole volume of NAF well sections (V
WELL
) will be calculated as:
ER22JA01.170
For wells where small volume discharges associated with cuttings are made, %BF
WELL
becomes:
ER08JN01.002

# Note:
See Addendum A and B to determine the sampling frequency to determine the total number of retort sets required for all NAF well sections.
8. The total number of retort sets (n) is increased by 1 for each sampling interval (
see
Section 2.4, Addendum A of this appendix) when all NAF cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids for that sampling interval are retained for no discharge. A zero discharge interval shall be at least 500 feet up to a maximum of three per day. This action has the effect of setting the total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BF
T
) at zero for that NAF sampling interval when all NAF cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids are retained for no discharge.
9. Operators that elect to use the Best Management Practices (BMPs) for NAF-cuttings shall use the procedures outlined in Addendum B.

# Addendum A to Appendix 7 to Subpart A of Part 435—Sampling of Cuttings Discharge Streams for use with API Recommended Practice 13B-2

# 1.0 Sampling Locations
1.1 Each NAF-cuttings waste stream that discharges into the ocean shall be sampled and analyzed as detailed in appendix 7. NAF-cuttings discharges to the ocean may include discharges from primary shakers, secondary shakers, cuttings dryer, fines removal unit, accumulated solids, and any other cuttings separation device whose NAF-cuttings waste is discharged to the ocean. NAF-cuttings wastestreams not directly discharged to the ocean (e.g., NAF-cuttings generated from shake shakers and sent to a cuttings dryer for additional processing) do not require sampling and analysis.
1.2 The collected samples shall be representative of each NAF-cuttings discharge. Operators shall conduct sampling to avoid the serious consequences of error (
i.e.,
bias or inaccuracy). Operators shall collect NAF-cuttings samples near the point of origin and before the solids and liquid fractions of the stream have a chance to separate from one another. For example, operators shall collect shale shaker NAF-cuttings samples at the point where NAF-cuttings are coming off the shale shaker and not from a holding container downstream where separation of larger particles from the liquid can take place.
1.3 Operators shall provide a simple schematic diagram of the solids control system and sample locations to the NPDES permit controlling authority.

# 2.0 Type of Sample and Sampling Frequency
2.1 Each NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharge has an associated mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BF) and mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction (X) for each sampling interval (
see
Section 2.4 of this addendum). Operators shall collect a single discrete NAF-cuttings sample for each NAF-cuttings waste stream discharged to the ocean during every sampling interval.
2.2 Operators shall use measured depth in feet from the Kelly bushing when samples are collected.
2.3 The NAF-cuttings samples collected for the mass fraction analysis (
see
Equation 6, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part) shall also be used for the retort analysis (
see
Equations 1-5, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part).
2.4 Operators shall collect and analyze at least one set of NAF-cuttings samples per day while discharging. Operators engaged in fast drilling (
i.e.,
greater than 500 linear NAF feet advancement of drill bit per day) shall collect and analyze one set of NAF-cuttings samples per 500 linear NAF feet of footage drilled. Operators are not required to collect and analyze more than three sets of NAF-cuttings samples per day (
i.e.,
three sampling intervals). Operators performing zero discharge of all NAF-cuttings (
i.e.,
all NAF cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids retained for no discharge) shall use the following periods to count sampling intervals:
(1) One sampling interval per day when drilling is less than 500 linear NAF feet advancement of drill bit per day; and (2) one sampling interval per 500 linear NAF feet of footage drilled with a maximum of three sampling intervals per day.
2.5 The operator shall measure the individual masses (F
i
, kg) and sum total mass (G, kg) (
see
Equation 6, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part) over a representative period of time (e.g.,
10 minutes) during steady-state conditions for each sampling interval (
see
Section 2.4 of this addendum). The operator shall ensure that all NAF-cuttings are capture for mass analysis during the same sampling time period (e.g.,
10 minutes) at approximately the same time (
i.e.,
all individual mass samples collected within one hour of each other).
2.6 Operators using Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control NAF-cuttings discharges shall follow the procedures in Addendum B to appendix 7 of subpart A of 40 CFR 435.

# 3.0 Sample Size and Handling
3.1 The volume of each sample depends on the volumetric flow rate (cm
3
/s) of the NAF-cuttings stream and the sampling time period (e.g.,
10 minutes). Consequently, different solids control equipment units producing different NAF-cuttings waste streams at different volumetric flow rates will produce different size samples for the same period of time. Operators shall use appropriately sized sample containers for each NAF-cuttings waste stream to ensure no NAF-cuttings are spilled during sample collection. Operators shall use the same time period (e.g.,
10 minutes) to collect NAF-cuttings samples from each NAF-cuttings waste stream. Each NAF-cuttings sample size shall be at least one gallon. Operators shall clearly mark each container to identify each NAF-cuttings sample.
3.2 Operators shall not decant, heat, wash, or towel the NAF-cuttings to remove NAF base fluid before mass and retort analysis.
3.3 Operators shall first calculate the mass of each NAF-cuttings sample and perform the mass ratio analysis (
see
Equation 6, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part). Operators with only one NAF-cuttings discharge may skip this step (
see
Section 4.c.4, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part).
3.4 Operators shall homogenize (e.g., stirring, shaking) each NAF-cuttings sample prior to placing a sub-sample into the retort cup. The bottom of the NAF-cuttings sample container shall be examined to be sure that solids are not sticking to it.
3.5 Operators shall then calculate the NAF base fluid retained on cuttings using the retort procedure (
see
Equations 1-5, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part). Operators shall start the retort analyses no more than two hours after collecting the first individual mass sample for the sampling interval .
3.6 Operators shall not discharge any sample before successfully completing the mass and retort analyses [
i.e.
, mass balance requirements (
see
Section 4.b, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part) are satisfied]. Operators shall immediately re-run the retort analyses if the mass balance requirements (
see
Equation 4, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part) are not within a tolerance of 5% (
see
Section 4.b, Equation 4, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part).

# 4.0 Calculations
4.1 Operators shall calculate a set of mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings values (%BF) and mass NAF-cuttings discharge fractions (X) for each NAF-cuttings waste stream (
see
Section 1.1 of this addendum) for each sampling interval (
see
Section 2.4 of this addendum) using the procedures outlined in appendix 7 of subpart A of this part.
4.2 Operators shall tabulate the following data for each individual NAF-cuttings sample: (1) Date and time of NAF-cuttings sample collection; (2) time period of NAF-cuttings sample collection (
see
Section 3.1 of this addendum); (3) mass and volume of each NAF-cuttings sample; (4) measured depth (feet) at NAF-cuttings sample collection (
see
Section 2.2 of this addendum); (5) respective linear feet of hole drilled represented by the NAF-cuttings sample (feet); and (6) the drill bit diameter (inches) used to generate the NAF-cuttings sample cuttings.
4.3 Operators shall calculate a single total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BF
T
) for each sampling interval (
see
Section 2.4 of this addendum) using the procedures outlined in appendix 7 of subpart A of this part.
4.4 Operators shall tabulate the following data for each total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BF
T
) for each NAF-cuttings sampling interval: (1) Date and starting and stopping times of NAF-cuttings sample collection and retort analyses; (2) measured depth of well (feet) at start of NAF-cuttings sample collection (
see
Section 2.2 of this addendum); (3) respective linear feet of hole drilled represented by the NAF-cuttings sample (feet); (4) the drill bit diameter (inches) used to generate the NAF-cuttings sample cuttings; and (5) annotation when zero discharge of NAF-cuttings is performed.
4.5 Operators shall calculate the weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BF
well
) using the procedures outlined in appendix 7 of subpart A of this part.
4.6 Operators shall tabulate the following data for each weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BF
well
) for each NAF well: (1) Starting and stopping dates of NAF well sections; (2) measured depth (feet)
of all NAF well sections; (3) total number of sampling intervals (
see
Section 2.4 and Section 2.6 of this addendum); (4) number of sampling intervals tabulated during any zero discharge operations; (5) total volume of zero discharged NAF-cuttings over entire NAF well sections; and (6) identification of whether BMPs were employed (
see
Addendum B of appendix 7 of subpart A of this part).

# Addendum B to Appendix 7 to Subpart A of Part 435—Best Management Practices (BMPs) for use with API Recommended Practice 13B-2

# 1.0 Overview of BMPs
1.1 Best Management Practices (BMPs) are inherently pollution prevention practices. BMPs may include the universe of pollution prevention encompassing production modifications, operational changes, material substitution, materials and water conservation, and other such measures. BMPs include methods to prevent toxic and hazardous pollutants from reaching receiving waters. Because BMPs are most effective when organized into a comprehensive facility BMP Plan, operators shall develop a BMP in accordance with the requirements in this addendum.
1.2 The BMP requirements contained in this appendix were compiled from several Regional permits, an EPA guidance document (
i.e.
, Guidance Document for Developing Best Management Practices (BMP)” (EPA 833-B-93-004, U.S. EPA, 1993)), and draft industry BMPs. These common elements represent the appropriate mix of broad directions needed to complete a BMP Plan along with specific tasks common to all drilling operations.
1.3 Operators are not required to use BMPs if all NAF-cuttings discharges are monitored in accordance with appendix 7 of subpart A of this part.

# 2.0 BMP Plan Purpose and Objectives
2.1 Operators shall design the BMP Plan to prevent or minimize the generation and the potential for the discharge of NAF from the facility to the waters of the United States through normal operations and ancillary activities. The operator shall establish specific objectives for the control of NAF by conducting the following evaluations.
2.2 The operator shall identify and document each NAF well that uses BMPs before starting drilling operations and the anticipated total feet to be drilled with NAF for that particular well.
2.3 Each facility component or system controlled through use of BMPs shall be examined for its NAF-waste minimization opportunities and its potential for causing a discharge of NAF to waters of the United States due to equipment failure, improper operation, natural phenomena (e.g., rain, snowfall).
2.4 For each NAF wastestream controlled through BMPs where experience indicates a reasonable potential for equipment failure (e.g., a tank overflow or leakage), natural condition (e.g., precipitation), or other circumstances to result in NAF reaching surface waters, the BMP Plan shall include a prediction of the total quantity of NAF which could be discharged from the facility as a result of each condition or circumstance.

# 3.0 BMP Plan Requirements
3.1 The BMP Plan may reflect requirements within the pollution prevention requirements required by the Minerals Management Service (
see
30 CFR 250.300) or other Federal or State requirements and incorporate any part of such plans into the BMP Plan by reference.
3.2 The operator shall certify that its BMP Plan is complete, on-site, and available upon request to EPA or the NPDES Permit controlling authority. This certification shall identify the NPDES permit number and be signed by an authorized representative of the operator. This certification shall be kept with the BMP Plan. For new or modified NPDES permits, the certification shall be made no later than the effective date of the new or modified permit. For existing NPDES permits, the certification shall be made within one year of permit issuance.
3.3 The BMP Plan shall:
3.3.1 Be documented in narrative form, and shall include any necessary plot plans, drawings or maps, and shall be developed in accordance with good engineering practices. At a minimum, the BMP Plan shall contain the planning, development and implementation, and evaluation/reevaluation components. Examples of these components are contained in “Guidance Document for Developing Best Management Practices (BMP)” (EPA 833-B-93-004, U.S. EPA, 1993).
3.3.2 Include the following provisions concerning BMP Plan review.
3.3.2.1 Be reviewed by permittee's drilling engineer and offshore installation manager (OIM) to ensure compliance with the BMP Plan purpose and objectives set forth in Section 2.0.
3.3.2.2 Include a statement that the review has been completed and that the BMP Plan fulfills the BMP Plan purpose and objectives set forth in Section 2.0. This statement shall have dated signatures from the permittee's drilling engineer and offshore installation manager and any other individuals responsible for development and implementation of the BMP Plan.
3.4 Address each component or system capable of generating or causing a release of
significant amounts of NAF and identify specific preventative or remedial measures to be implemented.

# 4.0 BMP Plan Documentation
4.1 The operator shall maintain a copy of the BMP Plan and related documentation (e.g., training certifications, summary of the monitoring results, records of NAF-equipment spills, repairs, and maintenance) at the facility and shall make the BMP Plan and related documentation available to EPA or the NPDES Permit controlling authority upon request.

# 5.0 BMP Plan Modification
5.1 For those NAF wastestreams controlled through BMPs, the operator shall amend the BMP Plan whenever there is a change in the facility or in the operation of the facility which materially increases the generation of those NAF-wastes or their release or potential release to the receiving waters.
5.2 At a minimum the BMP Plan shall be reviewed once every five years and amended within three months if warranted. Any such changes to the BMP Plan shall be consistent with the objectives and specific requirements listed in this addendum. All changes in the BMP Plan shall be reviewed by the permittee's drilling engineer and offshore installation manager.
5.3 At any time, if the BMP Plan proves to be ineffective in achieving the general objective of preventing and minimizing the generation of NAF-wastes and their release and potential release to the receiving waters and/or the specific requirements in this addendum, the permit and/or the BMP Plan shall be subject to modification to incorporate revised BMP requirements.

# 6.0 Specific Pollution Prevention Requirements for NAF Discharges Associated with Cuttings
6.1 The following specific pollution prevention activities are required in a BMP Plan when operators elect to control NAF discharges associated with cuttings by a set of BMPs.
6.2 Establishing programs for identifying, documenting, and repairing malfunctioning NAF equipment, tracking NAF equipment repairs, and training personnel to report and evaluate malfunctioning NAF equipment.
6.3 Establishing operating and maintenance procedures for each component in the solids control system in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's design criteria.
6.4 Using the most applicable spacers, flushes, pills, and displacement techniques in order to minimize contamination of drilling fluids when changing from water-based drilling fluids to NAF and vice versa.
6.5 A daily retort analysis shall be performed (in accordance with appendix 7 to subpart A of part 435) during the first 0.33 X feet drilled with NAF where X is the anticipated total feet to be drilled with NAF for that particular well. The retort analyses shall be documented in the well retort log. The operators shall use the calculation procedures detailed in appendix 7 to subpart A of part 435 (
see
Equations 1 through 8) to determine the arithmetic average (%BF
well
) of the retort analyses taken during the first 0.33 X feet drilled with NAF.

6.5.2 When the arithmetic average (%BF
well
) of the retort analyses taken during the first 0.33 X feet drilled with NAF is greater the base fluid retained on cuttings limitation or standard (
see
§§ 435.13 and 435.15), retort monitoring shall continue for the following (second) 0.33 X feet drilled with NAF where X is the anticipated total feet to be drilled with NAF for that particular well. The retort analyses for the first and second 0.33 X feet shall be documented in the well retort log.
6.5.2.1 When the arithmetic average (%BF
well
) of the retort analyses taken during the first 0.66 X feet (
i.e.
, retort analyses taken from first and second 0.33 X feet) drilled with NAF is less than or equal to the base fluid retained on cuttings limitation or standard (
see
§§ 435.13 and 435.15), retort monitoring of cuttings may cease for that particular well. The same BMPs and drilling fluid used during the first 0.66 X feet shall be used for all remaining NAF sections for that particular well.
6.5.2.2 When the arithmetic average (%BF
well
) of the retort analyses taken during the first 0.66 X feet (
i.e.
, retort analyses taken from first and second 0.33 X feet) drilled with NAF is greater than the base fluid retained on cuttings limitation or standard (
see
§§ 435.13 and 435.15), retort monitoring shall continue for all remaining NAF sections for that particular well. The retort analyses for all NAF sections shall be documented in the well retort log.
6.5.3 When the arithmetic average (%BF
well
) of the retort analyses taken over all NAF sections for the entire well is greater that the base fluid retained on cuttings limitation or standard (
see
§§ 435.13 and 435.15), the operator is in violation of the base fluid retained on cuttings limitation or standard and shall submit notification of these monitoring values in accordance with
NPDES permit requirements. Additionally, the operator shall, as part of the BMP Plan, initiate a reevaluation and modification to the BMP Plan in conjunction with equipment vendors and/or industry specialists.
6.5.4 The operator shall include retort monitoring data and dates of retort-monitored and non-retort-monitored NAF-cuttings discharges managed by BMPs in their NPDES permit reports.
6.6 Establishing mud pit and equipment cleaning methods in such a way as to minimize the potential for building-up drill cuttings (including accumulated solids) in the active mud system and solids control equipment system. These cleaning methods shall include but are not limited to the following procedures.
6.6.1 Ensuring proper operation and efficiency of mud pit agitation equipment.

means that waste streams may not be discharged that contain free oil as evidenced by the monitoring method specified for that particular stream, e.g., deck drainage or miscellaneous discharges cannot be discharged when they would cause a film or sheen upon or discoloration of the surface of the receiving water; drilling fluids or cuttings may not be discharged when they fail EPA Method 1617 (Static Sheen Test), which is published as an appendix to Subpart A of this part and in “Analytic Methods for the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category,” EPA-821-R-11-004. See paragraph (mm) of this section.
(z) Parameters that are regulated in this subpart and listed with approved methods of analysis in Table 1B at 40 CFR 136.3 are defined as follows:
(1)
Cadmium
means total cadmium.
(2)
Chlorine
means total residual chlorine.
(3)
Mercury
means total mercury.
(4)
Oil and Grease
means total recoverable oil and grease.
(aa)
Produced sand
means the slurried particles used in hydraulic fracturing, the accumulated formation sands and scales particles generated during production. Produced sand also includes desander discharge from the produced water waste stream, and blowdown of the water phase from the produced water treating system.
(bb)
Produced water
means the water (brine) brought up from the hydrocarbon-bearing strata during the extraction of oil and gas, and can include formation water, injection water, and any chemicals added downhole or during the oil/water separation process.
(cc)
Production facility
means any fixed or mobile structure subject to this subpart that is either engaged in well completion or used for active recovery of hydrocarbons from producing formations. It includes facilities that are engaged in hydrocarbon fluids separation even if located separately from wellheads.
(dd)
Sanitary waste
means the human body waste discharged from toilets and urinals located within facilities subject to this subpart.
(ee)
SPP toxicity
as applied to BAT effluent limitations and NSPS for drilling fluids and drill cuttings refers to the bioassay test procedure, “Suspended Particulate Phase (SPP) Toxicity Test,” presented in EPA Method 1619, which is published as an appendix to Subpart A of this part and in “Analytic Methods for the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category,” EPA-821-R-11-004. See paragraph (mm) of this section.
(ff)
Static sheen test
means the standard test procedure that has been developed for this industrial subcategory for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the requirement of no discharge of free oil. The methodology for performing the static sheen test is presented in EPA Method 1617, which is published as an appendix to Subpart A of this part and in “Analytic Methods for the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category,” EPA-821-R-11-004. See paragraph (mm) of this section.
(gg)
Stock barite
means the barite that was used to formulate a drilling fluid.
(hh)
Synthetic material
as applied to synthetic-based drilling fluid means material produced by the reaction of specific purified chemical feedstock, as opposed to the traditional base fluids such as diesel and mineral oil which are derived from crude oil solely through physical separation processes. Physical separation processes include fractionation and distillation and/or minor chemical reactions such as cracking and hydro processing. Since they are synthesized by the reaction of purified compounds, synthetic materials suitable for use in drilling fluids are typically free of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) but are sometimes found to contain levels of PAH up to 0.001 weight percent PAH expressed as phenanthrene. Internal olefins and vegetable esters are two examples of synthetic materials suitable for use by the oil and gas extraction industry in formulating drilling fluids. Internal olefins are synthesized from the isomerization of purified straight-chain (linear) hydrocarbons such as
C
16
-C
18
linear alpha olefins. C
16
-C
18
linear alpha olefins are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the carbon to carbon double bond in the terminal position. Internal olefins are typically formed from heating linear alpha olefins with a catalyst. The feed material for synthetic linear alpha olefins is typically purified ethylene. Vegetable esters are synthesized from the acid-catalyzed esterification of vegetable fatty acids with various alcohols. EPA listed these two branches of synthetic fluid base materials to provide examples, and EPA does not mean to exclude other synthetic materials that are either in current use or may be used in the future. A synthetic-based drilling fluid may include a combination of synthetic materials.
(ii)
Well completion fluids
means salt solutions, weighted brines, polymers, and various additives used to prevent damage to the well bore during operations which prepare the drilled well for hydrocarbon production.
(jj)
Well treatment fluids
means any fluid used to restore or improve productivity by chemically or physically altering hydrocarbon-bearing strata after a well has been drilled.
(kk)
Workover fluids
means salt solutions, weighted brines, polymers, or other specialty additives used in a producing well to allow for maintenance, repair or abandonment procedures.
(ll)
96-hour LC
5
. means the concentration (parts per million) or percent of the suspended particulate phase (SPP) from a sample that is lethal to 50 percent of the test organisms exposed to that concentration of the SPP after 96 hours of constant exposure.

# Appendix 1 to Subpart D of Part 435—Procedure for Determining When Coastal Cook Inlet Operators Qualify for an Exemption From the Zero Discharge Requirement for EMO-Cuttings and SBF-Cuttings in Coastal Cook Inlet, Alaska

# 1.0 Scope and Application
This appendix is to be used to determine whether a Cook Inlet, Alaska, operator in Coastal waters (Coastal Cook Inlet operator) qualifies for the exemption to the zero discharge requirement established by 40 CFR 435.43 and 435.45 for drill cuttings associated with the following non-aqueous drilling fluids: enhanced mineral oil based drilling fluids (EMO-cuttings) and synthetic-based drilling fluids (SBF-cuttings). Coastal Cook Inlet operators are prohibited from discharging oil-based drilling fluids. This appendix is intended to define those situations under which technical limitations preclude Coastal Cook Inlet operators from complying with the zero discharge requirement for EMO-cuttings and SBF-cuttings. Coastal Cook Inlet operators that qualify for this exemption may be authorized to discharge EMO-cuttings and SBF-cuttings subject to the limitations applicable to operators in Offshore waters (
see
subpart A of this part).

# 2.0 Method
2.1 Any Coastal Cook Inlet operator must achieve the zero discharge limit for EMO-cuttings and SBF-cuttings unless it successfully demonstrates that technical limitations prevent it from being able to dispose of its EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings through on-site annular disposal, injection into a Class II underground injection control (UIC) well, or onshore land application.
2.2 To successfully demonstrate that technical limitations prevent it from being able to dispose of its EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings through on-site annular disposal, a Coastal Cook Inlet operator must show that it has been unable to establish formation injection in nearby wells that were initially considered for annular or dedicated disposal of EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings or prove to the satisfaction of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (AOGCC) that the EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings will be confined to the formation disposal interval. This demonstration must include:
a. Documentation, including engineering analysis, that shows (1) an inability to establish formation injection (e.g., formation is too tight), (2) an inability to confine EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings in disposal formation (e.g., no confining zone or adequate barrier to confine wastes in formation), or (3) the occurrence of high risk emergency (e.g., mechanical failure of well, loss of ability to inject that risks loss of well which would cause significant economic harm or create a substantial risk to safety); and
b. A risk analysis of alternative disposal options, including environmental assessment, human health and safety, and economic impact, that shows discharge as the lowest risk option.
2.3 To successfully demonstrate that technical limitations prevent it from being able to dispose of its EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings through injection into a Class II UIC well, a Coastal Cook Inlet operator must show that it has been unable to establish injection into a Class II UIC well or prove to the satisfaction of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (AOGCC) that the EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings will be confined to the formation disposal interval. This demonstration must include:
a. Documentation, including engineering analysis, that shows the inability to confine EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings in a Class II UIC well (e.g., no confining zone or adequate barrier to confine wastes in formation);
b. Documentation demonstrating that no Class II UIC well is accessible (e.g., operator does not own, competitor will not allow injection); and
c. A risk analysis of alternative disposal option, including environmental assessment, human health and safety, and economic impact, that shows discharge as the lowest risk option.
2.4 To successfully demonstrate that technical limitations prevent it from being able to dispose of its EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings through land application, a Coastal Cook Inlet operator must show that it has been unable to handle drilling waste or dispose of EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings at an appropriate land disposal site. This demonstration must include:
a. Documentation of site restrictions that preclude land application (e.g., no land disposal sites available);
b. Documentation of the platform's lack of capacity for adequate storage of EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings (e.g., limited storage or room for cuttings transfer); or
c. Documentation of inability to transfer EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings from platform to land for disposal (e.g., extremely low tides, high wave action).

# 3.0 Procedure
3.1 Except as described in Section 3.2 of this appendix, a Coastal Cook Inlet operator believing that it qualifies for the exemption to the zero discharge requirement for EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings must apply for and obtain an individual NPDES permit prior to discharging EMO-cuttings or SBF-cuttings to waters of the United States.
3.2 Discharges occurring as the result a high risk emergency (e.g., mechanical failure
of well, loss of ability to inject that risks loss of well which would cause significant economic harm or safety) may be authorized by a general NPDES permit provided that:
a. The Coastal Cook Inlet operator satisfactorily demonstrates to EPA Region 10 the fulfillment of the other exemption requirements described in Section 2.0 of this appendix, or
b. The general permit allows for high risk emergency discharges and provides Reporting Requirements to EPA Region 10 immediately upon commencing discharge.

§ 437.1
General applicability.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section, this part applies to that portion of wastewater discharges from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility that results from any of the following activities:
(1) Treatment and recovery of hazardous or non-hazardous industrial metal-bearing wastes, oily wastes and organic-bearing wastes received from off-site; and
(2) The treatment of CWT wastewater.
(b) This part does not apply to the following discharges of wastewater from a CWT facility:
(1) Wastewater from the treatment of wastes that are generated on-site when the wastes generated on-site are otherwise subject to another part of subchapter N.
(2) Wastewater from the treatment of wastes that are generated off-site if the discharger: a) demonstrates that the off-site wastes are generated at a facility that is subject to the same provisions in 40 CFR subchapter N as non-CWT wastes generated at the CWT facility or b) demonstrates that the off-site wastes are of similar nature and the treatment of such wastes are compatible with the treatment of non-CWT wastes generated and treated at the CWT.
(3) Wastewater from the treatment of wastes received from off-site via conduit (e.g., pipelines, channels, ditches, trenches, etc.) from the facility that generates the wastes unless the resulting wastewaters are commingled with other wastewaters subject to this provision. A facility that acts as a waste collection or consolidation center is not a facility that generates wastes.
(4) Wastewater from product stewardship activities, the treatment of sanitary wastes and wastes of domestic origin including chemical toilet wastes, septage, and restaurant wastes or thermal drying of POTW biosolids. Product stewardship activities for purposes of this provision are limited to the following activities at a manufacturing facility: acceptance for treatment or recovery of its unused products, shipping and storage containers with product residues and off-spec products.
(5) Wastewater from solids recovery operations so long as the wastes recovered are from non-industrial sources, and recovery of the wastes does not generate a wastewater or leach appreciable metal or organic chemicals or petroleum-based oil and grease into the water. Examples of solids recovery operations to which this subpart would not apply include, but are not limited to, the recycling of aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles.
(6) Wastewater from scrap metal processing or auto salvage operations.
(7) Wastewater from transfer stations or municipal recycling centers.
(8) Wastewater from the treatment of, or recovery of material from, animal or vegetable fats/oils from grease traps or interceptors generated by facilities engaged in food service activities.
(9) Wastewater from the treatment of, or recovery of material from, off-site wastes generated by facilities engaged only in food processing.
(10) Wastewater from facilities that are subject to 40 CFR part 442. Wastewater resulting from the treatment of off-site wastewater generated in cleaning transportation equipment (or on-site wastewater generated in cleaning equipment) along with other off-site wastes (subject to this part) not generated in cleaning transportation equipment is, however, subject to this part.
(11) Wastewater resulting from solvent recovery operations if the solvent recovery operations involve the separation of solvent mixtures by distillation.
(12) Wastewater from facilities that are engaged exclusively in centralized silver recovery from used photographic or x-ray materials activities. The discharge resulting from centralized silver recovery from used photographic or x-ray materials that is treated at a CWT facility along with other off-site wastestreams (subject to this part) is subject to this part.
(13) Wastewater from facilities that accept off-site wastes only for treatability studies, research and development, or chemical or physical analysis. The wastewater resulting from treatability studies, research and development, or chemical or physical analysis that is treated at a CWT facility along with other off-site wastestreams (subject to this part) is subject to this part.
(c) This part also does not apply to the following activities:
(1) “Dry” fuel blending operations, “dry” waste solidification/stabilization operations, “dry” used oil filter or oily absorbents recycling operations, or “dry” high temperature metals recovery operations. However, this part does apply to wastewater discharges from a CWT resulting from any of these operations that do produce wastewater.
(2) The discharge of marine generated wastes including wash water from equipment and tank cleaning, ballast water, bilge water, and other wastes generated (while operating on inland, coastal, or open waters or while berthed) as part of routine ship maintenance and operation as long as they are treated and discharged at the ship servicing facility where it is off-loaded. The discharges resulting from the treatment of marine generated wastes that are off-loaded and subsequently sent to a centralized waste treatment facility at a separate location are, however, subject to this part.
(3) Discharge of wastewater from land treatment units or land application operations.
(4) Discharge of wastewater from facilities that are engaged exclusively in landfilling activities and/or the treatment of landfill wastewaters (whether generated on or off-site). The discharge resulting from the treatment of landfill wastewater, whether generated on-site or off-site, treated at CWT facilities along with other off-site waste is, however, subject to this part.
(5) Discharge of wastewater from facilities that are engaged exclusively in incineration activities. The discharge resulting from the treatment of off-site wastewater generated in the incineration of industrial waste that is treated at a CWT facility along with other off-site wastestreams (subject to this part) is subject to this part.
(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the provisions of this part are not applicable to any metals treatment and recovery wastewater discharges which are subject to the secondary metals provisions of 40 CFR part 421, the Nonferrous Metals Manufacturing Point Source Category. These secondary metals subcategories are subpart C (Secondary Aluminum Smelting Subcategory), subpart F (Secondary Copper Subcategory), subpart L (Secondary Silver Subcategory), subpart M (Secondary Lead Subcategory), subpart P (Primary and Secondary Germanium and Gallium Subcategory), subpart Q (Secondary Indium Subcategory), subpart R (Secondary Mercury Subcategory), subpart
T (Secondary Molybdenum and Vanadium Subcategory), subpart V (Secondary Nickel Subcategory), subpart X (Secondary Precious Metals Subcategory), subpart Z (Secondary Tantalum Subcategory), subpart AA (Secondary Tin Subcategory), subpart AB (Primary and Secondary Titanium Subcategory), subpart AC (Secondary Tungsten and Cobalt Subcategory), and subpart AD (secondary Uranium Subcategory).
§ 437.2
General definitions.
As used in this part:
(a) The general definitions and abbreviations in 40 CFR part 401 apply to this part.
(b)
Alternative effluent limitations or pretreatment standards
mean effluent limitations determined on a case-by-case basis under section 402(a)(1) of the CWA or pretreatment standards developed as local limits by the control authority under 40 CFR § 403.6(c) that apply to the discharge of wastewater subject to this provision. The permit writer (or control authority) will calculate these limitations or standards using a “building block” approach or the “combined wastestream formula.” Under this approach, the permit writer (or control authority) will develop flow-weighted effluent limitations or standards for the treated combined wastestream by applying the limitations or standards in 40 CFR subchapter N that would otherwise apply to a particular wastestream received from off-site if the wastestream were treated and discharged from the facility at which it was generated.
(c)
Centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility
means any facility that treats (for disposal, recycling or recovery of material) any hazardous or non-hazardous industrial wastes, hazardous or non-hazardous industrial wastewater, and/or used material received from off-site. “CWT facility” includes both a facility that treats waste received exclusively from off-site and a facility that treats wastes generated on-site as well as waste received from off-site. For example, an organic chemical manufacturing plant may, in certain circumstances, be a CWT facility if it treats industrial wastes received from offsite as well as industrial waste generated at the organic chemical manufacturing plant. CWT facilities may also include re-refiners and may be owned by the federal government.
(d)
Centralized waste treatment wastewater
means any wastewater generated as a result of CWT activities. CWT wastewater sources may include, but are not limited to: liquid waste receipts, solubilization water, used oil emulsion-breaking wastewater, tanker truck/drum/roll-off box washes, equipment washes, air pollution control scrubber blow-down, laboratory-derived wastewater, on-site landfill wastewaters, and contaminated storm water.
(e)
Contaminated storm water
means storm water which comes in direct contact with CWT wastes, the waste handling and treatment areas, or other centralized waste treatment wastewater as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
(f)
Discharger
means a facility that discharges wastewater directly to waters of the United States or introduces wastewater to a publicly-owned treatment works.
(g)
Dry

(i)
Fuel blending
means the process of combining waste, wastewater, or used material for the purpose of regenerating a fuel for reuse. However, fuel blending may be loosely applied to any process where recovered hydrocarbons are combined as a fuel product where some pretreatment operations generate wastewater.
(j)
High temperature metals recovery
means a metals recovery process in which solid forms of metal-containing materials are processed with a heat-based pyrometallurgical technology to produce a metal product.
(k)
Marine generated waste
means any waste, wastewater, and/or used material generated as part of the normal
maintenance and operation of a ship, boat, or barge operating on inland, coastal, or open waters, or while berthed.
(l)
Metal-bearing wastes
means wastes and/or used materials from manufacturing or processing facilities or other commercial operations that contain significant quantities of metal pollutants, but not significant quantities of oil and grease (generally less than 100 mg/L). Examples of these wastes are spent electroplating baths and sludges, metal-finishing rinse water and sludges, chromate wastes, blow-down water and sludges from air pollution control, spent anodizing solutions, incineration air pollution control wastewaters, waste liquid mercury, cyanide containing wastes greater than 136 mg/L, and waste acids and bases with or without metals.
(m)
Multiple wastestream CWT facility
means a CWT facility which accepts waste in more than one CWT subcategory (metals, oils, or organics) and combines any portion of these different subcategory wastes at any point prior to the compliance discharge sampling location.
(n)

(o)
Oily absorbent recycling
means the process of recycling oil-soaked or contaminated disposable rags, paper, or pads for the purpose of regenerating a fuel for reuse.
(p)
Oily wastes
means wastes and/or used materials that contain oil and grease (generally at or in excess of 100 mg/L) from manufacturing or processing facilities or other commercial operations. Examples of these wastes are used oils, oil-water emulsions or mixtures, lubricants, coolants, contaminated groundwater clean-up from petroleum sources, used petroleum products, oil spill clean-up, bilge water, rinse/wash waters from petroleum sources, interceptor wastes, off-specification fuels, underground storage tank remediation waste, and tank clean out from petroleum or oily sources.
(q)
On-site
means within the boundaries of a facility. A facility may encompass land areas that are bisected by public thoroughfares but are under the control of a common owner.

Monitoring requirements.
(a) Permit compliance monitoring is required for each regulated parameter.
(b) Any CWT facility that discharges wastewater resulting from the treatment of metal-bearing waste, oily waste, or organic-bearing waste must monitor as follows:
(1) Facilities subject to more than one subpart of this part must monitor for compliance for each subpart after treatment and before mixing of the
waste with wastes of any other subpart. Alternatively, a multiple wastestream subcategory facility may certify that it provides equivalent treatment as defined in § 437.2(h) for the applicable waste and monitor for compliance with the applicable set of multiple wastestream subcategory limitations after mixing.
(2) Facilities subject to one or more subpart of this part must monitor for compliance with the applicable subpart after treatment and before mixing of the waste with wastes of any other subpart, uncontaminated storm water, or wastewater subject to another effluent limitation or standard in subchapter N. If, however, the facility can demonstrate to the receiving POTW or permitting authority the capability of achieving the effluent limitation or standard for each subpart after treatment and before mixing with other wastestreams, the facility may monitor for compliance after mixing. In the case of a facility which elects to comply with the applicable set of multiple wastestream subcategory limitations or standards, it is only subject to one subpart.
(3) When a CWT facility treats any waste receipt that contains cyanide at a concentration higher than 136 mg/L, the CWT facility must monitor for cyanide after cyanide treatment and before dilution with other wastestreams. If, however, the facility can demonstrate to the receiving POTW or permitting authority the capability of achieving the cyanide limitation or standard after cyanide treatment and before mixing with other wastestreams, the facility may monitor for compliance after mixing.

# Appendix B to Part 438—Oily Operations Definitions

# Note:
The definitions in this appendix shall not be used to differentiate between the six “core” metal finishing operations (
i.e.,
Electroplating, Electroless Plating, Anodizing, Coating (chromating, phosphating, and coloring), Chemical Etching and Milling, and Printed Circuit Board Manufacture) and forty “ancillary” process operations listed at 40 CFR 433.10(a).
Abrasive Blasting
involves removing surface film from a part by using abrasive directed at high velocity against the part. Abrasive blasting includes bead, grit, shot, and sand blasting, and may be performed either dry or with water. The primary applications of wet abrasive blasting include: Removing burrs on precision parts; producing satin or matte finishes; removing fine tool marks; and removing light mill scale, surface oxide, or welding scale. Wet blasting can be used to finish fragile items such as electronic components. Also, some aluminum parts are wet blasted to achieve a fine-grained matte finish for decorative purposes. In abrasive blasting, the water and abrasive typically are reused until the particle size diminishes due to impacting and fracture.
Adhesive Bonding
involves joining parts using an adhesive material. Typically, an organic bonding compound is used as the adhesive. This operation usually is dry; however, aqueous solutions may be used as bonding agents or to contain residual organic bonding materials.
Alkaline Cleaning for Oil Removal
is a general term for the application of an alkaline cleaning agent to a metal part to remove oil and grease during the manufacture, maintenance, or rebuilding of a metal product. This unit operation does not include washing of the finished products after routine use (as defined in “Washing (Finished Products)” in this appendix), or applying an alkaline cleaning agent to remove nonoily contaminants such as dirt and scale (as defined in “Alkaline Treatment Without Cyanide” in this appendix and “Alkaline Treatment With Cyanide” in appendix C of this part). Wastewater generated includes spent cleaning solutions and rinse waters.
(1) Alkaline cleaning is performed to remove foreign contaminants from parts. This operation usually is done prior to finishing (e.g., electroplating).
(2) Emulsion cleaning is an alkaline cleaning operation that uses either complex chemical enzymes or common organic solvents (e.g., kerosene, mineral oil, glycols, and benzene) dispersed in water with the aid of an emulsifying agent. The pH of the solvent usually is between 7 and 9, and, depending on the solvent used, cleaning is performed at temperatures from room temperature to 82 °C (180 °F). This operation often is used as a replacement for vapor degreasing.
Alkaline Treatment Without Cyanide
is a general term used to describe the application of an alkaline solution not containing cyanide to a metal surface to clean the metal surface or prepare the metal surface for further surface finishing.
Aqueous Degreasing
involves cleaning metal parts using aqueous-based cleaning chemicals primarily to remove residual oils and greases from the part. Residual oils can be from previous operations (e.g., machine coolants), oil from product use in a dirty environment, or oil coatings used to inhibit corrosion. Wastewater generated by this operation includes spent cleaning solutions and rinse waters.
Assembly/Disassembly
involves fitting together previously manufactured or rebuilt parts or components into a complete metal product or machine or taking a complete metal product or machine apart. Assembly/disassembly operations are typically dry; however, special circumstances can require water for cooling or buoyancy. Also, rinsing may be necessary under some conditions.
Burnishing
involves finish sizing or smooth finishing a part (previously machined or ground) by displacing, rather than removing, minute surface irregularities with smooth point or line-contact, fixed or rotating tools. Lubricants or soap solutions can be used to cool the tools used in burnishing operations. Wastewater generated during burnishing include process solutions and rinse water.
Calibration
is performed to provide reference points for the use of a product. This unit operation typically is dry, although water may be used in some cases (e.g., pumping water for calibration of a pump). Water used in this unit operation usually does not contain additives.
Corrosion Preventive Coating
involves applying removable oily or organic solutions to protect metal surfaces against corrosive environments. Corrosion preventive coatings include, but are not limited to: Petrolatum compounds, oils, hard dry-film compounds, solvent-cutback petroleum-based compounds, emulsions, water-displacing polar compounds, and fingerprint removers and neutralizers. Corrosion preventive coating does not include electroplating, or chemical conversion coating operations. Many corrosion preventive materials also are formulated to function as lubricants or as a base for paint. Typical applications include: Assembled machinery or equipment in standby storage; finished parts in stock or spare parts for replacement; tools such as drills, taps, dies, and gauges; and mill products such as sheet, strip, rod and bar. Wastewater generated during corrosion preventive coating includes spent process solutions and rinses. Process solutions are discharged when they become contaminated with impurities or are depleted of constituents. Corrosion preventive coatings typically do not require an associated rinse, but parts are sometimes rinsed to remove the coating before further processing.
Electrical Discharge Machining
involves removing metals by a rapid spark discharge between different polarity electrodes, one the part and the other the tool, separated by a small gap. The gap may be filled with air or a dielectric fluid. This operation is used primarily to cut tool alloys, hard nonferrous alloys, and other hard-to-machine materials. Most electrical discharge machining processes are operated dry; however, in some cases, the process uses water and generates wastewater containing dielectric fluid.
Floor Cleaning (in Process Area)
removes dirt, debris, and process solution spills from process area floors. Floors can be cleaned using wet or dry methods, such as vacuuming, mopping, dry sweeping, and hose rinsing. Non-process area floor cleaning in offices and other similar non-process areas is not included in this unit operation.
Grinding
involves removing stock from a part by using abrasive grains held by a rigid or semirigid binder. Grinding shapes or deburrs the part. The grinding tool usually is a disk (the basic shape of grinding wheels), but can also be a cylinder, ring, cup, stick, strip, or belt. The most commonly used abrasives are aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, and diamond. The process may use a grinding fluid to cool the part and remove debris or metal fines. Wastewater generated during grinding includes spent coolants and rinses. Metal-working fluids become spent for a
number of reasons, including increased biological activity (
i.e.,
the fluids become rancid) or decomposition of the coolant additives. Rinse waters typically are assimilated into the working fluid or treated on site.
Heat Treating
involves modifying the physical properties of a part by applying controlled heating and cooling cycles. This operation includes tempering, carburizing, cyaniding, nitriding, annealing, aging, normalizing, austenitizing, austempering, siliconizing, martempering, and malleablizing. Parts are heated in furnaces or molten salt baths, and then may be cooled by quenching in aqueous solutions (e.g., brine solutions), neat oils (pure oils with little or no impurities), or oil/water emulsions. Heat treating typically is a dry operation, but is considered a wet operation if aqueous quenching solutions are used. Wastewater includes spent quench water and rinse water.
Impact Deformation
involves applying impact force to a part to permanently deform or shape it. Impact deformation may include mechanical processes such as hammer forging, shot peening, peening, coining, high-energy-rate forming, heading, or stamping. Natural and synthetic oils, light greases, and pigmented lubricants are used in impact deformation operations. Pigmented lubricants include whiting, lithapone, mica, zinc oxide, molybdenum disulfide, bentonite, flour, graphite, white lead, and soap-like materials. These operations typically are dry, but wastewater can be generated from lubricant discharge and from rinsing operations associated with the operation.
Iron Phosphate Conversion Coating
is the process of applying a protective coating on the surface of a metal using a bath consisting of a phosphoric acid solution containing no metals (e.g., manganese, nickel, or zinc) or a phosphate salt solution (
i.e.,
sodium or potassium salts of phosphoric acid solutions) containing no metals (e.g., manganese, nickel, or zinc) other than sodium or potassium. Any metal concentrations in the bath are from the substrate.
Machining
involves removing stock from a part (as chips) by forcing a cutting tool against the part. This includes machining processes such as turning, milling, drilling, boring, tapping, planing, broaching, sawing, shaving, shearing, threading, reaming, shaping, slotting, hobbing, and chamfering. Machining processes use various types of metal-working fluids, the choice of which depends on the type of machining being performed and the preference of the machine shop. The fluids can be categorized into four groups: Straight oil (neat oils), synthetic, semisynthetic, and water-soluble oil. Machining operations generate wastewater from working fluid or rinse water discharge. Metal-working fluids periodically are discarded because of reduced performance or development of a rancid odor. After machining, parts are sometimes rinsed to remove coolant and metal chips. The coolant reservoir is sometimes rinsed, and the rinse water is added to the working fluid.
Painting-Spray or Brush (Including Water Curtains)
involves applying an organic coating to a part. Coatings such as paint, varnish, lacquer, shellac, and plastics are applied by spraying, brushing, roll coating, lithographing, powder coating, and wiping. Water is used in painting operations as a solvent (water-borne formulations) for rinsing, for cleanup, and for water-wash (or curtain) type spray booths. Paint spray booths typically use most of the water in this unit operation. Spray booths capture overspray (
i.e.,
paint that misses the product during application), and control the introduction of pollutants into the workplace and environment.
Polishing
involves removing stock from a part using loose or loosely held abrasive grains carried to the part by a flexible support. Usually, the objective is to achieve a desired surface finish or appearance rather then to remove a specified amount of stock. Buffing is included in this unit operation, and usually is performed using a revolving cloth or sisal buffing wheel, which is coated with a suitable compound. Liquid buffing compounds are used extensively for large-volume production on semiautomated or automated buffing equipment. Polishing operations typically are dry, although liquid compounds and associated rinses are used in some polishing processes.
Pressure Deformation
involves applying force (other than impact force) to permanently deform or shape a part. Pressure deformation may include rolling, drawing, bending, embossing, sizing, extruding, squeezing, spinning, necking, forming, crimping or flaring. These operations use natural and synthetic oils, light greases, and pigmented lubricants. Pigmented lubricants include whiting, lithapone, mica, zinc oxide, molybdenum disulfide, bentonite, flour, graphite, white lead, and soap-like materials. Pressure deformation typically is dry, but wastewater is sometimes generated from the discharge of lubricants or from rinsing associated with the process.
Solvent Degreasing
removes oils and grease from the surface of a part using organic solvents, including aliphatic petroleum (e.g., kerosene, naphtha), aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene), oxygenated hydrocarbons (e.g., ketones, alcohol, ether), and halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, methylene chloride). Solvent cleaning takes place in either the liquid or vapor phase. Solvent vapor degreasing normally is quicker than solvent liquid degreasing. However, ultrasonic vibration is sometimes used with liquid solvents to decrease the required immersion time of complex shapes. Solvent cleaning often is used as a precleaning operation prior to alkaline
cleaning, as a final cleaning of precision parts, or as surface preparation for some painting operations. Solvent degreasing operations typically are not followed by rinsing, although rinsing is performed in some cases.
Steam Cleaning
removes residual dirt, oil, and grease from parts after processing though other unit operations. Typically, additives are not used in this operation; the hot steam removes the pollutants. Wastewater is generated when the cleaned parts are rinsed.
Testing (e.g., hydrostatic, dye penetrant, ultrasonic, magnetic flux)
involves applying thermal, electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, or other energy to determine the suitability or functionality of a part, assembly, or complete unit. Testing also may include applying surface penetrant dyes to detect surface imperfections. Other examples of tests frequently performed include electrical testing, performance testing, and ultrasonic testing; these tests typically are dry but may generate wastewater under certain circumstances. Testing usually is performed to replicate some aspect of the working environment. Wastewater generated during testing includes spent process solutions and rinses.
Thermal Cutting
involves cutting, slotting, or piercing a part using an oxy-acetylene oxygen lance, electric arc cutting tool, or laser. Thermal cutting typically is a dry process, except for the use of contact cooling waters and rinses.
Tumbling/Barrel Finishing/Mass Finishing/Vibratory Finishing
involves polishing or deburring a part using a rotating or vibrating container and abrasive media or other polishing materials to achieve a desired surface appearance. Parts to be finished are placed in a rotating barrel or vibrating unit with an abrasive media (e.g., ceramic chips, pebbles), water, and chemical additives (e.g., alkaline detergents). As the barrel rotates, the upper layer of the part slides toward the lower side of the barrel, causing the abrading or polishing. Similar results can be achieved in a vibrating unit, where the entire contents of the container are in constant motion, or in a centrifugal unit, which compacts the load of media and parts as the unit spins and generates up to 50 times the force of gravity. Spindle finishing is a similar process, where parts to be finished are mounted on fixtures and exposed to a rapidly moving abrasive slurry. Wastewater generated during barrel finishing includes spent process solutions and rinses. Following the finishing process, the contents of the barrel are unloaded. Process wastewater is either discharged continuously during the process, discharged after finishing, or collected and reused. The parts are sometimes given a final rinse to remove particles of abrasive media.
Washing (Finished Products)
involves cleaning finished metal products after use or storage using fresh water or water containing a mild cleaning solution. This unit operation applies only to the finished products that do not require maintenance or rebuilding.
Welding
involves joining two or more pieces of material by applying heat, pressure, or both, with or without filler material, to produce a metallurgical bond through fusion or recrystallization across the interface. This includes gas welding, resistance welding, arc welding, cold welding, electron beam welding, and laser beam welding. Welding typically is a dry process, except for the occasional use of contact cooling waters or rinses.
Wet Air Pollution Control for Organic Constituents
involves using water to remove organic constituents that are entrained in air streams exhausted from process tanks or production areas. Most frequently, wet air pollution control devices are used with cleaning and coating processes. A common type of wet air pollution control is the wet packed scrubber consisting of a spray chamber that is filled with packing material. Water is continuously sprayed onto the packing and the air stream is pulled through the packing by a fan. Pollutants in the air stream are absorbed by the water droplets and the air is released to the atmosphere. A single scrubber often serves numerous process tanks.
Pt. 438, App. C

# Appendix C to Part 438—Metal-Bearing Operations Definitions

# Note:
The definitions in this appendix shall not be used to differentiate between the six “core” metal finishing operations (
i.e.,
Electroplating, Electroless Plating, Anodizing, Coating (chromating, phosphating, and coloring), Chemical Etching and Milling, and Printed Circuit Board Manufacture) and forty “ancillary” process operations listed at 40 CFR 433.10(a).
Abrasive Jet Machining
includes removing stock material from a part by a high-speed stream of abrasive particles carried by a liquid or gas from a nozzle. Abrasive jet machining is used for deburring, drilling, and cutting thin sections of metal or composite material. Unlike abrasive blasting, this process operates at pressures of thousands of pounds per square inch. The liquid streams typically are alkaline or emulsified oil solutions, although water also can be used.
Acid Pickling Neutralization
involves using a dilute alkaline solution to raise the pH of acid pickling rinse water that remains on the part after pickling. The wastewater from this operation is the acid pickling neutralization rinse water.
Acid Treatment With Chromium
is a general term used to describe any application of an acid solution containing chromium to a
metal surface. Acid cleaning, chemical etching, and pickling are types of acid treatment. Chromic acid is used occasionally to clean cast iron, stainless steel, cadmium and aluminum, and bright dipping of copper and copper alloys. Also, chromic acid solutions can be used for the final step in acid cleaning phosphate conversion coating systems. Chemical conversion coatings formulated with chromic acid are defined at “Chromate Conversion Coating (or Chromating)” in this appendix. Wastewater generated during acid treatment includes spent solutions and rinse waters. Spent solutions typically are batch discharged and treated or disposed of off site. Most acid treatment operations are followed by a water rinse to remove residual acid.
Acid Treatment Without Chromium
is a general term used to describe any application of an acid solution not containing chromium to a metal surface. Acid cleaning, chemical etching, and pickling are types of acid treatment. Wastewater generated during acid treatment includes spent solutions and rinse waters. Spent solutions typically are batch discharged and treated or disposed of off site. Most acid treatment operations are followed by a water rinse to remove residual acid.
Alcohol Cleaning
involves removing dirt and residue material from a part using alcohol.
Alkaline Cleaning Neutralization
involves using a dilute acid solution to lower the pH of alkaline cleaning rinse water that remains on the part after alkaline cleaning. Wastewater from this operation is the alkaline cleaning neutralization rinse water.
Alkaline Treatment With Cyanide
is the cleaning of a metal surface with an alkaline solution containing cyanide. Wastewater generated during alkaline treatment includes spent solutions and rinse waters. Alkaline treatment solutions become contaminated from the introduction of soils and dissolution of the base metal. They usually are treated and disposed of on a batch basis. Alkaline treatment typically is followed by a water rinse that is discharged to a treatment system.
Anodizing With Chromium
involves producing a protective oxide film on aluminum, magnesium, or other light metal, usually by passing an electric current through an electrolyte bath in which the metal is immersed. Anodizing may be followed by a sealant operation. Chromic acid anodic coatings have a relatively thick boundary layer and are more protective than are sulfuric acid coatings. For these reasons, chromic acid is sometimes used when the part cannot be rinsed completely. These oxide coatings provide corrosion protection, decorative surfaces, a base for painting and other coating processes, and special electrical and mechanical properties. Wastewaters generated during anodizing include spent anodizing solutions, sealants, and rinse waters. Because of the anodic nature of the process, anodizing solutions become contaminated with the base metal being processed. These solutions eventually reach an intolerable concentration of dissolved metal and require treatment or disposal. Rinse water following anodizing, coloring, and sealing typically is discharged to a treatment system.
Anodizing Without Chromium
involves applying a protective oxide film to aluminum, magnesium, or other light metal, usually by passing an electric current through an electrolyte bath in which the metal is immersed. Phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and boric acid are used in anodizing. Anodizing also may include sealant baths. These oxide coatings provide corrosion protection, decorative surfaces, a base for painting and other coating processes, and special electrical and mechanical properties. Wastewater generated during anodizing includes spent anodizing solutions, sealants, and rinse waters. Because of the anodic nature of the process, anodizing solutions become contaminated with the base metal being processed. These solutions eventually reach an intolerable concentration of dissolved metal and require treatment or disposal. Rinse water following anodizing, coloring, and sealing steps typically is discharged to a treatment systems.
Carbon Black Deposition
involves coating the inside of printed circuit board holes by dipping the circuit board into a tank that contains carbon black and potassium hydroxide. After excess solution dips from the circuit boards, they are heated to allow the carbon black to adhere to the board.
Catalyst Acid Pre-Dip
uses rinse water to remove residual solution from a part after the part is processed in an acid bath. The wastewater generated in this unit operation is the rinse water.
Chemical Conversion Coating without Chromium
is the process of applying a protective coating on the surface of a metal without using chromium. Such coatings are applied through phosphate conversion (except for “Iron Phosphate Conversion Coating,” see appendix B of this part), metal coloring, or passivation. Coatings are applied to a base metal or previously deposited metal to increase corrosion protection and lubricity, prepare the surface for additional coatings, or formulate a special surface appearance. This unit process includes sealant operations that use additives other than chromium.
(1) In phosphate conversion, coatings are applied for one or more of the following reasons: to provide a base for paints and other organic coatings; to condition surfaces for cold forming operations by providing a base for drawing compounds and lubricants; to impart corrosion resistance to the metal surface; or to provide a suitable base for corrosion-resistant oils or waxes. Phosphate conversion coatings are formed by immersing a
metal part in a dilute solution of phosphoric acid, phosphate salts, and other reagents.
(2) Metal coloring by chemical conversion coating produces a large group of decorative finishes. Metal coloring includes the formation of oxide conversion coatings. In this operation, the metal surface is converted into an oxide or similar metallic compound, giving the part the desired color. The most common colored finishes are used on copper, steel, zinc, and cadmium.
(3) Passivation forms a protective coating on metals, particularly stainless steel, by immersing the part in an acid solution. Stainless steel is passivated to dissolve embedded iron particles and to form a thin oxide film on the surface of the metal. Wastewater generated during chemical conversion coating includes spent solutions and rinses (
i.e.,
both the chemical conversion coating solutions and post-treatment sealant solutions). These solutions commonly are discharged to a treatment system when contaminated with the base metal or other impurities. Rinsing normally follows each process step, except when a sealant dries on the part surface.
Chemical Milling (or Chemical Machining)
involves removing metal from a part by controlled chemical attack, or etching, to produce desired shapes and dimensions. In chemical machining, a masking agent typically is applied to cover a portion of the part's surface; the exposed (unmasked) surface is then treated with the chemical machining solution. Wastewater generated during chemical machining includes spent solutions and rinses. Process solutions typically are discharged after becoming contaminated with the base metal. Rinsing normally follows chemical machining.
Chromate Conversion Coating (or Chromating)
involves forming a conversion coating (protective coating) on a metal by immersing or spraying the metal with a hexavalent chromium compound solution to produce a hexavalent or trivalent chromium compound coating. This also is known as chromate treatment, and is most often applied to aluminum, zinc, cadmium or magnesium surfaces. Sealant operations using chromium also are included in this unit operation. Chromate solutions include two types: (1) those that deposit substantial chromate films on the substrate metal and are complete treatments themselves, and (2) those that seal or supplement oxide, phosphate, or other types of protective coatings. Wastewater generated during chromate conversion coating includes spent process solutions (
i.e.,
both the chromate conversion coating solutions and post-treatment sealant solutions) and rinses. These solutions typically are discharged to a treatment system when contaminated with the base metal or other impurities. Also, chromium-based solutions, which are typically formulated with hexavalent chromium, lose operating strength when the hexavalent chromium reduces to trivalent chromium during use. Rinsing normally follows each process step, except for sealants that dry on the surface of the part.
Chromium Drag-out Destruction
is a unit operation performed following chromium-bearing operations to reduce hexavalent chromium that is “dragged out” of the process bath. Parts are dipped in a solution of a chromium-reducing chemical (e.g., sodium metabisulfite) to prevent the hexavalent chromium from contaminating subsequent process baths. This operation typically is performed in a stagnant drag-out rinse tank that contains concentrated chromium-bearing wastewater.
Cyanide Drag-out Destruction
involves dipping part in a cyanide oxidation solution (e.g., sodium hypochloride) to prevent cyanide that is “dragged out” of a process bath from contaminating subsequent process baths. This operation typically is performed in a stagnant drag-out rinse tank.
Cyaniding Rinse
is generated during cyaniding hardening of a part. The part is heated in a molten salt solution containing cyanide. Wastewater is generated when excess cyanide salt solution is removed from the part in rinse water.
Electrochemical Machining
is a process in which the part becomes the anode and a shaped cathode is the cutting tool. By pumping electrolyte between the electrodes and applying a current, metal is rapidly but selectively dissolved from the part. Wastewater generated during electrochemical machining includes spent electrolytes and rinses.
Electroless Catalyst Solution
involves adding a catalyst just prior to an electroless plating operation to accelerate the plating operation.
Electroless Plating
involves applying a metallic coating to a part using a chemical reduction process in the presence of a catalysis. An electric current is not used in this operations. The metal to be plated onto a part typically is held in solution at high concentrations using a chelating agent. This plates all areas of the part to a uniform thickness regardless of the configuration of the part. Also, an electroless-plated surface is dense and virtually nonporous. Copper and nickel electroless plating operations are the most common. Sealant operations (
i.e.,
other than hot water dips) following electroless plating are considered separate unit operations if they include any additives. Wastewater generated during electroless plating includes spent process solutions and rinses. The wastewater contains chelated metals, which require separate preliminary treatment to break the metal chelates prior to conventional chemical precipitation. Rinsing follows most electroless plating processes to
remove residual plating solution and prevent contamination of subsequent process baths.
Electrolytic Cleaning
involves removing soil, scale, or surface oxides from a part by electrolysis. The part is one of the electrodes and the electrolyte is usually alkaline. Electrolytic alkaline cleaning and electrolytic acid cleaning are the two types of electrolytic cleaning.
(1) Electrolytic alkaline cleaning produces a cleaner surface than do nonelectrolytic methods of alkaline cleaning. This operation uses strong agitation, gas evolution in the solution, and oxidation-reduction reactions that occur during electrolysis. In addition, dirt particles become electrically charged and are repelled from the part surface.
(2) Electrolytic acid cleaning sometimes is used as a final cleaning before electroplating. Sulfuric acid is most frequently used as the electrolyte. As with electrolytic alkaline cleaning, the mechanical scrubbing effect from the evolution of gas enhances the effectiveness of the process.
Wastewater generated during electrolytic cleaning includes spent process solutions and rinses. Electrolytic cleaning solutions become contaminated during use due to the dissolution of the base metal and the introduction of pollutants. The solutions typically are batch discharged for treatment or disposal after they weaken. Rinsing following electrolytic cleaning removes residual cleaner to prevent contamination of subsequent process baths.
Electroplating with Chromium
involves producing a chromium metal coating on a surface by electrodeposition. Electroplating provides corrosion protection, wear or erosion resistance, lubricity, electrical conductivity, or decoration. In electroplating, metal ions in acid, alkaline, or neutral solutions are reduced on the cathodic surfaces of the parts being plated. Metal salts or oxides typically are added to replenish the solutions. Chromium trioxide often is added as a source of chromium. In addition to water and the metal being deposited, electroplating solutions often contain agents that form complexes with the metal being deposited, stabilizers to prevent hydrolysis, buffers for pH control, catalysts to assist in deposition, chemical aids to dissolve anodes, and miscellaneous ingredients that modify the process to attain specific properties. Sealant operations performed after this operation are considered separate unit operations if they include any additives (
i.e.,
other than hot water dips). Wastewater generated during electroplating includes spent process solutions and rinses. Electroplating solutions occasionally become contaminated during use due to the base metal dissolving and the introduction of other pollutants, diminishing the effectiveness of the electroplating solutions diminishes. Spent concentrated solutions typically are treated to remove pollutants and reused, processed in a wastewater treatment system, or disposed of off site. Rinse waters, including some drag-out rinse tank solutions, typically are treated on site.
Electroplating with Cyanide
involves producing metal coatings on a surface by electrodeposition using cyanide. Electroplating provides corrosion protection, wear or erosion resistance, electrical conductivity, or decoration. In electroplating, metal ions in acid, alkaline, or neutral solutions are reduced on the cathodic surfaces of the parts being plated. The metal ions in solution typically are replenished by dissolving metal from anodes contained in inert wire or metal baskets. Sealant operations performed after this operation are considered separate unit operations if they include any additives (
i.e.,
any sealant operations other than hot water dips). In addition to water and the metal being deposited, electroplating solutions often contain agents that form complexes with the metal being deposited, stabilizers to prevent hydrolysis, buffers to control pH, catalysts to assist in deposition, chemical aids to dissolve anodes, and miscellaneous ingredients that modify the process to attain specific properties. Cyanide, usually in the form of sodium or potassium cyanide, frequently is used as a complexing agent for zinc, cadmium, copper, and precious metal baths. Wastewater generated during electroplating includes spent process solutions and rinses. Electroplating solutions occasionally become contaminated during use due to dissolution of the base metal and the introduction of other pollutants, diminishing the performance of the electroplating solutions. Spent concentrated solutions typically are treated to remove pollutants and reused, processed in a wastewater treatment system, or disposed of off site. Rinse waters, including some drag-out rinse tank solutions, typically are treated on site.
Electroplating without Chromium or Cyanide
involves the production of metal coatings on a surface by electrodeposition, without using chromium or cyanide. Commonly electroplated metals include nickel, copper, tin/lead, gold, and zinc. Electroplating provides corrosion protection, wear or erosion resistance, lubricity, electrical conductivity, or decoration. In electroplating, metal ions in acid, alkaline, or neutral solutions are reduced on the cathodic surfaces of the parts being plated. The metal ions in solution typically are replenished by dissolving metal from anodes contained in inert wire or metal baskets. Sealant operations performed after this operation are considered separate unit operations if they include any additives (
i.e.,
any sealant operations other than hot water dips). In addition to water and the metal being deposited, electroplating solutions often contain agents that form complexes
with the metal being deposited, stabilizers to prevent hydrolysis, buffers to control pH, catalysts to assist in deposition, chemical aids to dissolve anodes, and miscellaneous ingredients that modify the process to attain specific properties. Wastewater generated during electroplating without chromium or cyanide includes spent process solutions and rinses. Electroplating solutions occasionally become contaminated during use due to dissolution of the base metal and the introduction of other pollutants, diminishing the effectiveness of the electroplating solutions. Spent concentrated solutions typically are treated for pollutant removal and reused, processed in a wastewater treatment system, or disposed of off site. Rinse waters, including some drag-out rinse tank solutions, typically are treated on site.
Electropolishing
involves producing a highly polished surface on a part using reversed electrodeposition in which the anode (part) releases some metal ions into the electrolyte to reduce surface roughness. When current is applied, a polarized film forms on the metal surface, through which metal ions diffuse. In this operation, areas of surface roughness on parts serve as high-current density areas and are dissolved at rates greater than the rates for smoother portions of the metal surface. Metals are electropolished to improve appearance, reflectivity, and corrosion resistance. Base metals processed by electropolishing include aluminum, copper, zinc, low-alloy steel, and stainless steel. Common electrolytes include sodium hydroxide and combinations of sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and chromic acid. Wastewater generated during electropolishing includes spent process solutions and rinses. Eventually, the concentration of dissolved metals increases to the point where the process becomes ineffective. Typically, a portion of the bath is decanted and either fresh chemicals are added or the entire solution is discharged to treatment and replaced with fresh chemicals. Rinsing can involve several steps and can include hot immersion or spray rinses.
Galvanizing/Hot Dip Coating
involves using various processes to coat an iron or steel surface with zinc. In hot dipping, a base metal is coated by dipping it into a tank that contains a molten metal.
Hot Dip Coating
involves applying a metal coating (usually zinc) to the surface of a part by dipping the part in a molten metal bath. Wastewater is generated in this operation when residual metal coating solution is removed from the part in rinse water.
Kerfing
uses a tool to remove small amounts of metal from a product surface. Water and synthetic coolants may be used to lubricate the area between the tool and the metal, to maintain the temperature of the cutting tool, and to remove metal fines from the surface of the part. This operation generates oily wastewater that contains metal fines and dust.
Laminating
involves applying a material to a substrate using heat and pressure.
Mechanical and Vapor Plating
involves applying a metallic coating to a part. For mechanical plating, the part is rotated in a drum containing a water-based solution, glass beads, and metal powder. In vapor plating, a metallic coating is applied by atomizing the metal and applying an electric charge to the part, which causes the atomized (vapor phase) metal to adhere to the part. Wastewater generated in this operation includes spent solutions from the process bath and rinse water. Typically, the wastewater contains high concentrations of the applied metal.
Metallic Fiber Cloth Manufacturing
involves weaving thin metallic fibers to create a mesh cloth.
Metal Spraying (Including Water Curtain)
involves applying a metallic coating to a part by projecting molten or semimolten metal particles onto a substrate. Coatings can be sprayed from rod or wire stock or from powdered material. The process involves feeding the material (e.g., wire) into a flame where it is melted. The molten stock then is stripped from the end of the wire and atomized by a high-velocity stream of compressed air or other gas that propels the material onto a prepared substrate or part. Metal spraying coatings are used in a wide range of special applications, including: insulating layers in applications such as induction heating coils; electromagnetic interference shielding; thermal barriers for rocket engines; nuclear moderators; films for hot isostatic pressing; and dimensional restoration of worn parts. Metal spraying is sometimes performed in front of a “water curtain” (a circulated water stream used to trap overspray) or a dry filter exhaust hood that captures the overspray and fumes. With water curtain systems, water is recirculated from a sump or tank. Wastewater is generated when the sump or tank is discharged periodically. Metal spraying typically is not followed by rinsing.
Painting-Immersion (Including Electrophoretic, “E-coat”)
involves applying an organic coating to a part using processes such autophoretic and electrophoretic painting.
(1) Autophoretic Painting involves applying an organic paint film by electrophoresis when a part is immersed in a suitable aqueous bath.
(2) Electrophoretic Painting is coating a part by making it either anodic or cathodic in a bath that is generally an aqueous emulsion of the organic coating material.
(3) Other Immersion Painting includes all other types of immersion painting such as dip painting.
Water is used in immersion paint operations as a carrier for paint particles and to rinse the part. Aqueous painting solutions and rinses typically are treated through an ultrafiltration system. The concentrate is returned to the painting solution, and the permeate is reused as rinse water. Sites typically discharge a bleed stream to treatment. The painting solution and rinses are batch discharged periodically to treatment.
Photo Imaging
is the process of exposing a photoresist-laden printed wiring board to light to impact the circuitry design to the board. Water is not used in this operation.
Photo Image Developing
is an operation in which a water-based solution is used to develop the exposed circuitry in a photoresist-laden printed wiring board. Wastewater generated in this operation includes spent process solution and rinse water.
Photoresist Application
is an operation that uses heat and pressure to apply a photoresist coating to a printed wiring board. Water is not used in this operation.
Photoresist Strip
involves removing organic photoresist material from a printed wiring board using an acid solution.
Phosphor Deposition
is the application of a phosphorescent coating to a part. Wastewater generated in this unit operation includes water used to keep the parts clean and wet while the coating is applied, and rinse water used to remove excess phosphorescent coating from the part.
Physical Vapor Deposition
involves physically removing a material from a source through evaporation or sputtering, using the energy of the vapor particles in a vacuum or partial vacuum to transport the removed material, and condensing the removed material as a film onto the surface of a part or other substrate.
Plasma Arc Machining
involves removing material or shaping a part by a high-velocity jet of high-temperature, ionized gas. A gas (nitrogen, argon, or hydrogen) is passed through an electric arc, causing the gas to become ionized, and heated to temperatures exceeding 16,650 °C (30,000 °F). The relatively narrow plasma jet melts and displaces the material in its path. Because plasma arc machining does not depend on a chemical reaction between the gas and the part, and because plasma temperatures are extremely high, the process can be used on almost any metal, including those that are resistant to oxygen-fuel gas cutting. The method is used mainly for profile cutting of stainless steel and aluminum alloys. Although plasma arc machining typically is a dry process, water is used for water injection plasma arc torches. In these cases, a constricted swirling flow of water surrounds the cutting arc. This operations also may be performed immersed in a water bath. In both cases, water is used to stabilize the arc, to cool the part, and to contain smoke and fumes.
Plastic Wire Extrusion
involves applying a plastic material to a metal wire through an extrusion process.
Salt Bath Descaling
involves removing surface oxides or scale from a part by immersing the part in a molten salt bath or hot salt solution. Salt bath descaling solutions can contain molten salts, caustic soda, sodium hydride, and chemical additives. Molten salt baths are used in a salt bath-water quench-acid dip sequence to remove oxides from stainless steel and other corrosion-resistant alloys. In this process, the part typically is immersed in the molten salt, quenched with water, and then dipped in acid. Oxidizing, reducing, or electrolytic salt baths can be used depending on the oxide to be removed. Wastewater generated during salt bath descaling includes spent process solutions, quenches, and rinses.
Shot Tower—Lead Shot Manufacturing
involves dropping molten lead from a platform on the top of a tower through a sieve-like device and into a vat of cold water.
Soldering
involves joining metals by inserting a thin (capillary thickness) layer of nonferrous filler metal into the space between them. Bonding results from the intimate contact produced by the metallic bond formed between the substrate metal and the solder alloy. The term soldering is used where the melting temperature of the filler is below 425 °C (800 °F). Some soldering operations use a solder flux, which is an aqueous or nonaqueous material used to dissolve, remove, or prevent the formation of surface oxides on the part. Except for the use of aqueous fluxes, soldering typically is a dry operation; however, a quench or rinse sometimes follows soldering to cool the part or remove excess flux or other foreign material from its surface. Recent developments in soldering technology have focused on fluxless solders and fluxes that can be cleaned off with water.
Solder Flux Cleaning
involves removing residual solder flux from a printed circuit board using either an alkaline or alcohol cleaning solution.
Solder Fusing
involves coating a tin-lead plated circuit board with a solder flux and then passing the board through a hot oil. The hot oil fuses the tin-lead to the board and creates a solder-like finish on the board.
Solder Masking
involves applying a resistive coating to certain areas of a circuit board to protect the areas during subsequent processing.
Sputtering
is a vacuum evaporation process in which portions of a coating material are physically removed from a substrate and deposited a thin film onto a different substrate.
Stripping (Paint)
involves removing a paint (or other organic) coating from a metal basis material. Stripping commonly is performed
as part of the manufacturing process to recover parts that have been improperly coated or as part of maintenance and rebuilding to restore parts to a usable condition. Organic coatings (including paint) are stripped using thermal, mechanical, and chemical means. Thermal methods include burn-off ovens, fluidized beds of sand, and molten salt baths. Mechanical methods include scraping and abrasive blasting (as defined in “Abrasive Blasting” in appendix B of this part). Chemical paint strippers include alkali solutions, acid solutions, and solvents (e.g., methylene chloride). Wastewater generated during organic coating stripping includes process solutions (limited mostly to chemical paint strippers and rinses).
Stripping (Metallic Coating)
involves removing a metallic coating from a metal basis material. Stripping is commonly part of the manufacturing process to recover parts that have been improperly coated or as part of maintenance and rebuilding to restore parts to a usable condition. Metallic coating stripping most often uses chemical baths, although mechanical means (e.g., grinding, abrasive blasting) also are used. Chemical stripping frequently is performed as an aqueous electrolytic process. Wastewater generated during metallic coating stripping includes process solutions and rinses. Stripping solutions become contaminated from dissolution of the base metal. Typically, the entire solution is discharged to treatment. Rinsing is used to remove the corrosive film remaining on the parts.
Thermal Infusion
uses heat to infuse metal powder or dust onto the surface of a part. Typically, thermal infusion is a dry operation. In some cases, however, water may be used to remove excess metal powder, metal dust, or molten metal.
Ultrasonic Machining
involves forcing an abrasive liquid between a vibrating tool and a part. Particles in the abrasive liquid strike the part, removing any microscopic flakes on the part.
Vacuum Impregnation
is used to reduce the porosity of the part. A filler material (usually organic) is applied to the surface of the part and polymerized under pressure and heat. Wastewater is generated in this unit operation when rinse water is used to remove residual organic coating from the part.
Vacuum Plating
involves applying a thin layer of metal oxide onto a part using molten metal in a vacuum chamber.
Water Shedder
involves applying a dilute water-based chemical compound to a part to accelerate drying. This operation typically is used to prevent a part from streaking when excess water remains on the part.
Wet Air Pollution Control
involves using water to remove chemicals, fumes, or dusts that are entrained in air streams exhausted from process tanks or production areas. Most frequently, wet air pollution control devices are used with electroplating, cleaning, and coating processes. A common type of wet air pollution control is the wet packed scrubber consisting of a spray chamber that is filled with packing material. Water is continuously sprayed onto the packing and the air stream is pulled through the packing by a fan. Pollutants in the air stream are absorbed by the water droplets and the air is released to the atmosphere. A single scrubber often serves numerous process tanks; however, the air streams typically are segregated by source into chromium, cyanide, and acid/alkaline sources. Wet air pollution control can be divided into several suboperations, including:
(1) Wet Air Pollution Control for Acid Alkaline Baths;
(2) Wet Air Pollution Control for Cyanide Baths;
(3) Wet Air Pollution Control for Chromium-Bearing Baths; and
(4) Wet Air Pollution Control for Fumes and Dusts.
Wire Galvanizing Flux
involves using flux to remove rust and oxide from the surface of steel wire prior to galvanizing. This provides long-term corrosion protection for the steel wire.

§ 439.11
Special definitions.
For the purpose of this subpart:
(a)

[68 FR 12271, Mar. 13, 2003]
§ 439.12
Effluent limitations attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).
Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of BPT:
(a) The maximum monthly average limitation for BOD
5
, expressed as mass loading (lbs., kg) per day, must reflect not less than 90 percent reduction in the long-term average daily BOD
5
load of the raw (untreated) process wastewater, multiplied by a variability factor of 3.0.
(1) The long-term average daily BOD
5
load of the raw process wastewater (
i.e.
, the base number to which the percent reduction is applied) is defined as the average daily BOD
5
load during any calendar month, over 12 consecutive months within the most recent 36 months, and must include one or more periods during which production was at a maximum.
(2) To assure equity in the determination of NPDES permit limitations regulating discharges subject to this subpart, calculation of the long-term average daily BOD
5
load in the influent to the wastewater treatment system must exclude any portion of the load associated with separable mycelia and solvents, except for residual amounts of mycelia and solvents remaining after the practices of recovery and/or separate disposal or reuse. These residual amounts may be included in the calculation of the average influent BOD
5
loading.
(3) The practices of recovery, and/or separate disposal or reuse include: physical separation and removal of separable mycelia; recovery of solvents from waste streams; incineration of concentrated solvent wastestreams (including tar still bottoms); and concentration of broth for disposal other than to the treatment system. This part does not prohibit the inclusion of such wastes in raw waste loads in fact, nor does it mandate any specific practice, but rather describes the rationale for determining NPDES permit limitations. The effluent limitation for BOD
5
may be achieved by any of several, or a combination, of these practices.
(b) The maximum monthly average limitation for TSS, expressed as mass loading (lbs., kg) per day, must be calculated as 1.7 times the BOD
5
limitation determined in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the limitations for COD are as follows:

(d) If the maximum monthly average COD concentration in paragraph (c) of this section is higher than a concentration value reflecting a reduction in the long-term average daily COD load in the raw (untreated) process wastewater of 74 percent multiplied by a variability factor of 2.2, then the monthly average limitation for COD corresponding to the lower concentration value must be applied.
(e) The effluent limitations for cyanide are as follows:
Effluent Limitations (BPT)
Regulated parameter

(f) When monitoring for cyanide at the end-of-pipe is impractical because of dilution by other process wastewaters, compliance with the cyanide effluent limitations in paragraph (e) of this section must be demonstrated at in-plant monitoring points pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(i) and 122.45(h). Under the same provisions, the permitting authority may impose monitoring requirements on internal wastestreams for any other parameter(s) regulated by this section.
(g) Compliance with the limitation in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section may be achieved by certifying to the permit issuing authority that the facility's manufacturing processes neither use nor generate cyanide.

# Subpart B—Extraction Products
§ 439.20
Applicability.
This subpart applies to discharges of process wastewater resulting from the manufacture of pharmaceutical products by extraction.
[63 FR 50430, Sept. 21, 1998]
§ 439.21
Special definitions.
For the purpose of this subpart:
(a)
Extraction
means process operations that derive pharmaceutically active ingredients from natural sources such as plant roots and leaves, animal glands, and parasitic fungi by chemical and physical extraction.
(b)
Product
means any substance manufactured by an extraction process, including blood fractions, vaccines, serums, animal bile derivatives, endocrine products and medicinal products such as alkaloids that are isolated from botanical drugs and herbs.
[68 FR 12272, Mar. 13, 2003]
§ 439.22
Effluent limitations attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).
Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of BPT:
(a) The limitation for BOD
5
is the same as specified in § 439.12(a). No facility shall be required to attain a monthly average limitation for BOD
5
that is less than the equivalent of 45 mg/L.
(1) The long-term average daily BOD
5
load of the raw process wastewater (
i.e.
, the base number to which the percent reduction is applied) is defined as the average daily BOD
5
load during any calendar month, over 12 consecutive months within the most recent 36 months, and must include one or more periods during which production was at a maximum.
(2) To assure equity in the determination of NPDES permit limitations regulating discharges subject to this subpart, calculation of the long-term average daily BOD
5
load in the influent to the wastewater treatment system must exclude any portion of the load associated with separable mycelia and solvents, except for residual amounts of mycelia and solvents remaining after the practices of recovery and/or separate disposal or reuse. Residual amounts of these substances may be included in the calculation of the average influent BOD
5
loading.
(3) The practices of recovery, and/or separate disposal or reuse include: physical separation and removal of separable mycelia; recovery of solvents from wastestreams; incineration of concentrated solvent wastestreams (including tar still bottoms); and broth concentration for disposal other than to the treatment system. This part does not prohibit the inclusion of such wastes in raw waste loads in fact, nor does it mandate any specific practice, but rather describes the rationale for determining NPDES permit limitations. The effluent limitation for BOD
5
may be achieved by any of several, or a combination, of these practices.
(b) The limitation for TSS is the same as specified in § 439.12(b).
(c) Except for the provisions in paragraph (d) of this section, the limitations for COD are as follows:
Effluent Limitations (BPT)
Regulated parameter

# Subpart L—General Provisions and Definitions
§ 440.130
Applicability.
Abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to part 440 except as provided in these general provisions and definitions. The general provisions and definitions in this subpart apply to all subparts of part 440 unless otherwise noted.
§ 440.131
General provisions.
(a)
Combined waste streams.
In the event that waste streams from various subparts or segments of subparts in part 440 are combined for treatment and discharge, the quantity and concentration of each pollutant or pollutant property in the combined discharge that is subject to effluent limitations shall not exceed the quantity and concentration of each pollutant or pollutant property that could have been discharged had each waste stream been treated separately. In addition, the discharge flow from the combined discharge shall not exceed the volume that could have been discharged had each waste stream been treated separately.
(b)
Storm exemption for facilities permitted to discharge.
If, as a result of precipitation or snowmelt, a source with an allowable discharge under 40 CFR part 440 has an overflow or excess discharge of effluent which does not meet the limitations of 40 CFR part 440, the source may qualify for an exemption from such limitations with respect to such discharge if the following conditions are met:
(1) The facility is designed, constructed and maintained to contain the maximum volume of wastewater which would be generated by the facility during a 24-hour period without an increase in volume from precipitation and the maximum volume of wastewater resulting from a 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event or treat the maximum flow associated with these volumes. In computing the maximum volume of wastewater which would result from a 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event, the facility must include the volume which would result from all areas contributing runoff to the individual treatment facility,
i.e.
, all runoff that is not diverted from the active mining area and runoff which is not diverted from the mill area.
(2) The facility takes all reasonable steps to maintain treatment of the wastewater and minimize the amount of overflow.
(3) The facility complies with the notification requirements of § 122.60 (g) and (h). The storm exemption is designed to provide an affirmative defense to an enforcement action. Therefore, the operator has the burden of demonstrating to the appropriate authority that the above conditions have been met.
(c)
Storm exemption for facilities not permitted to discharge.
If, as a result of precipitation (rainfall or snowmelt), a
source which is not permitted to discharge under 40 CFR part 440, has an overflow or discharge which violates the limitations of 40 CFR part 440, the source may qualify for an exemption from such limitations with respect to such discharge if the following conditions are met:
(1) The facility is designed, constructed, and maintained to contain the maximum volume of wastewater stored and contained by the facility during normal operating conditions without an increase in volume from precipitation and the maximum volume of wastewater resulting from a 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event. In computing the maximum volume of wastewater which would result from a 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event, the facility must include the volume which would result from all areas contributing runoff to the individual treatment facility,
i.e.
, all runoff that is not diverted from the area or process subject to zero discharge, and other runoff that is allowed to commingle with the influent to the treatment system.
(2) The facility takes all reasonable steps to minimize the overflow or excess discharge.
(3) The facility complies with the notification requirements of § 122.60(g) and (h). The storm exemption is designed to provide an affirmative defense to an enforcement action. Therefore, the operator has the burden of demonstrating to the appropriate authority that the above conditions have been met.
(d)
pH adjustment.
(1) Where the application of neutralization and sedimentation technology to comply with relevant metal limitations results in an inability to comply with the pH range of 6 to 9, the permit issuer may allow the pH level in the final effluent to slightly exceed 9.0 so that the copper, lead, zinc, mercury, and cadmium limitations will be achieved.
(2) In the case of a discharge into natural receiving waters for which the pH, if unaltered by human activities, is or would be less than 6.0 and approved water quality standards authorize such lower pH, the pH limitations for the discharge may be adjusted downward to the pH water quality criterion for the receiving waters provided the other effluent limitations for the discharge are met. In no case shall a pH limitation below 5.0 be permitted.
(e)
Groundwater infiltration provision.
In the event a new source subject to a no discharge requirement can demonstrate that groundwater infiltration contributes a substantial amount of water to the tailing impoundment or wastewater holding facility, the permitting authority may allow the discharge of a volume of water equivalent to the amount of groundwater infiltration. This discharge shall be subject to the limitations for mine drainage applicable to the new source subcategory.

§ 442.1
General applicability.
(a) As defined more specifically in each subpart, and except for discharges specified in paragraph (b) of this section, this part applies to discharges resulting from cleaning the interior of tanks used to transport chemical, petroleum or food grade cargos. This part does not apply to facilities that clean only the exteriors of transportation equipment. Operations which may be subject to this part typically are reported under a wide variety of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Several of the most common SIC codes include: SIC 7699, SIC 4741, or SIC 4491 (1987 SIC Manual).
(b) This part is not applicable to the following discharges:
(1) Wastewaters associated with tank cleanings operated in conjunction with other industrial, commercial, or Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) operations, provided that the cleaning is limited to tanks that previously contained raw materials, by-products, or finished products that are associated with the facility's on-site processes.

Closed-top hoppers are not designed or constructed to carry liquid cargos and are typically used to transport grain, soybeans, soy meal, soda ash, lime, fertilizer, plastic pellets, flour, sugar, and similar commodities or cargos. The cargos transported come in direct contact with the hopper interior. Closed-top hoppers are also commonly referred to as dry bulk hoppers.
Drums
mean metal or plastic cylindrical containers with either an open-head or a tight-head (also known as bung-type top) used to hold liquid, solid, or gaseous commodities or cargos which are in direct contact with the container interior. Drums typically range in capacity from 30 to 55 gallons.
Food grade cargos
mean edible and non-edible food products. Specific examples of food grade cargos include, but are not limited to, the following: alcoholic beverages, animal by-products, animal fats, animal oils, caramel, caramel coloring, chocolate, corn syrup and other corn products, dairy products, dietary supplements, eggs, flavorings, food preservatives, food products that are not suitable for human consumption, fruit juices, honey, lard, molasses, non-alcoholic beverages, sweeteners, tallow, vegetable oils, and vinegar.
Heel
means any material remaining in a tank following unloading, delivery, or discharge of the transported cargo. Heels may also be referred to as container residue, residual materials or residuals.
Intermediate bulk container (“IBC” or “Tote”)
means a completely enclosed storage vessel used to hold liquid, solid, or gaseous commodities or cargos which are in direct contact with the container interior. IBCs may be loaded onto flat beds for either truck or rail transport, or onto ship decks for water transport. IBCs are portable containers with 450 liters (119 gallons) to 3000 liters (793 gallons) capacity. IBCs are also commonly referred to as totes or tote bins.
Intermodal tank container
means a completely enclosed storage vessel used to hold liquid, solid, or gaseous commodities or cargos which come in direct contact with the tank interior. Intermodal tank containers may be loaded onto flat beds for either truck or rail transport, or onto ship decks for water transport. Containers larger than 3000 liters capacity are considered intermodal tank containers. Containers smaller than 3000 liters capacity are considered IBCs.
Ocean/sea tanker
means a self or non-self-propelled vessel constructed or adapted to transport liquid, solid or gaseous commodities or cargos in bulk in cargo spaces (or tanks) through oceans and seas, where the commodity or cargo carried comes in direct contact with the tank interior. There are no maximum or minimum vessel or tank volumes.
On-site
means within the contiguous and non-contiguous established boundaries of a facility.
Petroleum cargos
mean products of the fractionation or straight distillation of crude oil, redistillation of unfinished petroleum derivatives, cracking, or other refining processes. For purposes of this rule, petroleum cargos also include products obtained from the refining or processing of natural gas and coal. For purposes of this rule, specific examples of petroleum products include but are not limited to: asphalt; benzene; coal tar; crude oil; cutting oil; ethyl benzene; diesel fuel; fuel additives; fuel oils; gasoline; greases; heavy, medium, and light oils; hydraulic fluids, jet fuel; kerosene; liquid petroleum gases (LPG) including butane and propane; lubrication oils; mineral spirits; naphtha; olefin, paraffin, and other waxes; tall oil; tar; toluene; xylene; and waste oil.
Pollution Prevention Allowable Discharge
for this subpart means the quantity of/concentrations of pollutants in wastewaters being discharged to publicly owned treatment works after a facility has demonstrated compliance with the Pollutant Management Plan provisions in § 442.15(b), § 442.16(b), § 442.25(b), or § 442.26(b) of this part.
Prerinse/presteam
means a rinse, typically with hot or cold water, performed
at the beginning of the cleaning sequence to remove residual material from the tank interior.
Presolve wash
means the use of diesel, kerosene, gasoline, or any other type of fuel or solvent as a tank interior cleaning solution.
Rail Tank Car
means a completely enclosed storage vessel pulled by a locomotive that is used to transport liquid, solid, or gaseous commodities or cargos over railway access lines. A rail tank car storage vessel may have one or more storage compartments and the stored commodities or cargos come in direct contact with the tank interior. There are no maximum or minimum vessel or tank volumes.
Tank barge
means a non-self-propelled vessel constructed or adapted primarily to carry liquid, solid or gaseous commodities or cargos in bulk in cargo spaces (or tanks) through rivers and inland waterways, and may occasionally carry commodities or cargos through oceans and seas when in transit from one inland waterway to another. The commodities or cargos transported are in direct contact with the tank interior. There are no maximum or minimum vessel or tank volumes.
Tank truck
means a motor-driven vehicle with a completely enclosed storage vessel used to transport liquid, solid or gaseous materials over roads and highways. The storage vessel or tank may be detachable, as with tank trailers, or permanently attached. The commodities or cargos transported come in direct contact with the tank interior. A tank truck may have one or more storage compartments. There are no maximum or minimum vessel or tank volumes. Tank trucks are also commonly referred to as cargo tanks or tankers.
Transportation equipment cleaning (TEC) process wastewater
means all wastewaters associated with cleaning the interiors of tanks including: tank trucks; rail tank cars; intermodal tank containers; tank barges; and ocean/sea tankers used to transport commodities or cargos that come into direct contact with the interior of the tank or container. At those facilities that clean tank interiors, TEC process wastewater also includes wastewater generated from washing vehicle exteriors, equipment and floor washings, TEC-contaminated stormwater, wastewater prerinse cleaning solutions, chemical cleaning solutions, and final rinse solutions. TEC process wastewater is defined to include only wastewater generated from a regulated TEC subcategory. Therefore, TEC process wastewater does not include wastewater generated from cleaning hopper cars, or from food grade facilities discharging to a POTW. Wastewater generated from cleaning tank interiors for purposes of shipping products (
i.e.
, cleaned for purposes other than maintenance and repair) is considered TEC process wastewater. Wastewater generated from cleaning tank interiors for the purposes of maintenance and repair on the tank is not considered TEC process wastewater. Facilities that clean tank interiors solely for the purposes of repair and maintenance are not regulated under this part.

# Subpart A—Commercial Hazardous Waste Combustor Subcategory
§ 444.10
Applicability.
(a) The provisions of this part apply only to that portion of wastewater discharges that are associated with Commercial Hazardous Waste Combustor (CHWC) wastewater.
(b) The discharge from a CHWC of wastewater that is not CHWC wastewater, may be subject to other applicable provisions of EPA's CWA effluent guidelines and standards regulations at subchapter N of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
§ 444.11
Definitions.
As used in this part the general definitions and abbreviations in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply.
Commercial hazardous waste combustor
means any thermal unit, except a cement kiln, that is subject either to 40 CFR part 264, subpart O; 40 CFR part 265, subpart O; or 40 CFR part 266, subpart H if the thermal unit burns RCRA hazardous wastes received from off-site for a fee or other remuneration in the following circumstances. The thermal unit is a commercial hazardous waste combustor if the off-site wastes are generated at a facility not under the same corporate structure or subject to the same ownership as the thermal unit and
(1) The thermal unit is burning wastes that are not of a similar nature to wastes being burned from industrial processes on site or
(2) There are no wastes being burned from industrial processes on site. Examples of wastes of a “similar nature” may include the following: Wastes generated in industrial operations whose wastewaters are subject to the same provisions in 40 CFR subchapter N or wastes burned as part of a product stewardship activity. The term commercial hazardous waste combustor includes the following facilities: a facility that burns exclusively waste received from off-site; and, a facility that burns both wastes generated on-site and wastes received from off-site. Facilities that may be commercial hazardous waste combustors include hazardous waste incinerators, rotary kiln incinerators, lime kilns, lightweight aggregate kilns, and boilers. A facility not otherwise a commercial hazardous waste combustor is not a commercial hazardous waste combustor if it burns RCRA hazardous waste for charitable organizations, as a community service or as an accommodation to local, state or government agencies so long as the waste is burned for no fee or other remuneration.
Commercial hazardous waste combustor wastewater
means wastewater attributable to commercial waste combustion operations, but includes only wastewater from air pollution control systems and water used to quench flue gas or slag generated as a result of commercial hazardous waste combustor operations.
Off-site
means outside the boundaries of a facility.
On-site
means within the boundaries of a facility.
Parameters
are defined as Parameters at 40 CFR 136.2 in Table 1B, which also cites the approved methods of analysis.
(1)
Arsenic
means total arsenic, Parameter 6.
(2)
Cadmium
means total cadmium, Parameter 12.
(3)
Chromium
means total chromium, Parameter 19.
(4)

§ 444.12
Monitoring requirements.
(a) Both direct and indirect discharges must monitor to establish compliance with their limitations and standards. Thus, all the permits of all direct dischargers must include requirements to monitor, according to EPA-approved test procedures, each pollutant limited in the permit, the volume of effluent discharged from each outfall, and other appropriate measurements subject to notification requirements. See 40 CFR 122.44(i). EPA's pretreatment regulations similarly require indirect dischargers to monitor to demonstrate compliance with pretreatment standards. See 40 CFR 403.12(g).
(b) Incorporation by reference:
(1) Compliance with the monitoring requirements may be accomplished using approved test procedures listed in the table to this paragraph. Most of these test procedures have previously been incorporated by reference at 40
CFR 136.3(a), Table IB. The test procedures for the regulated pollutants (arsenic, cadmium, chromium (total), copper, pH, lead, mercury, TSS, silver, titanium, and zinc) listed in the table to this paragraph are also incorporated by reference into this regulation. The full texts of the test procedures listed in this paragraph are available from the sources indicated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition to those test procedures incorporated by reference at 40 CFR 136.3(a), Table IB, you may also use EPA Method 200.8, “Determination of Trace Elements in Water and Wastes by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry,” from “Methods for Determination of Metals in Environmental Samples—Supplement I,” EPA-600/R-94-111, May 1994, and ASTM Method D 5673-96, “Standard Test Method for Elements in Water by Inductively Coupled Plasma—Mass Spectrometry,” from 1999 Annual Book of ASTM Standards, for determination of arsenic, cadmium, chromium (total), copper, lead, silver, and zinc. The full texts of these methods are incorporated by reference into this regulation and may be obtained from the sources identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

For the determination of total metals the sample is not filtered before processing. A digestion procedure is required to solubilize suspended material and to destroy possible organic-metal complexes. Two digestion procedures are given in “Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes, 1979 and 1983”. One (Section 4.1.3), is a vigorous digestion using nitric acid. A less vigorous digestion using nitric and hydrochloric acids (Section 4.1.4) is preferred; however, the analyst should be cautioned that this mild digestion may not suffice for all samples types. Particularly, if a colorimetric procedure is to be employed, it is necessary to ensure that all organo-metallic bonds be broken so that the metal is in a reactive state. In those situations, the vigorous digestion is to be preferred making certain that at no time does the sample go to dryness. Samples containing large amounts of organic materials may also benefit by this vigorous digestion, however, vigorous digestion with concentrated nitric acid will convert antimony and tin to insoluble oxides and render them unavailable for analysis. Use of ICP/AES as well as determinations for certain elements such as antimony, arsenic, the noble metals, mercury, selenium, silver, tin, and titanium require a modified sample digestion procedure and in all cases the method write-up should be consulted for specific instructions and/or cautions.
Note.
—If the digestion procedure for direct aspiration AA included in one of the other approved references is different than the above, the EPA procedure must be used.
Dissolved metals are defined as those constituents which will pass through a 0.45 micron membrane filter. Following filtration of the sample, the referenced procedure for total metals must be followed. Sample digestion of the filtrate for dissolved metals (or digestion of the original sample solution for total metals) may be omitted for AA (direct aspiration or graphite furnace) and ICP analyses, provided the sample solution to be analyzed meets the following criteria:
a. Has a low COD (
20)
b. Is visibly transparent with a turbidity measurement of 1 NTU or less
c. Is colorless with no perceptible odor, and
d. Is of one liquid phase and free of particulate or suspended matter following acidification.

Approved methods for the analysis of silver in industrial wastewaters at concentrations of 1 mg/L and above are inadequate where silver exists as an inorganic halide. Silver halides such as the bromide and chloride are relatively insoluble in reagents such as nitric acid but are readily soluble in an aqueous buffer of sodium thiosulfate and sodium hydroxide to pH of 12. Therefore, for levels of silver above 1 mg/L, 20 mL of sample should be diluted to 100 mL by adding 40 mL each of 2 M Na

This part applies to discharges of pollutants from deicing operations at Primary Airports.
§ 449.2
General definitions.
The following definitions apply to this part:
Aircraft deicing fluid (ADF)
means a fluid (other than hot water) applied to
aircraft to remove or prevent any accumulation of snow or ice on the aircraft. This includes deicing and anti-icing fluids.
Airfield pavement
means all paved surfaces on the airside of an airport.
Airside
means the part of an airport directly involved in the arrival and departure of aircraft, including runways, taxiways, aprons, and ramps.
Annual non-propeller aircraft departures
means the average number of commercial turbine-engine aircraft that are propelled by jet,
i.e.,
turbojet or turbofan, that take off from an airport on an annual basis, as tabulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Available ADF
means 75 percent of the normalized Type I aircraft deicing fluid and 10 percent of the normalized Type IV aircraft deicing fluid, excluding aircraft deicing fluids used for defrosting or deicing for safe taxiing.
Centralized deicing pad
means a facility on an airfield designed for aircraft deicing operations, typically constructed with a drainage system separate from the airport main storm drain system.
COD
means Chemical Oxygen Demand.
Collection requirement
means the requirement in § 449.11 for the permittee to collect available ADF.
Defrosting
means the removal of frost contamination from an aircraft when there has been no active precipitation.
Deicing
mean procedures and practices to remove or prevent any accumulation of snow or ice on:
(1) An aircraft; or
(2) Airfield pavement.

§ 449.20
Monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
(a)
Demonstrating compliance with the ADF collection requirement for dischargers subject to NSPS collection requirements in § 449.11.
Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, an individual permittee shall select a procedure under either paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section in its permit application as the procedure for the permittee to demonstrate compliance with the applicable collection, reporting and recordkeeping requirements of this Part. A procedure selected by the permittee under paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be included in the permit only with the Director's approval, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. For general permits, use of alternative methods for determining compliance with the ADF collection requirement for dischargers subject to NSPS collection requirements in this part will be at the discretion of the Director.
(1) The permittee shall maintain records to demonstrate, and certify annually, that it is operating and maintaining one or more centralized deicing pads. This technology shall be operated and maintained according to the technical specifications set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. For both individual and general permits, these technical specifications shall be expressly set forth as requirements in the permit. The permittee's demonstration and valid certification are sufficient to meet the applicable NSPS collection requirement without the permittee having to determine the numeric percentage of available ADF collected.
(i) Each centralized deicing pad shall be sized and sited in accordance with all applicable FAA advisory circulars.
(ii) Drainage valves associated with the centralized deicing pad shall be activated before deicing activities commence, to collect available ADF.
(iii) The centralized deicing pad and associated collection equipment shall be installed and maintained per any applicable manufacturers' instructions, and shall be inspected, at a minimum, at the beginning of each deicing season to ensure that the pad and associated equipment are in working condition.
(iv) All aircraft deicing shall take place on a centralized deicing pad, with the exception of defrosting and deicing for safe taxiing.
(2)
Alternative technology or specifications.
(i) An individual permit (or a general permit at the discretion of the Director) may allow one of the following alternative procedures for demonstrating compliance with its collection requirement, instead of the procedure in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The permittee must submit all information and documentation necessary to support this request. An individual permittee may request this alternative procedure in its initial permit application or permit renewal application. During the term of an individual permit, the permittee may also request this alternative procedure as a permit modification, subject to the requirements and procedures at 40 CFR 122.62 and 40 CFR part 124. If the Director determines, in his or her discretion, that the requested alternative procedure will achieve the collection requirement in the permit, the Director shall approve the request:
(A) The use of a different ADF collection technology from the centralized deicing pad technology specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or
(B) The use of the same ADF collection technology, but with different specifications for operation and/or maintenance.
(ii)
Pollution prevention credit.
A permittee may apply for, and obtain, full or partial credit towards compliance with the available ADF collection requirement. To obtain credit the permittee must demonstrate to the Director's satisfaction that it employs a pollution prevention technique that reduces the volume of, or quantity of, pollutants in, available ADF. The credit shall be equivalent to the demonstrated reduction, as determined by the Director.
(iii) The Director shall set forth technical specifications for proper operation and maintenance of the chosen collection technology, as appropriate, and compliance with these technical specifications must be required by the permit. The permit shall also require the permittee to maintain records sufficient to demonstrate compliance with these requirements. This demonstration constitutes compliance by the permittee with the percent capture requirement without the permittee having to determine the numeric percentage of ADF that it has collected. Before the Director may approve an alternate technology under this subsection, the permittee must demonstrate to the Director's satisfaction that the alternate technology will achieve the applicable percent capture requirement.
(3) The permittee shall maintain records, by means deemed acceptable by the Director, and report at a frequency determined by the Director, on the volume of ADF sprayed and the amount of available ADF collected in order to determine the compliance with the collection requirement.
(b)
Monitoring requirements
—(1)
COD limitation.
Permittees subject to the ADF collection and discharge requirements specified in § 449.11 must conduct effluent monitoring to demonstrate compliance with the COD limitation
for all ADF that is collected. Compliance must be demonstrated at the location where the effluent leaves the on-site treatment system utilized for meeting these requirements and before commingling with any non-deicing discharge. Effluent samples must be collected following the protocol in Appendix A to this part.
(2)
Ammonia limitation.
If a permittee chooses to comply with the compliance alternative specified in § 449.10(a) or § 449.11(b), the permittee must conduct effluent monitoring at all locations where pavement deicing with a product that contains urea is occurring, prior to any dilution or commingling with any non-deicing discharge.
(c)
Recordkeeping.
(1) The permit shall provide that the permittee must maintain on site, during the term of the permit, up to five years, records documenting compliance with paragraphs (a) through (b) of this section. These records include, but are not limited to, documentation of wastewater samples collected and analyzed, certifications, and equipment maintenance schedules and agreements.
(2) At the Director's discretion, a requirement may be included in the permit for the permittee to collect, and maintain on site during the term of the permit, up to five (5) years of data on the annual volume of ADF used.

Pt. 449, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 449—Sampling Protocol for Soluble COD
This sampling protocol applies only to samples collected for use in measurement of COD when demonstrating compliance with the regulations set forth in this part. Collect a representative sample of the effluent from the airport deicing treatment system, based on the discharge permit requirements (e.g., a grab sample or a composite sample). Because only the COD sample is filtered, do not use in-line filters if collecting a sample with a compositing device.

# A. Grab Samples
1. Cap the container and shake the grab sample vigorously to mix it. Remove the plunger from a 10-milliliter (mL) or larger Luer-lock plastic syringe equipped with an Acrodisc Luer-lock filter containing a 1.5-μm glass fiber filter (Whatman 934-AH, or equivalent), and fill the syringe body with sample.
2. Replace the plunger and filter the sample into a clean 50-mL screw-cap glass, plastic, or fluoropolymer bottle.

# Note:
If testing is being done in the field, or with a test kit product (e.g., Hach Method 8000), the filtrate may be collected in the test kit vial or container.
3. Additional 10-mL volumes of sample may be filtered and the filtrate added to the same sample bottle. This additional volume may be used to repeat sample analyses or to prepare Quality Control (QC) samples, as needed.
4. Unless the filtered sample will be analyzed within 15 minutes, preserve the filtered sample with H
2
SO
4
to pH
2. Cap the bottle and label with the sample number. Place in a cooler on ice prior to shipping.
5. Once at the analytical laboratory, the sample must be stored at ≤6 degrees Celsius and analyzed within 28 days of collection (see the requirements for COD in Table II at 40 CFR part 136).
6. Analyze the sample using a method approved for COD in Table IB at 40 CFR part 136.

# Note:
Because this procedure is specific to this point source category, it does not appear by name in 40 CFR part 136.
7. Report the sample results as Soluble COD in units of milligrams per liter (mg/L). There is no Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number for soluble COD.

# B. Composite Samples
1. If the sample will be analyzed in a fixed laboratory (as opposed to field testing), transfer at least 50 mL of well-mixed sample from the compositing device into a clean 50-mL screw-cap glass, plastic, or fluoropolymer bottle. Preserve the sample with H
2
SO
4
to pH
2. Cap the bottle and label with the sample number. Place in a cooler on ice prior to shipping.
2. Once at the analytical laboratory, the sample must be stored at ≤6 degrees Celsius and analyzed within 28 days of collection (see the requirements for COD in Table II at 40 CFR part 136).
3. Prior to analysis, remove the sample from cold storage and allow it to warm to room temperature. Shake the sample vigorously to mix it.
4. Remove the plunger from a 10-mL or larger Luer-lock plastic syringe equipped with an Acrodisc Luer-lock filter containing a 1.5-μm glass fiber filter (Whatman 934-AH, or equivalent), and fill the syringe body with sample.
5. Replace the plunger and filter the sample into a clean COD vial or other suitable container.
6. Additional 10-mL volumes of sample may be filtered and the filtrate added to separate
containers, as needed, to provide samples for repeat analyses or to prepare QC samples.
7. Analyze the sample using a method approved for COD in Table 1B at 40 CFR part 136.

# Note:
Because this procedure is specific to this point source category, it does not appear by name in 40 CFR part 136.
8. Report the sample results as Soluble COD in units of mg/L. There is no CAS Registry Number for soluble COD.

# Subpart B—Construction and Development Effluent Guidelines
§ 450.21
Effluent limitations reflecting the best practicable technology currently available (BPT).
Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any point source subject to this subpart must achieve, at a minimum, the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).
(a)
Erosion and sediment controls.
Design, install and maintain effective erosion controls and sediment controls to minimize the discharge of pollutants. At a minimum, such controls must be designed, installed and maintained to:
(1) Control stormwater volume and velocity to minimize soil erosion in order to minimize pollutant discharges;
(2) Control stormwater discharges, including both peak flowrates and total stormwater volume, to minimize channel and streambank erosion and scour in the immediate vicinity of discharge points;
(3) Minimize the amount of soil exposed during construction activity;
(4) Minimize the disturbance of steep slopes;
(5)
Minimize sediment discharges from the site.
The design, installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment controls must address factors such as the amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of
soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site;
(6) Provide and maintain natural buffers around waters of the United States, direct stormwater to vegetated areas and maximize stormwater infiltration to reduce pollutant discharges, unless infeasible;
(7) Minimize soil compaction. Minimizing soil compaction is not required where the intended function of a specific area of the site dictates that it be compacted; and
(8) Unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. Preserving topsoil is not required where the intended function of a specific area of the site dictates that the topsoil be disturbed or removed.
(b)
Soil stabilization.
Stabilization of disturbed areas must, at a minimum, be initiated immediately whenever any clearing, grading, excavating or other earth disturbing activities have permanently ceased on any portion of the site, or temporarily ceased on any portion of the site and will not resume for a period exceeding 14 calendar days. In arid, semiarid, and drought-stricken areas where initiating vegetative stabilization measures immediately is infeasible, alternative stabilization measures must be employed as specified by the permitting authority. Stabilization must be completed within a period of time determined by the permitting authority. In limited circumstances, stabilization may not be required if the intended function of a specific area of the site necessitates that it remain disturbed.

(2) Minimize the exposure of building materials, building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, sanitary waste and other materials present on the site to precipitation and to stormwater. Minimization of exposure is not required in cases where the exposure to precipitation and to stormwater will not result in a discharge of pollutants, or where exposure of a specific material or product poses little risk of stormwater contamination (such as final products and materials intended for outdoor use); and
(3) Minimize the discharge of pollutants from spills and leaks and implement chemical spill and leak prevention and response procedures.
(e)
Prohibited discharges.
The following discharges are prohibited:
(1) Wastewater from washout of concrete, unless managed by an appropriate control;
(2) Wastewater from washout and cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds and other construction materials;
(3) Fuels, oils, or other pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance; and
(4) Soaps or solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing.

Discharges of cyanide in cyanide-bearing waste streams are not subject to the cyanide limitation and standards of this subpart if the permit writer or control authority determines that the cyanide limitations and standards are not achievable due to elevated levels of non-amenable cyanide (
i.e.
, cyanide that is not oxidized by chlorine treatment) that result from the unavoidable complexing of cyanide at the process source of the cyanide-bearing waste stream and establishes an alternative total cyanide or amenable cyanide limitation that reflects the best available technology economically achievable. The determination must be based upon a review of relevant engineering, production, and sampling and analysis information, including measurements of both total and amenable cyanide in the waste stream. An analysis of the extent of complexing in the waste stream, based on the foregoing information, and its impact on cyanide treatability shall be set forth in writing and, for direct dischargers, be contained in the fact sheet required by 40 CFR 124.8.

# Subpart D—Test Methods for Pesticide Pollutants
§ 455.50
Identification of test procedures.
The pesticide active ingredients to which this section applies and for which effluent limitations guidelines and standards are specified in this part are named, together with the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number (provided to assist in identifying the pesticide active ingredient only) and analytical method(s) designation(s) in Table IG at 40 CFR 136.3(a). Except as provided in 40 CFR 136.5, the discharge parameter values required under the Clean Water Act must be determined by one of the analytical methods cited and described in Table IG at 40 CFR 136.3(a). Pesticide manufacturers may not use the analytical method cited in Table IB, Table IC, or Table ID of 40 CFR 136.3(a) to make these determinations (except where the method cited in those tables is identical to the method specified in Table IG at 40 CFR 136.3(a)). The full texts of the analytical methods cited in Table IG at 40 CFR 136.3(a) are contained in the
Methods For The Determination of Nonconventional Pesticides In Municipal and Industrial Wastewater, Volume I,
EPA 821-R-93-010A (August 1993 Revision I) and
Volume II,
EPA 821-R-93-010B (August 1993) (the “Compendium”). Each pesticide chemical manufacturer that is required to determine discharge parameter values under this part using one of the analytical methods cited in Table IG at 40 CFR 136.3(a) must request in writing a copy of the Compendium from the permit authority or local control authority (as applicable) prior to determining such discharge parameter values, unless the manufacturer already has a copy.

Table 7 to Part 455 [Reserved]
Pt. 455, Table 8

# Table 8 to Part 455—List of Pollution Prevention Alternative Practices
A modification to the list of practices on this table that an individual facility must comply with to be eligible for the pollution prevention alternative is allowed with acceptable justification as listed on this table as approved by the permit writer or control authority (using BPJ/BEJ) after submittal by the facility of a request for modification. A modification, for purposes of this table, means that a facility would no longer have to perform a listed practice or would need to comply with a modified practice. However, the modification only applies to the specific practice for which the modification has been justified and to no other listed practices. Facilities are required to thoroughly discuss all modifications in the on-site compliance paperwork as described above in the limitations and standards (§ 455.41(c)).
1. Must use water conservation practices. These practices may include, but are not limited to using: spray nozzles or flow reduction devices on hoses, low volume/high pressure rinsing equipment, floor scrubbing machines, mop(s) and bucket(s), and counter current staged drum rinsing stations.
[Modification allowed when: Rinsing narrow transfer lines or piping where sufficient rinsing is better achieved by flushing with water.]
2. Must practice good housekeeping:
(a) Perform preventative maintenance on all valves and fittings and repair leaky valves and fittings in a timely manner;
(b) Use drip pans under any valves or fittings where hoses or lines are routinely connected and disconnected, collect for reuse when possible; and
(c) Perform quick cleanup of leaks and spills in outdoor bulk storage or process areas.
3. Must sweep or vacuum dry production areas prior to rinsing with water.
4. Must clean interiors of dry formulation equipment with dry carrier prior to any water rinse. The carrier material must be stored and reused in future formulation of the same or compatible product or properly disposed of as solid waste.
5. If operating continuous overflow Department of Transportation (DOT) aerosol leak test baths—
Must operate with some recirculation.
6. If operating air pollution control wet scrubbers—
Must operate as recirculating scrubbers (periodic blowdown is allowed as needed).
[Modification allowed when: Facility demonstrates that they would not be able to meet Resource Conservation Recovery Act or Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements.]
7. When performing rinsing of raw material drums, storage drums, and/or shipping containers that contained liquid PAI(s) and/or inert ingredients for the formulation of water-based products—
Must reuse the drum/shipping container rinsate DIRECTLY into the formulation at the time of formulation; or store for use in future formulation of same or compatible product; or use a staged drum rinsing station (counter current rinsing).
[Modification allowed when: the drum/shipping container holds inert ingredient(s) only and (1) the facility can demonstrate that, after using water conservation practices, the large concentration of inert ingredient in the formulation creates more volume than could feasibly be reused; or (2) the facility can demonstrate that the concentration of the inert in the formulation is so small that the reuse would cause a formulation to exceed the ranges allowed in the Confidential Statement of Formula (CSF) (40 CFR 158.155).]
8. When performing rinsing of raw material drums, storage drums, and/or shipping containers that contained liquid PAI(s) and/or inert ingredients for the formulation of solvent-based products—
Must reuse the drum/shipping container rinsate DIRECTLY into the formulation at the time of formulation or store for use in future formulation of same or compatible product.
[Modification allowed when:
(a) The drum/shipping container holds inert ingredient(s) only and: (1) The facility can demonstrate that, after using water conservation practices, the large concentration of inert ingredient in the formulation creates more volume than could feasibly be reused; or (2) the facility can demonstrate that the concentration of the inert in the formulation is so small that the reuse would cause a formulation to exceed the ranges allowed in the Confidential Statement of Formula (CSF) (40 CFR 158.155);
or
(b) Drums/shipping containers are going to a drum refurbisher/recycler who will only accept drums rinsed with water.]
9. Must dedicate PFPR production equipment by water-based versus solvent-based products. Dedicated solvent-based or water-based equipment may be used on a non-routine basis for non-dedicated operations; however the facility may not discharge the solvent/aqueous changeover rinsate as part of their P2 allowable discharge (
i.e.
, the facility must achieve zero discharge of those process wastewater pollutants).
[Modification allowed when: Facility has installed and is using a solvent recovery system for the changeover rinsate (can also be used for other solvent recovery).]
10. Must store the rinsate from interior rinsing (does not include drum/shipping container rinsate) for reuse in future formulation of same or compatible product.
[Modification allowed when:
(a) Facility has evidence of biological growth or other product deterioration over a typical storage period;
(b) Facility has space limitations, BUT must still store rinsates for most frequently produced products;
(c) Manufacturer (or formulator contracting for toll formulating) has directed otherwise (
i.e.
, send back to them or send for off-site disposal);
(d) Facility is dropping registration or production of the formulation and there is no compatible formulation for reuse of the rinsates or facility can provide reasonable explanation of why it does not anticipate formulation of same or compatible formulation within the next 12 months;
(e) Facility only performs packaging of the pesticide product from which interior rinsate is generated; or
(f) Facility has demonstrated that it must use a detergent to clean the equipment.]

# Notes
For indirect dischargers:
After following the practices above, some wastewaters may require pretreatment prior to discharge to POTWs. See definition of pollution prevention allowable discharge for indirect dischargers (§ 455.41(d)).
For direct dischargers:
After following the practices above, all wastewaters require treatment prior to discharge directly to the nation's waters. See definition of pollution prevention allowable discharge for direct dischargers (§ 455.41(e)).
Additional information and guidance
on implementing these P2 practices as well as evaluating compliance with these practices will be available in a P2 Guidance Manual for the PFPR Industry.

Pt. 455, Table 10

# Table 10 to Part 455—List of Appropriate Pollution Control Technologies
This table contains those pollutant control technologies, such as hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, precipitation and activated carbon adsorption, which have been used for estimating compliance costs on a PAI specific basis. In general, these treatment technologies have been determined to be effective in treating pesticide containing wastewaters in literature, in bench or pilot scale treatability studies or in the Pesticide Manufacturing effluent guidelines. These are the same technologies that are presented as part of the Universal Treatment System. However, these technologies are PAI specific and may need to be used in conjunction with one another to provide treatment for all PAIs used at a facility over a period of time. In addition, facilities may experience difficulties treating wastewaters that contain emulsions, therefore, “appropriate” treatment for emulsified wastewaters must include an emulsion breaking step. For PAIs whose technology is listed as “Pollution Prevention”, the permitting authority/control authority can determine if additional treatment is necessary through best professional judgement/best engineering judgement, respectively.

The 272 Pesticide Active Ingredients (PAIs) are listed first, by PAI code, followed by the non-272 PAIs from the 1988 FIFRA and TSCA Enforcement System (FATES) Database, which are listed in Shaughnessy code order. PAIs that were exempted or reserved from the PFPR effluent guidelines are not listed in the table.
2
The non-272 PAI names are taken directly from the 1988 FATES database. Several of the PAI names are truncated because the PAI names listed in the FATES database are limited to 60 characters.
3
The non-272 PAIs do not have PAI codes.
4
All Shaughnessy codes are taken from the 1988 FATES database. Some of the 272 PAIs are not listed in the 1988 FATES database; therefore, no Shaughnessy codes are listed for these PAIs.
5
Structural groups are based on an analysis of the chemical structures of each PAI.
6
EPA has also received data indicating that acid hydrolysis may also be effective in treating this PAI.
* This PAI code represents a category or group of PAIs; therefore, it has multiple Shaughnessy codes.

§ 459.10
Applicability; description of the photographic processing subcategory.
The provisions of this subpart are applicable to point source discharges resulting from the development or printing of paper prints, slides, negatives, enlargements, movie film, and other sensitized materials except that facilities processing 150 sq. meters (1600 sq. feet) per day or less are not covered. Both commercial and military facilities are covered by this subpart.
§ 459.11
Specialized definitions.
For the purpose of this subpart:
(a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in part 401 of this chapter shall apply to this subpart.
(b) The term “product” shall mean articles developed or printed by photographic processes, such as paper prints, slides, negatives, enlargements, movie film and other sensitized materials.
§ 459.12
Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
In establishing the limitations set forth in this section, EPA took into account all information it was able to collect, develop and solicit with respect to factors (such as age and size of plant, raw materials, manufacturing processes, products produced, treatment technology available energy requirements and costs) which can affect the industry subcategorization and effluent levels established. It is, however, possible that data which would affect these limitations have not been available and, as a result, these limitations should be adjusted for certain plants in this industry. An individual discharger or other interested person may submit evidence to the Regional Administrator (or to the State, if the State has the authority to issue NPDES permits) that factors relating to the equipment of facilities involved, the process applied, or other such factors related to such discharger are fundamentally different from the factors considered in the establishment of the guidelines. On the basis of such evidence or other available information, the Regional Administrator (or the State) will make a written finding that such factors are or are not fundamentally different for that facility compared to those specified in the Development Document. If such fundamentally different factors are found to exist, the Regional Administrator or the State shall establish for the discharger effluent limitations in the NPDES permit either more or less stringent than the limitations established herein, to the extent dictated by such fundamentally different factors. Such limitations must be approved by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Administrator may approve or disapprove such limitations, specify other limitations, or initiate proceedings to revise these regulations.
(a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this paragraph, which may be discharged from a photographic processing point source subject to the provisions of this paragraph after application of the best practicable control technology currently available:

# General Provisions
§ 463.1
Applicability.
(a) This part applies to any plastics molding and forming process that discharges or may discharge pollutants to waters of the United States or that introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works. Plastics molding and forming processes include processes that blend, mold, form, or otherwise process plastic materials into intermediate or final plastic products. They include commonly recognized processes such as extrusion, molding, coating and laminating, thermoforming, calendering, casting, foaming, cleaning, and finishing.
(b) Plastics molding and forming processes (e.g., extrusion and pelletizing) used by plastics resin manufacturers to process crude intermediate plastic material for shipment off-site are excluded from this regulation and regulated under the organic chemicals, plastics, and synthetic fibers category. Plastics molding and forming processes used by plastic resin manufacturers to process crude intermediate plastic materials, which are further processed on-site into intermediate or final plastics products in molding and forming processes, are controlled by the effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the plastics molding and forming category in this part.
(c) Processes that coat a plastic material onto a substrate may fall within the definition of electroplating and metal finishing as defined in 40 CFR parts 413 and 433. These coating processes are excluded from the effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the electroplating and metal finishing point source categories and are subject to the plastics molding and forming regulation in this part.
(d) Coating of plastic material onto a formed metal substrate is also covered by the plastics molding and forming effluent limitations guidelines and standards and is not covered by the specific metal forming guidelines such as aluminum forming (40 CFR part 467), copper forming (40 CFR part 468), and nonferrous metals forming (40 CFR part 471). However, the plastics molding and forming effluent limitations guidelines and standards in this part apply only to the coating process; the metal forming operations are subject to the specific metal forming regulation.
(e) Research and development laboratories that produce plastic products using a plastics molding and forming process are subject to the effluent limitations guidelines and standards in this part if the plastics molding and forming process discharges process water. The mass of plastic product produced in the plastics molding and forming process is not considered when determining the applicability of the plastics molding and forming regulation in this part to plastics molding and forming processes at research and development laboratories.
(f) Chemical and thermal reticulation processes for polyurethane foam are not subject to the effluent limitations guidelines and standards in this part. Water used in those processes is not considered to be process water as defined in this regulation. Processes used to further mold or form the reticulated foam are subject, however, to this regulation if they discharge process water.
(g) Processes used to regenerate cellulose and to produce a product (e.g., rayon) from the regenerated cellulose are not subject to the effluent limitations guidelines and standards in this part. Processes that mold or form cellulose derivatives (e.g., cellulose acetate) are subject to the effluent limitations guidelines and standards in this part if they discharge process water.
[49 FR 49047, Dec. 17, 1984; 50 FR 18249, Apr. 30, 1985]
§ 463.2
General definitions.
In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401, the following definitions apply to this part:
(a) “Plastics molding and forming” is a manufacturing process in which plastic materials are blended, molded, formed, or otherwise processed into intermediate or final products.
(b) “Process water” is any raw, service, recycled, or reused water that contacts the plastic product or contacts shaping equipment surfaces such as molds and mandrels that are, or have been, in contact with the plastic product.
(c) “Contact cooling and heating water” is process water that contacts the raw materials or plastic product for the purpose of heat transfer during the plastics molding and forming process.
(d) “Cleaning water” is process water used to clean the surface of an intermediate or final plastic product or to clean the surfaces of equipment used in plastics molding and forming that contact an intermediate or final plastic product. It includes water used in both the detergent wash and rinse cycles of a cleaning process.
(e) “Finishing” water is processed water used to remove waste plastic material generated during a finishing process or to lubricate a plastic product during a finishing process. It includes water used to machine or to assemble intermediate or final plastic products.
(f) “Plastic material” is a synthetic organic polymer (
i.e.
, a thermoset polymer, a thermoplastic polymer, or a combination of a natural polymer and a thermoset or thermoplastic polymer) that is solid in its final form and that was shaped by flow. The material can be either a homogeneous polymer or a polymer combined with fillers, plasticizers, pigments, stabilizers, or other additives.
(g) “Crude intermediate plastic material” is plastic material formulated in an on-site polymerization process.
(h) “Mass of pollutant that can be discharged” is the pollutant mass calculated by multiplying the pollutant concentration times the average process water usage flow rate.
§ 463.3
Monitoring and reporting requirements.
The “monthly average” regulatory values shall be the basis for the monthly average effluent limitations guidelines and standards in direct discharge permits. Compliance with the monthly average effluent limitations guidelines and standards is required regardless of the number of samples analyzed and averaged.

# Subpart A—Contact Cooling and Heating Water Subcategory
§ 463.10
Applicability; description of the contact cooling and heating water subcategory.
This subpart applies to discharges of pollutants from processes in the contact cooling and heating water subcategory to waters of the United States and the introduction of such pollutants into publicly owned treatment works. Processes in the contact cooling and heating water subcategory are processes where process water comes in contact with plastic materials or plastic products for the purpose of heat transfer during plastics molding and forming.
§ 463.11
Specialized definitions.
For the purpose of this subpart:
(a) The “average process water usage flow rate” of a contact cooling and heating water process in liters per day is equal to the volume of process water (liters) used per year by a process divided by the number of days per year the process operates. The “average process water usage flow rate” for a plant with more than one plastics molding and forming process that uses contact cooling and heating water is the sum of the “average process water usage flow rates” for the contact cooling and heating processes.
(b) The “volume of process water used per year” is the volume of process water that flows through a contact cooling and heating water process and comes in contact with the plastic product over a period of one year.
§ 463.12
Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the effluent limitations guidelines (
i.e.
, mass of pollutant discharged) representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available, which are calculated by multiplying the average process water usage flow rate for the contact cooling and heating water processes at a point source times the following pollutant concentrations:

# Subpart B—Cleaning Water Subcategory
§ 463.20
Applicability; description of the cleaning water subcategory.
This subpart applies to discharges of pollutants from processes in the cleaning water subcategory to waters of the United States and the introduction of such pollutants into publicly owned treatment works. Processes in the cleaning water subcategory are processes where water comes in contact with the plastic product for the purpose of cleaning the surface of the product and where water comes in contact with shaping equipment, such as molds and mandrels, that contact the plastic material for the purpose of cleaning the equipment surfaces.
§ 463.21
Specialized definitions.
For the purpose of this subpart:
(a) The “average process water usage flow rate” of a cleaning water process in liters per day is equal to the volume of process water (liters) used per year by a process divided by the number of days per year the process operates. The “average process water usage flow rate” for a plant with more than one plastics molding and forming process that uses cleaning water is the sum of
the “average process water usage flow rates” for the cleaning processes.
(b) The “volume of process water used per year” is the volume of process water that flows through a cleaning process and comes in contact with the plastic product over a period of one year.
§ 463.22
Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the effluent limitations guidelines (
i.e.

# General Provisions
§ 464.01
Applicability.
(a) This part applies to metal molding and casting facilities that discharge or may discharge pollutants to waters of the United States or that introduce pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works.
§ 464.02
General definitions.
In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401, the following definitions apply to this part:
(a)
Aluminum casting.
The remelting of aluminum or an aluminum alloy to form a cast intermediate or final product by pouring or forcing the molten metal into a mold, except for ingots, pigs, or other cast shapes related to nonferrous (primary and secondary) metals manufacturing (40 CFR part 421) and aluminum forming (40 CFR part 467). Processing operations following the cooling of castings not covered under aluminum forming, except for grinding scrubber operations which are covered here, are covered under the electroplating and metal finishing point source categories (40 CFR parts 413 and 433).
(b)
Copper casting.
The remelting of copper or a copper alloy to form a cast intermediate or final product by pouring or forcing the molten metal into a mold, except for ingots, pigs, or other cast shapes related to nonferrous (primary and secondary) metals manufacturing (40 CFR part 421). Also excluded are casting of beryllium alloys in which beryllium is present at 0.1 or greater percent by weight and precious metals alloys in which the precious metal is present at 30 or greater percent by weight. Except for grinding scrubber operations which are covered here, processing operations following the cooling of castings are covered under the electroplating and metal finishing point source categories (40 CFR parts 413 and 433).
(c)
Ferrous casting.
The remelting of ferrous metals to form a cast intermediate or finished product by pouring the molten metal into a mold. Except for grinding scrubber operations which are covered here, processing operations following the cooling of castings are covered under the electroplating and metal finishing point source categories (40 CFR parts 413 and 433).
(d)
Zinc casting.
The remelting of zinc or zinc alloy to form a cast intermediate or final product by pouring or forcing the molten metal into a mold, except for ingots, pigs, or other cast shapes related to nonferrous (primary) metals manufacturing (40 CFR part 421) and nonferrous metals forming (40 CFR part 471). Processing operations following the cooling of castings not covered under nonferrous metals forming are covered under the electroplating
and metal finishing point source categories (40 CFR parts 413 and 433).
(e)
POTW
shall mean “publicly owned treatment works.”
(f) A
non-continuous discharger
is a plant which does not discharge pollutants during specific periods of time for reasons other than treatment plant upset, such periods being at least 24 hours in duration. A typical example of a non-continuous discharger is a plant where wastewaters are routinely stored for periods in excess of 24 hours to be treated on a batch basis. For non-continuous discharging direct discharging plants, NPDES permit authorities shall apply the mass-based annual average effluent limitations or standards and the concentration-based maximum day and maximum for monthly average effluent limitations or standards established in the regulations. POTWs may elect to establish concentration-based standards for non-continuous discharges to POTWs. They may do so by establishing concentration-based pretreatment standards equivalent to the mass-based standards provided in §§ 464.15, 464.16, 464.25, 464.26, 464.35, 464.36, 464.45, and 464.46 of the regulations. Equivalent concentration standards may be established by following the procedures outlined in § 464.03(b).
(g)
Total phenols
shall mean total phenolic compounds as measured by the procedure listed in 40 CFR part 136 (distillation followed by colorimetric—4AAP).
(h)
Sm
3
shall mean standard cubic meters.
(i)
SCF
shall means standard cubic feet.
(j)
Total toxic organics
(TTO) shall mean the sum of the mass of each of the toxic organic compounds which are found at a concentration greater than 0.010 mg/l. The specialized definitions for each subpart contain a discrete list of toxic organic compounds comprising TTO for each process segment in which TTO is regulated.
§ 464.03
Monitoring and reporting requirements.
(a) As an alternative to monitoring for TTO (total toxic organics), an indirect discharging plant may elect to monitor for Oil and Grease instead. Compliance with the Oil and Grease standard shall be considered equivalent to complying with the TTO standard. Alternate Oil and Grease standards are provided as substitutes for the TTO standards provided in §§ 464.15, 464.16, 464.25, 464.26, 464.35, 464.36, 464.45, and 464.46.
(b) POTWs may establish concentration standards rather than mass standards, but must ensure that the concentration standards are exactly equivalent to the mass-based standards provided in §§ 464.15, 464.16, 464.25, 464.26, 464.35, 464.36, 464.45, and 464.46. Equivalent concentration standards may be determined by multiplying the mass-based standards included in the regulations by an appropriate measurement of average production, raw material usage, or air scrubber flow (kkg of metal poured, kkg of sand reclaimed, or standard cubic meters of air scrubbed) and dividing by an appropriate measure of average discharge flow to the POTW, taking into account the proper conversion factors to ensure that the units (mg/l) are correct.
(c) The “monthly average” regulatory values shall be the basis for the monthly average effluent limitations guidelines and standards in direct discharge permits and for pretreatment standards. Compliance with the monthly average effluent limitations guidelines and standards is required regardless of the number of samples analyzed and averaged.
§ 464.04
Compliance date for PSES.
The compliance date of PSES is October 31, 1988.

Cast Iron.
An iron containing carbon in excess of the solubility in the austentite that exists in the alloy at the eutectic temperature. Cast iron also is defined here to include any iron-carbon alloys containing 1.2 percent or more carbon by weight.
(c)
Ductile Iron.
A cast iron that has been treated while molten with a master alloy containing an element such as magnesium or cerium to induce the formation of free graphite as nodules or spherules, which imparts a measurable degree of ductility to the cast metal.
(d)
Gray Iron.
A cast iron that gives a gray fracture due to the presence of flake graphite.
(e)
Malleable Iron.
A cast iron made by a prolonged anneal of white cast iron in which decarburization or graphitization, or both, take place to eliminate some or all of the cementite. Graphite is present in the form of temper carbon.
(f)
Steel.
An iron-base alloy containing carbon, manganese, and often other alloying elements. Steel is defined here to include only those iron-carbon alloys containing less than 1.2 percent carbon by weight.
(g) The “primary metal cast” shall mean the metal that is poured in the greatest quantity at an individual plant.
(h)
Multiple Ferrous Melting Furnace Scrubber Configuration.
A multiple ferrous melting furnace scrubber configuration is a configuration where two or more discrete wet scrubbing devices are employed in series in a single melting furnace exhaust gas stream. The ferrous melting furnace scrubber mass allowance shall be given to each discrete wet scrubbing device that has an associated wastewater discharge in a multiple ferrous melting furnace scrubber configuration. The mass allowance for each discrete wet scrubber shall be identical and based on the air flow of the exhaust gas stream that passes through the multiple scrubber configuration.
(i)
Discrete Wet Scrubbing Device.
A discrete wet scrubbing device is a distinct, stand-alone device that removes particulates and fumes from a contaminated gas stream by bringing the gas stream into contact with a scrubber liquor, usually water, and from which there is a wastewater discharge. Examples of discrete wet scrubbing devices are: Spray towers and chambers, venturi scrubbers (fixed and variable), wet caps, packed bed scrubbers, quenchers, and orifice scrubbers. Semi-wet scrubbing devices where water is added and totally evaporates prior to dry air pollution control are not considered to be discrete wet scrubbing devices. Ancillary scrubber operations such as fan washes and backwashes are not considered to be discrete wet scrubber devices. These ancillary operations are covered by the mass limitations of the associated scrubber. Aftercoolers are not considered to be discrete wet scrubbing devices, and water discharges from aftercooling are not regulated as a process wastewater in this category.
§ 464.32
Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available, except that non-continuous dischargers shall not be subject to the maximum day and maximum for monthly average mass (kg/1,000 kkg or lb/million lb of metal poured; kg/1,000 kkg or lb/million lb of sand reclaimed; kg/62.3 million Sm
3
or lb/billion SCF of air scrubbed) effluent limitations for copper, lead, zinc, total phenols, oil and grease, and TSS. For non-continuous dischargers,
annual average mass limitations and maximum day and maximum for monthly average concentration (mg/l) limitations shall apply. Concentration limitations and annual average mass limitations shall only apply to non-continuous dischargers.

# General Provisions
§ 466.01
Applicability.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the provisions of this part apply to any porcelain enameling facility which discharges pollutants to waters of the United States or introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works.
(b) Any existing porcelain enameling facility which prepares or coats less than 1600 m
2
/day and which introduces less than 60,000 1/day of wastewater
into a publicly owned treatment works is not controlled by the pretreatment standards for existing sources established by this regulation. Such facilities must comply with the provisions of 40 CFR part 403.
(c) This part does not apply to the porcelain enameling on precious metal basis material.
(d) When wastewaters from coating cast iron are cotreated with wastewaters from coating steel, the limitations for coating steel contained in § 466.11 may be applied to the entire wastestream.
[47 FR 53184, Nov. 24, 1982, as amended at 50 FR 36543, Sept. 6, 1985]
§ 466.02
General definitions.
In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401, the following definitions apply to this part:
(a) “Porcelain enameling” means the entire process of applying a fused vitreous enamel coating to a metal basis material. Usually this includes metal preparation and coating operations.
(b) “Basis material” means the metal part or base onto which procelain enamel is applied.
(c) “Area processed” means the total basis material area exposed to processing solutions.
(d) “Area coated” means the area of basis material covered by each coating of enamel.
(e) “Coating operations” means all of the operations associated with preparation and application of the vitreous coating. Usually this includes ballmilling, slip transport, application of slip to the workpieces, cleaning and recovery of faulty parts, and firing (fusing) of the enamel coat.
(f) “Metal preparation” means any and all of the metal processing steps preparatory to applying the enamel slip. Usually this includes cleaning, pickling and applying a nickel flash or chemical coating.
(g) The term “control authority” is defined as the POTW if it has an approved pretreatment program; in the absence of such a program, the NPDES state if it has an approved pretreatment program or EPA if the State does not have an approved program.
(h) The term “precious metal” means gold, silver, or platinum group metals and the principal alloys of those metals.
§ 466.03
Monitoring and reporting requirements.
(a) Periodic analyses for chromium as may be required under part 122 or 403 of this chapter is not required when both of the following conditions are met.
(1) The first wastewater sample of each calendar year has been analyzed and found to contain less than 0.08 mg/l chromium.
(2) The owner or operator of the porcelain enameling facility certifies in writing to the control authority or permit issuing authority that chromium is not contained in the raw materials or process chemicals of that facility and will not be used in the facility.
(b) The “monthly average” regulatory values shall be the basis for the monthly average discharge in direct discharge permits and for pretreatment standards. Compliance with the monthly discharge limit is required regardless of the number of samples analyzed and averaged.
