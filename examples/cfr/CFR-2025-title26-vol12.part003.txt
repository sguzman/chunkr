Under DC's eligible pretransition method, DC's basis in assets distributed from Branch is equal to the portion of the capital basis pool attributable to the distribution. If Branch transferred the land with a basis of €100 to DC on December 31, year 3, its remaining capital basis pool of $100 would be attributable to the distribution, and the land would have a basis of $100 in the hands of DC. Because the land had a basis of €100 in the hands of Branch, and would have a basis of $100 in the hands of DC if it were distributed on December 31, year 3, the pretransition translation rate is €1 = $1. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, because a current rate election is in effect for year 4, the transition exchange rate is the spot rate applicable to December 31, year 3. The €100 basis of Branch's land, translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 3 of €1 = $1.40 is equal to $140. The €100 basis of Branch's land, translated at the pretransition translation rate on December 31, year 3 of €1 = $1 is equal to $100. Therefore, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is equal to $40 ($140−$100).
(C)
Determination of unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4.
For purposes of determining unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4 under § 1.987-4(d), the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is determined by translating the €100 basis of the land at the transition exchange rate, which is the spot rate on December 31, year 3 (€1 = $1.40). Therefore, the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is $140.
(iii)
Alternative facts
—(A)
No current rate election.
Assume the facts are the same as described in paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section (
Example 2
), except that a current rate election is not in effect for year 4.
(B)
Analysis.
As explained in paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 2
), DC determines its pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Because a current rate election is not in effect, the transition exchange rate is determined under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.
(
1
)
Transition exchange rate.
DC applied an earnings only method described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section before the transition date. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, because a current rate election is not in effect for year 4, the transition exchange rate for Branch's land is equal to the pretransition translation rate. As explained in paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section (
Example 2
), the pretransition translation rate is €1 = $1.
(
2
)
Pretransition gain or loss.
Because the transition exchange rate for the land (Branch's sole asset) is equal to the pretransition translation rate, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is zero. As explained in paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), the deemed termination amount is also zero. Therefore, DC has no pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch.
(
3
)
Determination of unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4.
For purposes of determining unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4 under § 1.987-4(d), the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is determined by translating the €100 basis of the land at the transition exchange rate, which is the pretransition translation rate of €1 = $1. Therefore, the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is $100.
(3)
Example 3: Earnings only method described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section
—(i)
Facts
—(A)
In general.
The facts and exchange rates are the same as in paragraph (l)(1) of this section (
Example 1
), except that DC used an earnings only method with respect to Branch before the transition date, as described in paragraph (l)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
(B)
Pretransition method.
Under the earnings only method, DC maintains an equity pool in euros (Branch's functional currency) and a basis pool in U.S. dollars (DC's functional currency) with respect to Branch's earnings. However, DC does not maintain separate equity and basis pools with respect to Branch's capital. Distributions are treated as being made first out of earnings and then out of capital. When Branch makes a remittance out of earnings, DC recognizes section 987
gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of the remittance (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of the remittance) and the portion of the earnings basis pool attributable to the remittance. No section 987 gain or loss is recognized on a distribution out of capital. Under DC's pretransition method, DC's basis in assets distributed by Branch (whether out of earnings or capital) is equal to Branch's basis in the assets translated at the spot rate on the date of the distribution. Branch's earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the taxable year. DC first applied its earnings only method on a return filed before November 9, 2023. In addition, DC applied its earnings only method consistently to all of its section 987 QBUs and otherwise applied section 987 in a reasonable manner.
(C)
Application of the pretransition method before the transition date.
On June 30, year 3, Branch distributed €100 cash to DC. Of this amount, €50 represented a remittance out of earnings, and €50 represented a distribution out of capital.
(
1
)
Remittance out of earnings.
For purposes of determining section 987 gain or loss recognized on the remittance, Branch's earnings equity pool was equal to €50, and its earnings basis pool was equal to $60, as shown in the table below. Because Branch remitted 100% of the earnings equity pool (€50), the entire earnings basis pool, or $60, was attributable to the remittance. The value of the remittance was $67.50 (€50 translated at the spot rate on June 30, year 3, of €1 = $1.35). Therefore, in year 3, DC recognized section 987 gain of $7.50, equal to the difference between the value of the remittance ($67.50) and the portion of the basis pool attributable to the remittance ($60). As a result of the remittance, the earnings equity pool and the earnings basis pool were each reduced to zero.

In the hands of DC, the €100 distributed had a basis of $135 (€100 translated at the spot rate on June 30, year 3, of €1 = $1.35). DC did not recognize gain or loss under section 988 when it exchanged the €100 for $135.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
DC's method is an eligible pretransition method.
Unlike in paragraph (l)(2) of this section (
Example 2
), DC's earnings only method would not result in the same total amount of income over the life of DC as an earnings and capital method described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section because DC does not maintain capital basis and equity pools and DC translates the basis of all property distributed from Branch at the spot rate on the distribution date. However, this method is an eligible pretransition method under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section because DC first applied its earnings only method on a return filed before November 9, 2023, DC applied its earnings only method consistently to all of its section 987 QBUs, and DC otherwise applied section 987 in a reasonable manner. Consequently, DC determines its pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(B)
Pretransition gain or loss.
Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, DC's pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch is equal to the sum of the deemed termination amount described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section and the owner functional currency net value adjustment described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section. As explained in paragraphs (l)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section (
Example 3
), the deemed termination amount is zero and the owner functional currency net value adjustment is zero. Therefore, DC
has no pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch.
(
1
)
Deemed termination amount.
Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the deemed termination amount is the amount of section 987 gain or loss that would have been recognized by DC under the eligible pretransition method if Branch terminated and transferred all of its assets and liabilities to DC on December 31, year 3. Under DC's eligible pretransition method, if Branch had transferred all of its assets and liabilities to DC, it would have been treated as a distribution out of capital. Under its eligible pretransition method, DC would not have recognized section 987 gain or loss on a distribution out of capital. Therefore, the deemed termination amount is zero.
(
2
)
Owner functional currency net value adjustment.
On December 31, year 3, Branch has no liabilities and only one asset: land with a basis of €100. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is equal to the basis of the land, translated into U.S. dollars at the transition exchange rate, reduced by the basis of the land, translated into U.S. dollars at the pretransition translation rate. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the transition exchange rate is the spot rate applicable to December 31, year 3. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the pretransition translation rate is the rate that would be used under DC's eligible pretransition method to determine the basis of the land in the hands of DC if Branch transferred the land to DC on December 31, year 3. Under DC's eligible pretransition method, if Branch transferred the land to DC, DC's basis in the land would be equal to Branch's basis (€100) translated at the spot rate on the date of the distribution. Therefore, the pretransition translation rate on December 31, year 3, is equal to the spot rate on December 31, year 3. Consequently, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is zero.
(C)
Determination of unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4.
For purposes of determining unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4 under § 1.987-4(d), the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is determined by translating the €100 basis of the land at the spot rate on December 31, year 3 (€1 = $1.40). Therefore, the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is $140.
(4)
Example 4: Owner did not apply section 987(3)
—(i)
Facts.
The facts and exchange rates are the same as in paragraph (l)(1) of this section (
Example 1
), except that DC did not apply section 987(3) with respect to Branch and did not recognize section 987 gain or loss with respect to Branch before the transition date.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
DC's method is not an eligible pretransition method.
Because DC did not apply section 987(3) with respect to Branch before the transition date, DC did not apply an eligible pretransition method under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Therefore, DC determines pretransition gain or loss under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(B)
Pretransition gain or loss.
Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, DC's pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch is equal to the annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss with respect to Branch for all taxable years ending before the transition date in which DC was the owner of Branch (that is, years 1 through 3), reduced by section 987 gain or loss recognized by DC before the transition date. As explained in paragraphs (l)(4)(ii)(C) through (E) of this section (
Example 4
), DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 1 is $7.50, DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 2 is $16.25, and DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 3 is $23.75. DC did not recognize any section 987 gain or loss with respect to Branch before the transition date. Therefore, DC has $47.50 of pretransition gain with respect to Branch. Under paragraph (e)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the pretransition gain is treated as Branch's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain. However, if DC elects to recognize its pretransition gain ratably over the transition period under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the pretransition gain is not treated as net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain. Instead, DC recognizes $4.75 (one tenth of its pretransition gain) for each of the ten
taxable years from year 4 through year 13.
(C)
Annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss for year 1.
Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss with respect to a section 987 QBU is determined under the rules of § 1.987-4(d), applied as though a current rate election was in effect for all relevant taxable years (such that all items are treated as marked items), but modified so that only §§ 1.987-4(d)(1) (change in owner functional currency net value) and 1.987-4(d)(10) (adjustment for residual increase or decrease to net assets) are applied. As explained in paragraphs (l)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section (
Example 4
), in year 1, the change in owner functional currency net value under § 1.987-4(d)(1) is an increase of $165, and there is a negative adjustment of $157.50 under § 1.987-4(d)(10). Therefore, DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 1 is $7.50.
(
1
)
Change in owner functional currency net value for year 1.
On December 31, year 1, Branch held land with a basis of €100 and €50 cash. Therefore, on the last day of year 1, Branch's owner functional currency net value is $165 (150 euros translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 1, of €1 = $1.10). Because Branch was formed in year 1, its owner functional currency net value on the last day of the preceding taxable year is zero.
See
§ 1.987-4(d)(1)(iii). Therefore, the change in owner functional currency net value is an increase of $165.
(
2
)
Residual increase to net assets for year 1.
Under § 1.987-4(d)(10), unrecognized section 987 gain or loss for a taxable year is decreased by any residual increase to net assets (and increased by any residual decrease to net assets), translated into the owner's functional currency at the yearly average exchange rate for the taxable year. For this purpose, the residual increase (or decrease) to net assets is equal to the change in net value of the section 987 QBU, determined in the section 987 QBU's functional currency (that is, the QBU net value).
See
§ 1.987-4(d)(10)(ii)(B) and (e)(2)(ii). On December 31, year 1, Branch held land with a basis of €100 euros and €50 cash. Therefore, on the last day of year 1, Branch has a QBU net value of €150. Because Branch was formed in year 1, its QBU net value on the last day of the preceding taxable year is zero.
See
§ 1.987-4(d)(1)(iii). Therefore, the residual increase to net assets is €150. This results in a negative adjustment to annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of $157.50 for year 1 (equal to €150 translated at the yearly average exchange rate for year 1 of €1 = $1.05).
(D)
Annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss for year 2.
As explained in paragraphs (l)(4)(ii)(D)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section (
Example 4
), in year 2, the change in owner functional currency net value under § 1.987-4(d)(1) is an increase of $45, and there is a negative adjustment of $28.75 under § 1.987-4(d)(10). Therefore, DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 2 is $16.25.
(
1
)
Change in owner functional currency net value for year 2.
On December 31, year 2, Branch held land with a basis of €100 and €75 cash. Therefore, on the last day of year 2, Branch's owner functional currency net value is $210 (175 euros translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 2, of €1 = $1.20). As explained in paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section (
Example 4
), Branch's owner functional currency net value on the last day of year 1 was $165. Therefore, the change in owner functional currency net value is an increase of $45.
(
2
)
Residual increase to net assets for year 2.
On December 31, year 2, Branch held land with a basis of €100 and €75 cash. Therefore, on the last day of year 2, Branch has a QBU net value of €175. As explained in paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section (
Example 4
), Branch had a QBU net value of €150 on December 31, year 1. Therefore, the residual increase to net assets is €25. This results in a negative adjustment to annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of $28.75 for year 2 (equal to a reduction of €25, translated at the yearly average exchange rate for year 2 of €1 = $1.15).
(E)
Annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss for year 3.
As explained in paragraphs (l)(4)(ii)(E)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section (
Example 4
), in year 3, the change in owner functional currency net value under § 1.987-4(d)(1) is a decrease of $70, and there is a positive adjustment of $93.75 under § 1.987-4(d)(10).
Therefore, DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 3 is $23.75.
(
1
)
Change in owner functional currency net value for year 3.
On December 31, year 3, Branch held land with a basis of €100. Therefore, on the last day of year 3, Branch's owner functional currency net value is $140 (100 euros translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 3, of €1 = $1.40). As explained in paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section (
Example 4
), Branch's owner functional currency net value on the last day of year 2 was $210. Therefore, the change in owner functional currency net value is a decrease of $70.
(
2
)
Residual decrease to net assets for year 3.
On December 31, year 3, Branch held land with a basis of €100. Therefore, on the last day of year 3, Branch has a QBU net value of €100. As explained in paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(D)(
2
) of this section (
Example 4
), Branch had a QBU net value of €175 on December 31, year 2. Therefore, the residual decrease to net assets is €75. This results in a positive adjustment to annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of $93.75 for year 3 (equal to €75, translated at the yearly average exchange rate for year 3 of €1 = $1.25).
(F)
Determination of unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4.
For purposes of determining unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4 under § 1.987-4(d), the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is determined by translating the €100 basis of the land at the spot rate on December 31, year 3 (€1 = $1.40). Therefore, the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is $140.
(5)
Example 5: Error in application of method
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as described in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except that DC inadvertently miscalculated the amount of the June 30, year 3, remittance as being €90 rather than €100. This reduced the amount of section 987 gain recognized by DC in year 3.
(ii)
Analysis.
DC committed an error in its application of the earnings and capital method to Branch. Under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, DC is nonetheless treated as having applied an eligible pretransition method. However, under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, DC must determine its pretransition gain or loss as though the error had not been made. Therefore, DC computes its pretransition gain or loss as described in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (
Example 1
). DC has $35 of pretransition gain with respect to Branch.
(6)
Example 6: Consistent practice not treated as an error
—(i)
Facts.
Before the transition date, DC used the earnings and capital method described in the 1991 proposed regulations under section 987 with respect to Branch, as described in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1
). In years 1, 2, and 3, Branch made recurring purchases of inventory from Owner, which Branch sold to unrelated customers. In connection with the purchase transactions, Branch transferred cash to Owner, and Owner transferred inventory to Branch. Owner did not take these transfers into account in determining the amount of any remittance and, accordingly, did not recognize section 987 gain or loss with respect to these transfers. However, Owner consistently adjusted Branch's equity and basis pools in a reasonable manner to reflect all transfers between Owner and Branch; for this purpose, the amount of each transfer made in connection with the purchase transactions was translated using the average rate for the relevant taxable year. Owner also adjusted Branch's equity and basis pools to account for Branch's income from the sale of inventory.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
DC's method is an eligible pretransition method.
Before the transition date, DC followed the earnings and capital method described in the 1991 proposed regulations under section 987 with respect to Branch. This method is an eligible pretransition method under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. Therefore, DC determines its pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(B)
Effect of consistent practice.
Before the transition date, Owner engaged in a consistent practice under which Owner did not account for inventory purchase transactions in determining the amount of a remittance requiring the
recognition of gain or loss under section 987(3). However, Owner consistently accounted for the disregarded transfers in a reasonable manner for purposes of computing its equity and basis pools. Under paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section, this consistent practice is not treated as an error in the application of a pretransition method and does not preclude Owner's method from being treated as an eligible pretransition method. Therefore, Owner must take this consistent practice into account in determining pretransition gain or loss under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. In particular, Owner must use the equity and basis pools computed under its consistent practice (rather than the equity and basis pools it would have computed if it had historically taken the disregarded transfers into account in determining the amount of remittances) to determine the deemed termination amount under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section.

§ 1.987-11
Suspended section 987 loss relating to certain elections; loss-to-the-extent-of-gain rule.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules relating to suspended section 987 loss. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for computing the cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to a section 987 QBU or successor suspended loss QBU. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules that suspend section 987 loss that would otherwise be recognized when a current rate election is in effect. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules that treat net unrecognized section 987 loss and deferred section 987 loss as suspended section 987 loss when an annual recognition election is made or a current rate election is revoked. Paragraph (e) of this section describes the extent to which suspended section 987 loss is recognized under a loss-to-the-extent-of-gain rule. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining recognition groupings based on the source and character of section 987 gain or loss. Paragraph (g) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of this section.
(b)
Cumulative suspended section 987 loss in a recognition grouping
—(1)
In general.
The cumulative suspended section 987 loss in a recognition grouping with respect to a section 987 QBU or a successor suspended loss QBU for the current taxable year is equal to the cumulative suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping for the prior taxable year, decreased by the amount of suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping that was recognized with respect to the QBU under paragraph (e) of this section or under § 1.987-13(b) through (d) in the prior taxable year, and increased by the amount that becomes suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping with respect to the QBU in the current taxable year (including under § 1.987-10(e)(5)(i)(B)(
1
)). If the taxable year is the first taxable year of the section 987 QBU (or the first taxable year in which the section 987 regulations apply), the cumulative suspended section 987 loss for the prior taxable year is zero. An owner's (or original suspended loss QBU owner's) total cumulative suspended section 987 loss in a recognition grouping is equal to the sum of its cumulative suspended section 987 gain or loss with respect to each section 987 QBU and successor suspended loss QBU.
(2)
Combined QBU.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in the taxable year of a combination, the cumulative suspended section 987 loss in a recognition grouping with respect to a combined QBU for the prior taxable year is equal to the sum of the cumulative suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping with respect to each combining QBU for the prior taxable year; the suspended section 987 loss in a recognition grouping with respect to a combined QBU that was recognized in the prior taxable year is equal to sum of the suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping with respect to each combining QBU that was recognized in the prior taxable year.
(3)
Separated QBU.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in the taxable year of a separation, the cumulative suspended section 987 loss in a recognition grouping with respect to a separated QBU for the prior taxable
year is equal to the cumulative suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping with respect to the separating QBU for the prior taxable year multiplied by the separation fraction; the suspended section 987 loss in a recognition grouping with respect to a separated QBU that was recognized in the prior taxable year is equal to the suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping with respect to the separating QBU that was recognized in the prior taxable year multiplied by the separation fraction.
(c)
Suspension of section 987 loss for taxable years in which a current rate election is in effect and an annual recognition election is not in effect
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, in a taxable year in which a current rate election is in effect and an annual recognition election is not in effect, to the extent that an owner's net unrecognized section 987 loss with respect to a section 987 QBU would otherwise be recognized under § 1.987-5 (including pursuant to § 1.987-12(b)), or its deferred section 987 loss would otherwise be recognized under § 1.987-12(c), the net unrecognized section 987 loss or deferred section 987 loss is not recognized by the owner and instead becomes suspended section 987 loss.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section (
Example 1
) for an illustration of this rule.
(2)
De minimis rule.
Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply in a taxable year of an owner in which the total amount of net unrecognized section 987 loss or deferred section 987 loss of the owner and all members of the owner's controlled group that would (but for the application of this paragraph (c)(2) and § 1.987-7(d)(2)(iii)) become suspended section 987 loss under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or § 1.987-7(d) does not exceed the lesser of—
(i) $3 million; or
(ii) Two percent of the total amount of gross income of the owner and all members of the owner's controlled group for the taxable year.
(3)
Taxable year of controlled group members
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to an owner, suspended section 987 loss and gross income of a member of the owner's controlled group is determined by reference to the member's suspended section 987 loss and gross income for its taxable year ending with or within the owner's taxable year.
(ii)
Owner is a CFC.
For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to an owner that is a CFC, suspended section 987 loss and gross income of a member of the owner's controlled group is determined by reference to the member's suspended section 987 loss and gross income for its taxable year ending with or within the owner's required year described in section 898(c)(1), without regard to section 898(c)(2).
(d)
Suspension of net unrecognized section 987 loss upon making or revoking certain elections
—(1)
Making an annual recognition election.
At the beginning of the first taxable year for which an annual recognition election is in effect, an owner's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 loss and deferred section 987 loss are converted into suspended section 987 loss if either—
(i) A current rate election was in effect for the immediately preceding taxable year; or
(ii) A current rate election was not in effect for the immediately preceding taxable year and, as of the beginning of the taxable year, the sum of the owner's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 loss and deferred section 987 loss exceeds the sum of the owner's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain and deferred section 987 gain by more than $5 million.

Revoking a current rate election.
At the beginning of the first taxable year in which a current rate election ceases to be in effect, an owner's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 loss and deferred section 987 loss are converted into suspended section 987 loss.
See
paragraph (g)(3) of this section (
Example 3
) for an illustration of this rule.
(e)
Loss-to-the-extent-of-gain rule
—(1)
In general.
An owner of a section 987 QBU (or an original suspended loss QBU owner) only recognizes suspended section 987 loss to the extent described in this paragraph (e) (the
loss-to-the-extent-of-gain rule
).
See
§ 1.987-13(b)
through (d) for rules requiring the recognition of additional suspended section 987 loss (after the application of the loss-to-the-extent-of-gain rule) in connection with certain transactions.
(2)
Separate determination for each recognition grouping.
The amount of suspended section 987 loss recognized is determined separately for the suspended section 987 loss in each recognition grouping. Because the recognition groupings generally are determined on the basis of the initial assignment of section 987 gain or loss under § 1.987-6(b)(2)(i), the loss-to-the-extent-of-gain rule generally is applied on the basis of the initial assignment of section 987 gain or loss.
(3)
Amount of suspended section 987 loss recognized.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5) or (6) of this section, the amount of suspended section 987 loss in each recognition grouping that an owner recognizes in a taxable year is equal to the sum (if positive) of the current year gain amount described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and the lookback gain amount described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, but may not exceed the owner's total cumulative suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping. If the sum of the current year gain amount and the lookback gain amount is negative, then the amount of suspended section 987 loss recognized under this paragraph (e) is zero.
See
paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section (
Examples 1
and
2
) for an illustration of this rule.
(i)
Current year gain amount.
The current year gain amount described in this paragraph (e)(3)(i) is equal to the section 987 gain in the recognition grouping that is recognized by the owner in the taxable year, reduced (including below zero) by section 987 loss (other than suspended section 987 loss) in the recognition grouping that is recognized by the owner in the taxable year.
(ii)
Lookback gain amount.
The lookback gain amount described in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) is equal to the section 987 gain in the recognition grouping that was recognized by the owner in the lookback period, reduced (including below zero) by section 987 loss (other than suspended section 987 loss described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section) in the recognition grouping that was recognized by the owner in the lookback period. The total amount of suspended section 987 loss recognized by reason of the recognition of an amount of section 987 gain cannot, in any event, exceed the amount of section 987 gain recognized.
(iii)
Suspended section 987 loss not taken into account
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of applying paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section in a taxable year (the
current taxable year
), suspended section 987 loss recognized during the lookback period is not taken into account if it was recognized under this paragraph (e) by reason of the recognition of section 987 gain that was recognized before the lookback period for the current taxable year.
(B)
Ordering rule.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii), suspended section 987 loss is treated as recognized by reason of the most recently recognized section 987 gain in the same recognition grouping.
See
paragraph (g)(2) of this section (
Example 2
) for an illustration of this rule.
(iv)
Lookback period
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, the lookback period with respect to a taxable year of an owner means the three preceding taxable years of the owner (or, if the owner was not in existence for three preceding taxable years, each taxable year in which the owner existed), but it does not include any taxable year beginning before the transition date described in § 1.987-10(c)(1).
(B)
Taxable years in which both a current rate election and an annual recognition election are in effect.
In a taxable year of an owner in which both a current rate election and an annual recognition election are in effect, the lookback period includes all prior taxable years of the owner in which both a current rate election and an annual recognition election were continuously in effect.
(v)
Anti-abuse rule.
If an owner recognizes section 987 gain with a principal purpose of reducing the Federal income tax liability of the owner (or its U.S. shareholders or partners, as applicable), including over multiple taxable years, the section 987 gain is disregarded for purposes of this paragraph (e)(3). For example, this paragraph
(e)(3)(v) may apply if an owner that is a CFC recognizes section 987 gain that is offset by a tax attribute of one of the CFC's U.S. shareholders that would not otherwise be used (such as excess foreign tax credits with respect to section 951A category income, or a tested loss). In determining whether a principal purpose described in this paragraph (e)(3)(v) exists, all relevant facts and circumstances are considered, including the extent to which the transaction giving rise to the recognition of section 987 gain resulted in a sustained economic contraction of the section 987 QBU over a period of at least twelve months.
(4)
Suspended section 987 loss recognized with respect to each section 987 QBU and suspended section 987 loss QBU.
The amount of suspended section 987 loss in a recognition grouping that is recognized by an owner in a taxable year is treated as attributable to each section 987 QBU or successor suspended loss QBU in proportion to the QBU's suspended section 987 loss in that recognition grouping.
(5) S
ection 381(a) transactions
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section (or to the extent that other limitations apply), if one corporation (acquiring corporation) acquires the assets of another corporation (transferor corporation) in a transaction described in section 381(a), section 987 gain or loss recognized by the transferor corporation during the lookback period is taken into account in determining the lookback gain amount of the acquiring corporation in taxable years ending after the transaction under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. If the lookback period for a taxable year of the acquiring corporation is determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, the lookback period includes each taxable year of the transferor corporation ending with or within the current taxable year of the acquiring corporation or during the acquiring corporation's lookback period. If the lookback period for a taxable year of the acquiring corporation is determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, the lookback period includes only taxable years of the transferor corporation in which both an annual recognition election and a current rate election were continuously in effect before the transaction (and only if both elections were continuously in effect from the date of the transaction through the current taxable year).
(ii)
Limitation for inbound nonrecognition transactions.
If a foreign corporation ceases to exist in a transaction described in § 1.987-8(c)(1)(ii) (inbound section 332 liquidation) or § 1.987-8(c)(2)(ii) (inbound reorganization), section 987 gain recognized by the foreign corporation before the transaction is disregarded for purposes of applying paragraph (e)(3) of this section in taxable years ending after the transaction.
(6)
Consolidated group members
—(i)
In general.
All members of a consolidated group are treated as a single owner for purposes of applying this paragraph (e).
(ii)
Suspended section 987 losses arising in separate return limitation years.
This paragraph (e)(6)(ii) applies to suspended section 987 losses arising in a separate return limitation year (SRLY, as defined in § 1.1502-1(f)) or treated as arising in a SRLY under the principles of § 1.1502-21(c) (
SRLY section 987 losses
). The aggregate of a member's SRLY section 987 losses that are included in the determination of consolidated taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group may not exceed the aggregate consolidated net income for all consolidated return years of the group determined by reference to only the member's items of section 987 gain or loss, including the member's section 987 losses actually absorbed by the group in the taxable year (whether or not absorbed by the member). For purposes of applying this paragraph (e)(6)(ii), the principles of § 1.1502-21(c) (including the SRLY subgroup principles of § 1.1502-21(c)(2)) apply with appropriate adjustments.
(f)
Recognition groupings.
The term
recognition grouping
means the section 987 gain or loss (including section 987 gain or loss that is recognized under § 1.987-5, deferred section 987 gain or loss, suspended section 987 loss, or pretransition gain or loss that is recognized under § 1.987-10(e)(5)(ii)) described in paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable. If an owner has suspended section 987 loss with respect to a terminating QBU in a taxable year
ending before the transition date described in § 1.987-10(c)(1), section 987 gain or loss of the owner (other than section 987 gain or loss with respect to the terminating QBU) is assigned to a recognition grouping based on the method that is used to determine the source and character of section 987 gain or loss for that taxable year.
(1)
Sourcing and section 904 category.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, a recognition grouping includes only section 987 gain or loss that is initially assigned to one of the following statutory and residual groupings—
(i) U.S. source income; or
(ii) Foreign source income in a single section 904 category.
(2)
Statutory and residual groupings for CFC owners.
In the case of an owner that is a controlled foreign corporation, a recognition grouping includes only section 987 gain or loss that is initially assigned to one of the statutory and residual groupings described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and that is also initially assigned to one of the following statutory and residual groupings—
(i) Tentative tested income;
(ii) Each separate subpart F income group (as defined in § 1.960-1(d)(2)(ii)(B));
(iii) Income described in section 952(b) (ECI that is excluded from subpart F income); or
(iv) Income not described in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section.
(1)
Example 1: Suspension of section 987 loss and recognition of suspended section 987 loss
—(i)
Facts.
CFC is a controlled foreign corporation that has the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. CFC owns three section 987 QBUs, QBU1, QBU2, and QBU3. QBU1 has the euro as its functional currency, QBU2 has the pound as its functional currency, and QBU3 has the yen as its functional currency. CFC is subject to a current rate election but not an annual recognition election. CFC is also subject to an election under § 1.987-6(b)(2)(i)(C) (treating section 987 gain or loss relating to passive foreign personal holding company income as attributable to section 988 transactions). An election has not been made under § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(viii) (GILTI high-tax exclusion) with respect to CFC. In year 1, CFC did not have cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to any of its QBUs and did not have outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss. In the three years before year 2, CFC did not recognize any section 987 gain or loss. In year 2, CFC has net unrecognized section 987 loss of $200 with respect to QBU1, net unrecognized section 987 loss of $1,000 with respect to QBU2, and net unrecognized section 987 gain of $1,000 with respect to QBU3. In year 2, each QBU makes a remittance, and CFC's remittance proportion (determined under § 1.987-5(b)(1)) is 25% with respect to QBU1, 15% with respect to QBU2, and 10% with respect to QBU3. For purposes of § 1.987-6(b)(2)(i), all of QBU1's assets generate foreign source passive category income that corresponds to one or more subpart F income groups described in § 1.960-1(d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
i
) through (
v
), and all of QBU2's and QBU3's assets generate foreign source general category tested income. Another member of CFC's controlled group owns a section 987 QBU with respect to which $10 million of net unrecognized section 987 loss becomes suspended section 987 loss under paragraph (c)(1) of this section in year 2.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Application of §§ 1.987-5 and 1.987-6 and paragraph (c) of this section.
In year 2, CFC recognizes $100 of section 987 gain with respect to QBU3 (10% of $1,000) under § 1.987-5(a). Under § 1.987-6(b)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (D), the section 987 gain is initially characterized as foreign source general category tentative tested income. If a current rate election was not in effect, in year 2 CFC would recognize $50 of section 987 loss with respect to QBU1 (25% of $200) and $150 of section 987 loss with respect to QBU2 (15% of $1,000). However, under paragraph (c) of this section, these amounts instead become suspended section 987 loss. The de minimis rule under paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not apply because a member of CFC's controlled group has more than $3 million of section 987 loss that is suspended in year 2 under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under § 1.987-
6(b)(2)(i)(A) and (B), the $50 of suspended section 987 loss with respect to QBU1 is initially characterized as foreign source passive category income assigned to a subpart F income group described in § 1.960-1(d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
i
) through (
v
), and is treated as foreign currency loss of the CFC attributable to section 988 transactions not directly related to the business needs of the CFC because an election under § 1.987-6(b)(2)(i)(C) is in effect. Under § 1.987-6(b)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (D), the $150 of suspended section 987 loss with respect to QBU2 is initially characterized as foreign source general category tentative tested income.
(B)
Cumulative suspended section 987 loss.
Under paragraph (b) of this section, in year 2, CFC's cumulative suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping of foreign source passive category income in a separate subpart F income group for foreign currency gains of CFC with respect to QBU1 is $50, the amount that became suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping in year 2. In addition, CFC's total cumulative suspended section 987 loss in that recognition grouping is $50. Similarly, CFC's cumulative suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping of foreign source general category tentative tested income with respect to QBU2 is $150, the amount that became suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping in year 2. In addition, CFC's total cumulative suspended section 987 loss in that recognition grouping is $150.
(C)
Current year gain amount and lookback gain amount.
Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, in year 2, CFC recognizes suspended section 987 loss in a recognition grouping to the extent of the sum of the current year gain amount described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and the lookback gain amount described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. In the recognition grouping of foreign source general category tentative tested income, the current year gain amount described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is equal to the section 987 gain of $100 recognized by CFC in year 2 with respect to QBU3. The current year gain amount for all other recognition groupings is zero. During the lookback period (the three years before year 2), CFC did not recognize any section 987 gain or loss. Therefore, the lookback gain amount described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is zero for all recognition groupings.
(D)
Recognition of suspended section 987 loss.
In year 2, CFC has $50 of total cumulative suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping of foreign source passive category income in a separate subpart F income group for foreign currency gains of CFC and $150 of total cumulative suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping of foreign source general category tentative tested income. In the recognition grouping of foreign source general category tentative tested income, CFC has a current year gain amount of $100 and a lookback gain amount of zero ($100 in total). Therefore, CFC recognizes $100 of suspended section 987 loss in that recognition grouping. Under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the cumulative suspended section 987 loss that is recognized by CFC is attributable to QBU2, because QBU2 is CFC's only QBU with cumulative suspended section 987 loss in the recognition grouping of foreign source general category tentative tested income. Because no election under § 1.951A-2(c)(7) applies in year 2, both the $100 of recognized section 987 gain and the $100 of recognized section 987 loss are allocated to foreign source general category tested income.
See
§ 1.987-6(b)(2)(ii). The amounts of suspended section 987 loss not recognized (that is, $50 of suspended section 987 loss assigned to foreign source passive category income in the subpart F income group for foreign currency gains of CFC with respect to QBU1 and $50 of suspended section 987 loss assigned to foreign source general category tentative tested income with respect to QBU2) remain suspended.
(2)
Example 2: Recognition of suspended section 987 loss by reason of gain recognized during the lookback period
—(i)
Facts.
CFC is a controlled foreign corporation that has the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. CFC owns QBU1, a section 987 QBU with the euro as its functional currency, and CFC has no other QBUs. Assume that all section 987 gain or loss (including suspended section 987 loss) is assigned to the same
recognition grouping. CFC is subject to a current rate election but not an annual recognition election. Before year 1, QBU1 does not have cumulative suspended section 987 loss. In year 1, CFC recognizes section 987 gain of $10 million with respect to QBU1. In year 3, CFC recognizes section 987 gain of $15 million with respect to QBU1. In year 4, QBU1 has net unrecognized section 987 loss, and $10 million of the net unrecognized section 987 loss becomes suspended section 987 loss under paragraph (c) of this section. In year 6, an additional $10 million of net unrecognized section 987 loss with respect to QBU1 becomes suspended section 987 loss under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Recognition of suspended section 987 loss in year 4.
In year 4, CFC's total cumulative suspended section 987 loss is $10 million (that is, the loss that becomes suspended in year 4). The current year gain amount under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is zero, because CFC does not recognize section 987 gain in year 4. The lookback period under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section is three years (years 1 through 3). The lookback gain amount under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is $25 million (the sum of the $10 million of section 987 gain recognized in year 1 and the $15 million of section 987 gain recognized in year 3). Therefore, under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, CFC recognizes suspended section 987 loss of $10 million. Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the suspended section 987 loss is considered to be recognized by reason of the section 987 gain recognized in year 3, which is the most recent taxable year in which section 987 gain was recognized.
(B)
Recognition of suspended section 987 loss in year 6.
In year 6, CFC's total cumulative suspended section 987 loss is $10 million (that is, the loss that becomes suspended in year 6). The current year gain amount under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is zero, because CFC does not recognize section 987 gain in year 6. The lookback period under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section is three years (years 3 through 5). The lookback gain amount under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is $5 million (the sum of the section 987 gain of $15 million recognized in year 3 and the suspended section 987 loss of $10 million recognized in year 4 by reason of the section 987 gain recognized in year 3). Therefore, under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, CFC recognizes $5 million of suspended section 987 loss in year 6.
(iii)
Alternative facts.
Assume the facts are the same as described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, with the following modifications. In year 1, CFC recognizes section 987 gain of $10 million with respect to QBU1. CFC does not recognize section 987 gain in year 3. In year 4, $10 million of net unrecognized section 987 loss with respect to QBU1 becomes suspended section 987 loss under paragraph (c) of this section. In year 5, CFC recognizes section 987 gain of $15 million with respect to QBU1. In year 6, $10 million of net unrecognized section 987 loss with respect to QBU1 becomes suspended section 987 loss under paragraph (c) of this section.
(iv)
Analysis of alternative facts
—(A)
Recognition of suspended section 987 loss in year 4.
In year 4, CFC's total cumulative suspended section 987 loss is $10 million (that is, the loss that becomes suspended in year 4). The current year gain amount under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is zero, because CFC does not recognize section 987 gain in year 4. The lookback period under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section is three years (years 1 through 3). The lookback gain amount under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is $10 million (equal to the $10 million of section 987 gain recognized in year 1). Therefore, under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, CFC recognizes suspended section 987 loss of $10 million in year 4. Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the suspended section 987 loss is considered to be recognized by reason of the section 987 gain recognized in year 1, which is the most recent taxable year in which section 987 gain was recognized.
(B)
Recognition of suspended section 987 loss in year 6.
In year 6, CFC's total cumulative suspended section 987 loss is $10 million (that is, the loss that becomes suspended in year 6). The current year gain amount under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is zero because CFC does not recognize section 987 gain in year 6. The lookback period under
paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section is three years (years 3 through 5). The lookback gain amount under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is $15 million (equal to the section 987 gain of $15 million recognized in year 5). Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the suspended section 987 loss recognized in year 4 is not taken into account in determining the lookback gain amount, because it was recognized by reason of the section 987 gain recognized in year 1 (before the beginning of the lookback period for year 6). Therefore, under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, CFC recognizes $10 million of suspended section 987 loss in year 6.
(3)
Example 3: Suspension of section 987 loss when a current rate election is revoked
—(i)
Facts.
U.S. Corp is a domestic corporation that owns all of the interests in DE1. DE1 owns Business A, which is a section 987 QBU of U.S. Corp. In year 1, U.S. Corp made a current rate election but not an annual recognition election. In year 9, U.S. Corp has net unrecognized section 987 loss of $2 million with respect to Business A, which is not recognized or suspended in year 9. U.S. Corp revokes its current rate election effective for year 10. In year 10, before the application of this section, U.S. Corp has net accumulated unrecognized section 987 loss of $2 million.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, U.S. Corp's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 loss of $2 million with respect to Business A is converted into suspended section 987 loss at the beginning of year 10, the first taxable year in which the current rate election ceases to be in effect.

§ 1.987-12
Deferral of section 987 gain or loss.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides rules that defer the recognition of section 987 gain or loss and rules for recognizing (or suspending) deferred section 987 gain or loss. This paragraph (a) provides an overview of this section and certain instances when this section does not apply. Paragraph (b) of this section describes the extent to which net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss is recognized under § 1.987-5 (or in certain cases, suspended) or becomes deferred section 987 gain or loss in connection with a deferral event. Paragraph (c) of this section describes the extent to which deferred section 987 gain or loss is recognized (or in certain cases, suspended) upon the occurrence of subsequent events. Paragraph (d) of this section provides a rule relating to the treatment of a successor deferral QBU when deferred section 987 loss becomes suspended section 987 loss. Paragraph (e) of this section provides an anti-abuse rule. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining the deferred section 987 gain or loss of combined and separated QBUs. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (h) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of this section.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Annual recognition election.
This section does not apply to a termination of a section 987 QBU in a taxable year in which an annual recognition election is in effect.
(ii)
De minimis rule.
This section does not apply in a taxable year if the aggregate amount of net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of the owner with respect to all of its section 987 QBUs that would become deferred section 987 gain or loss under this section does not exceed $5 million.
(b)
Treatment of section 987 gain and loss in connection with a deferral event.
Notwithstanding § 1.987-5 (general rule requiring recognition of section 987 gain or loss in the taxable year of a remittance), the owner of a section 987 QBU with respect to which a deferral event occurs (an
original deferral QBU
) includes in taxable income section 987 gain or loss in connection with the deferral event only to the extent provided in this paragraph (b).
(1)
Gain or loss recognized (or suspended) in the taxable year of a deferral event.
In the taxable year of a deferral event with respect to an original deferral QBU, the owner of the original deferral QBU recognizes section 987 gain or loss under § 1.987-5, except that, solely for purposes of applying § 1.987-5, all assets and liabilities of the original deferral QBU that, immediately after the deferral event, are reflected on the books and records of a successor deferral QBU are treated as not having been transferred and therefore as remaining
on the books and records of the original deferral QBU notwithstanding the deferral event. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, any section 987 loss that would otherwise be recognized under this paragraph (b)(1) and § 1.987-5 may instead become suspended loss under § 1.987-11(c) if a current rate election is in effect, or under § 1.987-13(h) if the deferral event also constitutes an outbound loss event.
(2)
Deferred section 987 gain or loss
—(i)
In general.
In the taxable year of a deferral event with respect to an original deferral QBU, any net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss that is not recognized or suspended in the taxable year of the deferral event becomes deferred section 987 gain or loss of the original deferral QBU owner. Suspended section 987 loss does not become deferred section 987 loss under this paragraph (b)(2).
(ii)
Deferred section 987 gain or loss attributable to a successor deferral QBU.
A portion of the deferred section 987 gain or loss described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section becomes deferred section 987 gain or loss with respect to each successor deferral QBU. Such portion is equal to the deferred section 987 gain or loss multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate adjusted basis of the gross assets transferred to the successor deferral QBU in connection with the deferral event and the denominator of which is the aggregate adjusted basis of the gross assets transferred to all successor deferral QBUs in connection with the deferral event.
(c)
Recognition (or suspension) of deferred section 987 gain or loss following a deferral event.
An original deferral QBU owner recognizes deferred section 987 gain or loss with respect to a successor deferral QBU in the taxable year of the deferral event and in subsequent taxable years as provided in this paragraph (c).
(1)
Recognition upon a subsequent remittance
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an original deferral QBU owner recognizes deferred section 987 gain or loss in the taxable year of the deferral event, and in subsequent taxable years, upon a remittance from a successor deferral QBU to the owner of the successor deferral QBU (
successor deferral QBU owner
) in the amount described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, any deferred section 987 loss that would otherwise be recognized under this paragraph (c)(1) may instead become suspended section 987 loss under § 1.987-11(c) (if a current rate election is in effect with respect to the original deferral QBU owner) or under § 1.987-7(d)(1)(ii) (in the case of a partnership).
(ii)
Amount.
The amount of deferred section 987 gain or loss that is recognized (or suspended) pursuant to this paragraph (c)(1) in a taxable year of the original deferral QBU owner is the original deferral QBU owner's outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss (that is, the amount of deferred section 987 gain or loss not previously recognized or suspended) with respect to the successor deferral QBU multiplied by the remittance proportion of the successor deferral QBU owner with respect to the successor deferral QBU for the taxable year ending with or within the taxable year of the original deferral QBU owner, as determined under § 1.987-5(b) without regard to any annual recognition election of the successor deferral QBU owner.
See
paragraph (h)(4) of this section (
Example 4
) for an illustration of this rule.
(iii)
Deemed remittance by a successor deferral QBU.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), in a taxable year of the original deferral QBU owner in which a successor deferral QBU ceases to be owned by a member of the controlled group that includes the original deferral QBU owner, the successor deferral QBU is treated as having a remittance proportion of one. Accordingly, if a successor deferral QBU ceases to be owned by a member of the controlled group that includes the original deferral QBU owner, the original deferral QBU owner's outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss with respect to that successor deferral QBU will be recognized (or suspended). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), if the original deferral QBU owner goes out of existence and there is no qualified successor, in
the last taxable year of the original deferral QBU owner, each successor deferral QBU is treated as having a remittance proportion of one. This paragraph (c)(1)(iii) does not affect the application of the section 987 regulations to the successor deferral QBU owner with respect to its ownership of the successor deferral QBU.
(2)
Deferral events and outbound loss events with respect to a successor deferral QBU.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if assets of the successor deferral QBU (
transferred assets
) are transferred (or deemed transferred) in a transaction that would constitute a deferral event or an outbound loss event if the original deferral QBU owner owned the successor deferral QBU directly and the original deferral QBU owner had net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss with respect to the successor deferral QBU equal to its outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss with respect to the successor deferral QBU (the
deemed transaction
), then, in accordance with the rules of this section and § 1.987-13(h)—
(i) The original deferral QBU owner recognizes its outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss, or suspends its outstanding deferred section 987 loss, to the extent it would have recognized or suspended net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss as a result of the deemed transaction; and
(ii) Each section 987 QBU is a successor deferral QBU to the extent it would have been after the deemed transaction and the original deferral QBU owner has deferred section 987 gain or loss with respect to the successor deferral QBU to the extent it would have after the deemed transaction;
(iii) Each eligible QBU is a successor suspended loss QBU to the extent it would have been after the deemed transaction and the original deferral QBU owner has suspended section 987 loss with respect to the suspended loss QBU to the extent it would have after the deemed transaction.
(d)
Successor deferral QBU becomes a successor suspended loss QBU.
A successor deferral QBU becomes a successor suspended loss QBU, and an original deferral QBU owner becomes an original suspended loss QBU owner, if any of the original deferral QBU owner's deferred section 987 loss with respect to the successor deferral QBU becomes suspended section 987 loss. An eligible QBU may be both a successor deferral QBU and a successor suspended loss QBU and the original deferral QBU owner may also be an original suspended loss QBU owner.
(e)
Anti-abuse rule.
No section 987 loss is recognized under this section, § 1.987-5 or § 1.987-13 in connection with a transaction or series of transactions that are undertaken with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section.
(f)
Combinations and separations of successor deferral QBUs.
A combined QBU is a successor deferral QBU if either combining QBU was a successor deferral QBU. A separated QBU is a successor deferral QBU if the separating QBU was a successor deferral QBU.
(1)
Combined QBU.
The outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss of a combined QBU in each recognition grouping for a taxable year is equal to the sum of the combining QBUs' outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss in that recognition grouping.
(2)
Separated QBU.
The outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss of a separated QBU in each recognition grouping for a taxable year is equal to the separating QBU's outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss in each recognition grouping multiplied by the separation fraction.
(g)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
Deferral event.
A deferral event with respect to a section 987 QBU means any transaction or series of transactions that satisfy the conditions described in both paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i)
Events.
The transaction or series of transactions constitutes:
(A) A termination of the section 987 QBU under § 1.987-8(b)(2) (substantially all the assets transferred to the owner), § 1.987-8(b)(5) (section 987 QBU ceases to be a section 987 QBU), or § 1.987-8(b)(6) (individual or corporation ceases to be a direct owner of a section 987 QBU); or
(B) [Reserved]
(ii)
Assets on books of successor deferral QBU.
Immediately after the transaction or series of transactions, assets of the section 987 QBU are reflected on the books and records of a successor deferral QBU.
(2)
Successor deferral QBU.
A section 987 QBU (
potential successor deferral QBU
) is a successor deferral QBU with respect to a section 987 QBU referred to in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section if, immediately after the transaction or series of transactions described in that paragraph, the potential successor deferral QBU satisfies all of the conditions described in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) The books and records of the potential successor deferral QBU reflect assets that, immediately before the transaction or series of transactions described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, were reflected on the books and records of the section 987 QBU referred to in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
(ii) The owner of the potential successor deferral QBU and the owner of the section 987 QBU referred to in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section immediately before the transaction or series of transactions described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section are members of the same controlled group.
(iii) If the owner of the section 987 QBU referred to in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section immediately before the transaction or series of transactions described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section was a U.S. person, the potential successor deferral QBU is owned by a U.S. person.
(3)
Original deferral QBU owner.
An original deferral QBU owner means, with respect to an original deferral QBU, the owner of the original deferral QBU immediately before the deferral event, or the owner's qualified successor.
(4)
Qualified successor.
A qualified successor with respect to a corporation (
transferor corporation
) means another corporation that acquires the assets of the transferor corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) (
acquiring corporation
), provided that the acquiring corporation is a domestic corporation and the transferor corporation was a domestic corporation, or the acquiring corporation is a controlled foreign corporation and the transferor corporation was a controlled foreign corporation. A qualified successor of a person includes the qualified successor of a qualified successor.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section. For purposes of the examples, DC1 is a domestic corporation that owns all of the stock of DC2, which is also a domestic corporation, and CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation. In addition, DC1, DC2, and CFC1 are members of a controlled group, and the de minimis rule of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is not applicable. Finally, except as otherwise provided, Business A is a section 987 QBU with the euro as its functional currency, there are no transfers between Business A and its owner, and Business A's assets are not depreciable or amortizable.
(1)
Example 1: Contribution of a section 987 QBU with net unrecognized section 987 gain to a member of the controlled group
—(i)
Facts.
DC1 owns Business A. The adjusted balance sheet of Business A reflects assets with an aggregate adjusted basis of €1,000x and no liabilities. DC1 contributes €900x of Business A's assets to DC2 in exchange for DC2 stock in a transaction to which section 351 applies. Immediately after the contribution, the remaining €100x of Business A's assets are no longer reflected on the books and records of a section 987 QBU (but are instead reflected on the books and records of DC1's home office). DC2, which has the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, uses the Business A assets in a business (
Business B
) that constitutes a section 987 QBU. At the time of the contribution, Business A has net unrecognized section 987 gain of $100x.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A) Under § 1.987-2(c)(2)(ii), DC1's contribution of €900x of Business A's assets to DC2 is treated as a transfer of all of the assets of Business A to DC1, immediately followed by DC1's contribution of €900x of Business A's assets to DC2. The contribution of Business A's assets is a deferral event within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1) of this section because:
(
1
) The transfer from Business A to DC1 is a transfer of substantially all of Business A's assets to DC1, resulting in
a termination of the Business A QBU under § 1.987-8(b)(2); and
(
2
) Immediately after the transaction, assets of Business A are reflected on the books and records of Business B, a section 987 QBU owned by a member of DC1's controlled group and a successor deferral QBU within the meaning of paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Accordingly, Business A is an original deferral QBU within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section, and DC1 is an original deferral QBU owner of Business A within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(B) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, DC1's taxable income in the taxable year of the deferral event includes DC1's section 987 gain or loss determined with respect to Business A under § 1.987-5, except that, for purposes of applying § 1.987-5, all assets of Business A that are reflected on the books and records of Business B immediately after Business A's termination are treated as not having been transferred and therefore as though they remained on Business A's books and records (notwithstanding the deemed transfer of those assets under § 1.987-8(e)). Accordingly, in the taxable year of the deferral event, Business A is treated as making a remittance of €100x, corresponding to the assets of Business A that are no longer reflected on the books and records of a section 987 QBU, and is treated as having a remittance proportion with respect to Business A of 0.1, determined by dividing the €100x remittance by the sum of the remittance and the €900x aggregate adjusted basis of the gross assets deemed to remain on Business A's books and records at the end of the taxable year. Thus, DC1 recognizes $10x of section 987 gain in the taxable year of the deferral event. DC1's deferred section 987 gain equals $90x, which is the amount of its net unrecognized section 987 gain (which is $100x) less the amount of section 987 gain recognized by DC1 under § 1.987-5 and this section (which is $10x).
(2)
Example 2: Contribution of a section 987 QBU with net unrecognized section 987 loss to a member of the controlled group when a current rate election is in effect
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(1) of this section (
Example 1
) except that a current rate election is in effect for the taxable year (and an annual recognition election is not in effect) and, at the time of the contribution, Business A has net unrecognized section 987 loss of $100x. Business A is engaged in the business of manufacturing Product X before the contribution, and Business B is engaged in the same business after the contribution. After the contribution, the €100x of assets that are reflected on the books and records of DC1's home office are not used in the business of manufacturing Product X.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A) For the reasons described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section (
Example 1
), the contribution results in a termination of the Business A QBU and a deferral event with respect to the Business A QBU, an original deferral QBU; DC1 is an original deferral QBU owner within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section; Business B is a successor deferral QBU with respect to Business A; and DC2 is a successor deferral QBU owner.
(B) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for purposes of applying § 1.987-5, all the assets of Business A that are reflected on the books and records of Business B immediately after Business A's termination are treated as not having been transferred and therefore as though they remained on Business A's books and records (notwithstanding the deemed transfer of those assets under § 1.987-8(e)). Accordingly, in the taxable year of the deferral event, Business A is treated as making a remittance of €100x, corresponding to the assets of Business A that are no longer reflected on the books and records of a section 987 QBU, and DC1 is treated as having a remittance proportion with respect to Business A of 0.1, determined by dividing the €100x remittance by the sum of the remittance and the €900x aggregate adjusted basis of the gross assets deemed to remain on Business A's books and records at the end of the taxable year. Thus, but for the application of § 1.987-11(c), DC1 would recognize $10x of section 987 loss in the taxable year of the deferral event. Under § 1.987-11(c), because a current rate election is in effect (and an annual recognition election is not in effect), the loss is instead treated as suspended section 987 loss. DC1's deferred section
987 loss equals $90x, which is the amount of its net unrecognized section 987 loss less the amount of section 987 loss suspended under § 1.987-11(c) (which is $10x).
(C) Under § 1.987-13(b)(1)(i), Business B is a successor suspended loss QBU because, immediately after the termination of the Business A section 987 QBU, a significant portion of the assets of Business A was reflected on the books and records of Business B (an eligible QBU), Business B continued to carry on the trade or business of Business A, and Business B was owned by DC2, a member of the same controlled group as DC1 (which is the original suspended loss QBU owner under § 1.987-13(l)(1)). Therefore, under § 1.987-13(b)(1)(ii), all of Business A's cumulative suspended section 987 loss (including the suspended section 987 loss resulting from the termination of Business A) becomes suspended section 987 loss with respect to Business B. After the transaction, DC1 may recognize its suspended section 987 loss with respect to Business B under § 1.987-11(e) or § 1.987-13(b) through (d), as applicable.
(3)
Example 3: Election to be classified as a corporation
—(i)
Facts.
DC1 owns all of the interests in Entity A, a DE. Entity A conducts Business A, which has net unrecognized section 987 gain of $500x. Entity A elects to be classified as a corporation under § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter. As a result of the election and pursuant to § 301.7701-3(g)(1)(iv) of this chapter, DC1 is treated as contributing all of the assets and liabilities of Business A to newly-formed CFC1, which has the euro as its functional currency. Immediately after the contribution, the assets and liabilities of Business A are reflected on CFC1's books and records.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under § 1.987-2(c)(2)(ii), DC1's deemed contribution of all of the assets and liabilities of Business A to CFC1 is treated as a transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of Business A to DC1, followed immediately by DC1's contribution of those assets and liabilities to CFC1. Because the deemed transfer from Business A to DC1 is a transfer of substantially all of Business A's assets to DC1, the Business A QBU terminates under § 1.987-8(b)(2). The contribution of Business A's assets is not a deferral event within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section because, immediately after the transaction, no assets of Business A are reflected on the books and records of a successor deferral QBU within the meaning of paragraph (g)(2) of this section due to the fact that the assets of Business A are not reflected on the books and records of a section 987 QBU immediately after the termination. In addition, the requirement of paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section is not met because Business A was owned by a U.S. person and the potential successor deferral QBU, which is owned by CFC1, is not owned by a U.S. person. Accordingly, DC1 recognizes section 987 gain of $500x with respect to Business A under § 1.987-5 without regard to this section. Because the requirement of paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section is not met, the result would be the same even if the assets of Business A were transferred in a section 351 exchange to an existing foreign corporation that had a different functional currency than Business A.
(4)
Example 4: Partial recognition of deferred gain or loss
—(i)
Facts.
DC1 owns all of the interests in Entity A, a DE that conducts Business A in Country X. During year 1, DC1 contributes all of its interests in Entity A to DC2 in an exchange to which section 351 applies. At the time of the contribution, Business A has net unrecognized section 987 gain of $100x and cumulative suspended section 987 loss of $50x. After the contribution, Entity A continues to conduct the same trade or business in Country X (
Business B
). In year 3, as a result of a net transfer of property from Business B to DC2, DC2's remittance proportion with respect to Business B, as determined under § 1.987-5, is 0.25.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A) For the reasons described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section
(Example 1
), the contribution of all the interests in Entity A by DC1 to DC2 results in a termination of the Business A QBU and a deferral event with respect to the Business A QBU, an original deferral QBU; DC1 is an original deferral QBU owner within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section; Business B is a successor deferral QBU with respect to Business A; DC2 is
a successor deferral QBU owner; and the $100x of net unrecognized section 987 gain with respect to Business A becomes deferred section 987 gain as a result of the deferral event.
(B) Under § 1.987-13(b)(1)(i), Business B is a successor suspended loss QBU because, immediately after the termination of the Business A section 987 QBU, a significant portion of the assets of Business A was reflected on the books and records of Business B (an eligible QBU), Business B continued to carry on the trade or business of Business A, and Business B was owned by DC2, a member of the same controlled group as DC1 (which is the original suspended loss QBU owner under § 1.987-13(l)(1)). Therefore, under § 1.987-13(b)(1)(ii), all of DC1's cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to Business A becomes suspended section 987 loss of DC1 with respect to Business B.
(C) Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, DC1 recognizes deferred section 987 gain in year 3 as a result of the remittance from Business B to DC2. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the amount of deferred section 987 gain that DC1 recognizes is $25x, which is DC1's outstanding deferred section 987 gain of $100x with respect to Business A multiplied by the remittance proportion of 0.25 of DC2 with respect to Business B for the taxable year as determined under § 1.987-5(b). In addition, under § 1.987-11(e), DC1 recognizes its cumulative suspended section 987 loss to the extent of the deferred section 987 gain recognized in the same recognition grouping.

§ 1.987-13
Suspended section 987 loss upon terminations.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules relating to suspended section 987 loss of an owner with respect to a section 987 QBU or successor suspended loss QBU that terminates. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules treating suspended section 987 loss as recognized or attributable to a successor when a section 987 QBU terminates. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules treating suspended section 987 loss as recognized or attributable to a subsequent successor when a successor suspended loss QBU terminates. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules regarding the recognition of suspended section 987 loss when interests in a successor suspended loss QBU owner are transferred. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules that apply when interests in an original suspended loss QBU owner are transferred. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules that apply when an original suspended loss QBU owner ceases to exist. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules preventing the carryover of suspended section 987 loss in connection with certain inbound transactions. Paragraph (h) of this section provides rules that suspend section 987 loss in connection with certain outbound transactions. Paragraph (i) of this section is reserved. Paragraph (j) of this section provides rules relating to the termination of a successor suspended loss QBU. Paragraph (k) of this section provides an anti-abuse rule. Paragraph (l) of this section provides definitions that apply for purposes of this section. Paragraph (m) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of this section.
(2)
Ordering rule.
Paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section are applied after the application of § 1.987-11(e) (loss-to-the-extent-of-gain rule).
(b)
Termination of a section 987 QBU with suspended loss.
If a section 987 QBU terminates, and at the time of termination, the owner has suspended section 987 loss with respect to the section 987 QBU (including because the termination was an outbound loss event or because net unrecognized section 987 loss became suspended section 987 loss upon termination as a result of a current rate election), then either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section applies. However, this paragraph (b) does not apply to a termination that occurs in connection with a transaction described in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section.
(1)
Suspended section 987 loss becomes suspended section 987 loss with respect to a successor suspended loss QBU
—(i)
Successor suspended loss QBU.
If, immediately after the termination, a significant portion of the assets of the terminating section 987 QBU are reflected on the books and records of an eligible
QBU that carries on a trade or business of the section 987 QBU and is owned by the owner of the section 987 QBU or a member of its controlled group (determined immediately after the transaction), then the eligible QBU is a successor suspended loss QBU and the rules provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section apply.
(ii)
Attribution of suspended section 987 loss to successor suspended loss QBU.
A portion of the cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to the terminating section 987 QBU that is not recognized in the taxable year of the termination under § 1.987-11(e) becomes suspended section 987 loss with respect to each successor suspended loss QBU. Such portion is equal to the suspended section 987 loss described in the preceding sentence, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate adjusted basis of the gross assets transferred to the successor suspended loss QBU in connection with the termination, and the denominator of which is the aggregate adjusted basis of the gross assets transferred to all successor suspended loss QBUs in connection with the termination.
(2)
Recognition of suspended section 987 loss.
If, immediately after the termination of the section 987 QBU, there is no successor suspended loss QBU under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then the owner recognizes the cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to the section 987 QBU that is not recognized in the taxable year of the termination under § 1.987-11(e).
(c)
Termination of a successor suspended loss QBU.
If a successor suspended loss QBU terminates (as described in paragraph (j) of this section), then either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section applies. However, this paragraph (c) does not apply to a termination that occurs in connection with a transaction described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section.
(1)
Successor to the successor suspended loss QBU
—(i)
Successor suspended loss QBU.
If, immediately after the termination, a significant portion of the assets of the terminating successor suspended loss QBU (
initial successor
) are reflected on the books and records of an eligible QBU (
subsequent successor
) that carries on a trade or business of the initial successor and is owned by the original suspended loss QBU owner or a member of its controlled group (determined immediately after the transaction), then the subsequent successor is a successor suspended loss QBU and the rules provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section apply.
(ii)
Attribution of suspended section 987 loss to successor suspended loss QBU.
A portion of the cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to the initial successor that is not recognized in the taxable year of the termination under § 1.987-11(e) becomes suspended section 987 loss with respect to each subsequent successor. Such portion is equal to the suspended section 987 loss described in the preceding sentence, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate adjusted basis of the gross assets transferred to the subsequent successor in connection with the termination, and the denominator of which is the aggregate adjusted basis of the gross assets transferred to all subsequent successors in connection with the termination.
(2)
Recognition of suspended section 987 loss.
If, immediately after the termination of the initial successor, there is no subsequent successor that is a successor suspended loss QBU under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then the original suspended loss QBU owner recognizes the cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to the initial successor that is not recognized in the taxable year of the termination under § 1.987-11(e).
(d)
Transfer of successor suspended loss QBU owner.
If a successor suspended loss QBU ceases to be owned by a member of the original suspended loss QBU owner's controlled group as a result of a direct or indirect transfer, or an issuance or redemption, of an ownership interest in the successor suspended loss QBU owner, then the original suspended loss QBU owner recognizes the cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to the successor suspended loss QBU that is not recognized in the taxable year under § 1.987-11(e).
(e)
Transfer of original suspended loss QBU owner.
If an original suspended loss QBU owner ceases to be a member of the successor suspended loss QBU
owner's controlled group as a result of a direct or indirect transfer, or an issuance or redemption, of an ownership interest in the original suspended loss QBU owner, the original suspended loss QBU owner's suspended section 987 loss ceases to be attributable to any successor suspended loss QBU (but it continues to be suspended section 987 loss of the original suspended loss QBU owner). As a result, the suspended section 987 loss can be recognized by the original suspended loss QBU owner under § 1.987-11(e) but cannot be recognized under paragraph (b)(2), (c)(2), or (d) of this section.
(f)
Owner ceases to exist.
If the owner of a section 987 QBU with suspended section 987 loss or an original suspended loss QBU owner ceases to exist and there is no successor under paragraph (l)(1)(ii) of this section (for example, as a result of a section 331 liquidation), then any suspended section 987 loss of the owner that is not recognized after application of the loss-to-the-extent-of-gain rule in § 1.987-11(e) is eliminated and cannot be recognized.
(g)
Inbound nonrecognition transactions
—
no carryover of suspended section 987 loss.
If an owner of a section 987 QBU with suspended section 987 loss, or an original suspended loss QBU owner, ceases to exist in a transaction described in § 1.987-8(c)(1)(ii) (inbound section 332 liquidation) or § 1.987-8(c)(2)(ii) (inbound reorganization), then any suspended section 987 loss of the owner or original suspended loss QBU owner that is not recognized after application of the loss-to-the-extent-of-gain rule in § 1.987-11(e) is eliminated and cannot be recognized. As a result, the distributee or acquiring corporation does not succeed to or take into account any suspended section 987 loss of the owner or original suspended loss QBU owner under section 381.
(h)
Outbound transactions
—
recognition or suspension of net unrecognized section 987 loss.
This paragraph (h) applies to taxable years in which neither a current rate election nor an annual recognition election is in effect.
(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding § 1.987-5, if an outbound loss event occurs with respect to a section 987 QBU (an
outbound loss QBU
), the original owner of the section 987 QBU includes in taxable income in the taxable year of the outbound loss event section 987 loss with respect to the outbound loss QBU only to the extent provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
(2)
Outbound loss event.
An outbound loss event means, with respect to a section 987 QBU:
(i) Any termination of the section 987 QBU as a result of a transfer by a U.S. person of assets of the section 987 QBU to a foreign person that is a member of the same controlled group as the U.S. person immediately before the transaction or, if the transferee did not exist immediately before the transaction, immediately after the transaction (
related foreign person
), provided that the termination would result in the recognition of section 987 loss with respect to the section 987 QBU under § 1.987-5 but for this paragraph (h); or
(ii) [Reserved]
(3)
Loss recognition upon an outbound loss event.
In the taxable year of an outbound loss event with respect to an outbound loss QBU, the owner of the outbound loss QBU recognizes section 987 loss as determined under §§ 1.987-5 and 1.987-12(b), except that, solely for purposes of applying § 1.987-5, assets and liabilities of the outbound loss QBU that, immediately after the outbound loss event, are reflected on the books and records of an eligible QBU owned by the related foreign person described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section are treated as not having been transferred and therefore as remaining on the books and records of the outbound loss QBU notwithstanding the outbound loss event.

(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Termination of a successor suspended loss QBU.

(k)
Anti-abuse.
No section 987 loss is recognized under this section, § 1.987-5,
or § 1.987-12 in connection with a transaction or series of transactions that are undertaken with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section.
(l)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
Original suspended loss QBU owner
—(i)
In general.
An
original suspended loss QBU owner
is the person that was the owner of a section 987 QBU before its termination in a transaction to which paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies.
(ii)
Successors.
If an original suspended loss QBU owner is a corporation (
transferor corporation
) and another corporation acquires the assets of the transferor corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a), then the acquiring corporation becomes the original suspended loss QBU owner.
(2)
Successor suspended loss QBU. See
paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section and § 1.987-12(d) for rules regarding when an eligible QBU is a successor suspended loss QBU.
(3)
Successor suspended loss QBU owner.
A
successor suspended loss QBU owner
is the owner of the assets and liabilities of a successor suspended loss QBU.
(4)
Ownership interests.
The term ownership interests means stock in a corporation and partnership interests in a partnership.
(5)
Significant portion.
With respect to the assets of an eligible QBU, the term
significant portion
means a significant portion of the operating assets, determined based on all the facts and circumstances, provided that more than 30 percent of the operating assets will constitute a significant portion in all cases and less than 10 percent of the operating assets will not constitute a significant portion in all cases.
(m)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section. For purposes of the examples, DC1 is a domestic corporation that owns all of the interests in Entity A, a DE. Entity A conducts Business A, a section 987 QBU that is engaged in the business of selling Product X. Business A has the euro as its functional currency.
(1)
Example 1: Trade or business of a section 987 QBU ceases
—(i)
Facts.
Entity A's trade or business of selling Product X ceases, resulting in a termination of the Business A section 987 QBU under § 1.987-8(b)(1). After the trade or business is wound up, the remaining assets are transferred to DC1 and are not used in the trade or business of selling Product X immediately following the termination. Business A has cumulative suspended section 987 loss under § 1.987-11(b) of $500x.
(ii)
Analysis.
Immediately after the termination of the Business A section 987 QBU, a significant portion of Business A's assets is not reflected on the books and records of an eligible QBU that carries on a trade or business of Business A and is owned by DC1 or a member of its controlled group. Therefore, Business A has no successor suspended loss QBU under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Consequently, DC1 recognizes the cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to the Business A section 987 QBU under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2)
Example 2: Trade or business of a section 987 QBU is sold to a third party
—(i)
Facts.
DC1 sells all the interests in Entity A to a third party for cash. Business A has cumulative suspended section 987 loss under § 1.987-11(b) of $500x.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under § 1.987-2(c)(2)(ii), the sale of the Business A assets and liabilities for cash that is reflected on the books of DC1 is treated as a transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of Business A to DC1, followed immediately by DC1's sale of those assets and liabilities. Because the deemed transfer from Business A to DC1 is a transfer of substantially all of Business A's assets to DC1, the Business A section 987 QBU terminates under § 1.987-8(b)(2). Immediately after the termination of the Business A section 987 QBU, a significant portion of Business A's assets is not reflected on the books and records of an eligible QBU that carries on a trade or business of Business A and is owned by DC1 or a member of its controlled group. Therefore, Business A has no successor suspended loss QBU under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Consequently, DC1 recognizes the cumulative suspended section 987 loss with respect to the Business A section 987 QBU under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(3)
Example 3: Outbound loss event
—(i)
Facts.
Entity A elects to be classified as a corporation under § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter. As a result of the election and pursuant to § 301.7701-3(g)(1)(iv) of this chapter, DC1 is treated as contributing all of the assets and liabilities of Business A to newly formed CFC1, which has the euro as its functional currency. Immediately after the contribution, the assets and liabilities of Business A are reflected on CFC1's books and records (which are the only books and records maintained by CFC1). CFC1 continues to use those assets in the same trade or business after the contribution (
Business B
). Neither a current rate election nor an annual recognition election is in effect. Business A has net unrecognized section 987 loss of $500x.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A) Under § 1.987-2(c)(2)(ii), DC1's contribution of all of the assets and liabilities of Business A to CFC1 is treated as a transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of Business A to DC1, followed immediately by DC1's contribution of those assets and liabilities to CFC1. Because the deemed transfer from Business A to DC1 is a transfer of substantially all of Business A's assets to DC1, the Business A section 987 QBU terminates under § 1.987-8(b)(2). The contribution of Business A's assets to CFC1 is not a deferral event within the meaning of § 1.987-12(g)(1) because, immediately after the transaction, no assets of Business A are reflected on the books and records of a successor deferral QBU within the meaning of § 1.987-12(g)(2) due to the fact that the assets of Business A are not reflected on the books and records of a section 987 QBU immediately after the termination, as well as the fact that the requirement of § 1.987-12(g)(2)(iii) is not met because Business A was owned by a U.S. person and the potential successor deferral QBU (Business B) is not owned by a U.S. person. The termination of the Business A section 987 QBU as a result of the transfer of the assets of Business A by a U.S. person (DC1) to a foreign person (CFC1) that is a member of DC1's controlled group is an outbound loss event described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(B) Under paragraphs (h)(1) and (3) of this section, in the taxable year of the outbound loss event, DC1 includes in taxable income section 987 loss recognized with respect to Business A as determined under § 1.987-5, except that, for purposes of applying § 1.987-5, all assets and liabilities of Business A that are reflected on the books and records of CFC1, a related foreign person described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, are treated as not having been transferred. Accordingly, DC1's remittance proportion with respect to Business A is 0, and DC1 recognizes no section 987 loss with respect to Business A. DC1's outbound section 987 loss is $500x, which is the amount of section 987 loss that DC1 would have recognized under § 1.987-5 without regard to paragraph (h) of this section ($500x), less the amount of section 987 loss recognized by DC1 under paragraph (h)(3) of this section ($0). Under paragraph (h)(4) of this section, the $500x of outbound section 987 loss becomes suspended section 987 loss.
(C) Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, Business B is a successor suspended loss QBU because, immediately after the termination of the Business A section 987 QBU, the Business A assets are reflected on the books and records of Business B (which is the only set of books and records maintained by CFC1), Business B was an eligible QBU that continued to carry on the same trade or business as Business A did before the contribution, and Business B was owned by CFC1, a member of the same controlled group as DC (which is the original suspended loss QBU owner under paragraph (l)(1) of this section).
See
§ 1.987-1(b)(4)(ii) (providing that, if a corporation is solely engaged in activities that constitute a trade or business, and the corporation maintains only one set of books and records, the activities (but not the corporation) are a qualified business unit). Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, all of Business A's suspended section 987 loss (including the suspended section 987 loss resulting from the termination of Business A) is treated as suspended section 987 loss of DC1 with respect to Business B.

§ 1.987-14
Section 987 hedging transactions.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules relating to section 987 hedging transactions. Paragraph (b) of this section provides the definition of a section 987 hedging transaction. Paragraph (c) of this section provides identification requirements for section 987 hedging transactions. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules relating to the taxation of section 987 hedging transactions. Paragraph (e) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of this section.
(b)
Section 987 hedging transaction
—(1)
In general.
A section 987 hedging transaction is a financial instrument or a combination or series of financial instruments (a
hedge
), that is entered into by the owner of a section 987 QBU as part of the normal course of the owner's trade or business for the purpose of managing exchange rate risk with respect to all or part of the owner's net investment in the section 987 QBU (the
hedged QBU
), provided that the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met. If only part of a financial instrument (or combination or series of financial instruments) is described in the preceding sentence, that part is treated as a section 987 hedging transaction for purposes of this section.
(2)
Requirements.
A transaction is a section 987 hedging transaction described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a taxable year only if the following requirements are met.
(i)
Identification.
The hedge must be identified as a section 987 hedging transaction with respect to the hedged QBU under paragraph (c) of this section. The financial instrument or instruments that comprise the hedge must not be identified as a section 987 hedging transaction with respect to any other section 987 QBU. If only part of a financial instrument (or combination or series of financial instruments) is a section 987 hedging transaction, that part must be clearly identified.
(ii)
Current rate election.
A current rate election must be in effect for the taxable year.
(iii)
Mark-to-market method of accounting.
Section 988 gain or loss of the owner with respect to the hedge must be accounted for under a mark-to-market method of accounting (for example, under section 1256). In addition, if a member of the owner's controlled group is a party to the hedge, any section 988 gain or loss of the controlled group member with respect to the hedge must be accounted for under a mark-to-market method of accounting.
(iv)
Treatment under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Foreign currency gain or loss on the hedge must be properly accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment to shareholders' equity.
(v)
Hedge entered into by owner of the hedged QBU.
The hedge must be entered into by the owner of the hedged QBU (and not by a section 987 QBU of the owner). In the case of a hedged QBU that is owned by a member of a consolidated group, the hedge must be entered into by the member that owns the hedged QBU.
(3)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a taxpayer enters into a hedge or a related transaction with a principal purpose of effectively converting section 987 gain or loss into section 988 gain or loss (or another type of income or loss) of the owner or a related party, the hedge is not treated as a section 987 hedging transaction.
(4)
Partial termination of a section 987 hedging transaction.
If only part of a financial instrument is a section 987 hedging transaction, and a part of the financial instrument is terminated or disposed of, a proportionate part of the section 987 hedging transaction is treated as terminated or disposed of.
(c)
Identification requirements
—(1)
In general.
The owner of a hedged QBU must clearly identify the hedge as a section 987 hedging transaction with respect to the hedged QBU in its books and records on or before the close of the day on which the owner entered into the hedge. The identification must meet the requirements of § 1.1221-2(f)(4) and must include the following information—
(i) The date on which the hedge is entered into by the owner of the hedged QBU and the date on which the hedge is identified as a section 987 hedging transaction;
(ii) A description of the hedge; and
(iii) Identification of the hedged QBU.
(2)
Inadvertent error.
If a hedge is not identified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but the hedge would otherwise qualify as a section 987 hedging transaction with respect to a hedged QBU within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section and the taxpayer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that its failure to identify the hedge was due to inadvertent error, the taxpayer may treat the hedge as a section 987 hedging transaction if all of the owner's hedges described in paragraph (b) of this section in all open years are being treated on either original or, if necessary, amended returns as section 987 hedging transactions subject to the rules of paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Taxation of section 987 hedging transactions
—(1)
Hedging gain or loss with respect to a hedged QBU.
If the owner of a section 987 QBU has entered into a section 987 hedging transaction with respect to the section 987 QBU, the owner's hedging gain or loss with respect to the hedged QBU for a taxable year is equal to the gain or loss that the owner would (but for the application of this paragraph (d)) recognize under section 988 with respect to the section 987 hedging transaction in the taxable year under the mark-to-market method of accounting described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section (including gain or loss that would be recognized in connection with a complete or partial disposition or termination of the section 987 hedging transaction). If only part of a financial instrument is a section 987 hedging transaction, a proportionate part of the gain or loss that would (but for the application of this paragraph (d)) be recognized under section 988 with respect to the financial instrument in the taxable year is treated as hedging gain or loss with respect to the hedged QBU.
See
paragraph (d)(3) of this section for rules relating to the determination of hedging gain or loss in the taxable year in which the hedged QBU terminates.
(2)
Adjustment to unrecognized section 987 gain or loss for the taxable year
—(i)
Hedging loss.
In a taxable year in which an owner has hedging loss with respect to a hedged QBU and has unrecognized section 987 gain for the taxable year with respect to the hedged QBU (as determined under § 1.987-4(d), without regard to this paragraph (d)), the unrecognized section 987 gain for the taxable year is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the hedging loss. The amount of hedging loss that reduces unrecognized section 987 gain under this paragraph (d)(2)(i) is not recognized under section 988. Any hedging loss that does not reduce unrecognized section 987 gain under this paragraph (d)(2)(i) is recognized under section 988.
(ii)
Hedging gain.
In a taxable year in which an owner has hedging gain with respect to a hedged QBU and has unrecognized section 987 loss for the taxable year with respect to the hedged QBU (as determined under § 1.987-4(d), without regard to this paragraph (d)), the unrecognized section 987 loss for the taxable year is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the hedging gain. The amount of hedging gain that reduces unrecognized section 987 loss under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) is not recognized under section 988. Any hedging gain that does not reduce unrecognized section 987 loss under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) is recognized under section 988.
(3)
Termination of a hedged QBU.
If the owner of a section 987 QBU has entered into a section 987 hedging transaction with respect to the section 987 QBU and the hedged QBU terminates, the owner's hedging gain or loss with respect to the hedged QBU for the taxable year is equal to the hedging gain or loss that the owner would (but for the application of this paragraph (d)) recognize with respect to the section 987 hedging transaction under the mark-to-market method of accounting described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section if the taxable year ended on the termination date. Appropriate adjustments must be made to prevent the section 988 gain or loss from being taken into account again after it is applied to reduce unrecognized section 987 gain or loss under this paragraph (d).
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section. For purposes of the examples, DC1
is a domestic corporation that owns Business A, a section 987 QBU that has the euro as its functional currency. A current rate election is in effect for years 1 and 2, but no other elections are in effect. In year 1, DC1 had net unrecognized section 987 loss (determined under § 1.987-4(b)) of $1,000x with respect to Business A, and Business A did not make a remittance in year 1. As a result, in year 2, DC1's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 loss from prior taxable years (determined under § 1.987-4(c)) was $1,000x. In year 2, DC1 had unrecognized section 987 loss for the taxable year (determined under § 1.987-4(d) before the application of paragraph (d) of this section) of $500x.
(1)
Example 1: Section 987 hedging transaction
—(i)
Facts.
In year 2, DC1 entered into a six-month foreign currency forward contract with an unrelated bank in the normal course of DC1's trade or business for the purpose of managing exchange rate risk with respect to DC1's net investment in Business A. On the same day, DC1 identified the forward contract as a section 987 hedging transaction with respect to Business A under paragraph (c) of this section. Under generally accepted accounting principles, currency gain or loss from the forward contract is accounted for as a cumulative translation adjustment to shareholder's equity. For Federal income tax purposes, DC1 accounts for section 988 gain or loss with respect to the forward contract under a mark-to-market method of accounting. But for the application of paragraph (d) of this section, DC1 would recognize $400x of section 988 gain with respect to the forward contract.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Qualification of the hedge as a section 987 hedging transaction.
The forward contract qualifies as a section 987 hedging transaction under paragraph (b) of this section because it is a financial instrument that manages DC1's exchange rate risk with respect to Business A (the hedged QBU) as part of the normal course of DC1's trade or business, and the hedge meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(B)
Treatment of the section 987 hedging transaction.
But for the application of paragraph (d) of this section, DC1 would recognize $400x of section 988 gain with respect to the forward contract in year 2. Therefore, DC1 has $400x of hedging gain in year 2. In year 2, DC1 had unrecognized section 987 loss of $500x for the taxable year (determined under § 1.987-4(d) before the application of paragraph (d) of this section). Therefore, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, DC1's unrecognized section 987 loss for the taxable year of $500x is reduced by the $400x of hedging gain. Accordingly, DC1 has unrecognized section 987 loss of $100x for the taxable year with respect to Business A. Under § 1.987-4(b), DC1 has $1,100x of net unrecognized section 987 loss in year 2 (equal to the sum of its net accumulated section 987 loss of $1,000x from prior taxable years and its unrecognized section 987 loss for the taxable year of $100x). DC1 does not recognize its hedging gain under section 988 because all of the hedging gain reduces unrecognized section 987 loss for the taxable year.
(2)
Example 2: Excess hedging gain from a section 987 hedging transaction
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (
Example 1
) except that, but for the application of paragraph (d) of this section, DC1 would recognize $600x of section 988 gain with respect to the forward contract.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, DC1's unrecognized section 987 loss for the taxable year of $500x is reduced by the hedging gain, but not below zero. Accordingly, $500x of the hedging gain is applied to reduce DC1's unrecognized section 987 loss for the taxable year to zero. DC1 has $1,000x of net unrecognized section 987 loss in year 2 under § 1.987-4(b) (equal to its net accumulated section 987 loss of $1,000x from prior taxable years). The $500x hedging gain that reduces unrecognized section 987 loss for the taxable year is not recognized under section 988. The excess amount of hedging gain ($100x) is recognized by DC1 under section 988.

§ 1.988-1
Certain definitions and special rules.
(a)
Section 988 transaction
—(1)
In general.
The term “section 988 transaction” means any of the following transactions—
(i) A disposition of nonfunctional currency as defined in paragraph (c) of this section;
(ii) Any transaction described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section if any amount which the taxpayer is entitled to receive or is required to pay by reason of such transaction is denominated in terms of a nonfunctional currency or is determined by reference to the value of one or more nonfunctional currencies.
A transaction described in this paragraph (a) need not require or permit payment with a nonfunctional currency as long as any amount paid or received is determined by reference to the value of one or more nonfunctional currencies. The acquisition of nonfunctional currency is treated as a section 988 transaction for purposes of establishing the taxpayer's basis in such currency and determining exchange gain or loss thereon.
(2)
Description of transactions.
The following transactions are described in this paragraph (a)(2).
(i)
Debt instruments.
Acquiring a debt instrument or becoming an obligor under a debt instrument. The term “debt instrument” means a bond, debenture, note, certificate or other evidence of indebtedness.
(ii)
Payables, receivables, etc.
Accruing, or otherwise taking into account, for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, any item of expense or gross income or receipts which is to be paid or received after the date on which so accrued or taken into account. A payable relating to cost of goods sold, or a payable or receivable relating to a capital expenditure or receipt, is within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii). Generally, a payable relating to foreign taxes (whether or not claimed as a credit under section 901) is within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii). However, a payable of a domestic person relating to accrued foreign taxes of its qualified business unit (QBU branch) is not within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii) if the QBU branch's functional currency is the U.S. dollar and the foreign taxes are claimed as a credit under section 901.
(iii)
Forward contract, futures contract, option contract, or similar financial instrument.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) and paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, entering into or acquiring any forward contract, futures contract, option, warrant, or similar financial instrument.
(A)
Limitation for certain derivative instruments.
A forward contract, futures contract, option, warrant, or similar financial instrument is within this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) only if the underlying property to which the instrument ultimately relates is a nonfunctional currency or is otherwise described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. Thus, if the underlying property of an instrument is another financial instrument (
e.g.,
an option on a futures contract), then the underlying property to which such other instrument (
e.g.,
the futures contract) ultimately relates must be a nonfunctional currency. For example, a forward contract to purchase wheat denominated in a nonfunctional currency, an option to enter into a forward contract to purchase wheat denominated in a nonfunctional currency, or a warrant to purchase stock denominated in a nonfunctional currency is not described in this paragraph (a)(2)(iii). On the other hand, a forward contract to purchase a nonfunctional currency, an option to enter into a forward contract to purchase a nonfunctional currency, an option to purchase a bond denominated in or the payments of which are determined by reference to the value of a nonfunctional currency, or a warrant to purchase nonfunctional currency is described in this paragraph (a)(2)(iii).
(B)
Nonfunctional currency notional principal contracts
—(
1
)
In general.
The term “similar financial instrument” includes a notional principal contract only if the payments required to be made or received under the contract are determined with reference to a nonfunctional currency.
(
2
)
Definition of notional principal contract.
The term “notional principal contract” means a contract (
e.g.,
a swap, cap, floor or collar) that provides for the payment of amounts by one party to another at specified intervals calculated by reference to a specified index upon a notional principal amount in exchange for specified consideration or a promise to pay similar amounts. For this purpose, a “notional principal contract” shall only include an instrument where the underlying property to which the instrument ultimately relates is money (
e.g.,
functional currency), nonfunctional currency, or property the value of which is determined by reference to an interest rate. Thus, the term “notional principal contract” includes a currency swap as defined in § 1.988-2(e)(2)(ii), but does not include a swap referenced to a commodity or equity index.
(C)
Effective date with respect to certain contracts.
This paragraph (a)(2)(iii) does not apply to any forward contract, futures contract, option, warrant, or similar financial instrument entered into or acquired on or before October 21, 1988, if such instrument would have been marked to market under section 1256 if held on the last day of the taxable year.
(3) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.988-1T(a)(3).
(4)-(5) [Reserved]
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a) of this section. The examples assume that X is a U.S. corporation on an accrual method with the calendar year as its taxable year. Because X is a U.S. corporation the U.S. dollar is its functional currency under section 985. The examples also assume that section 988(d) does not apply.

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1989, X acquires 10,000 Canadian dollars. On January 15, 1989, X uses the 10,000 Canadian dollars to purchase inventory. The acquisition of the 10,000 Canadian dollars is a section 988 transaction for purposes of establishing X's basis in such Canadian dollars. The disposition of the 10,000 Canadian dollars is a section 988 transaction pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 2.
On January 1, 1989, X acquires 10,000 Canadian dollars. On January 15, 1989, X converts the 10,000 Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. The acquisition of the 10,000 Canadian dollars is a section 988 transaction for purposes of establishing X's basis in such Canadian dollars. The conversion of the 10,000 Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars is a section 988 transaction pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 3.
On January 1, 1989, X borrows 100,000 British pounds (£) for a period of 10 years and issues a note to the lender with a face amount of £100,000. The note provides for payments of interest at an annual rate of 10% paid quarterly in pounds and has a stated redemption price at maturity of £100,000. X's becoming the obligor under the note is a section 988 transaction pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(i) of this section. Because X is an accrual basis taxpayer, the accrual of interest expense under X's note is a section 988 transaction pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section. In addition, the acquisition of the British pounds to make payments under the note is a section 988 transaction for purposes of establishing X's basis in such pounds, and the disposition of such pounds is a section 988 transaction under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. See § 1.988-2(b) with respect to the translation of accrued interest expense and the determination of exchange gain or loss upon payment of accrued interest expense.

# Example 4.
On January 1, 1989, X purchases an original issue for 74,621.54 British pounds (£) a 3-year bond maturing on December 31, 1991, at a stated redemption price of £100,000. The bond provides for no stated interest. The bond has a yield to maturity of 10% compounded semiannually and has £25,378.46 of original issue discount. The acquisition of the bond is a section 988 transaction as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(i) of this section. The accrual of original issue discount with respect to the bond is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section. See § 1.988-2(b) with respect to the translation of original issue discount and the determination of exchange gain or loss upon receipt of such amounts.

# Example 5.
On January 1, 1989, X sells and delivers inventory to Y for 10,000,000 Italian lira for payment on April 1, 1989. Under X's method of accounting, January 1, 1989 is the accrual date. Because X is an accrual basis taxpayer, the accrual of a nonfunctional currency denominated item of gross receipts on January 1, 1989, for payment after the date of accrual is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section.

# Example 6.
On January 1, 1989, X agrees to purchase a machine from Y for delivery on March 1, 1990 for 1,000,000 yen. The agreement calls for X to pay Y for the machine on June 1, 1990. Under X's method of accounting, the expenditure for the machine does not accrue until delivery on March 1, 1990. The agreement to purchase the machine is not a section 988 transaction. In particular, the agreement to purchase the machine is not described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section because the agreement is not an item of expense taken into account under subtitle A (but rather is an agreement to purchase a capital asset in the future). However, the payable that will arise on the delivery date is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section even though the payable relates to a capital expenditure. In addition, the disposition of yen to satisfy the payable on June 1, 1990, is a section 988 transaction under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

# Example 7.
On January 1, 1989, X purchases and takes delivery of inventory for 10,000 French francs with payment to be made on April 1, 1989. Under X's method of accounting, the expense accrues on January 1, 1989. On January 1, 1989, X also enters into a forward contract with a bank to purchase 10,000 French francs for $2,000 on April 1, 1989. Because X is an accrual basis taxpayer, the accrual of a nonfunctional currency denominated item of expense on January 1, 1989, for payment after the date of accrual is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section. Entering into the forward contract to purchase the 10,000 French francs is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) of this section.

# Example 8.
On January 1, 1989, X acquires 100,000 Norwegian krone. On January 15, 1989, X purchases and takes delivery of 1,000 shares of common stock with the 100,000 krone acquired on January 1, 1989. On August 1, 1989, X sells the 1,000 shares of common stock and receives 120,000 krone in payment. On August 30, 1989, X converts the 120,000 krone to U.S. dollars. The acquisition of the 100,000 krone on January 1, 1989, and the acquisition of the 120,000 krone on August 1, 1989, are section 988 transactions for purposes of establishing the basis of such krone. The disposition of the 100,000 krone on January 15, 1989, and the 120,000 krone on August 30, 1989, are section 988 transactions as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. Neither the acquisition on January 15, 1989, nor the disposition on August 1, 1989, of the stock is a section 988 transaction.

# Example 9.
On May 11, 1989, X purchases a one year note at original issue for its issue price of $1,000. The note pays interest in dollars at the rate of 4 percent compounded semiannually. The amount of principal received by X upon maturity is equal to $1,000 plus the equivalent of the excess, if any, of (a) the Financial Times One Hundred Stock Index (an index of stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange hereafter referred to as the FT100) determined and translated into dollars on the last business day prior to the maturity date, over (b) £2,150, the “stated value” of the FT100, which is equal to 110% of the average value of the index for the six months prior to the issue date, translated at the exchange rate of £1 = $1.50. The purchase by X of the instrument described above is not a section 988 transaction because the index used to compute the principal amount received upon maturity is determined with reference to the value of stock and not nonfunctional currency.

# Example 10.
On April 9, 1989, X enters into an interest rate swap that provides for the payment of amounts by X to its counterparty based on 4% of a 10,000 yen principal amount in exchange for amounts based on yen LIBOR rates. Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) of this section, this yen for yen interest rate swap is a section 988 transaction.

# Example 11.
On August 11, 1989, X enters into an option contract for sale of a group of stocks traded on the Japanese Nikkei exchange. The contract is not a section 988 transaction within the meaning of § 1.988-1(a)(2)(iii) because the underlying property to which the option relates is a group of stocks and not nonfunctional currency.

Special rules for regulated futures contracts and non-equity options
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section, paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section shall not apply to any regulated futures contract or non-equity option which would be marked to market under section 1256 if held on the last day of the taxable year.
(ii)

Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, a taxpayer may elect to have paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section apply to regulated futures contracts and non-equity options as provided in paragraphs (a)(7)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
(iii)
Procedure for making the election.
A taxpayer shall make the election provided in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section by sending to the Internal Revenue Service Center, Examination Branch, Stop Number 92, Kansas City, MO 64999 a statement titled “Election to Treat Regulated Futures Contracts and Non-Equity Options as Section 988 Transactions Under Section 988
(c)(1)(D)(ii)” that contains the following:
(A) The taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(B) The date the notice is mailed or otherwise delivered to the Internal Revenue Service Center;
(C) A statement that the taxpayer (including all members of such person's affiliated group as defined in section 1504 or in the case of an individual all persons filing a joint return with such individual) elects to have section 988(c)(1)(D)(i) and § 1.988-1(a)(7)(i) not apply;
(D) The date of the beginning of the taxable year for which the election is being made;
(E) If the election is filed after the first day of the taxable year, a statement regarding whether the taxpayer has previously held a contract described in section 988(c)(1)(D)(i) or § 1.988-1(a)(7)(i) during such taxable year, and if so, the first date during the taxable year on which such contract was held; and
(F) The signature of the person making the election (in the case of individuals filing a joint return, the signature of all persons filing such return).
The election shall be made by the following persons: in the case of an individual, by such individual; in the case of a partnership, by each partner separately; effective for taxable years beginning after March 17, 1992, in the case of tiered partnerships, each ultimate partner; in the case of an S corporation, by each shareholder separately; in the case of a trust (other than a grantor trust) or estate, by the fiduciary of such trust or estate; in the case of any corporation other than an S corporation, by such corporation (in the case of a corporation that is a member of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return, such election shall be valid and binding only if made by the common parent, as that term is used in § 1.1502-77(a)); in the case of a controlled foreign corporation, by its controlling United States shareholders under § 1.964-1(c)(3). With respect to a corporation (other than an S corporation), the election, when made by the common parent, shall be binding on all members of such corporation's affiliated group as defined in section 1504 that file a consolidated return. The election shall be binding on any income or loss derived from the partner's share (determined under the principles of section 702(a)) of all contracts described in section 988(c)(1)(D)(i) or paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section in which the taxpayer holds a direct interest or indirect interest through a partnership or S corporation; however, the election shall not apply to any income or loss of a partnership for any taxable year if such partnership made an election under section 988(c)(1)(E)(iii)(V) for such year or any preceding year. Generally, a copy of the election must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the first year it is effective. It is not required to be attached to subsequent returns. However, in the case of a partner, a copy of the election must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for every year during which the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership that engages in a transaction that is subject to the election.
(iv)
Time for making the election
—(A)
In general.
Unless the requirements for making a late election described in paragraph (a)(7)(iv)(B) of this section are satisfied, an election under section 988 (c)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section for any taxable year shall be made on or before the first day of the taxable year or, if later, on or before the first day during such taxable year on which the taxpayer holds a contract described in section 988(c)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section. The election under section 988(c)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section shall apply to contracts entered into or acquired after October 21, 1988, and held on or after the effective date of the election. The election shall be effective as of the beginning of the taxable year and shall be binding with respect to all succeeding taxable years unless revoked with the prior consent of the Commissioner. In determining whether to grant revocation of the election, recapture of the tax benefit derived from the election in previous taxable years will be considered.
(B)
Late elections.
A taxpayer may make an election under section 988(c)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (a)(7)(ii)
of this section within 30 days after the time prescribed in the first sentence of paragraph (a)(7)(iv)(A) of this section. Such a late election shall be effective as of the beginning of the taxable year; however, any losses recognized during the taxable year with respect to contracts described in section 988(c)(1)(D)(ii) or paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section which were entered into or acquired after October 21, 1988, and held on or before the date on which the late election is mailed or otherwise delivered to the Internal Revenue Service Center shall not be treated as derived from a section 988 transaction. A late election must comply with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section.
(v)
Transition rule.
An election made prior to September 21, 1989 which satisfied the requirements of Notice 88-124, 1988-51 I.R.B. 6, shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a)(7)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
(vi)
General effective date provision.
This paragraph (a)(7) shall apply with respect to futures contracts and options entered into or acquired after October 21, 1988.
(8)
Special rules for qualified funds
—(i)
Definition of qualified fund.
The term “qualified fund” means any partnership if—
(A) At all times during the taxable year (and during each preceding taxable year to which an election under section 988(c)(1)(E)(iii)(V) applied) such partnership has at least 20 partners and no single partner owns more than 20 percent of the interests in the capital or profits of the partnership;
(B) The principa1 activity of such partnership for such taxable year (and each such preceding taxable year) consists of buying and selling options, futures, or forwards with respect to commodities;
(C) At least 90 percent of the gross income of the partnership for the taxable year (and each such preceding year) consists of income or gains described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (G) of section 7704(d)(1) or gain from the sale or disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends;
(D) No more than a de minimis amount of the gross income of the partnership for the taxable year (and each such preceding taxable year) was derived from buying and selling commodities; and
(E) An election under section 988 (c)(1)(E)(iii)(V) as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section applies to the taxable year.
(ii)
Special rules relating to paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of this section
—(A)
Certain general partners.
The interest of a general partner in the partnership shall not be treated as failing to meet the 20 percent ownership requirement of paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of this section for any taxable year of the partnership if, for the taxable year of the partner in which such partnership's taxable year ends, such partner (and each corporation filing a consolidated return with such partner) had no ordinary income or loss from a section 988 transaction (other than income from the partnership) which is exchange gain or loss (as the case may be).
(B)
Treatment of incentive compensation.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of this section, any income allocable to a general partner as incentive compensation based on profits rather than capital shall not be taken into account in determining such partner's interest in the profits of the partnership.
(C)
Treatment of tax exempt partners.
The interest of a partner in the partnership shall not be treated as failing to meet the 20 percent ownership requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(8)(A) of this section if none of the income of such partner from such partnership is subject to tax under chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (whether directly or through one or more pass-through entities).
(D)
Look-through rule.
In determining whether the 20 percent ownership requirement of paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of this section is met with respect to any partnership, any interest in such partnership held by another partnership shall be treated as held proportionately by the partners in such other partnership.
(iii)
Other special rules
—(A)
Related persons.
Interests in the partnership held by persons related to each other (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) shall be treated as held by one person.
(B)
Predecessors.
Reference to any partnership shall include a reference to any predecessor thereof.
(C)
Treatment of certain debt instruments.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (a)(8)(i)(D) of this section, any debt instrument which is described in both paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(i) of this section shall be treated as a commodity.

The election shall be made by a general partner with management responsibility of the partnership's activities and a copy of such election shall be attached to the partnership's income tax return (Form 1065) for the first taxable year it is effective. It is not required to be attached to subsequent returns.
(v)
Time for making the election.
The election under section 988(c)(1)(E)(iii)(V) for any taxable year shall be made on or before the first day of the taxable year or, if later, on or before the first day during such year on which the partnership holds an instrument described in section 988(c)(1)(E)(i). The election under section 988(c)(1)(E)(iii)(V) shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all succeeding taxable years. Such election may only be revoked with the consent of the Commissioner. In determining whether to grant revocation of the election, recapture by the partners of the tax benefit derived from the election in previous taxable years will be considered.
(vi)
Operative rules applicable to qualified funds
—(A)
In general.
In the case of a qualified fund, any bank forward contract or any foreign currency futures contract traded on a foreign exchange which is not otherwise a section 1256 contract shall be treated as a section 1256 contract for purposes of section 1256.
(B)
Gains and losses treated as short-term.
In the case of any instrument treated as a section 1256 contract under paragraph (a)(8)(vi)(A) of this section, subparagraph (A) of section 1256(a)(3) shall be applied by substituting “100 percent” for “40 percent” (and subparagraph (B) of such section shall not apply).
(vii)
Transition rule.
An election made prior to September 21, 1989, which satisfied the requirements of Notice 88-124, 1988-51 I.R.B. 6, shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of § 1.988-1(a)(8)(iv) and (v).
(viii)
General effective date rules
—(A) The requirements of subclause (IV) of section 988(c)(1)(E)(iii) shall not apply to contracts entered into or acquired on or before October 21, 1988.
(B) In the case of any partner in an existing partnership, the 20 percent ownership requirements of subclause (I) of section 988(c)(1)(E)(iii) shall be treated as met during any period during which such partner does not own a percentage interest in the capital or profits of such partnership greater than 33
1/3
percent (or, if lower, the lowest such percentage interest of such partner during any period after October 21, 1988, during which such partnership is in existence). For purposes of
the preceding sentence, the term “existing partnership” means any partnership if—
(
1
) Such partnership was in existence on October 21, 1988, and principally engaged on such date in buying and selling options, futures, or forwards with respect to commodities; or
(
2
) A registration statement was filed with respect to such partnership with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or before such date and such registration statement indicated that the principal activity of such partnership will consist of buying and selling instruments referred to in paragraph (a)(8)(viii)(B)(
1
) of this section.
(9)
Exception for certain transactions entered into by an individual
—(i)
In general.
A transaction entered into by an individual which otherwise qualifies as a section 988 transaction shall be considered a section 988 transaction only to the extent expenses properly allocable to such transaction meet the requirements of section 162 or 212 (other than the part of section 212 dealing with expenses incurred in connection with taxes).
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a)(9) of this section.

# Example 1.
X is a U.S. citizen who therefore has the U.S. dollar as his functional currency. On January 1, 1990, X enters into a spot contract to purchase 10,000 British pounds (£) for $15,000 for delivery on January 3, 1990. Immediately upon delivery, X acquires at original issue a pound denominated bond with an issue price of £10,000. The bond matures on January 3, 1993, pays interest in pounds at a rate of 10% compounded semiannually, and has no original issue discount. Assume that all expenses properly allocable to these transactions would meet the requirements of section 212. Under § 1.988-2(d)(1)(ii), entering into the spot contract on January 1, 1990, is not a section 988 transaction. The acquisition of the pounds on January 3, 1990, under the spot contract is a section 988 transaction for purposes of establishing X's basis in the pounds. The disposition of the pounds and the acquisition of the bond by X are section 988 transactions. These transactions are not excluded from the definition of a section 988 transaction under paragraph (a)(9) of this section because expenses properly allocable to such transactions meet the requirements of section 212.

# Example 2.
X is a U.S. citizen who therefore has the dollar as his functional currency. In preparation for X's vacation, X purchases 1,000 British pounds (£) from a bank on June 1, 1989. During the period of X's vacation in the United Kingdom beginning June 10, 1989, and ending June 20, 1989, X spends £500 for hotel rooms, £300 for food and £200 for miscellaneous vacation expenses. The expenses properly allocable to such dispositions do not meet the requirements of section 162 or 212. Thus, the disposition of the pounds by X on his vacation are not section 988 transactions.
(10)
Intra-taxpayer transactions
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section, disregarded transactions between or among the taxpayer and/or qualified business units of that taxpayer (“intra-taxpayer transactions”) are not section 988 transactions. See section 987 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
Certain intra-taxpayer transfers of section 988 transactions that result in the recognition of section 988 gain or loss
—(A)
In general.
Exchange gain or loss with respect to nonfunctional currency or any item described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section entered into with another taxpayer shall be realized upon a transfer (as defined under § 1.987-2(c)) of such currency or item from an owner to a section 987 QBU or from a section 987 QBU to an owner if as a result of such transfer—
(
1
) The currency or item loses its character as nonfunctional currency or as an item described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or
(
2
) The source of the exchange gain or loss could be altered absent the application of paragraph (a)(10)(ii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Computation of exchange gain or loss.
Exchange gain or loss described in section (a)(10)(ii)(A) of this section shall be computed in accordance with § 1.988-2 (without regard to § 1.988-2(b)(8)) as if the nonfunctional currency or item described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section had been sold or otherwise transferred at fair market value between unrelated taxpayers. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a taxpayer must use a translation rate that is consistent with the translation conventions of the section 987 QBU to or from which, as the case may be, the item is being transferred. In the case of a gain or loss incurred in a transaction described in this paragraph (a)(10)(ii)
that does not have a significant business purpose, the Commissioner may defer such gain or loss.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (a)(10).

# Example.
(A) X, a corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, operates through foreign branches Y and Z. Y and Z are qualified business units as defined in section 989(a) with the LC as their functional currency. X computes Y's and Z's income under section 987 (relating to branch transactions). On November 12, 1988, Y transfers $25 to the home office of X when the fair market value of such amount equals LC120. Y has a basis of LC100 in the $25. Under paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section, Y realizes foreign source exchange gain of LC20 (LC120—LC100) as the result of the $25 transfer. For purposes of determining whether the transfer is a remittance resulting in additional gain or loss, see section 987 and the regulations thereunder.
(B) If instead Y transfers the $25 to Z, exchange gain is not realized because the $25 is nonfunctional currency with respect to Z and if Z were to immediately convert the $25 into LCs, the gain would be foreign source. For purposes of determining whether the transfer is a remittance resulting in additional gain or loss, see section 987 and the regulations thereunder.
(11)
Authority to include or exclude transactions from section 988
—(i)
In general.
The Commissioner may recharacterize a transaction (or series of transactions) in whole or in part as a section 988 transaction if the effect of such transaction (or series of transactions) is to avoid section 988. In addition, the Commissioner may exclude a transaction (or series of transactions) which in form is a section 988 transaction from the provisions of section 988 if the substance of the transaction (or series of transactions) indicates that it is not properly considered a section 988 transaction.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (a)(11).

# Example.
B is an individual with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. B holds 500,000 Swiss francs which have a basis of $100,000 and a fair market value of $400,000 as of October 15, 1989. On October 16, 1989, B transfers the 500,000 Swiss francs to a newly formed U.S. corporation, X, with the dollar as its functional currency. On October 16, 1989, B sells the stock of X for $400,000. Assume the transfer to X qualified for nonrecognition under section 351. Because the sale of the stock of X is a substitute for the disposition of an asset subject to section 988, the Commissioner may recharacterize the sale of the stock as a section 988 transaction. The same result would obtain if B transferred the Swiss francs to a partnership and then sold the partnership interest.
(b)
Spot contract.
A spot contract is a contract to buy or sell nonfunctional currency on or before two business days following the date of the execution of the contract. See § 1.988-2 (d)(1)(ii) for operative rules regarding spot contracts.
(c)
Nonfunctional currency.
The term “nonfunctional currency” means with respect to a taxpayer or a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989 (a)) a currency (including the European Currency Unit) other than the taxpayer's or the qualified business unit's functional currency as defined in section 985 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relating to nonrecognition of exchange gain or loss with respect to certain dispositions of nonfunctional currency, see § 1.988-2 (a)(1)(iii).
(d)
Spot rate
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the term “spot rate” means a rate demonstrated to the satisfaction of the District Director or the Assistant Commissioner (International) to reflect a fair market rate of exchange available to the public for currency under a spot contract in a free market and involving representative amounts. In the absence of such a demonstration, the District Director or the Assistant Commissioner (International), in his or her sole discretion, shall determine the spot rate from a source of exchange rate information reflecting actual transactions conducted in a free market. For example, the taxpayer or the District Director or the Assistant Commissioner (International) may determine the spot rate by reference to exchange rates published in the pertinent monthly issue of “International Financial Statistics” or a successor publication of the International Monetary Fund; exchange rates published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to 31 U.S.C. section 5151; exchange rates published in newspapers, financial journals or other
daily financial news sources; or exchange rates quoted by electronic financial news services.
(2)
Consistency required in valuing transactions subject to section 988.
If the use of inconsistent sources of spot rate quotations results in the distortion of income, the District Director or the Assistant Commissioner (International) may determine the appropriate spot rate.
(3)
Use of certain spot rate conventions for payables and receivables denominated in nonfunctional currency.
If consistent with the taxpayer's financial accounting, a taxpayer may utilize a spot rate convention determined at intervals of one quarter year or less for purposes of computing exchange gain or loss with respect to payables and receivables denominated in a nonfunctional currency that are incurred in the ordinary course of business with respect to the acquisition or sale of goods or the obtaining or performance of services. For example, if consistent with the taxpayer's financial accounting, a taxpayer may accrue all payables and receivables incurred during the month of January at the spot rate on December 31 or January 31 (or at an average of any spot rates occurring between these two dates) and record the payment or receipt of amounts in satisfaction of such payables and receivables consistent with such convention. The use of a spot rate convention cannot be changed without the consent of the Commissioner.
(4)
Currency where an official government established rate differs from a free market rate
—(i)
In general.
If a currency has an official government established rate that differs from a free market rate, the spot rate shall be the rate which most clearly reflects the taxpayer's income. Generally, this shall be the free market rate.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(4).

# Example 1.
X is an accrual method U.S. corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. X owns all the stock of a Country L subsidiary, CFC. CFC has the currency of Country L, the LC, as its functional currency. Country L imposes restrictions on the remittance of dividends. On April 1, 1990, CFC pays a dividend to X in the amount of LC100. Assume that the official governnent established rate is $1 = LC1 and the free market rate, which takes into account the remittance restrictions and which is the rate that most clearly reflects income, is $1 = LC4. On April 1, 1990, X donates the LC100 in a transaction that otherwise qualifies as a charitable contribution under section 170 (c). Both the amount of the dividend income and the deduction under section 170 is $25 (LC100 × the free market rate, $.25).

# Example 2.
X, a corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, operates in foreign country L through branch Y. Y is a qualified business unit as defined in section 989 (a). X computes Y's income under the dollar approximate separate transactions method as described in § 1.985-3. The currency of L is the LC. X can purchase legally United States dollars ($) in L only from the L government. In order to take advantage of an arbitrage between the official and secondary dollar to LC exchange rates in L:
(i) X purchases LC100 for $60 in L on the secondary market when the official exchange rate is S1 = LC1;
(ii) X transfers the LC100 to Y;
(iii) Y purchases $100 for LC100; and
(iv) Y transfers $65 ($100 less an L tax withheld of $35 on the transfer) to the home office of X.
Under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the transfer of the LC100 by X to Y is a realization event. X has a basis of $60 in the LC100. Under these facts, the appropriate dollar to LC exchange rate for computing the amount realized by X is the official exchange rate. Therefore, X realizes $40 ($100-$60) of U.S. source gain from the transfer to Y. The same result would obtain if Y rather than X purchased the LC100 on the secondary market in L with $60 supplied by X, because the substance of this transaction is that X is performing the arbitrage.
(e)
Exchange gain or loss.
The term “exchange gain or loss” means the amount of gain or loss realized as determined in § 1.988-2 with respect to a section 988 transaction. Except as otherwise provided in these regulations (
e.g.,
§ 1.98B-5), the amount of exchange gain or loss from a section 988 transaction shall be separately computed for each section 988 transaction, and such amount shall not be integrated with gain or loss recognized on another transaction (whether or not such transaction is economically related to the section 988 transaction). See § 1.988-2 (b)(8) for a special rule with respect to debt instruments.
(f)
Hyperinflationary currency
—(1)
Definition
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of
section 988, a hyperinflationary currency means a currency described in § 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D). Unless otherwise provided, the currency in any example used in §§ 1.988-1 through 1.988-5 is not a hyperinflationary currency.
(ii)
Special rules for determining base period.
In determining whether a currency is hyperinflationary under § 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) for purposes of this paragraph (f), the following rules will apply:
(A) The base period means the thirty-six calendar month period ending on the last day of the taxpayer's (or qualified business unit's) current taxable year. Thus, for example, if for 1996, 1997, and 1998, a country's annual inflation rates are 6 percent, 11 percent, and 90 percent, respectively, the cumulative inflation rate for the three-year base period is 124% [((1.06 × 1.11 × 1.90) − 1.0 = 1.24) × 100 = 124%]. Accordingly, assuming the QBU has a calendar year as its taxable year, the currency of the country is hyperinflationary for the 1998 taxable year. This change in the § 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) base period shall not apply to any section 988 transaction of an entity described in section 851 (regulated investment company (RIC)) or section 856 (real estate investment trust (REIT)). The Service may, by notice, provide that the foregoing change in the § 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) base period does not apply to any section 988 transaction of an entity with distribution requirements similar to a RIC or REIT.
(B) The last sentence of § 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) shall not apply to alter the base period for purposes of this paragraph (f) in determining whether a currency is hyperinflationary for purposes of section 988. Accordingly, generally accepted accounting principles may not apply to alter the base period for purposes of this paragraph (f).
(2)
Effective date.
Paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall apply to transactions entered into after February 14, 2000.
(g)
Fair market value.
The fair market value of an item shall, where relevant, reflect an appropriate premium or discount for the time value of money (
e.g.,
the fair market value of a forward contract to buy or sell nonfunctional currency shall reflect the present value of the difference between the units of nonfunctional currency times the market forward rate at the time of valuation and the units of nonfunctional currency times the forward rate set forth in the contract). However, if consistent with the taxpayer's method of financial accounting (and consistently applied from year to year), the preceding sentence shall not apply to a financial instrument that matures within one year from the date of issuance or acquisition. Unless otherwise provided, the fair market value given in any example used in §§ 1.988-1 through 1.988-5 is deemed to reflect appropriately the time value of money. If the use of inconsistent sources of forward or other market rate quotations results in the distortion of income, the District Director or the Assistant Commissioner (International) may determine the appropriate rate.
(h)
Interaction with sections 1092 and 1256.
Unless otherwise provided, it is assumed for purposes of §§ 1.988-1 through 1.988-5 that any contract used in any example is not a section 1256 contract and is not part of a straddle as defined in section 1092. No inference is intended regarding the application of section 1092 or 1256 unless expressly stated.
(i)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Thus, except as otherwise provided in this section, any payments made or received with respect to a section 988 transaction in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, are subject to this section.
(2)
Paragraph (a)(10)(ii).
Generally, paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. However, if pursuant to § 1.987-15(b), a taxpayer chooses to apply §§ 1.987-1 through 1.987-15 to a taxable year before the first taxable year described in § 1.987-15(a)(1), then paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section applies to that taxable year.
See
§ 1.988-1(i), as contained in 26 CFR in part 1 in
effect on April 1, 2024, for a prior applicability date for paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section.

(3)
Specified owner functional currency transactions of a section 987 QBU not treated as section 988 transactions.
Specified owner functional currency transactions, as defined in § 1.987-3T(b)(4)(ii), held by a section 987 QBU are not treated as section 988 transactions. Thus, no currency gain or loss shall be recognized by a section 987 QBU under section 988 with respect to such transactions.
(4) through (i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.988-1(a)(4) through (i).
(j)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after one year after the first day of the first taxable year following December 7, 2016. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a taxpayer makes an election under § 1.987-11(b), then this section applies to taxable years to which §§ 1.987-1 through 1.987-10 apply as a result of such election.

§ 1.988-2
Recognition and computation of exchange gain or loss.
(a)
Disposition of nonfunctional currency
—(1)
Recognition of exchange gain or loss
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, § 1.988-1(a)(7)(ii), and § 1.988-5, the recognition of exchange gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of nonfunctional currency shall be governed by the recognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which apply to the sale or disposition of property (
e.g.,
section 1001 or, to the extent provided in regulations, section 1092). The disposition of nonfunctional currency in settlement of a forward contract, futures contract, option contract, or similar financial instrument is considered to be a sale or disposition of the nonfunctional currency for purposes of the preceding sentence.
(ii)
Clarification of section 1031.
An amount of one nonfunctional currency is not “property of like kind” with respect to an amount of a different nonfunctional currency.
(iii)
Coordination with section 988(c)(1)(C)(ii).
No exchange gain or loss is recognized with respect to the following transactions—
(A) An exchange of units of nonfunctional currency for different units of the same nonfunctional currency;
(B) The deposit of nonfunctional currency in a demand or time deposit or similar instrument (including a certificate of deposit) issued by a bank or other financial institution if such instrument is denominated in such currency;
(C) The withdrawal of nonfunctional currency from a demand or time deposit or similar instrument issued by a bank or other financial institution if such instrument is denominated in such currency;
(D) The receipt of nonfunctional currency from a bank or other financial institution from which the taxpayer purchased a certificate of deposit or similar instrument denominated in such currency by reason of the maturing or other termination of such instrument; and
(E) The transfer of nonfunctional currency from a demand or time deposit or similar instrument issued by a bank or other financial institution to another demand or time deposit or similar instrument denominated in the same nonfunctional currency issued by a bank or other financial institution.
The taxpayer's basis in the units of nonfunctional currency or other property received in the transaction shall be the adjusted basis of the units of nonfunctional currency or other property transferred. See paragraph (b) of
this section with respect to the timing of interest income or expense and the determination of exchange gain or loss thereon.
(iv)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

# Example.
X is a corporation on the accrual method of accounting with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1989, X acquires 1,500 British pounds (£) for $2,250 (£1 = $1.50). On January 3, 1989, when the spot rate is £1 = $1.49, X deposits the £1,500 with a British financial institution in a non-interest bearing demand account. On February 1, 1989, when the spot rate is £1 = $1.45, X withdraws the £1,500. On February 5, 1989, when the spot rate is £1 = $1.42, X purchases inventory in the amount of £1,500. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, no exchange loss is realized until February 5, 1989, when X disposes of the £1,500 for inventory. At that time, X realizes exchange loss in the amount of $120 computed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The loss is not an adjustment to the cost of the inventory.
(2)
Computation of gain or loss
—(i)
In general.
Exchange gain realized from the sale or other disposition of nonfunctional currency shall be the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of such currency, and exchange loss realized shall be the excess of the adjusted basis of such currency over the amount realized.
(ii)
Amount realized
—(A)
In general.
The amount realized from the disposition of nonfunctional currency shall be determined under section 1001(b). A taxpayer that uses a spot rate convention under § 1.988-1(d)(3) to determine exchange gain or loss with respect to a payable shall determine the amount realized upon the disposition of nonfunctional currency paid in satisfaction of the payable in a manner consistent with such convention.
(B)
Exchange of nonfunctional currency for property.
For purpose of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the exchange of nonfunctional currency for property (other than nonfunctional currency) shall be treated as—
(
1
) An exchange of the units of nonfunctional currency for units of functional currency at the spot rate on the date of the exchange, and
(
2
) The purchase or sale of the property for such units of functional currency.
(C)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

# Example.
G is a U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1989, G enters into a contract to purchase a paper manufacturing machine for 10,000,000 British pounds (£) for delivery on January 1, 1991. On January 1, 1991, when G exchanges £10,000,000 (which G purchased for $12,000,000) for the machine, the fair market value of the machine is £17,000,000. On January 1, 1991, the spot exchange rate is £1 = $1.50. Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the transaction is treated as an exchange of £10,000,000 for $15,000,000 and the purchase of the machine for $15,000,000. Accordingly, in computing G's exchange gain of $3,000,000 on the disposition of the £10,000,000, the amount realized is $15,000,000. G's basis in the machine is $15,000,000. No gain is recognized on the bargain purchase of the machine.
(iii)
Adjusted basis
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, the adjusted basis of nonfunctional currency is determined under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (
e.g.,
sections 1011 through 1023). A taxpayer that uses a spot rate convention under § 1.988-1 (d)(3) to determine exchange gain or loss with respect to a receivable shall determine the basis of nonfunctional currency received in satisfaction of such receivable in a manner consistent with such convention.
(B)
Determination of the basis of nonfunctional currency withdrawn from an account with a bank or other financial institution
—(
1
)
In general.
The basis of nonfunctional currency withdrawn from an account with a bank or other financial institution shall be determined under any reasonable method that is consistently applied from year to year by the taxpayer to all accounts denominated in a nonfunctional currency. For example, a taxpayer may use a first in first out method, a last in first out method, a pro rata method (as illustrated in the example below), or any other reasonable method that is consistently applied. However, a method that consistently results in units of nonfunctional currency with the highest basis being withdrawn first shall not be considered reasonable.
(
2
)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B).

# Example.
(i) X, a cash basis individual with the dollar as his functional currency, opens a demand account with a Swiss bank. Assume expenses associated with the demand account are deductible under section 212. The following chart indicates Swiss franc deposits to the account, Swiss franc interest credited to the account, the dollar basis of each deposit, and the determination of the aggregate dollar basis of all Swiss francs in the account. Assume that the taxpayer has properly translated all the amounts specified in the chart and that all transactions are subject to section 988.

(ii) On January 1, 1990, X withdraws 500 Swiss francs from the account. X may determine his basis in the Swiss francs by multiplying the aggregate U.S. dollar basis of Swiss francs in the account by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Swiss francs withdrawn from the account and the denominator is the total number of Swiss francs in the account. Under this method, X's basis in the 500 Swiss francs is $250 computed as follows:
EC09OC91.070
(iii) X's basis in the Swiss francs remaining in the account is $350 ($600−$250). X must use this method consistently from year to year with respect to withdrawals of nonfunctional currency from all of X's accounts.
(C)
Basis in refunded foreign income tax.
See § 1.986(a)-1(e) for rules relating to the determination of basis in refunded foreign income tax denominated in nonfunctional currency.
(iv) Purchase and sale of stock or securities traded on an established securities market by cash basis taxpayer—
(A)
Amount realized.
If stock or securities traded on an established securities market are sold by a cash basis taxpayer for nonfunctional currency, the amount realized with respect to the stock or securities (as determined on the trade date) shall be computed by translating the units of nonfunctional currency received into functional currency at the spot rate on the settlement date of the sale. This rule applies notwithstanding that the stock or securities are treated as disposed of on a date other than the settlement date under another section of the Code. See section 453(k).
(B)
Basis.
If stock or securities traded on an established securities market are purchased by a cash basis taxpayer for nonfunctional currency, the basis of the stock or securities shall be determined by translating the units of nonfunctional currency paid into functional currency at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase.
(C)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (a)(2)(iv).

# Example.
On November 1, 1989 (the trade date), X, a calendar year cash basis U.S. individual, purchases stock for £100 for settlement on November 5, 1989. On November 1, 1989, the spot value of the £100 is $140. On November 5, 1989, X purchases £100 for $141 which X uses to pay for the stock. X's basis in the stock is $141. On December 30, 1990 (the trade date), X sells the stock for £110 for settlement on January 5, 1991. On December 30, 1990, the spot value of £110 is $165. On January 5, 1991, X transfers the stock and receives £110 which, translated at the spot rate, equal $166. Under section 453(k), the stock is considered disposed of on December 30, 1990. The amount realized with respect to such disposition is the value of the £110 on January 5, 1991 ($166). Accordingly, X's gain realized on December 30, 1990, from the disposition of the stock is $25 ($166 amount realized less $141 basis). X's basis in the £110 received from the sale of the stock is $166.
(v)
Purchase and sale of stock or securities traded on an established securities market by accrual basis taxpayer.
For taxable years beginning after March 17, 1992, an accrual basis taxpayer may elect to apply the rules of paragraph
(a)(2)(iv) of this section. The election shall be made by filing a statement with the taxpayer's first return in which the election is effective clearly indicating that the election has been made. A method so elected must be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the Commissioner.
(b)
Translation of interest income or expense and determination of exchange gain or loss with respect to debt instruments
—(1)
Translation of interest income received with respect to a nonfunctional currency demand account.
Interest income received with respect to a demand account with a bank or other financial institution which is denominated in (or the payments of which are determined by reference to) a nonfunctional currency shall be translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date received or accrued or pursuant to any reasonable spot rate convention consistently applied by the taxpayer to all taxable years and to all accounts denominated in nonfunctional currency in the same financial institution. For example, a taxpayer may translate interest income received with respect to a demand account on the last day of each month of the taxable year, on the last day of each quarter of the taxable year, on the last day of each half of the taxable year, or on the last day of the taxable year. No exchange gain or loss is realized upon the receipt or accrual of interest income with respect to a demand account subject to this paragraph (b)(1).
(2)
Translation of nonfunctional currency interest income or expense received or paid with respect to a debt instrument described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(i)
—(i)
Scope
—(A)
In general.
Paragraph (b) of this section only applies to debt instruments described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(i) where all payments are denominated in, or determined with reference to, a single nonfunctional currency. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, this paragraph (b) shall not apply to contingent payment debt instruments.
(B)
Nonfunctional currency contingent payment debt instruments
—(

)
Operative rules.
See § 1.988-6 for rules applicable to contingent payment debt instruments for which one or more payments are denominated in, or determined by reference to, a nonfunctional currency.
(
2
)
Certain instruments are not contingent payment debt instruments.
For purposes of sections 163(e) and 1271 through 1275 and the regulations thereunder, a debt instrument does not provide for contingent payments merely because the instrument is denominated in, or all payments of which are determined with reference to, a single nonfunctional currency. See § 1.988-6 for the treatment of nonfunctional currency contingent payment debt instruments.
(ii)
Determination and translation of interest income or expense
—(A)
In general.
Interest income or expense on a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (including original issue discount determined in accordance with sections 1271 through 1275 and 163(e) as adjusted for acquisition premium under section 1272(a)(7), and acquisition discount determined in accordance with sections 1281 through 1283) shall be determined in units of nonfunctional currency and translated into functional currency as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section. For purposes of sections 483, 1273(b)(5) and 1274, the nonfunctional currency in which an instrument is denominated (or by reference to which payments are determined) shall be considered money.
(B)
Translation of interest income or expense that is not required to be accrued prior to receipt or payment.
With respect to an instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, interest income or expense received or paid that is not required to be accrued by the taxpayer prior to receipt or payment shall be translated at the spot rate on the date of receipt or payment. No exchange gain or loss is realized with respect to the receipt or payment of such interest income or expense (other than the exchange gain or loss that might be realized under paragraph (a) of this section upon the disposition of the nonfunctional currency so received or paid).
(C)
Translation of interest income or expense that is required to be accrued prior to receipt or payment.
With respect to an instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, interest income
or expense that is required to be accrued prior to receipt or payment (
e.g.
, under section 1272, 1281 or 163(e) or because the taxpayer uses an accrual method of accounting) shall be translated at the average rate (or other rate specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) for the interest accrual period or, with respect to an interest accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate (or other rate specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) for the partial period within the taxable year. See paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section for the determination of exchange gain or loss on the receipt or payment of accrued interest income or expense.
(iii)
Determination of average rate or other accrual convention
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the average rate for an accrual period (or partial period) shall be a simple average of the spot exchange rates for each business day of such period or other average exchange rate for the period reasonably derived and consistently applied by the taxpayer.
(B)
Election to use spot accrual convention.
For taxable years beginning after March 17, 1992, a taxpayer may elect to translate interest income and expense at the spot rate on the last day of the interest accrual period (and in the case of a partial accrual period, the spot rate on the last day of the taxable year). If the last day of the interest accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt or payment, the taxpayer may translate interest income or expense at the spot rate on the date of receipt or payment. The election shall be made by filing a statement with the taxpayer's first return in which the election is effective clearly indicating that the election has been made. A method so elected must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the Commissioner.
(3)
Exchange gain or loss recognized by the holder with respect to accrued interest income.
The holder of a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall realize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such accrued interest income is received or the instrument is disposed of (including a deemed disposition under section 1001 that results from a material change in terms of the instrument). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b) (
e.g.
, paragraph (b)(8) of this section), exchange gain or loss realized with respect to accrued interest income shall be recognized in accordance with the applicable recognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The amount of exchange gain or loss so realized with respect to accrued interest income is determined for each accrual period by—
(i) Translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest income received with respect to such accrual period (as determined under the ordering rules of paragraph (b)(7) of this section) into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the interest income is received or the instrument is disposed of (or deemed disposed of), and
(ii) Subtracting from such amount the amount computed by translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest income accrued with respect to such income received at the average rate (or other rate specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) for the accrual period.
(4)
Exchange gain or loss recognized by the obligor with respect to accrued interest expense.
The obligor under a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall realize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest expense on the date such accrued interest expense is paid or the obligation to make payments is transferred or extinguished (including a deemed disposition under section 1001 that results from a material change in terms of the instrument). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b) (
e.g.,
paragraph (b)(8) of this section), exchange gain or loss realized with respect to accrued interest expense shall be recognized in accordance with the applicable recognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The amount of exchange gain or loss so realized with respect to accrued interest expense is determined for each accrual period by—
(i) Translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest expense accrued with respect to the amount of interest paid into functional currency at the average rate (or other rate specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) for such accrual period; and
(ii) Subtracting from such amount the amount computed by translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest paid (or, if the obligation to make payments is extinguished or transferred, the units accrued) with respect to such accrual period (as determined under the ordering rules in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) into functional currency at the spot rate on the date payment is made or the obligation is transferred or extinguished (or deemed extinguished).
(5)
Exchange gain or loss recognized by the holder of a debt instrument with respect to principal.
The holder of a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall realize exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of such instrument on the date principal (determined under the ordering rules of paragraph (b)(7) of this section) is received from the obligor or the instrument is disposed of (including a deemed disposition under section 1001 that results from a material change in terms of the instrument). For purposes of computing exchange gain or loss, the principal amount of a debt instrument is the holder's purchase price in units of nonfunctional currency. See paragraph (b)(10) of this section for rules regarding the amortization of that part of the principal amount that represents bond premium and the computation of exchange gain or loss thereon. If, however, the holder acquired the instrument in a transaction in which exchange gain or loss was realized but not recognized by the transferor, the nonfunctional currency principal amount of the instrument with respect to the holder shall be the same as that of the transferor. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b) (
e.g.,
paragraph (b)(8) of this section), exchange gain or loss realized with respect to such principal amount shall be recognized in accordance with the applicable recognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The amount of exchange gain or loss so realized by the holder with respect to principal is determined by—
(i) Translating the units of nonfunctional currency principal at the spot rate on the date payment is received or the instrument is disposed of (or deemed disposed of); and
(ii) Subtracting from such amount the amount computed by translating the units of nonfunctional currency principal at the spot rate on the date the holder (or a transferor from whom the nonfunctional principal amount is carried over) acquired the instrument (is deemed to acquire the instrument).
(6)
Exchange gain or loss recognized by the obligor of a debt instrument with respect to principal.
The obligor under a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall realize exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of such instrument on the date principal (determined under the ordering rules of paragraph (b)(7) of this section) is paid or the obligation to make payments is transferred or extinguished (including a deemed disposition under section 1001 that results from a material change in terms of the instrument). For purposes of computing exchange gain or loss, the principal amount of a debt instrument is the amount received by the obligor for the debt instrument in units of nonfunctional currency. See paragraph (b)(10) of this section for rules regarding the amortization of that part of the principal amount that represents bond premium and the computation of exchange gain or loss thereon. If, however, the obligor became the obligor in a transaction in which exchange gain or loss was realized but not recognized by the transferor, the nonfunctional currency principal amount of the instrument with respect to such obligor shall be the same as that of the transferor. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b) (
e.g.,
paragraph (b)(8) of this section), exchange gain or loss realized with respect to such principal shall be recognized in accordance with the applicable recognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The amount of exchange gain or loss so realized by the obligor is determined by—
(i) Translating the units of nonfunctional currency principal at the spot
rate on the date the obligor (or a transferor from whom the principal amount is carried over) became the obligor (or is deemed to have become the obligor); and
(ii) Subtracting from such amount the amount computed by translating the units of nonfunctional currency principal at the spot rate on the date payment is made or the obligation is transferred or extinguished (or deemed extinguished).
(7)
Payment ordering rules
—(i)
Debt instruments subject to the rules of sections 163(e), or 1271 through 1288.
In the case of a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that is subject to the rules of sections 163(e), or 1272 through 1288, units of nonfunctional currency (or an amount determined with reference to nonfunctional currency) received or paid with respect to such debt instrument shall be treated first as a receipt or payment of periodic interest under the principles of section 1273 and the regulations thereunder, second as a receipt or payment of original issue discount to the extent accrued as of the date of the receipt or payment, and finally as a receipt or payment of principal. Units of nonfunctional currency (or an amount determined with reference to nonfunctional currency) treated as a receipt or payment of original issue discount under the preceding sentence are attributed to the earliest accrual period in which original issue discount has accrued and to which prior receipts or payments have not been attributed. No portion thereof shall be treated as prepaid interest. These rules are illustrated by
Example 10
of paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
(ii)
Other debt instruments.
In the case of a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that is not subject to the rules of section 163(e) or 1272 through 1288, whether units of nonfunctional currency (or an amount determined with reference to nonfunctional currency) received or paid with respect to such debt instrument are treated as interest or principal shall be determined under section 163 or other applicable section of the Code.
(8)
Limitation of exchange gain or loss on payment or disposition of a debt instrument.
When a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is paid or disposed of, or when the obligation to make payments thereunder is satisfied by another person, or extinguished or assumed by another person, exchange gain or loss is computed with respect to both principal and any accrued interest (including original issue discount), as provided in paragraph (b)(3) through (7) of this section. However, pursuant to section 988(b)(1) and (2), the sum of any exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal and interest of any such debt instrument shall be realized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the transaction. The gain or loss realized shall be recognized in accordance with the general principles of the Code. See
Examples 3, 4
and
6
of paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
(9)
Examples.
The preceding provisions are illustrated in the following examples. The examples assume that any transaction involving an individual is a section 988 transaction.

# Example 1.
(i) X is an individual on the cash method of accounting with the dollar as his functional currency. On January 1, 1992, X converts $13,000 to 10,000 British pounds (£) at the spot rate of £1 = $1.30 and loans the £10,000 to Y for 3 years. The terms of the loan provide that Y will make interest payments of £1,000 on December 31 of 1992, 1993, and 1994, and will repay X's £10,000 principal on December 31, 1994. Assume the spot rates for the pertinent dates are as follows:
Date
Spot rate (pounds to dollars)
Jan. 1, 1992
£1 = $1.30
Dec. 31, 1992
£1 = $1.35
Dec. 31, 1993
£1 = $1.40
Dec. 31, 1994
£1 = $1.45
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, X will trans1ate the £1,000 interest payments at the spot rate on the date received. Accordingly, X will have interest income of $1,350 in 1992, $1,400 in 1993, and $1,450 in 1994. Because X is a cash basis taxpayer, X does not realize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of interest income.
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, X will realize exchange gain upon repayment of the £10,000 principal amount determined by translating the £10,000 at the spot rate on the date it is received (£10,000 × $1.45 = $14,500) and subtracting from such amount, the amount determined by translating the £10,000 at the spot rate on the date the loan
was made (£10,000 × $1.30 = $13,000). Accordingly, X will realize an exchange gain of $1,500 on the repayment of the loan on December 31, 1994.

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that X is an accrual method taxpayer and that average rates are as follows:
Accrual period
Average rate (pounds to dollars)
1992
£1 = $1.32
1993
£1 = $1.37
1994
£1 = $1.42
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, X will accrue the £1,000 interest payments at the average rate for the accrual period. Accordingly, X will have interest income of $1,320 in 1992, $1,370 in 1993, and $1,420 in 1994. Because X is an accrual basis taxpayer, X determines exchange gain or loss for each interest accrual period by translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest income received with respect to such accrual period at the spot rate on the date received and subtracting the amounts of interest income accrued for such period. Thus, X will realize $90 of exchange gain with respect to interest received under the loan, computed as follows:
Year
Spot value interest received
Accrued interest @ average rate
Exch. gain
1992
$1,350
$1,320
$30
1993
1,400
1,370
30
1994
1,450
1,420
30
Total
$90
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, X will realize exchange gain upon repayment of the £10,000 loan principal determined in the same manner as in
Example 1.
Accordingly, X will realize an exchange gain of $1,500 on the repayment of the loan principal on December 31, 1994.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that X is a calendar year taxpayer on the accrual method of accounting that elects to use a spot rate convention to translate interest income as provided in § 1.988-2(b)(2)(iii)(B). Interest income is received by X on the last day of each accrual period. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C), X will translate the interest income at the spot rate on the last day of each interest accrual period. Accordingly, X will have interest income of $1,350 in 1992, and $1,400 in 1993, $1,450 in 1994. Because the rate at which the interest income is translated is the same as the rate on the day of receipt, X will not realize any exchange gain or loss with respect to the interest income. Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, X will realize exchange gain upon repayment of the £10,000 loan principal determined in the same manner as in
Example 1.
Accordingly, X will realize an exchange gain of $1,500 on the repayment of the loan principal on December 31, 1994.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that on December 31, 1993, X sells Y's note for 9,821.13 British pounds (£) after the interest payment. Under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, X will compute exchange gain on the £10,000 principal. The exchange gain is $1,000 [(£10,000 × $1.40)−(£10,000 × $1.30)]. This exchange gain, however, is only realized to the extent of the total gain on the disposition. X's total gain is $749.58 [(£9,821.13 × $1.40)−(£10,000 × $1.30)]. Thus, X will realize $749.58 of exchange gain (and will realize no market loss).

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that Y becomes insolvent and fails to repay the full £10,000 principal when due. Instead, X and Y agree to compromise the debt for a payment of £8,000 on December 31, 1994. Under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, X will compute exchange gain on the £10,000 originally booked. The exchange gain is $1,500 [(£10,000 × $1.45)−(£10,000 × $1.30) = $1,500]. This exchange gain, however, is only realized to the extent of the total gain on the disposition. X realizes an overall loss on the disposition of $1,400 [(£8,000 × $1.45)−(£10,000 × $1.30) = ($1,400)]. Thus, X will realize no exchange gain (and a $1400 market loss).
(ii) If the exchange rate on December 31, 1994, were £1 = $1.25, rather than £1 = $1.45, X would compute exchange loss under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, on the £10,000 originally booked. The exchange loss would be $500 [(£10,000 × $1.25)−(£10,000 × $1.30) = ($500)]. X's total loss on the disposition would be $3,000 [(£8,000 × $1.25)-(£10,000 × $1.30) = ($3,000)]. Thus, X would realize $500 of exchange loss and a $2,500 market loss on the disposition.

# Example 6.
(i) X is an individual with the dollar as his functional currency. X is on the cash method of accounting. On January 1, 1989, X borrows 10,000 British pounds (£) from Y, an unrelated person. The terms of the loan provide that X will make interest payments of £1,200 on December 31 of 1989 and 1990 and will repay Y's £10,000 principal on December 31, 1990. The spot rates for the pertinent dates are as follows:
Date
Spot rate
1
Jan. 1, 1989
1 = $1.50
Dec. 31, 1989
1 = 1.60
Dec. 31, 1990
1 = 1.70
1
Pounds to dollars.
Assume that the basis of the £1,200 paid as interest by X on December 31, 1989, is $2,000, the basis of the £1,200 paid as interest by X on December 31, 1990, is $2,020 and the basis
of the £10,000 principal paid by X on December 31, 1990, is $16,000.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, X translates the £1,200 interest payments at the spot rate on the day paid. Thus, X paid $1,920 (£1,200 × $1.60) of interest on December 31, 1989, and $2,040 (£1,200 × $1.70) of interest on December 31, 1990. In addition, X will realize exchange gain or loss on the disposition of the £1,200 on December 31, 1989 and 1990, under paragraph (a) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, X will realize an exchange loss of $80 [(£1,200 × $1.60)−$2,000] on December 31, 1989, and exchange gain of $20 [(£1,200 × $1.70)−$2,020] on December 31, 1990.
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, X will realize exchange loss on December 31, 1990, upon repayment of the £10,000 principal amount determined by translating the £10,000 received at the spot rate on January 1, 1989 (£10,000 × $1.50 = $15,000) and subtracting from such amount, the amount determined by translating the £10,000 paid at the spot rate on December 31, 1990 (£10,000 × $1.70 = $17,000). Thus, under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, X has an exchange loss with respect to the £10,000 principal of $2,000. Further, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, X will realize an exchange gain upon disposition of the £10,000 on December 31, 1990. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, X will subtract his adjusted basis in the £10,000 ($16,000) from the amount realized upon the disposition of the £10,000 (£10,000 × $1.70 = $17,000) resulting in a gain of $1,000. Accordingly, X's combined exchange gain and loss realized on December 31, 1990, with respect to the repayment of the £10,000 is a $1,000 exchange loss.

# Example 7.
(i) X is a calendar year corporation on the accrual method of accounting and with the dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1989, X purchases at original issue for 82.64 Canadian dollars (C$) M corporation's 2 year note maturing on December 31, 1990, at a stated redemption price of C$100. The yield to maturity in Canadian dollars is 10 percent and the accrual period is the one year period beginning January 1 and ending December 31. The note has C$17.36 of original issue discount. Assume that the spot rates are as follows: C$1 = U.S.$.72 on January 1, 1989; C$1 = U.S.$.80 on January 1, 1990; C$1 = U.S.$ .82 on December 31, 1990. Assume further that the average rate for 1989 is C$1 = U.S.$ .76 and for 1990 is C$1 = U.S. $.81.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, X will determine its interest income in Canadian dollars. Accordingly, under section 1272, X must take into account original issue discount in the amount of C$8.26 on December 31, 1989, and C$9.10 on December 31, 1990. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, X will translate these amounts into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the relevant accrual period. Thus, the amount of interest income taken into account in 1989 is U.S.$6.28 (C$8.26 × U.S.$.76) and in 1990 is U.S.$7.37 (C$9.10 × U.S.$.81). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, X will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to the accrued interest determined for each accrual period by translating the Canadian dollars received with respect to such accrual period into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the interest is received and subtracting from that amount the amount accrued in U.S. dollars. Thus, the amount of exchange gain realized on December 31, 1990, is U.S.$.58 (U.S.$.49 from 1989 + U.S.$.09 from 1990). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, X shall realize exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal (C$82.64) on December 31, 1990, computed by translating the C$82.64 at the spot rate on December 31, 1990 (U.S.$67.76) and subtracting the C$82.64 translated at the spot rate on January 1, 1989 (U.S.$59.50) for an exchange gain of U.S.$8.26. Thus, X's combined exchange gain is U.S.$8.84 (U.S.$.49 + U.S.$.09 + U.S.$8.26).
(iii) Assume instead that on January 1, 1990, X sells the note for C$86.95, which it immediately converts to U.S. dollars. X's exchange gain is computed under paragraph (b)(8) of this section with reference to the nonfunctional currency denominated principal amount (C$82.64) and the nonfunctional currency denominated accrued original issue discount (C$8.26). X will compute an exchange gain of U.S.$6.61 with respect to the issue price [(C$82.64 × U.S.$.80)−(C$82.64 × U.S.$.72)] and an exchange gain of U.S.$.33 with respect to the accrued original issue discount [(C$8.26 × U.S.$.80)− (C$8.26 × U.S.$ .76)]. Accordingly, prior to the application of paragraph (b)(8) of this section, X's total exchange gain is U.S.$6.94 (U.S.$6.61 + U.S.$.33), and X's market loss is U.S.$3.16 [(C$90.90−C$86.95) × U.S.$.80]. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(8) of this section, however, X's market loss on the note of U.S.$3.16 is netted against X's exchange gain of U.S.$6.94, resulting in a realized exchange gain of U.S.$3.78 and no market loss.

# Example 8.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7
(i) except that on January 1, 1990, X contributes the M corporation note to Y, a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of X with the dollar as its functional currency, and Y collects C$100 from M corporation at maturity on December 31, 1990, when the spot rate is C$1 = U.S.$.82. The transfer of the note from X to Y qualifies for nonrecognition of gain under section 351(a). On December 31, 1990, Y includes C$9.10 of accrued interest in income which translated at the average exchange rate of C$1 = U.S.$.81 for the year results in U.S.$7.37 of interest income.
(ii) Y's exchange gain is computed under paragraph (b)(3) of this section with respect to accrued interest income and paragraph
(b)(5) of this section with respect to the nonfunctional currency principal amount. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, Y will realize exchange gain or loss for each accrual period computed by translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest income received with respect to such accrual period at the spot rate on the day received and subtracting the amounts of interest income accrued for such period. Thus, Y will realize $.49 of exchange gain with respect to original issue discount accrued in 1989 [(C$8.26 × U.S.$.82)−(C$8.26 × U.S.$.76) = U.S. $.49] and $.09 of exchange gain with respect to original issue discount accrued in 1990 [(C$9.10 × U.S.$.82)−(C$9.10 × U.S.$.81) = $.09].
(iii) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the nonfunctional currency principal amount of the M bond in the hands of Y is C$82.64, the amount carried over from X, the transferor. Y's exchange gain with respect to the nonfunctional currency principal amount is $8.26 [(C$82.64 × U.S.$.82)− (C$82.64 × U.S.$.72) = U.S. $8.26]. Accordingly, Y's combined exchange gain is U.S. $8.84 ($.49 + $.09 + $8.26). Because the amount realized in Canadian dollars equals the adjusted issue price (C$100) on retirement of the M note, there is no market loss, and the netting rule of paragraph (b)(8) of this section does not limit realization of the exchange gain.

# Example 9.
(i) X is a calendar year corporation on the accrual method of accounting and with the dollar as its functional currency. X elects to use the spot rate convention to translate interest income as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. On January 31, 1992, X loans £1000 to Y, an unrelated person. Under the terms of the loan, Y will pay X interest of £50 on July 31, 1992, and January 31, 1993, and will repay the £1000 principal on January 31, 1993. Assume the following spot exchange rates:
Date
Spot rate
1
Jan. 31, 1992
£1 = $1.50
July 31, 1992
£1 = 1.55
Dec. 31, 1992
£1 = 1.60
Jan. 31, 1993
£1 = 1.61
1
Pounds to dollars.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, X will translate the interest income at the spot rate on the last day of each interest accrual period (and in the case of a partial accrual period, at the spot rate on the last day of the taxable year). Accordingly, X will have interest income of $77.50 (£50 × $1.55) on July 31, 1992. Assuming under X's method of accounting that interest is accrued daily, X will accrue $66.50 (153 / 184 × £50) × $1.60) of interest income on December 31, 1992. On January 31, 1993, X will have interest income of $13.60 ((31/184 × £50) × $1.61). Because the rate at which the interest income is translated is the same as the rate on the day of receipt, X will not realize any exchange gain or loss with respect to the interest income received on July 31, 1992. However, X will realize exchange gain on the £41.50 (153/184 × £50) of accrued interest income of $.41 [(£41.50 × $1.61) − (£41.50 × $1.60) = $.41].
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, X will realize exchange gain upon repayment of the £100 principal amount determined by translating the £100 at the spot rate on the date it is received (£100 × $1.61 = $161.00) and subtracting from such amount, the amount determined by translating the £100 at the spot rate on the date the loan was made (£100 × $1.50 = $150.00). Accordingly, X will realize an exchange gain of $11 on the repayment of the loan on January 31, 1993.

# Example 10.
(i) X, a cash basis taxpayer with the dollar as its functional currency, has the calendar year as its taxable year. On January 1, 1992, X purchases at original issue for 65.88 British pounds (£) M corporation's 5-year bond maturing on December 31, 1996, having a stated redemption price at maturity of £100. The bond provides for annual payments of interest in pounds of 1 pound per year on December 31 of each year. The bond has 34.12 British pounds of original issue discount. The yield to maturity is 10 percent in British pounds and the accrual period is the one year period beginning January 1 and ending December 31 of each calendar year. The amount of original issue discount is determined in pounds for each accrual period by multiplying the adjusted issue price expressed in pounds by the yield and subtracting from such amount the periodic interest payments expressed in pounds for such period. The periodic interest payments are translated at the spot rate on the payment date (December 31 of each year). The original issue discount is translated at the average rate for the accrual period (January 1 through December 31). The following chart describes the determination of interest income with respect to the facts presented and provides other pertinent information.

(ii) Because X is a cash basis taxpayer, X does not realize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of the £1 periodic interest payments. However, X will realize exchange gain on December 31, 1996 totaling $7.88 with respect to the original issue discount. Exchange gain is determined for each interest accrual period by translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest income received with respect to such accrual period at the spot rate on the date received and subtracting from such amount, the amount computed by translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest income accrued for such period at the average rate for the period.

(iii) X will also realize exchange gain with respect to the principal of the loan (
i.e.,
the issue price of 65.88 British pounds) on December 31, 1996 computed by translating the units of nonfunctional currency principal received at the spot rate on the date principal is received (65.88 British pounds × $1.70 = $112.00) and subtracting from such amount, the units of nonfunctional currency principal received translated at the spot rate on the date the instrument was acquired (65.88 British pounds × $1.20 = $79.06). Accordingly, X's exchange gain on the principal is $32.94 and X's total exchange gain with respect to the accrued interest and principal is $40.82. It should be noted that, under this fact pattern, the total exchange gain may be determined in an alternative fashion. Exchange gain may be computed by subtracting the adjusted issue price in dollars at maturity ($129.18—see column 10 of Table 1) from the amount computed by multiplying the stated redemption price at maturity in pounds times the spot rate on the maturity date (£100 × $1.70 = $170), which equals $40.82.

# Example 11.
(i) The facts are the same as in

except that X makes an election under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section to translate accrued interest on the last day of the accrual period. Accordingly, columns 8, 9 and 10 in Table 1 would change as follows:

(ii) Because X is a cash basis taxpayer, X does not realize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of the £1 periodic interest payments. However, X will realize exchange gain on December 31, 1993 totaling $6.18 with respect to the original issue discount. Exchange gain is determined for each interest accrual period by translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest income received with respect to such accrual period at the spot rate on the date received and subtracting from such amount, the amount computed by translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest income accrued for such period at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period. Accordingly, columns 5, 6 and 7 of Table 2 would change as follows:

(iii) X will realize exchange gain with respect to the principal amount of the loan as provided in the preceding example.

# Example 12.
(i) C is a corporation that is a calendar year accrual method taxpayer with the dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1989, C lends 100 British pounds (£) in exchange for a note under the terms of which C will receive two equal payments of £57.62 on December 31, 1989, and December 31, 1990. Each payment of £57.62 represents the annual payment necessary to amortize the £100 principal amount at a rate of 10% compounded annually over a two year period. The following tables reflect the amounts of principal and interest that compose each payment and assumptions as to the relevant exchange rates:
Date
Principal
Interest

1.35
Dec. 31, 1990
1.50
1.45
(ii) Because each interest payment is equal to the product of the outstanding principal balance of the obligation and a single fixed rate of interest, each stated interest payment constitutes periodic interest under the principles of section 1273. Accordingly, there is no original issue discount.
(iii) Because C is an accrual basis taxpayer, C will translate the interest income at the average rate for the annual accrual period pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Thus, C's interest income is $13.50 (£10.00 × $1.35) in 1989, and $7.60 (£5.24 × $1.45) in 1990. C will realize exchange gain or loss upon receipt of accrued interest computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Thus, C will realize exchange gain in the amount of $.50 [(£10.00 × $1.40)−$13.50] in 1989, and $.26 [(£5.24 × $1.50)−$7.60] in 1990.
(iv) In addition, C will realize exchange gain or loss upon the receipt of principal each year computed under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Thus, C will realize exchange gain in the amount of $4.76 [(£47.62 × $1.40)−(£47.62 × $1.30)] in 1989, and $10.48 [(£52.38 × $1.50)−(£52.38 × $1.30)] in 1990.
(10)
Treatment of bond premium
—(i)
In general.
Amortizable bond premium on a bond described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be computed in the units of nonfunctional currency in which the bond is denominated (or in which the payments are determined). Amortizable bond premium properly taken into account under section 171 or § 1.61-12 (or the successor provision thereof) shall reduce interest income or expense in units of nonfunctional currency. Exchange gain or loss is realized with respect to bond premium described in the preceding sentence by treating the portion of premium amortized with respect to any period as a return of principal. With respect to a holder that does not elect to amortize bond premium under section 171, the amount of bond premium will constitute a market loss when the bond matures. See paragraph (b)(8) of this
section. The principles set forth in this paragraph (b)(10) shall apply to determine the treatment of acquisition premium described in section 1272(a)(7).
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (b)(10).

# Example.
(A) X is an individual on the cash method of accounting with the dollar as his functional currency. On January 1, 1989, X purchases Y corporation's note for 107.99 British pounds (£) from Z, an unrelated party. The note has an issue price of £100, a stated redemption price at maturity of £100, pays interest in pounds at the rate of 10% compounded annually, and matures on December 31, 1993. X elects to amortize the bond premium of £7.99 under the rules of section 171. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section, bond premium is determined and amortized in British pounds. Assume the amortization schedule is as follows:
Year ending 12/31
Bond premium amortized
Unamortized premium plus principal
Interest
£107.99
1989
£1.36
£106.63
£8.64
1990
£1.47
£105.16
£8.53
1991
£1.59
£103.57
£8.41
1992
£1.71
£101.86
£8.29
1993
£1.85
£100.00
£8.15
(B) The bond premium reduces X's pound interest income under the note. For example, the £10 stated interest payment made in 1989 is reduced by £1.36 of bond premium, and the resulting £8.64 interest income is translated into dollars at the spot rate on December 31, 1989. Exchange gain or loss is realized on the £1.36 bond premium based on the difference between the spot rates on January 1, 1989, the date the premium is paid to acquire the bond, and December 31, 1989, the date the bond premium is returned as part of the stated interest. The £1.36 bond premium reduces the unamortized premium plus principal to £106.63 (£107.99−£1.36). On December 31, 1993, when the bond matures and the £7.99 of bond premium has been fully amortized, X will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to the remaining purchase price of £100.
(11)
Market discount
—(i)
In general.
Market discount as defined in section 1278(a)(2) shall be determined in units of nonfunctional currency in which the market discount bond is denominated (or in which the payments are determined). Accrued market discount (other than market discount currently included in income pursuant to section 1278(b)) shall be translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the market discount bond is disposed of. No part of such accrued market discount is treated as exchange gain or loss. Accrued market discount currently includible in income pursuant to section 1278(b) shall be translated into functional currency at the average exchange rate for the accrual period. Exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued market discount currently includible in income under section 1278(b) shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section relating to accrued interest income.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (b)(11).

# Example.
(A) X is a calendar year corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1990, X purchases a bond of M corporation for 96,530 British pounds (£). The bond, which was issued on January 1, 1989, has an issue price of £100,000, a stated redemption price at maturity of £100,000, and provides for annual pound payments of interest at 8 percent. The bond matures on December 31, 1991. X purchased the bond at a market discount of 3,470 pounds and did not elect to include the market discount currently in income under section 1278(b). X holds the bond to maturity and on December 31, 1991, receives payment of £100,000 (plus £8,000 interest) when the exchange rate is £1 = $1.50.
(B) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(11) of this section, X computes market discount in units of nonfunctional currency. Thus, the market discount as defined under section 1278(a)(2) is £3,470. Accrued market discount (other than market discount currently included in income pursuant to section 1278(b)) is translated at the spot rate on the date the market discount bond is disposed of. Accordingly, X will translate the accrued market discount of £3,470 at the spot rate on December 31, 1991 (£3,470 × $1.50 = $5,205). No exchange gain or loss is realized with respect to the £3,470 of accrued market discount. See paragraphs (b)(3) and (5) of this section for the realization and recognition of exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest and principal.
(12)
Tax exempt bonds.
See § 1.988-3(c)(2), which characterizes exchange loss realized with respect to a nonfunctional currency tax exempt bond as a reduction of interest income.
(13)
Nonfunctional currency debt exchanged for stock of obligor
—(i)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other section of the Code other than section 267,
1091 or 1092, exchange gain or loss shall be realized and recognized by the holder and the obligor in accordance with the rules of paragraphs (b)(3) through (7) of this section with respect to the principal and accrued interest of a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that is acquired by the obligor in exchange for its stock, provided however, that such gain or loss shall be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss on the exchange (regardless of whether such gain or loss would otherwise be recognized). This rule shall apply whether the debt instrument is converted into stock according to its terms or exchanged pursuant to a separate agreement between the obligor and the holder. A debt instrument that is acquired by the obligor from a shareholder as a contribution to capital shall be treated for purposes of this section as exchanged for stock, whether or not additional stock is issued.
(ii)
Coordination with section 108.
Section 988 and this section shall apply before section 108. Exchange gain realized by the obligor on an exchange described in paragraph (b)(13)(i) of this section shall not be treated as discharge of indebtedness income, but shall be considered to reduce the amount of the liability for purposes of computing the obligor's income on the exchange under section 108(e)(4), section 108(e)(6) or section 108(e)(10).
(iii)
Effective date.
This paragraph (b)(13) shall be effective for exchanges of debt for stock effected after September 21, 1989.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of this paragraph (b)(13). In each such example, assume that sections 267, 1091 and 1092 do not apply.

# Example 1.
(i) X is a calendar year U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1990 (the issue date), X acquired a convertible bond maturing on December 31, 1998, issued by Y corporation, a U.K. corporation with the British pound (£) as its functional currency. The issue price of the bond is £100,000, the stated redemption price at maturity is £100,000, and the bond provides for annual pound interest payments at the rate of 10%. The terms of the bond also provide that at any time prior to December 31, 1998, the holder may surrender all of his interest in the bond in exchange for 20 shares of Y common stock. On January 1, 1994, X surrenders his interest in the bond for 20 shares of Y common stock. Assume the following: (a) The spot rate on January 1, 1990, is £1 = $1.30, (b) The spot rate on January 1, 1994, is £1 = $1.50, and (c) The 20 shares of Y common stock have a market value of £200,000 on January 1, 1994.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(13) of this section, X will realize and recognize exchange gain with respect to the issue price (£100,000) of the bond on January 1, 1994, when the bond is converted to stock. X will compute exchange gain pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section by translating the issue price at the spot rate on the conversion date (£100.000 × $1.50 = $150,000) and subtracting from such amount the issue price translated at the spot rate on the date X acquired the bond (£100,000 × $1.30 = $130,000). Thus, X will realize and recognize $20,000 of exchange gain. X's basis in the 20 shares of Y common stock is $150,000 ($130,000 substituted basis + $20,000 recognized gain).

(i) X, a foreign corporation with the British pound (£) as its functional currency, lends £100 at a market rate of interest to Y, its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, on January 1, 1990, on which date the spot exchange rate is £1 = $1. Y's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. On January 1, 1992, when the spot exchange rate is £1 = $.50, X cancels the debt as a contribution to capital. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(13) of this section, Y will realize and recognize exchange gain with respect to the £100 issue price of the debt instrument on January 1, 1992. Y will compute exchange gain pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section by translating the issue price at the spot rate on the date Y became the obligor (£100 × $1 = $100) and subtracting from such amount the issue price translated at the spot rate on the date of extinguishment (£100 × $.50 = $50). Thus, Y will realize and recognize $50 of exchange gain.
(ii) Under section 108(e)(6), on the acquisition of its indebtedness from X as a contribution to capital Y is treated as having satisfied the debt with an amount of money equal to X's adjusted basis in the debt (£100). For purposes of section 108(e)(6), X's adjusted basis is translated into United States dollars at the spot rate on the date Y acquires the debt (£1 = $.50). Therefore, Y is treated as having satisfied the debt for $50. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(13) of this section, for purposes of section 108 the amount of the indebtedness is considered to be reduced by the exchange gain from $100 to $50. Accordingly, Y recognizes $50 of exchange gain and no discharge of indebtedness income on the extinguishment of its debt to X.
(iii) If X were a United States taxpayer with a dollar functional currency and a $100 basis in Y's obligation. X would realize and
recognize an exchange loss of $50 under paragraph (b)(5) of this section on the contribution of the debt to Y. The recognized loss would reduce X's adjusted basis in the debt from $100 to $50, so that for purposes of applying section 108(e)(6) Y is treated as having satisfied the debt for $50. Accordingly, under these facts as well Y would recognize $50 of exchange gain and no discharge of indebtedness income.

# Example 3.
(i) X and Y are unrelated calendar year U.S. corporations with the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. On January 1, 1990 (the issue date), X acquires Y's bond maturing on December 31, 1999. The issue price of the bond is £100,000, the stated redemption price at maturity is £100,000, and the bond provides for annual pound interest payments at the rate of 10%. On January 1, 1994, X and Y agree that Y will redeem its bond from X in exchange for 20 shares of Y common stock. Assume the following:
(a) The spot rate on January 1, 1990, is £1 = $1.00,
(b) The spot rate on January 1, 1994, is £1 = $.50,
(c) Interest rates on equivalent bonds have increased so that as of January 1, 1994, the value of Y's bond has declined to £90,000, and
(d) The 20 shares of Y common stock have a market value of £90,000 as of January 1, 1994.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(13) of this section, X will realize and recognize exchange loss with respect to the issue price (£100,000) of the bond on January 1, 1994, when the bond is exchanged for stock. X will compute exchange loss pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section by translating the issue price at the spot rate on the exchange date (£100,000 × $.50 = $50,000) and subtracting from such amount the issue price translated at the spot rate on the date X acquired the bond (£100,000 × $1.00 = $100,000). Thus, X will compute $50,000 of exchange loss, all of which will be realized and recognized because it does not exceed the total $55,000 realized loss on the exchange ($45,000 worth of stock received less $100,000 basis in the exchanged bond).
(iii) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(13) of this section, Y will realize and recognize exchange gain with respect to the issue price, computed under paragraph (b)(6) of this section by translating the issue price at the spot rate on the date Y became the obligor (£100,000 × $1.00 = $100,000) and subtracting from such amount the issue price translated at the spot rate on the exchange date (£100,000 × $.50 = $50,000). Thus, Y will realize and recognize $50,000 of exchange gain. Under section 108(e)(10), on the transfer of stock to X in satisfaction of its indebtedness Y is treated as having satisfied the indebtedness with an amount of money equal to the fair market value of the stock (£90,000 × $.50 = $45,000). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(13) of this section, for purposes of section 108 the amount of the indebtedness is considered to be reduced by the recognized exchange gain from $100,000 to $50,000. Accordingly, Y recognizes an additional $5,000 of discharge of indebtedness income on the exchange.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3
except that interest rates on equivalent bonds have declined, rather than increased, so that the value of Y's bond on January 1, 1994, has risen to £112,500; and X and Y agree that Y will redeem its bond from X on that date in exchange for 25 shares of Y common stock worth £112,500. Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(13) and (b)(5) of this section, X will compute $50,000 of exchange loss on the exchange with respect to the £100,000 issue price of the bond. See Example 3. However, because X's total loss on the exchange is only $43,750 ($56,250 worth of stock received less $100,000 basis in the exchanged bond), under the netting rule of paragraph (b)(13) of this section the realized exchange loss is limited to $43,750.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(13) and (b)(6) of this section, Y will compute $50,000 of exchange gain with respect to the issue price. See
Example 3.
Under section 108(e)(10), Y is treated as having satisfied the $100,000 indebtedness with an amount of money equal to the fair market value of the stock (£112,500 × $.50 = $56,250), resulting in a total gain on the exchange of $43,750. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(13) of this section Y's realized (and recognized) exchange gain on the exchange is limited to $43,750. Also pursuant to paragraph (b)(13) of this section, for purposes of section 108 the amount of the indebtedness is considered to be reduced by the recognized exchange gain from $100,000 to $56,250. Accordingly, Y recognizes no discharge of indebtedness income on the exchange.

Debt instruments and deposits denominated in hyperinflationary currencies
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer issues, acquires, or otherwise enters into or holds a hyperinflationary debt instrument (as defined in paragraph (b)(15)(vi)(A) of this section) or a hyperinflationary deposit (as defined in paragraph (b)(15)(vi)(B) of this section) on which interest is paid or accrued that is denominated in (or determined by reference to) a nonfunctional currency of the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall realize exchange gain or loss with respect to such instrument or deposit for its taxable year determined by reference to the change in exchange rates between—
(A) The later of the first day of the taxable year, or the date the instrument was entered into (or an amount deposited); and
(B) The earlier of the last day of the taxable year, or the date the instrument (or deposit) is disposed of or otherwise terminated.
(ii)
Only exchange gain or loss is realized.
No gain or loss is realized under paragraph (b)(15)(i) by reason of factors other than movement in exchange rates, such as the creditworthiness of the debtor.
(iii)
Special rule for synthetic, non-hyperinflationary currency debt instruments
—(A)
General rule.
Paragraph (b)(15)(i) does not apply to a debt instrument that has interest and principal payments that are to be made by reference to a currency or item that does not reflect hyperinflationary conditions in a country (within the meaning of § 1.988-1(f)).
(B)
Example.
Paragraph (b)(15)(iii)(A) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
When the Turkish lira (TL) is a hyperinflationary currency, A, a U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, makes a 5 year, 100,000 TL-denominated loan to B, an unrelated corporation, at a 10% interest rate when 1,000 TL equals $1. Under the terms of the debt instrument, B must pay interest annually to A in amount of Turkish lira that is equal to $100. Also under the terms of the debt instrument, B must pay A upon maturity of the debt instrument an amount of Turkish lira that is equal to $1,000. Although the principal and interest are payable in a hyperinflationary currency, the debt instrument is a synthetic dollar debt instrument and is not subject to paragraph (b)(15)(i) of this section.
(iv)
Source and character of gain or loss
—(A)
General rule for hyperinflationary conditions.
The rules of this paragraph (b)(15)(iv)(A) shall apply to any taxpayer that is either an issuer of (or obligor under) a hyperinflationary debt instrument or deposit and has currency gain on such debt instrument or deposit, or a holder of a hyperinflationary debt instrument or deposit and has currency loss on such debt instrument or deposit. For purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, any exchange gain or loss realized under paragraph (b)(15)(i) of this section is directly allocable to the interest expense or interest income, respectively, from the debt instrument or deposit (computed under this paragraph (b)), and therefore reduces or increases the amount of interest income or interest expense paid or accrued during that year with respect to that instrument or deposit. With respect to a debt instrument or deposit during a taxable year, to the extent exchange gain realized under paragraph (b)(15)(i) of this section exceeds interest expense of an issuer, or exchange loss realized under paragraph (b)(15)(i) of this section exceeds interest income of a holder or depositor, the character and source of such excess amount shall be determined under §§ 1.988-3 and 1.988-4.
(B)
Special rule for subsiding hyperinflationary conditions.
If the taxpayer is an issuer of (or obligor under) a hyperinflationary debt instrument or deposit and has currency loss, or if the taxpayer is a holder of a hyperinflationary debt instrument or deposit and has currency gain, then for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, the character and source of the currency gain or loss is determined under §§ 1.988-3 and 1.988-4. Thus, if an issuer has both interest expense and currency loss, the currency loss is sourced and characterized under section 988, and does not affect the determination of interest expense.
(v)
Adjustment to principal or basis.
Any exchange gain or loss realized under paragraph (b)(15)(i) of this section is an adjustment to the functional currency principal amount of the issuer, functional currency basis of the holder, or the functional currency amount of the deposit. This adjusted amount or basis is used in making subsequent computations of exchange gain or loss, computing the basis of assets for purposes of allocating interest under §§ 1.861-9T through 1.861-12T and 1.882-5, or making other determinations that may be relevant for computing taxable income or loss.
(vi)
Definitions
—(A)
Hyperinflationary debt instrument.
A hyperinflationary debt instrument is a debt instrument that provides for—
(
1
) Payments denominated in or determined by reference to a currency that is hyperinflationary (as defined in
§ 1.988-1(f)) at the time the taxpayer enters into or otherwise acquires the debt instrument; or
(
2
) Payments denominated in or determined by reference to a currency that is hyperinflationary (as defined in § 1.988-1(f)) during the taxable year, and the terms of the instrument provide for the adjustment of principal or interest payments in a manner that reflects hyperinflation. For example, a debt instrument providing for a variable interest rate based on local conditions and generally responding to changes in the local consumer price index will reflect hyperinflation.
(B)
Hyperinflationary deposit.
A hyperinflationary deposit is a demand or time deposit or similar instrument issued by a bank or other financial institution that provides for—
(
1
) Payments denominated in or determined by reference to a currency that is hyperinflationary (as defined in § 1.988-1(f)) at the time the taxpayer enters into or otherwise acquires the deposit; or
(
2
) Payments denominated in or determined by reference to a currency that is hyperinflationary (as defined in § 1.988-1(f)) during the taxable year, and the terms of the deposit provide for the adjustment of the deposit amount or interest payments in a manner that reflects hyperinflation.
(vii)
Interaction with other provisions
—(A)
Interest allocation rules.
In determining the amount of interest expense, this paragraph (b)(15) applies before §§ 1.861-9T through 1.861-12T, and 1.882-5.
(B)
DASTM.
With respect to a qualified business unit that uses the United States dollar approximate separate transactions method of accounting described in § 1.985-3, paragraph (b)(15)(i) of this section does not apply.
(C)
Interaction with section 988(a)(3)(C).
Section 988(a)(3)(C) does not apply to a debt instrument subject to the rules of paragraph (b)(15)(i) of this section.
(D)
Hedging rules.
To the extent § 1.446-4 or 1.988-5 apply, the rules of paragraph (b)(15)(i) of this section will not apply. This paragraph (b)(15)(vii)(D) does not apply if the application of § 1.988-5 results in hyperinflationary debt instrument or deposit described in paragraph (b)(15)(vi)(A) or (B) of this section.
(viii)
Effective date.
This paragraph (b)(15) applies to transactions entered into after February 14, 2000.
(16) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.988-2T(b)(16).
(17)
Coordination with installment method under section 453.
[Reserved]
(18)
Interaction of section 988 and § 1.1275-2(g)
—(i)
In general.
If a principal purpose of structuring a debt instrument subject to section 988 and any related hedges is to achieve a result that is unreasonable in light of the purposes of section 163(e), section 988, sections 1271 through 1275, or any related section of the Internal Revenue Code, the Commissioner can apply or depart from the regulations under the applicable sections as necessary or appropriate to achieve a reasonable result. For example, if this paragraph (b)(18) applies to a multicurrency debt instrument and a hedge or hedges, the Commissioner can wholly or partially integrate transactions or treat portions of the debt instrument as separate instruments where appropriate. See also § 1.1275-2(g).
(ii)
Unreasonable result.
Whether a result is unreasonable is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. In making this determination, a significant fact is whether the treatment of the debt instrument is expected to have a substantial effect on the issuer's or a holder's U.S. tax liability. Another significant fact is whether the result is obtainable without the application of § 1.988-6 and any related provisions (
e.g.
, if the debt instrument and the contingency were entered into separately). A result will not be considered unreasonable, however, in the absence of an expected substantial effect on the present value of a taxpayer's tax liability.
(iii)
Effective date.
This paragraph (b)(18) shall apply to debt instruments issued on or after October 29, 2004.
(c)
Item of expense or gross income or receipts which is to be paid or received after the date accrued
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in § 1.988-5, exchange gain or loss with respect to an item described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) (other than accrued interest income or expense subject to paragraph
(b) of this section) shall be realized on the date payment is made or received. Except as provided in the succeeding sentence, such exchange gain or loss shall be recognized in accordance with the applicable recognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If the taxpayer's right to receive income, or obligation to pay an expense, is transferred or modified in a transaction in which gain or loss would otherwise be recognized, exchange gain or loss shall be realized and recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss on the transaction.
(2)
Determination of exchange gain or loss with respect to an item of gross income or receipts.
Exchange gain or loss realized on an item of gross income or receipts described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be determined by multiplying the units of nonfunctional currency received by the spot rate on the payment date, and subtracting from such amount the amount determined by multiplying the units of nonfunctional currency received by the spot rate on the booking date. The term “spot rate on the payment date” means the spot rate determined under § 1.988-1(d) on the date payment is received or otherwise taken into account. Pursuant to § 1.988-1(d)(3), a taxpayer may use a spot rate convention for purposes of determining the spot rate on the payment date. The term “spot rate on the booking date” means the spot rate determined under § 1.988-1(d) on the date the item of gross income or receipts is accrued or otherwise taken into account. Pursuant to § 1.988-1(d)(3), a taxpayer may use a spot rate convention for purposes of determining the spot rate on the booking date.
(3)
Determination of exchange gain or loss with respect to an item of expense.
Exchange gain or loss realized on an item of expense described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be determined by multiplying the units of nonfunctional currency paid by the spot rate on the booking date and subtracting from such amount the amount determined by multiplying the units of nonfunctional currency paid by the spot rate on the payment date. The term “spot rate on the booking date” means the spot rate determined under § 1.988-1(d) on the date the item of expense is accrued or otherwise taken into account. Pursuant to § 1.988-1(d)(3), a taxpayer may use a spot rate convention for purposes of determining the spot rate on the booking date. The term “spot rate on the payment date” means the spot rate determined under § 1.988-1(d) on the date payment is made or otherwise taken into account. Pursuant to § 1.988-1(d)(3), a taxpayer may use a spot rate convention for purposes of determining the spot rate on the date.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c) of this section.

# Example 1.
X is a calendar year corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. X is on the accrual method of accounting. On January 15, 1989, X sells inventory for 10,000 Canadian dollars (C$). The spot rate on January 15, 1989, is C$1 = U.S. $.55. On February 23, 1989, when X receives payment of the C$10,000, the spot rate is C$1 = U.S. $.50. On February 23, 1989, X will realize exchange loss. X's loss is computed by multiplying the C$10,000 by the spot rate on the date the C$10,000 are received (C$10,000 × .50 = U.S. $5,000) and subtracting from such amount, the amount computed by multiplying the C$10,000 by the spot rate on the booking date (C$10,000 × .55 = U.S. $5,500). Thus, X's exchange loss on the transaction is U.S. $500 (U.S. $5,000−U.S. $5,500).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that X uses a spot rate convention to determine the spot rate as provided in § 1.988-1(d)(3). Pursuant to X's spot rate convention, the spot rate at which a payable or receivable is booked is determined monthly for each nonfunctional currency payable or receivable by adding the spot rate at the beginning of the month and the spot rate at the end of the month and dividing by two. All payables and receivables in a nonfunctional currency booked during the month are translated into functional currency at the rate described in the preceding sentence. Further, the translation of nonfunctional currency paid with respect to a payable, and nonfunctional currency received with respect to a receivable, is also performed pursuant to the spot rate convention. Assume the spot rate determined under the spot rate convention for the month of January is C$1 = U.S. $.54 and for the month of February is C$1 = U.S. $.51. On the last date in February, X will realize exchange loss. X's loss is computed by multiplying the C$10,000 by the spot rate convention for the month of February (C$10,000 × U.S. $.51 = U.S. $5,100) and subtracting from such amount, the amount computed by multiplying the C$10,000 by the spot rate convention for the
month of January (C$10,000 × U.S. $.54 = $5,400). Thus, X's exchange loss on the transaction is U.S. $300 (U.S. $5,100-U.S. $5,400). X's basis in the C$10,000 is U.S. $5,400.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that X has a standing order with X's bank for the bank to convert any nonfunctional currency received in satisfaction of a receivable into U.S. dollars on the day received and to deposit those U.S. dollars in X's U.S. dollar bank account. X may use its convention to translate the amount booked into U.S. dollars, but must use the U.S. dollar amounts received from the bank with respect to such receivables to determine X's exchange gain or loss. Thus, if X receives payment of the C$10,000 on February 23, 1989, when the spot rate is C$1 = U.S.$ .50, X determines exchange gain or loss by subtracting the amount booked under X's convention (U.S.$5,400) from the amount of U.S. dollars received from the bank under the standing conversion order (assume $5,000). X's exchange loss is U.S.$400.
(d)
Exchange gain or loss with respect to forward contracts, futures contracts and option contracts
—(1)
Scope
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (d) applies to forward contracts, futures contracts and option contracts described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii). For rules applicable to currency swaps and notional principal contracts described in § 1.988-1(a) (1)(ii) and (2)(iii), see paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii)
Treatment of spot contracts.
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d), a spot contract as defined in § 1.988-1(b) to buy or sell nonfunctional currency is not considered a forward contract or similar transaction described in § 1.988-1(a)(2)(iii) unless such spot contract is disposed of (or otherwise terminated) prior to making or taking delivery of the currency. For example, if a taxpayer with the dollar as its functional currency enters into a spot contract to purchase British pounds, and takes delivery of such pounds under the contract, the delivery of the pounds is not a realization event under section 988(c)(5) and paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section because the contract is not considered a forward contract or similar transaction described in § 1.988-1(a)(2)(iii). However, if the taxpayer sells or otherwise terminates the contract before taking delivery of the pounds, exchange gain or loss shall be realized and recognized in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.
(2)
Realization of exchange gain or loss
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in § 1.988-5, exchange gain or loss on a contract described in § 1.988-2(d)(1) shall be realized in accordance with the applicable realization section of the Internal Revenue Code (
e.g.
, sections 1001, 1092, and 1256). See also section 988(c)(5). For purposes of determining the timing of the realization of exchange gain or loss, sections 1092 and 1256 shall take precedence over section 988(c)(5).
(ii)
Realization by offset
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, exchange gain or loss with respect to a transaction described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) shall not be realized solely because such transaction is offset by another transaction (or transactions).
(B)
Exception where economic benefit is derived.
If a transaction described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) is offset by another transaction or transactions, exchange gain shall be realized to the extent the taxpayer derives, by pledge or otherwise, an economic benefit (
e.g.
, cash, property or the proceeds from a borrowing) from any gain inherent in such offsetting positions. Proper adjustment shall be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain taken into account by reason of the preceding sentence. This paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) shall apply to transactions creating an offset after September 21, 1989.
(C)
Certain contracts traded on an exchange.
If a transaction described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) is traded on an exchange and it is the general practice of the exchange to terminate offsetting contracts, entering into an offsetting contract shall be considered a termination of the contract being offset.
(iii)
Clarification of section 988(c)(5).
If the delivery date of a contract subject to section 988(c)(5) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section is different than the date the contract expires, then for purposes of determining the date exchange gain or loss is realized, the term delivery date shall mean expiration date.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d)(1) and (2).

# Example 1.
On August 1, 1989, X, a calendar year corporation with the dollar as its functional currency, enters into a forward contract with Bank A to buy 100 New Zealand dollars for $80 for delivery on January 31, 1990. (The forward purchase contract is not a section 1256 contract.) On November 1, 1989, the market price for the purchase of 100 New Zealand dollars for delivery on January 31, 1990, is $76. On November 1, 1989, X cancels its obligation under the forward purchase contract and pays Bank A $3.95 (the present value of $4 discounted at 12% for the period) in cancellation of such contract. Under section 1001 (a), X realizes an exchange loss of $3.95 on November 1, 1989, because cancellation of the forward purchase contract for cash results in the termination of X's contract.

# Example 2.
X is a corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1989, X enters into a currency swap contract with Bank A under which X is obligated to make a series of Japanese yen payments in exchange for a series of dollar payments. On February 21, 1992, X has a gain of $100,000 inherent in such contract as a result of interest rate and exchange rate movements. Also on February 21, 1992, X enters into an offsetting swap with Bank A to lock in such gain. If on February 21, 1992, X pledges the gain inherent in such offsetting positions as collateral for a loan, X's initial swap contract is treated as being terminated on February 21, 1992, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Proper adjustment is made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for the gain taken into account by reason of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

# Example 3.
X is a calendar year corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. On October 1, 1989, X enters into a forward contract to buy 100,000 Swiss francs (Sf) for delivery on March l, 1990, for $51,220. Assume that the contract is a section 1256 contract under section 1256(g)(2) and that section 1256(e) does not apply. Pursuant to section 1256(a)(1), the forward contract is treated as sold for its fair market value on December 31, 1989. Assume that the fair market value of the contract is $1,000 determined under § 1.988-1(g). Thus X will realize an exchange gain of $1,000 on December 31, 1989. Such gain is subject to the character rules of § 1.988-3 and the source rules of § 1.988-4.
(v)
Extension of the maturity date of certain contracts.
An extension of time for making or taking delivery under a contract described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (
e.g.,
a historical rate rollover as defined in § 1.988-5(b)(2)(iii)(C)) shall be considered a sale or exchange of the contract for its fair market value on the date of the extension and the establishment of a new contract on such date. If, under the terms of the extension, the time value of any gain or loss recognized pursuant to the preceding sentence adjusts the price of the currency to be bought or sold under the new contract, the amount attributable to such time value shall be treated as interest income or expense for all purposes of the Code. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply and the amount attributable to the time value of any gain or loss recognized shall be treated as exchange gain or loss if the period beginning on the first date the contract is rolled over and ending on the date payment is ultimately made or received with respect to such contract does not exceed 183 days.
(3)
Recognition of exchange gain or loss.
Except as provided in § 1.988-5 (relating to section 988 hedging transactions), exchange gain or loss realized with respect to a contract described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be recognized in accordance with the applicable recognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. For example, a loss realized with respect to a contract described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section which is part of a straddle shall be recognized in accordance with the provisions of section 1092 to the extent such section is applicable.
(4)
Determination of exchange gain or loss
—(i)
In general.
Exchange gain or loss with respect to a contract described in § 1.988-2(d)(1) shall be determined by subtracting the amount paid (or deemed paid), if any, for or with respect to the contract (including any amount paid upon termination of the contract) from the amount received (or deemed received), if any, for or with respect to the contract (including any amount received upon termination of the contract). Any gain or loss determined according to the preceding sentence shall be treated as exchange gain or loss.
(ii)
Special rules where taxpayer makes or takes delivery.
If the taxpayer makes or takes delivery in connection with a contract described in paragraph (d)(1)
of this section, any gain or loss shall be realized and recognized in the same manner as if the taxpayer sold the contract (or paid another person to assume the contract) on the date on which he took or made delivery for its fair market value on such date. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section regarding the definition of the term “delivery date.” This paragraph (d)(4)(ii) shall not apply in any case in which the taxpayer makes or takes delivery before June 11, 1987.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

# Example 1.
X is a calendar year corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. On October 1, 1989, when the six month forward rate is $.4907, X enters into a forward contract to buy 100,000 New Zealand dollars (NZD) for delivery on March 1, 1990. On March 1, 1990, when X takes delivery of the 100,000 NZD, the spot rate is 1NZD equals $.48. Pursuant to section 988(c)(5) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer that takes delivery of nonfunctional currency under a forward contract that is subject to section 988 is treated as if the taxpayer sold the contract for its fair market value on the date delivery is taken. If X sold the contract on March 1, 1990, the transferee would require a payment of $1,070 [($.48 × 100,000NZD)−($.4907 × 100,000NZD)] to compensate him for the loss in value of the 100,000NZD. Therefore, X realizes an exchange loss of $1,070. X has a basis in the 100,000NZD of $48,000.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that the contract is for Swiss francs and is a section 1256 contract. Assume further that on December 31, 1989, the value to X of the contract as marked to market is $1,000. Pursuant to section 1256(a), X realizes an exchange gain of $1,000. Such gain, however, is characterized as ordinary income under § 1.988-3 and will be sourced under § 1.988-4.

# Example 3.
X is a calendar year corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. On May 2, 1989, X enters into an option contract with Bank A to purchase 50,000 Canadian dollars (C$) for U.S. $42,500 (C$1 = U.S. $.85) for delivery on or before September 18, 1989. X pays a $285 premium to Bank A to obtain the option contract. On September 18, 1989, when X exercises the option and takes delivery of the C$50,000, the spot rate is C$1 equals U.S. $.90. Pursuant to section 988(c)(5) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer that takes delivery under an option contract that is subject to section 988 is treated as if the taxpayer sold the contract for its fair market value on the date delivery is taken. If X sold the contract for its fair market value on September 18, 1989, X would receive U.S. $2,500 [(C$50,000 × U.S. $.90)−(C$50,000 × U.S. $.85)]. Accordingly, X is deemed to have received U.S. $2,500 on the sale of the contract at its fair market value. X will realize U.S. $2,215 ($2,500 deemed received less $285 paid) of exchange gain with respect to the delivery of Canadian dollars under the option contract. X's basis in the 50,000 Canadian dollars is U.S. $45,000.

Hyperinflationary contracts
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer acquires or otherwise enters into a hyperinflationary contract (as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section) that has payments to be made or received that are denominated in (or determined by reference to) a nonfunctional currency of the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall realize exchange gain or loss with respect to such contract for its taxable year determined by reference to the change in exchange rates between—
(A) The later of the first day of the taxable year, or the date the contract was acquired or entered into; and
(B) The earlier of the last day of the taxable year, or the date the contract is disposed of or otherwise terminated.
(ii)
Definition of hyperinflationary contract.
A hyperinflationary contract is a contract described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section that provides for payments denominated in or determined by reference to a currency that is hyperinflationary (as defined in § 1.988-1(f)) at the time the taxpayer acquires or otherwise enters into the contract.
(iii)
Interaction with other provisions
—(A)
DASTM.
With respect to a qualified business unit that uses the United States dollar approximate separate transactions method of accounting described in § 1.985-3, this paragraph (d)(5) does not apply.
(B)
Hedging rules.
To the extent § 1.446-4 or 1.988-5 apply, this paragraph (d)(5) does not apply.
(C)
Adjustment for subsequent transactions.
Proper adjustments must be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain or loss taken into account by reason of this paragraph (d)(5).
(iv)
Effective date.
This paragraph (d) (5) is applicable to transactions acquired or otherwise entered into after February 14, 2000.
(e)
Currency swaps and other notional principal contracts
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section or in § 1.988-5, the timing of income, deduction and loss with respect to a notional principal contract that is a section 988 transaction shall be governed by section 446 and the regulations thereunder. Such income, deduction and loss is characterized as exchange gain or loss (except as provided in another section of the Internal Revenue Code (or regulations thereunder), § 1.988-5, or in paragraph (f) of this section).
(2)
Special rules for currency swaps
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) shall apply solely for purposes of determining the realization, recognition and amount of exchange gain or loss with respect to a currency swap contract, and not for purposes of determining the source of such gain or loss, or characterizing such gain or loss as interest. Except as provided in § 1.988-3(c), any income or loss realized with respect to a currency swap contract shall be characterized as exchange gain or loss (and not as interest income or expense). Any exchange gain or loss realized in accordance with this paragraph (e)(2) shall be recognized unless otherwise provided in an applicable section of the Code. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2), a currency swap contract is a contract defined in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. With respect to a contract which requires the payment of swap principal prior to maturity of such contract, see paragraph (f) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the rules of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section (regarding realization by offset) apply. See Example 2 of paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
(ii)
Definition of currency swap contract
—(A)
In general.
A currency swap contract is a contract involving different currencies between two or more parties to—
(
1
) Exchange periodic interim payments, as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, on or prior to maturity of the contract; and
(
2
) Exchange the swap principal amount upon maturity of the contract.
A currency swap contract may also require an exchange of the swap principal amount upon commencement of the agreement.
(B)
Swap principal amount.
The swap principal amount is an amount of two different currencies which, under the terms of the currency swap contract, is used to determine the periodic interim payments in each currency and which is exchanged upon maturity of the contract. If such amount is not clearly set forth in the contract, the Commissioner may determine the swap principal amount.
(C)
Exchange of periodic interim payments.
An exchange of periodic interim payments is an exchange of one or more payments in one currency specified by the contract for one or more payments in a different currency specified by the contract where the payments in each currency are computed by reference to an interest index applied to the swap principal amount. A currency swap contract must clearly indicate the periodic interim payments, or the interest index used to compute the periodic interim payments, in each currency.
(iii)
Timing and computation of periodic interim payments
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and § 1.988-5, the timing and computation of the periodic interim payments provided in a currency swap agreement shall be determined by treating—
(
1
) Payments made under the swap as payments made pursuant to a hypothetical borrowing that is denominated in the currency in which payments are required to be made (or are determined with reference to) under the swap, and
(
2
) Payments received under the swap as payments received pursuant to a hypothetical loan that is denominated in the currency in which payments are received (or are determined with reference to) under the swap.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, the hypothetical issue price of such hypothetical borrowing and loan shall be the swap principal amount. The hypothetical stated redemption price at maturity is the total of all payments (excluding any exchange of the swap principal amount at the inception of the
contract) provided under the hypothetical borrowing or loan other than periodic interest payments under the principles of section 1273. For purposes of determining economic accrual under the currency swap, the number of hypothetical interest compounding periods of such hypothetical borrowing and loan shall be determined pursuant to a semiannual compounding convention unless the currency swap contract indicates otherwise. For purposes of determining the timing and amount of the periodic interim payments, the principles regarding the amortization of interest (see generally, sections 1272 through 1275 and 163(e)) shall apply to the hypothetical interest expense and income of such hypothetical borrowing and loan. However, such principles shall not apply to determine the time when principal is deemed to be paid on the hypothetical borrowing and loan. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section and
Example 2
of paragraph (d)(5) of this section with respect to the time when principal is deemed to be paid. With respect to the translation and computation of exchange gain or loss on any hypothetical interest income or expense, see § 1.988-2(b). The amount treated as exchange gain or loss by the taxpayer with respect to the periodic interim payments for the taxable year shall be the amount of hypothetical interest income and exchange gain or loss attributable to such interest income from the hypothetical borrowing and loan for such year less the amount of hypothetical interest expense and exchange gain or loss attributable to the interest expense from such hypothetical borrowing and loan for such year.
(B)
Effect of prepayment for purposes of section 956.
For purposes of section 956, the Commissioner may treat any prepayment of a currency swap as a loan.
(iv)
Timing and determination of exchange gain or loss with respect to the swap principal amount.
Exchange gain or loss with respect to the swap principal amount shall be realized on the day the units of swap principal in each currency are exchanged. (See paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section which requires that the entire swap principal amount be exchanged upon maturity of the contract.) Such gain or loss shall be determined on the date of the exchange by subtracting the value (on such date) of the units of swap principal paid from the value of the units of swap principal received. This paragraph (e)(2)(iv) does not apply to an equal exchange of the swap principal amount at the commencement of the agreement at a market exchange rate.
(v)
Anti-abuse rules
—(A)
Method of accounting does not clearly reflect income.
If the taxpayer's method of accounting for income, expense, gain or loss attributable to a currency swap does not clearly reflect income, or if the present value of the payments to be made is not equivalent to that of the payments to be received (including the swap premium or discount, as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section) on the day the taxpayer enters into or acquires the contract, the Commissioner may apply principles analogous to those of section 1274 or such other rules as the Commissioner deems appropriate to clearly reflect income. For example, in order to clearly reflect income the Commissioner may determine the hypothetical issue price, the hypothetical stated redemption price at maturity, and the amounts required to be taken into account within a taxable year. Further, if the present value of the payments to be made is not equivalent to that of the payments to be received (including the swap premium or discount, as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section) on the day the taxpayer enters into or acquires the contract, the Commissioner may integrate the swap with another transaction (or transactions) in order to clearly reflect income.
(B)
Terms must be clearly stated.
If the currency swap contract does not clearly set forth the swap principal amount in each currency, and the periodic interim payments in each currency (or the interest index used to compute the periodic interim payments in each currency), the Commissioner may defer any income, deduction, gain or loss with respect to such contract until termination of the contract.
(3)
Amortization of swap premium or discount in the case of off-market currency swaps
—(i)
In general.
An “off-market currency swap” is a currency
swap contract under which the present value of the payments to be made is not equal to that of the payments to be received on the day the taxpayer enters into or acquires the contract (absent the swap premium or discount, as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section). Generally, such present values may not be equal if the swap exchange rate (as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section) is not the spot rate, or the interest indices used to compute the periodic interim payments do not reflect current values, on the day the taxpayer enters into or acquires the currency swap.
(ii)
Treatment of taxpayer entering into or acquiring an off-market currency swap.
If a taxpayer that enters into or acquires a currency swap makes a payment (that is, the taxpayer pays a premium, “swap premium,” to enter into or acquire the currency swap) or receives a payment (that is, the taxpayer enters into or acquires the currency swap at a discount, “swap discount”) in order to make the present value of the amounts to be paid equal the amounts to be received, such payment shall be amortized in a manner which places the taxpayer in the same position it would have been in had the taxpayer entered into a currency swap contract under which the present value of the amounts to be paid equal the amounts to be received (absent any swap premium or discount). Thus, swap premium or discount shall be amortized as follows—
(A) The amount of swap premium or discount that is attributable to the difference between the swap exchange rate (as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section) and the spot rate on the date the contract is entered into or acquired shall be taken into account as income or expense on the date the swap principal amounts are taken into account; and
(B) The amount of swap premium or discount attributable to the difference in values of the periodic interim payments shall be amortized in a manner consistent with the principles of economic accrual.
Cf.,
section 171.
Any amount taken into account pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) shall be treated as exchange gain or loss.
(iii)
Definition of swap exchange rate.
The swap exchange rate is the single exchange rate set forth in the contract at which the swap principal amounts are determined. If the swap exchange rate is not clearly set forth in the contract, the Commissioner may determine such rate.
(iv)
Coordination with § 1.446-3(g)(4) regarding swaps with significant nonperiodic payments.
The rules of § 1.446-3(g)(4) apply to any currency swap with a significant nonperiodic payment. Section 1.446-3(g)(4) applies before this paragraph (e)(3). Thus, if § 1.446-3(g)(4) applies, currency gain or loss may be realized on the loan. This paragraph (e)(3)(iv) applies to transactions entered into after February 14, 2000.
(4)
Treatment of taxpayer disposing of a currency swap.
Any gain or loss realized on the disposition or the termination of a currency swap is exchange gain or loss.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e).

# Example 1.
(i) C is an accrual method calendar year corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1989, C enters into a currency swap with J with the following terms:
(1) the principal amount is $150 and 100 British pounds (£) (the equivalent of $150 on the effective date of the contract assuming a spot rate of £1 = $1.50 on January 1, 1989);
(2) C will make payments equal to 10% of the dollar principal amount on December 31, 1989, and December 31, 1990;
(3) J will make payments equal to 12% of the pound principal amount on December 31, 1989, and December 31, 1990; and
(4) on December 31, 1990, C will pay to J the $150 principal amount and J will pay to C the £100 principal amount.
Assume that the spot rate is £1 = $1.50 on January 1, 1989, £1 = $1.40 on December 31, 1989, and £1 = $1.30 on December 31, 1990. Assume further that the average rate for 1989 is £1 = $1.45 and for 1990 is £1 = $1.35.
(ii) Solely for determining the realization of gain or loss in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section (and not for purposes of determining whether any payments are treated as interest), C will treat the dollar payments made by C as payments made pursuant to a dollar borrowing with an issue price of $150, a stated redemption price at maturity of $150, and yield to maturity of 10%. C will treat the pound payments received as payments received pursuant to a
pound loan with an issue price of £100, a stated redemption price at maturity of £100, and a yield of 12% to maturity. Pursuant to § 1.988-2(b), C is required to compute hypothetical accrued pound interest income at the average rate for the accrual period and then determine exchange gain or loss on the day payment is received with respect to such accrued amount. Accordingly, C will accrue $17.40 (£12 × $1.45) in 1989 and $16.20 (£12 × $1.35) in 1990. C also will compute hypothetical exchange loss of $.60 on December 31, 1989 [(£12 × $1.40)−(£12 × $1.45)] and hypothetical exchange loss of $.60 on December 31, 1990 [(£12 × $1.30)−(£12 × $1.35)]. All such hypothetical interest income and exchange loss are characterized and sourced as exchange gain and loss. Further, C is treated as having paid $15 ($150 × 10%) of hypothetical interest on December 31, 1989, and again on December 31, 1990. Such hypothetical interest expense is characterized and sourced as exchange loss. Thus, C will have a net exchange gain of $1.80 ($17.40−$.60−$15.00) with respect to the periodic interim payments in 1989 and a net exchange gain of $.60 ($16.20−$.60−$15.00) with respect to the periodic interim payments in 1990. Finally, C will realize an exchange loss on December 31, 1990, with respect to the exchange of the swap principal amount. This loss is determined by subtracting the value of the units of swap principal paid ($150) from the value of the units of swap principal received (£100 × $1.30 = $130) resulting in a $20 exchange loss.

# Example 2.
(i) C is an accrual method calendar year corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1989, when the spot rate is £1 = $1.50, C enters into a currency swap contract with J under which C agrees to make and receive the following payments:
Date
C pays
J pays
December 31, 1989
$15.00
£12.00
December 31, 1990
41.04
12.00
December 31, 1991
0.00
12.00
December 31, 1992
150.00
112.00
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, C must treat the dollar periodic interim payments under the swap as made pursuant to a hypothetical dollar borrowing. The hypothetical issue price is $150 and the stated redemption price at maturity is $206.04. The amount of hypothetical interest expense must be amortized in accordance with economic accrual. Thus J must include and C must deduct periodic interim payment amounts as follows:
Amount taken into account
Adjusted issue price
December 31, 1989
$15.00
150.00
December 31, 1990
$15.00
123.96
December 31, 1991
$12.40
136.36
December 31, 1992
$13.64
(iii) Gain or loss with respect to the periodic interim payments of the currency swap is determined under paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section with respect to the dollar cash flow amortized as set forth above and the corresponding pound cash flow as stated in the currency swap contract. Gain or loss with respect to the principal payments (
i.e.,
$150 and £100) exchanged on December 31, 1992, is determined under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section on December 31, 1992, notwithstanding that under the principles regarding amortization of interest $26.04 would have been regarded as a payment of principal on December 31, 1990.

# Example 3.
(i) X is a corporation on the accrual method of accounting with the dollar as its functional currency and the calendar year as its taxable year. On January 1, 1989, X enters into a three year currency swap contract with Y with the following terms. The swap principal amount is $100 and the Swiss franc (Sf) equivalent of such amount which equals Sf200 translated at the swap exchange rate of $1 = Sf2. There is no initial exchange of the swap principal amount. The interest rates used to compute the periodic interim payments are 10% compounded annually for U.S. dollar payments and 5% compounded annually for Swiss franc payments. Thus, under the currency swap, X agrees to pay Y $10 (10% × $100) on December 31st of 1989, 1990 and 1991 and to pay Y the swap principal amount of $100 on December 31, 1991. Y agrees to pay X Sf10 (5% × Sf200) on December 31st of 1989, 1990 and 1991 and to pay X the swap principal amount of Sf200 on December 31, 1991. Assume that the average rate for 1989 and the spot rate on December 31, 1989, is $1 = Sf2.5.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, on December 31, 1989, X will realize an exchange loss of $6 (the sum of $10 of loss by reason of the $10 periodic interim payment paid to Y and $4.00 of gain, the value of Sf10 on December 31, 1989, from the receipt of Sf10 on such date).
(iii) On January 1, 1990, X transfers its rights and obligations under the swap contract to Z, an unrelated corporation. Z has the dollar as its functional currency, is on the accrual method of accounting, and has the calendar year as its taxable year. On January 1, 1990, the exchange rate is $1 = Sf2.50. The relevant dollar interest rate is 8% compounded annually and the relevant Swiss franc interest rate is 5% compounded annually. Because of the movement in exchange and interest rates, the agreement between X and Z to transfer the currency swap requires
X to pay Z $23.56 (the swap discount as determined under paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
(iv) Pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) of this section, X may deduct the loss of $23.56 in 1990. The loss is characterized under § 1.988-3 and sourced under § 1.988-4.
(v) Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, Z is required to amortize the $23.56 received as follows. The amount of the $23.56 payment that is attributable to movements in exchange rates ($20) is taken into account on December 31, 1991, the date the swap principal amounts are exchanged, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. This amount is the present value (discounted at 10%, the rate under the currency swap contract used to compute the dollar periodic interim payments) of the financial asset required to compensate Z for the loss in value of the hypothetical Swiss franc loan resulting from movements in exchange rates between January 1, 1989, and January 1, 1990. This amount is determined by assuming that interest rates did not change from the date the swap originally was entered into (January 1, 1989), but that the exchange rate is $1 = Sf2.50. Under this assumption, a taxpayer undertaking the obligation to pay dollars under the currency swap on January 1, 1990, would only agree to pay $8 for Sf10 on December 31, 1990, and $88 for Sf210 on December 31, 1991, because the exchange rates have moved from $1 = Sf2 to $1 = Sf2.50. Thus, Z requires $2 on December 31, 1990, and $22 on December 31, 1991, to compensate for the amount of dollar payments Z is required to make in exchange for the Swiss francs received on December 31, 1990 and 1991. The present value of $2 on December 31, 1990, and $22 on December 31, 1991, discounted at the rate for U.S. dollar payments of 10% is $20 ($1.82 + $18.18). This amount is discounted at the rate for U.S. dollar payments (i.e., at the historic rate) because the amount of the $23.56 payment received by Z that is attributable to movements in interest rates is computed and amortized separately as provided in the following paragraph.
(vi) Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, Z is required to amortize the portion of the $23.56 payment attributable to movements in interest rates under principles of economic accrual over the term of the currency swap agreement. The amount of the $23.56 payment that is attributable to movements in interest rates (assuming that exchange rates have not changed) is the present value ($3.56) of the excess ($2.00 in 1990 and $2.00 in 1991) of the periodic interim payments Z is required to pay under the currency swap agreement ($10 in 1990 and $10 in 1991) over the amount Z would be required to pay if the currency swap agreement reflected current interest rates on the day Z acquired the swap contract ($8 in 1990 and $8 in 1991) discounted at the appropriate dollar interest rate on January 1, 1990. Thus, under principles of economic accrual (e.g., see section 171 of the Code), Z will include in income $1.72 on December 31, 1990, the amount that, when added to the interest ($.28) on the $3.56 computed at the 8% rate on the date Z acquired the currency swap contract, will equal the $2.00 needed to compensate Z for the movement in interest rates between January 1, 1989, and January 1, 1990. Z also will include in income $1.85 on December 31, 1991, the amount that, when added to the interest ($.15) on the $1.85 (the remaining balance of the $3.56 payment) computed at the 8% rate on the date Z acquired the currency swap contract, will equal the $2.00 needed to compensate Z for the movement in interest rates between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 1991. This amount is computed assuming exchange rates have not changed because the amount attributable to movements in exchange rates is computed and amortized separately under the preceding paragraph.
(6)
Special effective date for rules regarding currency swaps.
Paragraph (e)(3) of this section regarding amortization of swap premium or discount in the case of off-market currency swaps shall be effective for transactions entered into after September 21, 1989, unless such swap premium or discount was paid or received pursuant to a binding contract with an unrelated party that was entered into prior to such date. For transactions entered into prior to this date, see Notice 89-21, 1989-8 I.R.B. 23.
(7)
Special rules for currency swap contracts in hyperinflationary currencies
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer enters into a hyperinflationary currency swap (as defined in paragraph (e)(7)(iv) of this section), then the taxpayer realizes exchange gain or loss for its taxable year with respect to such instrument determined by reference to the change in exchange rates between—
(A) The later of the first day of the taxable year, or the date the instrument was entered into (by the taxpayer); and
(B) The earlier of the last day of the taxable year, or the date the instrument is disposed of or otherwise terminated.
(ii)
Adjustment to principal or basis.
Proper adjustments are made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain or loss taken into account by reason of this paragraph (e)(7).
(iii)
Interaction with DASTM.
With respect to a qualified business unit that uses the United States dollar approximate separate transactions method of accounting described in § 1.985-3, this paragraph (e)(7) does not apply.
(iv)
Definition of hyperinflationary currency swap contract.
A hyperinflationary currency swap contract is a currency swap contract that provides for—
(A) Payments denominated in or determined by reference to a currency that is hyperinflationary (as defined in § 1.988-1(f)) at the time the taxpayer enters into or otherwise acquires the currency swap; or
(B) Payments that are adjusted to take into account the fact that the currency is hyperinflationary (as defined in § 1.988-1(f)) during the current taxable year. A currency swap contract that provides for periodic payments determined by reference to a variable interest rate based on local conditions and generally responding to changes in the local consumer price index is an example of this latter type of currency swap contract.
(v)
Special effective date for nonfunctional hyperinflationary currency swap contracts.
This paragraph (e)(7) applies to transactions entered into after February 14, 2000.
(f)
Substance over form
—(1)
In general.
If the substance of a transaction described in § 1.988-1(a)(1) differs from its form, the timing, source, and character of gains or losses with respect to such transaction may be recharacterized by the Commissioner in accordance with its substance. For example, if a taxpayer enters into a transaction that it designates a “currency swap contract” that requires the prepayment of all payments to be made or to be received (but not both), the Commissioner may recharacterize the contract as a loan. In applying the substance over form principle, separate transactions may be integrated where appropriate. See also § 1.861-9T(b)(1).

Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (f).

# Example.
(i) On January 1, 1990, X, a U.S. corporation with the dollar as its functional currency, enters into a contract with Y under which X will pay Y $100 and Y will pay X LC100 on January 1, 1990, and X will pay Y LC109.3 and Y will pay X $133 on December 31, 1992. On January 1, 1990, the spot exchange rate is LC1 = $1 and the 3 year forward rate is LC1 = $.8218. X's cash flows are summarized below:
Date
Dollar
LC
1/1/90
(100)
100
12/31/90
0
0
12/31/91
0
0
12/31/92
133
(109.3)
(ii) X and Y designate this contract as a “currency swap.” Notwithstanding this designation, for purposes of determining the timing, source, and character with respect to the transaction, the transaction is characterized by the Commissioner in accordance with its substance. Thus, the January 1, 1990, exchange by X of $100 for LC 100 is treated as a spot purchase of LCs by X and the December 31, 1992, exchange by X at 109.3LC for $133 is treated as a forward sale of LCs by X. Under such treatment there would be no tax consequences to X under paragraph (e)(2) of this section in 1990, 1991, and 1992 with respect to this transaction other than the realization of exchange gain or loss on the sale of the LC109.3 on December 31, 1992. Calculation of such gain or loss would be governed by the rules of paragraph (d) of this section.
(g)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, this section shall be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Thus, except as otherwise provided in this section, any payments made or received with respect to a section 988 transaction in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, are subject to this section.
(h)
Timing of income and deductions from notional principal contracts.
Except as otherwise provided (e.g., in § 1.988-5 or § 1.446-3(g)), income or loss from a notional principal contract described in § 1.988-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) (other than a currency swap) is exchange gain or loss. For the rules governing the timing of income and deductions with respect to notional principal contracts, see § 1.446-3. See paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to currency swaps.
(i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.988-2T(i).

Treatment of creditor.
For rules applicable to a corporation included in a controlled group that is a creditor under a debt instrument see § 1.267(f)-1(e).
(ii)
Treatment of debtor
—(A)
In general.
Exchange loss realized under § 1.988-2(b)(4) or (b)(6) is deferred if—
(
1
) The loss is realized by a debtor with respect to a loan from a person that has a relationship to the debtor described in section 267(b) or section 707(b); and
(
2
) The transaction resulting in the realization of exchange loss has as a principal purpose the avoidance of Federal income tax.
(B)
Recognition of deferred loss.
Any exchange loss that is deferred under paragraph (b)(16)(ii)(A) of this section is deferred until the end of the term of the loan, determined immediately prior to the transaction.
(17) through (h) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.988-2(b)(17) through (h).

Special rules for section 988 transactions of a section 987 QBU.
For rules regarding section 988 transactions of a section 987 QBU, see § 1.987-3T(b)(4) for section 987 QBUs in general and § 1.987-1T(b)(6) for dollar QBUs.

Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (b)(16) of this section applies to any exchange loss realized on or after December 7, 2016. Paragraph (i) of this section applies to taxable years beginning on or after one year after the first day of the first taxable year following December 7, 2016. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a taxpayer makes an election under § 1.987-11(b), then paragraph (i) of this section applies to taxable years to which §§ 1.987-1 through 1.987-10 apply as a result of such election.
(k)
Expiration date.
The applicability of this section expires on December 6, 2019.
[T.D. 9795, 81 FR 88879, Dec. 8, 2016]
§ 1.988-3
Character of exchange gain or loss.
(a)
In general.
The character of exchange gain or loss recognized on a section 988 transaction is governed by section 988 and this section. Except as otherwise provided in section 988(c)(1)(E), section 1092, § 1.988-5 and this section, exchange gain or loss realized with respect to a section 988 transaction (including a section 1256 contract that is also a section 988 transaction) shall be characterized as ordinary gain or loss. Accordingly, unless a valid election is made under paragraph (b) of this section, any section providing special rules for capital gain or loss treatment, such as sections 1233, 1234, 1234A, 1236 and 1256(f)(3), shall not apply.
(b)
Election to characterize exchange gain or loss on certain identified forward contracts, futures contracts and option contracts as capital gain or loss
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a taxpayer may elect, subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, to treat any gain or loss recognized on a contract described in § 1.988-2(d)(1) as capital gain or loss, but only if the contract—
(i) Is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer;
(ii) Is not part of a straddle within the meaning of section 1092(c) (without regard to subsections (c)(4) or (e)); and
(iii) Is not a regulated futures contract or nonequity option with respect to which an election under section 988(c)(1)(D)(ii) is in effect.
If a valid election under this paragraph (b) is made with respect to a section 1256 contract, section 1256 shall govern the character of any gain or loss recognized on such contract.
(2)
Special rule for contracts that become part of a straddle after an election is made.
If a contract which is the subject of an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section becomes part of a straddle within the meaning of section 1092(c) (without regard to subsections (c)(4) or (e)) after the date of the election, the election shall be invalid with respect to gains from such contract and the Commissioner, in his sole discretion,
may invalidate the election with respect to losses.
(3)
Requirements for making the election.
A taxpayer elects to treat gain or loss on a transaction described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section as capital gain or loss by clearly identifying such transaction on its books and records on the date the transaction is entered into. No specific language or account is necessary for identifying a transaction referred to in the preceding sentence. However, the method of identification must be consistently applied and must clearly identify the pertinent transaction as subject to the section 988(a)(1)(B) election. The Commissioner, in his sole discretion, may invalidate any purported election that does not comply with the preceding sentence.
(4)
Verification.
A taxpayer that has made an election under § 1.988-3(b)(3) must attach to his income tax return a statement which sets forth the following:
(i) A description and the date of each election made by the taxpayer during the taxpayer's taxable year;
(ii) A statement that each election made during the taxable year was made before the close of the date the transaction was entered into;
(iii) A description of any contract for which an election was in effect and the date such contract expired or was otherwise sold or exchanged during the taxable year;
(iv) A statement that the contract was never part of a straddle as defined in section 1092; and
(v) A statement that all transactions subject to the election are included on the statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return.
In addition to any penalty that may otherwise apply, the Commissioner, in his sole discretion, may invalidate any or all elections made during the taxable year under § 1.988-3(b)(1) if the taxpayer fails to verify each election as provided in this § 1.988-3(b)(4). The preceding sentence shall not apply if the taxpayer's failure to verify each election was due to reasonable cause or bona fide mistake. The burden of proof to show reasonable cause or bona fide mistake made in good faith is on the taxpayer.
(5)
Independent verification
—(i)
Effect of independent verification.
If the taxpayer receives independent verification of the election in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the taxpayer shall be presumed to have satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section. A contract that is a part of a straddle as defined in section 1092 may not be independently verified and shall be subject to the rules of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(ii)
Requirements for independent verification.
A taxpayer receives independent verification of the election in paragraph (b)(3) of this section if—
(A) The taxpayer establishes a separate account(s) with an unrelated broker(s) or dealer(s) through which all transactions to be independently verified pursuant to this paragraph (b)(5) are conducted and reported.
(B) Only transactions entered into on or after the date the taxpayer establishes such account may be recorded in the account.
(C) Transactions subject to the election of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are entered into such account on the date such transactions are entered into.
(D) The broker or dealer provides the taxpayer a statement detailing the transactions conducted through such account and includes on such statement the following: “Each transaction identified in this account is subject to the election set forth in section 988(a)(1)(B).”
(iii)
Special effective date for independent verification.
The rules of this paragraph (b)(5) shall be effective for transactions entered into after March 17, 1992.
(6)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided, this paragraph (b) is effective for taxable years beginning on or after September 21, 1989. For prior taxable years, any reasonable contemporaneous election meeting the requirements of section 988(a)(1)(B) shall satisfy this paragraph (b).
(c)
Exchange gain or loss treated as interest
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (c)(1), exchange gain or loss realized on a section 988 transaction shall not be treated as interest income or expense. Exchange gain or
loss realized on a section 988 transaction shall be treated as interest income or expense as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section with regard to tax exempt bonds, § 1.988-2(e)(2)(ii)(B), § 1.988-5, and in administrative pronouncements. See § 1.861-9T(b), providing rules for the allocation of certain items of exchange gain or loss in the same manner as interest expense.
(2)
Exchange loss realized by the holder on nonfunctional currency tax exempt bonds.
Exchange loss realized by the holder of a debt instrument the interest on which is excluded from gross income under section 103(a) or any similar provision of law shall be treated as an offset to and reduce total interest income received or accrued with respect to such instrument. Therefore, to the extent of total interest income, no exchange loss shall be recognized. This paragraph (c)(2) shall be effective with respect to debt instruments acquired on or after June 24, 1987.
(d)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, this section shall be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Thus, except as otherwise provided in this section, any payments made or received with respect to a section 988 transaction in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, are subject to this section. Thus, for example, a payment made prior to January 1, 1987, under a forward contract that results in the deferral of a loss under section 1092 to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, is not characterized as an ordinary loss by virtue of paragraph (a) of this section because payment was made prior to January 1, 1987.
[T.D. 8400, 57 FR 9197, Mar. 17, 1992]
§ 1.988-4
Source of gain or loss realized on a section 988 transaction.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.988-5 and this section, the source of exchange gain or loss shall be determined by reference to the residence of the taxpayer. This rule applies even if the taxpayer has made an election under § 1.988-3(b) to characterize exchange gain or loss as capital gain or loss. This section takes precedence over section 865.
(b)
Qualified business unit
—(1)
In general.
The source of exchange gain or loss shall be determined by reference to the residence of the qualified business unit of the taxpayer on whose books the asset, liability, or item of income or expense giving rise to such gain or loss is properly reflected.
(2)
Proper reflection on the books of the taxpayer or qualified business unit
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the principles of § 1.987-2(b) apply in determining whether an asset, liability, or item of income, gain, deduction, or loss is reflected on the books and records of a qualified business unit.
(ii)
Applicability date.
Generally, paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. However, if pursuant to § 1.987-15(b), a taxpayer chooses to apply §§ 1.987-1 through 1.987-15 to a taxable year before the first taxable year described in § 1.987-15(a)(1), then paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section applies to that taxable year.
(c)
Effectively connected exchange gain or loss.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, exchange gain or loss that under principles similar to those set forth in § 1.864-4(c) arises from the conduct of a United States trade or business shall be sourced in the United States and such gain or loss shall be treated as effectively connected to the conduct of a United States trade or business for purposes of sections 871(b) and 882 (a)(1).
(d)
Residence
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), for purposes of sections 985 through 989, the residence of any person shall be—
(i) In the case of an individual, the country in which such individual's tax home (as defined in section 911(d)(3)) is located;
(ii) In the case of a corporation, partnership, trust or estate which is a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)), the United States; and
(iii) In the case of a corporation, partnership, trust or estate which is not a United States person, a country other than the United States.
If an individual does not have a tax home (as defined in section 911(d)(3)), the residence of such individual shall
be the United States if such individual is a United States citizen or a resident alien and shall be a country other than the United States if such individual is not a United States citizen or resident alien. If the taxpayer is a U.S. person and has no principal place of business outside the United States, the residence of the taxpayer is the United States. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if a partnership is formed or availed of to avoid tax by altering the source of exchange gain or loss, the source of such gain or loss shall be determined by reference to the residence of the partners rather than the partnership.
(2)
Exception.
In the case of a qualified business unit of any taxpayer (including an individual), the residence of such unit shall be the country in which the principal place of business of such qualified business unit is located.
(3)
Partner in a partnership not engaged in a U.S. trade or business under section 864(b)(2).
The determination of residence shall be made at the partner level (without regard to whether the partnership is a qualified business unit of the partners) in the case of partners in a partnership that are not engaged in a U.S. trade or business by reason of section 864(b)(2).
(e)
Special rule for certain related party loans
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a loan by a United States person or a related person to a 10 percent owned foreign corporation, or a corporation that meets the 80 percent foreign business requirements test of section 861(c)(1), other than a corporation subject to § 1.861-11T(e)(2)(i), which is denominated in, or determined by reference to, a currency other than the U.S. dollar and bears interest at a rate at least 10 percentage points higher than the Federal mid-term rate (as determined under section 1274(d)) at the time such loan is entered into, the following rules shall apply—
(i) For purposes of section 904 only, such loan shall be marked to market annually on the earlier of the last business day of the United States person's (or related person's) taxable year or the date the loan matures; and
(ii) Any interest income earned with respect to such loan for the taxable year shall be treated as income from sources within the United States to the extent of any notional loss attributable to such loan under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
United States person.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term “United States person” means a person described in section 7701(a)(30).
(3)
Loans by related foreign persons
—(i)
In general.
[Reserved]
(ii)
Definition of related person.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term “related person” has the meaning given such term by section 954(d)(3) except that such section shall be applied by substituting “United States person” for “controlled foreign corporation” each place such term appears.
(4)
10 percent owned foreign corporation.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term “10 percent owned foreign corporation” means any foreign corporation in which the United States person owns directly or indirectly (within the meaning of section 318(a)) at least 10 percent of the voting stock.
(f)
Exchange gain or loss treated as interest under § 1.988-3.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any gain or loss realized on a section 988 transaction that is treated as interest income or expense under § 1.988-3(c)(1) shall be sourced or allocated and apportioned pursuant to section 861(a)(1), 862(a)(1), or 864(e) as the case may be.
(g)
Exchange gain or loss allocated in the same manner as interest under § 1.861-9T.
The allocation and apportionment of exchange gain or loss under § 1.861-9T shall not affect the source of exchange gain or loss for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, 1442 and 6049.
(h)
Effective date.
This section shall be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Thus, any payments made or received with respect to a section 988 transaction in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, are subject to this section.
[T.D. 8400, 57 FR 9199, Mar. 17, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9794, 81 FR 88851, Dec. 8, 2016; T.D. 10016, 89 FR 100223, Dec. 11, 2024]
§ 1.988-5
Section 988(d) hedging transactions.
(a)
Integration of a nonfunctional currency debt instrument and a § 1.988-5(a) hedge
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (a)
applies to a qualified hedging transaction as defined in this paragraph (a)(1). A qualified hedging transaction is an integrated economic transaction, as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, consisting of a qualifying debt instrument as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and a § 1.988-5(a) hedge as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If a taxpayer enters into a transaction that is a qualified hedging transaction, no exchange gain or loss is recognized by the taxpayer on the qualifying debt instrument or on the § 1.988-5(a) hedge for the period that either is part of a qualified hedging transaction, and the transactions shall be integrated as provided in paragraph (a)(9) of this section. However, if the qualified hedging transaction results in a synthetic nonfunctional currency denominated debt instrument, such instrument shall be subject to the rules of § 1.988-2(b).
(2)
Exception.
This paragraph (a) does not apply with respect to a qualified hedging transaction that creates a synthetic asset or liability denominated in, or determined by reference to, a currency other than the U.S. dollar if the rate that approximates the Federal short-term rate in such currency is at least 20 percentage points higher than the Federal short term rate (determined under section 1274(d)) on the date the taxpayer identifies the transaction as a qualified hedging transaction.
(3)
Qualifying debt instrument
—(i)
In general.
A qualifying debt instrument is a debt instrument described in § 1.988-1(a)(2)(i), regardless of whether denominated in, or determined by reference to, nonfunctional currency (including dual currency debt instruments, multi-currency debt instruments and contingent payment debt instruments). A qualifying debt instrument does not include accounts payable, accounts receivable or similar items of expense or income.
(ii)
Special rule for debt instrument of which all payments are proportionately hedged.
If a debt instrument satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, and all principal and interest payments under the instrument are hedged in the same proportion, then for purposes of this paragraph (a), that portion of the instrument that is hedged is eligible to be treated as a qualifying debt instrument, and the rules of this paragraph (a) shall apply separately to such qualifying debt instrument. See Example 8 in paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section.
(4)
Section 1.988-5(a) hedge
—(i)
In general.
A § 1.988-5(a) hedge (hereinafter referred to in this paragraph (a) as a “hedge”) is a spot contract, futures contract, forward contract, option contract, notional principal contract, currency swap contract, similar financial instrument, or series or combination thereof, that when integrated with a qualifying debt instrument permits the calculation of a yield to maturity (under principles of section 1272) in the currency in which the synthetic debt instrument is denominated (as determined under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(A) of this section).
(ii)
Retroactive application of definition of currency swap contract.
A taxpayer may apply the definition of currency swap contract set forth in § 1.988-2(e)(2)(ii) in lieu of the definition of swap agreement in section 2(e)(5) of Notice 87-11, 1987-1 C.B. 423 to transactions entered into after December 31, 1986 and before September 21, 1989.
(5)
Definition of integrated economic transaction.
A qualifying debt instrument and a hedge are an integrated economic transaction if all of the following requirements are satisfied—
(i) All payments to be made or received under the qualifying debt instrument (or amounts determined by reference to a nonfunctional currency) are fully hedged on the date the taxpayer identifies the transaction under paragraph (a) of this section as a qualified hedging transaction such that a yield to maturity (under principles of section 1272) in the currency in which the synthetic debt instrument is denominated (as determined under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(A) of this section) can be calculated. Any contingent payment features of the qualifying debt instrument must be fully offset by the hedge such that the synthetic debt instrument is not classified as a contingent payment debt instrument. See Examples 6 and 7 of paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section.
(ii) The hedge is identified in accordance with paragraph (a)(8) of this section on or before the date the acquisition of the financial instrument (or instruments) constituting the hedge is settled or closed.
(iii) None of the parties to the hedge are related. The term “related” means the relationships defined in section 267(b) or section 707(b).
(iv) In the case of a qualified business unit with a residence, as defined in section 988(a)(3)(B), outside of the United States, both the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are properly reflected on the books of such qualified business unit throughout the term of the qualified hedging transaction.
(v) Subject to the limitations of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, both the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are entered into by the same individual, partnership, trust, estate, or corporation. With respect to a corporation, the same corporation must enter into both the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge whether or not such corporation is a member of an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated return.
(vi) With respect to a foreign person engaged in a U.S. trade or business that enters into a qualifying debt instrument or hedge through such trade or business, all items of income and expense associated with the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge (other than interest expense that is subject to § 1.882-5), would have been effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business throughout the term of the qualified hedging transaction had this paragraph (a) not applied.
(6)
Special rules for legging in and legging out of integrated treatment
—(i)
Legging in.
“Legging in” to integrated treatment under this paragraph (a) means that a hedge is entered into after the date the qualifying debt instrument is entered into or acquired, and the requirements of this paragraph (a) are satisfied on the date the hedge is entered into (“leg in date”). If a taxpayer legs into integrated treatment, the following rules shall apply—
(A) Exchange gain or loss shall be realized with respect to the qualifying debt instrument determined solely by reference to changes in exchange rates between—
(
1
) The date the instrument was acquired by the holder, or the date the obligor assumed the obligation to make payments under the instrument; and
(
2
) The leg in date.
(B) The recognition of such gain or loss will be deferred until the date the qualifying debt instrument matures or is otherwise disposed of.
(C) The source and character of such gain or loss shall be determined on the leg in date as if the qualifying debt instrument was actually sold or otherwise terminated by the taxpayer.
(ii)
Legging out.
With respect to a qualifying debt instrument and hedge that are properly identified as a qualified hedging transaction, “legging out” of integrated treatment under this paragraph (a) means that the taxpayer disposes of or otherwise terminates all or any portion of the qualifying debt instrument or the hedge before maturity of the qualified hedging transaction. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the taxpayer changes a material term of the qualifying debt instrument (for example, exercises an option to change the interest rate or index, or the maturity date) or the hedge (for example, changes the interest or exchange rates underlying the hedge, or the expiration date) before maturity of the qualified hedging transaction, the taxpayer will be deemed to have disposed of or otherwise terminated all or any portion of the qualifying debt instrument or the hedge, as applicable. A taxpayer that disposes of or terminates a qualified hedging transaction (that is, disposes of or terminates both the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge in their entirety on the same day) is considered to have disposed of or otherwise terminated the synthetic debt instrument rather than legging out. See paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section,
Example 10
for an illustration of this rule. If a taxpayer legs out of integrated treatment, the following rules apply:
(A) The transaction will be treated as a qualified hedging transaction during the time the requirements of this paragraph (a) were satisfied.
(B) If all of the instruments comprising the hedge (each such instrument, a component) are disposed of or otherwise terminated, the qualifying debt instrument is treated as sold or otherwise terminated by the taxpayer for its fair market value on the date the hedge is disposed of or otherwise terminated (the leg-out date), and any gain or loss (including gain or loss resulting from factors other than movements in exchange rates) from the identification date to the leg-out date is realized and recognized on the leg-out date. The spot rate on the leg-out date is used to determine exchange gain or loss on the debt instrument for the period beginning on the leg-out date and ending on the date such instrument matures or is disposed of or otherwise terminated. Proper adjustment must be made to reflect any gain or loss taken into account. The netting rule of § 1.988-2(b)(8) applies. See paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section,
Example 4
and
Example 5
for an illustration of this rule.
(C) If a hedge has more than one component (and such components have been properly identified as being part of the qualified hedging transaction) and at least one but not all of the components that comprise the hedge has been disposed of or otherwise terminated, or if part of any component of the hedge has been terminated (whether a hedge consists of a single or multiple components), the date such component (or part thereof) is disposed of or terminated is considered the leg-out date and the qualifying debt instrument is treated as sold or otherwise terminated by the taxpayer for its fair market value in accordance with the rules of paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(B) of this section on such leg-out date. In addition, all of the remaining components (or parts thereof) that have not been disposed of or otherwise terminated are treated as sold by the taxpayer for their fair market value on the leg-out date, and any gain or loss from the identification date to the leg-out date is realized and recognized on the leg-out date. To the extent relevant, the spot rate on the leg-out date is used to determine exchange gain or loss on the remaining components (or parts thereof) for the period beginning on the leg-out date and ending on the date such components (or parts thereof) are disposed of or otherwise terminated. See paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section,
Example 11
for an illustration of this rule.
(D) If the qualifying debt instrument is disposed of or otherwise terminated in whole or in part, the date of such disposition or termination is considered the leg-out date. Accordingly, the hedge (including all components making up the hedge in their entirety) that is part of the qualified hedging transaction is treated as sold by the taxpayer for its fair market value on the leg-out date, and any gain or loss from the identification date to the leg-out date is realized and recognized on the leg-out date. To the extent relevant, the spot rate on the leg-out date is used to determine exchange gain or loss on the hedge (including all components thereof) for the period beginning on the leg-out date and ending on the date such hedge is disposed of or otherwise terminated.
(E) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this section (regarding identification by the Commissioner), the part of the qualified hedging transaction that has not been disposed of or otherwise terminated (that is, the remaining debt instrument in its entirety even if partially hedged, or the remaining components of the hedge) cannot be part of a qualified hedging transaction for any period after the leg-out date.
(F) If a taxpayer legs out of a qualified hedging transaction and realizes a net gain with respect to the debt instrument that is disposed of or otherwise terminated, then paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(B), (C), and (D) of this section, as appropriate, will not apply if during the period beginning 30 days before the leg-out date and ending 30 days after that date the taxpayer enters into another transaction that, taken together with any remaining components of the hedge, hedges at least 50 percent of the remaining currency flow with respect to the qualifying debt instrument that was part of the qualified hedging transaction or, if appropriate, an equivalent amount under the hedge (or any remaining components thereof) that was part of the qualified hedging transaction. Similarly, in a case in which a
hedge has multiple components that are part of a qualified hedging transaction, if the taxpayer legs out of a qualified hedging transaction by terminating one such component or a part of one or more such components and realizes a net gain with respect to the terminated component, components, or portions thereof, then paragraphs (a)(6)(ii)(B), (C), and (D) of this section, as appropriate, will not apply if the remaining components of the hedge (including parts thereof) by themselves hedge at least 50 percent of the remaining currency flow with respect to the qualifying debt instrument that was part of the qualified hedging transaction. See paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section,
Example 11
for an illustration of this rule.
(7)
Transactions part of a straddle.
At the discretion of the Commissioner, a transaction shall not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section if the debt instrument making up the qualified hedging transaction is part of a straddle as defined in section 1092(c) prior to the time the qualified hedging transaction is identified.
(8)
Identification requirements
—(i)
Identification by the taxpayer.
A taxpayer must establish a record and before the close of the date the hedge is entered into, the taxpayer must enter into the record for each qualified hedging transaction the following information—
(A) The date the qualifying debt instrument and hedge were entered into;
(B) The date the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are identified as constituting a qualified hedging transaction;
(C) The amount that must be deferred, if any, under paragraph (a)(6) of this section and the source and character of such deferred amount;
(D) A description of the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge; and
(E) A summary of the cash flow resulting from treating the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge as a qualified hedging transaction.
(ii)
Identification by trustee on behalf of beneficiary.
A trustee of a trust that enters into a qualified hedging transaction may satisfy the identification requirements described in paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section on behalf of a beneficiary of such trust.
(iii)
Identification by the Commissioner.
If—
(A) A taxpayer enters into a qualifying debt instrument and a hedge but fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this paragraph (a), and
(B) On the basis of all the facts and circumstances, the Commissioner concludes that the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are, in substance, a qualified hedging transaction,
then the Commissioner may treat the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge as a qualified hedging transaction. The Commissioner may identify a qualifying debt instrument and a hedge as a qualified hedging transaction regardless of whether the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are held by the same taxpayer.
(9)
Taxation of qualified hedging transactions
—(i)
In general
—(A)
General rule.
If a transaction constitutes a qualified hedging transaction, the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are integrated and treated as a single transaction with respect to the taxpayer that has entered into the qualified hedging transaction during the period that the transaction qualifies as a qualified hedging transaction. Neither the qualifying debt instrument nor the hedge that makes up the qualified hedging transaction shall be subject to section 263(g), 1092 or 1256 for the period such transactions are integrated. However, the qualified hedging transaction may be subject to section 263(g) or 1092 if such transaction is part of a straddle.
(B)
Special rule for income or expense of foreign persons effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
Interest income of a foreign person resulting from a qualified hedging transaction entered into by such foreign person that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section shall be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Interest expense of a foreign person resulting from a qualified hedging transaction entered into by such foreign person that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section shall be allocated and apportioned under § 1.882-5 of the regulations.
(C)
Special rule for foreign persons that enter into qualified hedging transactions giving rise to U.S. source income not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
If a foreign person enters into a qualified hedging transaction that gives rise to U.S. source interest income (determined under the source rules for synthetic asset transactions as provided in this section) not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such foreign person, for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, 1442 and 6049, the provisions of this paragraph (a) shall not apply and such sections of the Internal Revenue Code shall be applied separately to the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge. To the extent relevant to any foreign person, if the requirements of this paragraph (a) are otherwise met, the provisions of this paragraph (a) shall apply for all other purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (
e.g.,
for purposes of calculating the earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation that enters into a qualified hedging transaction through a qualified business unit resident outside the United States, income or expense with respect to such qualified hedging transaction shall be calculated under the provisions of this paragraph (a)).
(ii)
Income tax effects of integration.
The effect of integrating and treating a transaction as a single transaction is to create a synthetic debt instrument for income tax purposes, which is subject to the original issue discount provisions of sections 1272 through 1288 and 163(e), the terms of which are determined as follows:
(A)
Denomination of synthetic debt instrument.
In the case where the qualifying debt instrument is a borrowing, the denomination of the synthetic debt instrument is the same as the currency paid under the terms of the hedge to acquire the currency used to make payments under the qualifying debt instrument. In the case where the qualifying debt instrument is a lending, the denomination of the synthetic debt instrument is the same as the currency received under the terms of the hedge in exchange for amounts received under the qualifying debt instrument. For example, if the hedge is a forward contract to acquire British pounds for dollars, and the qualifying debt instrument is a borrowing denominated in British pounds, the synthetic debt instrument is considered a borrowing in dollars.
(B)
Term and accrual periods.
The term of the synthetic debt instrument shall be the period beginning on the identification date and ending on the date the qualifying debt instrument matures or such earlier date that the qualifying debt instrument or hedge is disposed of or otherwise terminated. Unless otherwise clearly indicated by the payment interval under the hedge, the accrual period shall be a six month period which ends on the dates determined under section 1272(a)(5).
(C)
Issue price.
The issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument translated into the currency in which the synthetic debt instrument is denominated at the spot rate on the identification date.
(D)
Stated redemption price at maturity.
In the case where the qualifying debt instrument is a borrowing, the stated redemption price at maturity shall be determined under section 1273(a)(2) on the identification date by reference to the amounts to be paid under the hedge to acquire the currency necessary to make interest and principal payments on the qualifying debt instrument. In the case where the qualifying debt instrument is a lending, the stated redemption price at maturity shall be determined under section 1273(a)(2) on the identification date by reference to the amounts to be received under the hedge in exchange for the interest and principal payments received pursuant to the terms of the qualifying debt instrument.
(iii)
Source of interest income and allocation of expense.
Interest income from a synthetic debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section shall be sourced by reference to the source of income under sections 861 (a)(1) and 862(a)(1) of the qualifying debt instrument. The character for purposes of section 904 of interest income from a synthetic debt instrument shall be determined by reference to the character of the interest income from qualifying debt instrument. Interest
expense from a synthetic debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section shall be allocated and apportioned under §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-12T or the successor sections thereof or under § 1.882-5.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(9).

# Example 1.
(i) K is a U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On December 24, 1989, K agrees to close the following transaction on December 31, 1989. K will borrow from an unrelated party on December 31, 1989, 100 British pounds (£) for 3 years at a 10 percent rate of interest, payable annually, with no principal payment due until the final installment. K will also enter into a currency swap contract with an unrelated counterparty under the terms of which—
(a) K will swap, on December 31, 1989, the £100 obtained from the borrowing for $100; and
(b) K will exchange dollars for pounds pursuant to the following table in order to obtain the pounds necessary to make payments on the pound borrowing:
Date
U.S. dollars
Pounds
December 31, 1990
8
10
December 31, 1991
8
10
December 31, 1992
108
110
(ii) The interest rate on the borrowing is set and the exchange rates on the swap are fixed on December 24, 1989. On December 31, 1989, K borrows the £100 and swaps such pounds for $100. Assume x has satisfied the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
(iii) The pound borrowing (which constitutes a qualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and the currency swap contract (which constitutes a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) are a qualified hedging transaction as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the pound borrowing and the swap are integrated and treated as one transaction with the following consequences:
(A) The integration of the pound borrowing and the swap results in a synthetic dollar borrowing with an issue price of $100 under section 1273(b)(2).
(B) The total amount of interest and principal of the synthetic dollar borrowing is equal to the dollar payments made by K under the currency swap contract (i.e., $8 in 1990, $8 in 1991, and $108 in 1992).
(C) The stated redemption price at maturity (defined in section 1273(a)(2)) is $100. Because the stated redemption price equals the issue price, there is no OID on the synthetic dollar borrowing.
(D) K may deduct the annual interest payments of $8 under section 163(a) (subject to any limitations on deductibility imposed by other provisions of the Code) according to its regular method of accounting. K has also paid $100 as a return of principal in 1992.
(E) K must allocate and apportion its interest expense with respect to the synthetic dollar borrowing under the rules of §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-12T.

# Example 2.
(i) K, a U.S. corporation, has the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On December 24, 1989, when the spot rate for Swiss francs (Sf) is Sf1 = $1, K enters into a forward contract to purchase Sf100 in exchange for $100.04 for delivery on December 31, 1989. The Sf100 are to be used for the purchase of a franc denominated debt instrument on December 31, 1989. The instrument will have a term of 3 years, an issue price of Sf100, and will bear interest at 6 percent, payable annually, with no repayment of principal until the final installment. On December 24, 1989, K also enters into a series of forward contracts to sell the franc interest and principal payments that will be received under the terms of the franc denominated debt instrument for dollars according to the following schedule:
Date
U.S. dollars
Francs
December 31, 1990
6.12
6
December 31, 1991
6.23
6
December 31, 1992
112.16
106
(ii) On December 31, 1989, K takes delivery of the Sf100 and purchases the franc denominated debt instrument. Assume K satisfies the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this section. The purchase of the franc debt instrument (which constitutes a qualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and the series of forward contracts (which constitute a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) are a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the franc debt instrument and all the forward contracts are integrated and treated as one transaction with the following consequences:
(A) The integration of the franc debt instrument and the forward contracts results in a synthetic dollar debt instrument in an amount equal to the dollars exchanged under the forward contract to purchase the francs necessary to acquire the franc debt instrument. Accordingly, the issue price is $100.04 (section 1273(b)(2) of the Code).
(B) The total amount of interest and principal received by K with respect to the synthetic dollar debt instrument is equal to the dollars received under the forward sales contracts (i.e., $6.12 in 1990, $6.23 in 1991, and $112.16 in 1992).
(C) The synthetic dollar debt instrument is an installment obligation and its stated redemption price at maturity is $106.15 (i.e.,
$6.12 of the payments in 1990, 1991, and 1992 are treated as periodic interest payments under the principles of section 1273). Because the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds the issue price, under section 1273(a)(1) the synthetic dollar debt instrument has OID of $6.11.
(D) The yield to maturity of the synthetic dollar debt instrument is 8.00 percent, compounded annually. Assuming K is a calendar year taxpayer, it must include interest income of $8.00 in 1990 (of which $1.88 constitutes OID), $8.15 in 1991 (of which $2.03 constitutes OID), and $8.32 in 1992 (of which $2.20 constitutes OID). The amount of the final payment received by K in excess of the interest income includible is a return of principal and a payment of previously accrued OID.
(E) The source of the interest income shall be determined by applying sections 861(a)(1) and 862(a)(1) with reference to the franc interest income that would have been received had the transaction not been integrated.

# Example 3.
(i) K is an accrual method U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1992, K borrows 100 British pounds (£) for 3 years at a 10% rate of interest payable on December 31 of each year with no principal payment due until the final installment. The spot rate on January 1, 1992, is £1 = $1.50. On January 1, 1993, when the spot rate is £1 = $1.60, K enters into a currency swap contract with an unrelated counterparty under the terms of which K will exchange dollars for pounds pursuant to the following table in order to obtain the pounds necessary to make the remaining payments on the pound borrowing:
Date
U.S. dollars
Pounds
December 31, 1993
12.80
10
December 31, 1994
12.80
10
December 31, 1994
160.00
100
(ii) Assume that British pound interest rates are still 10% and that K properly identifies the pound borrowing and the currency swap contract as a qualified hedging transaction as provided in paragraph (a)(8) of this section. Under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, K must realize exchange gain or loss with respect to the pound borrowing determined solely by reference to changes in exchange rates between January 1, 1992 and January 1, 1993. (Thus, gain or loss from other factors such as movements in interest rates or changes in credit quality of K are not taken into account). Recognition of such gain or loss is deferred until K terminates its pound borrowing. Accordingly, K must defer exchange loss in the amount of $10 [(£100 × 1.50)−(£100 × 1.60)].
(iii) Additionally, the qualified hedging transaction is treated as a synthetic U.S. dollar debt instrument with an issue date of January 1, 1993, and a maturity date of December 31, 1994. The issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is $160 (£100 × 1.60, the spot rate on January 1, 1993) and the total amount of interest and principal is $185.60. The accrual period is the one year period beginning on January 1 and ending December 31 of each year. The stated redemption price at maturity is $160. Thus, K is treated as paying $12.80 of interest in 1993, $12.80 of interest in 1994, and $160 of principal in 1994. The interest expense from the synthetic instrument is allocated and apportioned in accordance with the rules of §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-12T. Sections 263(g), 1092, and 1256 do not apply to the positions comprising the synthetic dollar borrowing.

# Example 4.
(i) K is an accrual method U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 2013, K borrows 100 British pounds (£) for 3 years at a 10% rate of interest payable on December 31 of each year with no principal payment due until the final installment. The spot rate on January 1, 2013, is £1 = $1.50. Also on January 1, 2013, K enters into a currency swap contract with an unrelated counterparty under the terms of which K will exchange dollars for pounds pursuant to the following table in order to obtain the pounds necessary to make the remaining payments on the pound borrowing:
Date
U.S. dollars

(ii) Assume that K properly identifies the pound borrowing and the currency swap contract as a qualified hedging transaction as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iii) The pound borrowing (which constitutes a qualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and the currency swap contract (which constitutes a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) are a qualified hedging transaction as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the pound borrowing and the swap are integrated and treated as one transaction with the following consequences:
(A) The integration of the pound borrowing and the swap results in a synthetic dollar borrowing with an issue price of $150 under section 1273(b)(2).
(B) The total amount of interest and principal of the synthetic dollar borrowing is equal to the dollar payments made by K under the currency swap contract (i.e., $12 in 2013, $12 in 2014, and $162 in 2015).
(C) The stated redemption price at maturity (defined in section 1273(a)(2)) is $150. Because the stated redemption price equals the issue price, there is no OID on the synthetic dollar borrowing.
(D) K may deduct the annual interest payments of $12 under section 163(a) (subject to
any limitations on deductibility imposed by other provisions of the Code) according to its regular method of accounting. K has also paid $150 as a return of principal in 2015.
(E) K must allocate and apportion its interest expense from the synthetic instrument under the rules of §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-12T.
(iv) Assume that on January 1, 2014, the spot exchange rate is £1 = $1.60, interest rates have not changed since January 1, 2013, (accordingly, assume that the market value of K's bond in pounds has not changed) and that K transfers its rights and obligations under the currency swap contract in exchange for $10. Under § 1.988-2(e)(3)(iii), K will include in income as exchange gain $10 on January 1, 2014. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, the pound borrowing and the currency swap contract are treated as a qualified hedging transaction for 2013. The loss inherent in the pound borrowing from January 1, 2013, to January 1, 2014, is realized and recognized on January 1, 2014. Such loss is exchange loss in the amount of $10.00 [(£100 × $1.50, the spot rate on January 1, 2013)−(£100 × $1.60, the spot rate on January 1, 2014)]. For purposes of determining exchange gain or loss on the £100 principal amount of the debt instrument for the period January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015, the spot rate on January 1, 2014 is used rather than the spot rate on the issue date. Thus, assuming that the spot rate on December 31, 2015, the maturity date, is £1 = $1.80, K realizes exchange loss in the amount of $20 [(£100 × $1.60)−(£100 × $1.80)]. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(iii) (regarding identification by the Commissioner), the pound borrowing cannot be part of a qualified hedging transaction for any period subsequent to the leg out date.

# Example 5.
(i) K, a U.S. corporation, has the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 2013, when the spot rate for Swiss francs (Sf) is Sf1 = $.50, K converts $100 to Sf200 and purchases a franc denominated debt instrument. The instrument has a term of 3 years, an adjusted issue price of Sf200, and will bear interest at 5 percent, payable annually, with no repayment of principal until the final installment. The U.S. dollar interest rate on an equivalent instrument is 8% on January 1, 2013, compounded annually. On January 1, 2013, K also enters into a series of forward contracts to sell the franc interest and principal payments that will be received under the terms of the franc denominated debt instrument for dollars according to the following schedule:
Date
U.S. dollars
Francs

(ii) Assume K satisfies the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this section. Assume further that on January 1, 2014, the spot exchange rate is Sf1 = U.S.$.5143, the U.S. dollar interest rate is 10%, compounded annually, and the Swiss franc interest rate is the same as on January 1, 2013 (5%, compounded annually). On January 1, 2014, K disposes of the forward contracts that were to mature on December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2015 and incurs a loss of $3.62 (the present value of $.10 with respect to the 2014 contract and $4.27 with respect to the 2015 contract).
(iii) The purchase of the franc debt instrument (which constitutes a qualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and the series of forward contracts (which constitute a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) are a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the franc debt instrument and all the forward contracts are integrated for the period beginning January 1, 2013, and ending January 1, 2014.
(A) The integration of the franc debt instrument and the forward contracts results in a synthetic dollar debt instrument with an issue price of $100.
(B) The total amount of interest and principal to be received by K with respect to the synthetic dollar debt instrument is equal to the dollars to be received under the forward sales contracts (i.e., $5.14 in 2013, $5.29 in 2014, and $114.26 in 2015).
(C) The synthetic dollar debt instrument is an installment obligation and its stated redemption price at maturity is $109.27 (i.e., $5.14 of the payments in 2013, 2014, and 2015 is treated as periodic interest payments under the principles of section 1273). Because the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds the issue price, under section 1273(a)(1) the synthetic dollar debt instrument has OID of $9.27.
(D) The yield to maturity of the synthetic dollar debt instrument is 8.00 percent, compounded annually. Assuming K is a calendar year taxpayer, it must include interest income of $8.00 in 2013 (of which $2.86 constitutes OID).
(E) The source of the interest income is determined by applying sections 861(a)(1) and 862(a)(1) with reference to the franc interest income that would have been received had the transaction not been integrated.
(iv) Because K disposed of the forward contracts on January 1, 2014, the rules of paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section shall apply. Accordingly, the $3.62 loss from the disposition of the forward contracts is realized and recognized on January 1, 2014. Additionally, K is deemed to have sold the franc debt instrument for $102.86, its fair market value in dollars on January 1, 2014. K will compute gain or loss with respect to the deemed sale of the franc debt instrument by subtracting its adjusted basis in the instrument ($102.86—the value of the Sf200 issue price at the spot rate on the identification date plus $2.86 of
original issue discount accrued on the synthetic dollar debt instrument for 2013) from the amount realized on the deemed sale of $102.86. Thus K realizes and recognizes no gain or loss from the deemed sale of the debt instrument. The dollar amount used to determine exchange gain or loss with respect to the franc debt instrument is the Sf200 issue price on January 1, 2014, translated into dollars at the spot rate on January 1, 2014, of Sf1 = U.S.$.5143. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this section (regarding identification by the Commissioner), the franc borrowing cannot be part of a qualified hedging transaction for any period subsequent to the leg out date.

# Example 6.
(i) K is a U.S. corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1992, K issues a debt instrument with the following terms: the issue price is $1,000, the instrument pays interest annually at a rate of 8% on the $1,000 principal amount, the instrument matures on December 31, 1996, and the amount paid at maturity is the greater of zero or $2,000 less the U.S. dollar value (determined on December 31, 1996) of 150,000 Japanese yen.
(ii) Also on January 1, 1992, K enters into the following hedges with respect to the instrument described in the preceding paragraph: a forward contract under which K will sell 150,000 yen for $1,000 on December 31, 1996 (note that this forward rate assumes that interest rates in yen and dollars are equal); and an option contract that expires on December 31, 1996, under which K has the right (but not the obligation) to acquire 150,000 yen for $2,000. K will pay for the option by making payments to the writer of the option equal to $5 each December 31 from 1992 through 1996.
(iii) The net economic effect of these transactions is that K has created a liability with a principal amount and amount paid at maturity of $1,000, with an interest cost of 8.5% (8% on debt instrument, 0.5% option price) compounded annually. For example, if on December 31, 1996, the spot exchange rate is $1 = 100 yen, K pays $500 on the bond [$2,000−(150,000 yen/$100)], and $500 in satisfaction of the forward contract [$1,000−(150,000 yen/$100)]. If instead the spot exchange rate on December 31, 1996 is $1 = 200 yen, K pays $1,250 on the bond [$2,000−(150,000 yen/$200)] and K receives $250 in satisfaction of the forward contract [$1,000−(150,000 yen/$200)]. Finally, if the spot exchange rate on December 31, 1996 is $1 = 50 yen, K pays $0 on the bond [$2,000−(150,000 yen/$50), but the bond holder is not required under the terms of the instrument to pay additional principal]; K exercises the option to buy 150,000 yen for $2,000; and K then delivers the 150,000 yen as required by the forward contract in exchange for $1,000.
(iv) Assume K satisfies the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this section. The debt instrument described in paragraph (i) of this
Example 6
(which constitutes a qualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and the forward contract and option contract described in paragraph (ii) of this example (which constitute a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this section and are collectively referred to hereafter as “the contracts”) together are a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, with respect to K, the debt instrument and the contracts are integrated, resulting in a synthetic dollar debt instrument with an issue price of $1000, a stated redemption price at maturity of $1000 and a yield to maturity of 8.5% compounded annually (with no original issue discount). K must allocate and apportion its annual interest expense of $85 under the rules of §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-12T.

# Example 7.
(i) R is a U.S. corporation with the dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1995, R issues a debt instrument with the following terms: the issue price is 504 British pounds (£), the instrument pays interest at a rate of 3.7% (compounded semi-annually) on the £504 principal amount, the instrument matures on December 31, 1999, with a repayment at maturity of the £504 principal plus the proportional gain, if any, in the “Financial Times” 100 Stock Exchange (FTSE) index (determined by the excess of the value of the FTSE index on the maturity date over the value of the FTSE on the issue date, divided by the value of the FTSE index on the issue date, multiplied by the number of FTSE index contracts that could be purchased on the issue date for £504).
(ii) Also on January 1, 1995, R enters into a contract with a bank under which on January 1, 1995, R will swap the £504 for $1,000 (at the current spot rate). R will make U.S. dollar payments to the bank equal to 8.15% on the notional principal amount of $1,000 (compounded semi-annually) for the period beginning January 1, 1995 and ending December 31, 1999. R will receive pound payments from the bank equal to 3.7% on the notional principal amount of £504 (compounded semi-annually) for the period beginning January 1, 1995 and ending December 31, 1999. On December 31, 1999, R will swap with the bank $1,000 for £504 plus the proportional gain, if any, in the FTSE index (computed as provided above).
(iii) Economically, both the indexed debt instrument and the hedging contract are hybrid instruments with the following components. The indexed debt instrument is composed of a par pound debt instrument that is assumed to have a 10.85% coupon (compounded semi-annually) plus an embedded FTSE equity index option for which the investor pays a premium of 7.15% (amortized semi-annually) on the pound principal
amount. The combined effect is that the premium paid by the investor partially offsets the coupon payments resulting in a return of 3.7% (10.85%−7.15%). Similarly, the dollar payments under the hedging contract to be made by R are computed by multiplying the dollar notional principal amount by an 8.00% rate (compounded semi-annually) which the facts assume would be the rate paid on a conventional currency swap plus a premium of 0.15% (amortized semi-annually) on the dollar notional principal amount for an embedded FTSE equity index option.
(iv) Assume R satisfies the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this section. The indexed debt instrument described in paragraph (i) of this
Example 7
constitutes a qualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The hedging contract described in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 7
constitutes a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Since both the pound exposure of the indexed debt instrument and the exposure to movements of the FTSE embedded in the indexed debt instrument are hedged such that a yield to maturity can be determined in dollars, the transaction satisfies the requirement of paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. Assuming the transactions satisfy the other requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the indexed debt instrument and hedge are a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, with respect to R, the debt instrument and the contracts are integrated, resulting in a synthetic dollar debt instrument with an issue price of $1000, a stated redemption price at maturity of $1000 and a yield to maturity of 8.15% compounded semi-annually (with no original issue discount). K must allocate and apportion its interest expense from the synthetic instrument under the rules §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-12T.

# Example 8.
(i) K is a U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On December 24, 1992, K agrees to close the following transaction on December 31, 1992. K will borrow from an unrelated party on December 31, 1992, 200 British pounds (£) for 3 years at a 10 percent rate of interest, payable annually, with no principal payment due until the final installment. K will also enter into a currency swap contract with an unrelated counterparty under the terms of which—
(A) K will swap, on December 31, 1992, £100 obtained from the borrowing for $100; and
(B) K will exchange dollars for pounds pursuant to the following table:
Date
U.S. dollars
Pounds

8
10
December 31, 1994

10
December 31, 1995

(ii) The interest rate on the borrowing is set and the exchange rates on the swap are fixed on December 24, 1992. On December 31, 1992, K borrows the £200 and swaps £100 for $100. Assume K has satisfied the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
(iii) The £200 debt instrument satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. Because all principal and interest payments under the instrument are hedged in the same proportion (50% of all interest and principal payments are hedged), 50% of the payments under the £200 instrument (principal amount of £100 and annual interest of £10) are treated as a qualifying debt instrument for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, the distinct £100 borrowing and the currency swap contract (which constitutes a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) are a qualified hedging transaction as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, £100 of the pound borrowing and the swap are integrated and treated as one synthetic dollar transaction with the following consequences:
(A) The integration of £100 of the pound borrowing and the swap results in a synthetic dollar borrowing with an issue price of $100 under section 1273(b)(2).
(B) The total amount of interest and principal of the synthetic dollar borrowing is equal to the dollar payments made by K under the currency swap contract (i.e., $8 in 1993, $8 in 1994, and $108 in 1995).
(C) The stated redemption price at maturity (defined in section 1273(a)(2)) is $100. Because the stated redemption price equals the issue price, there is no OID on the synthetic dollar borrowing.
(D) K may deduct the annual interest payments of $8 under section 163(a) (subject to any limitations on deductibility imposed by other provisions of the Code) according to its regular method of accounting. K has also paid $100 as a return of principal in 1995.
(E) K must allocate and apportion its interest expense from the synthetic instrument under the rules of §§ l.861-8T through 1.861-12T.
That portion of the £200 pound debt instrument that is not hedged (
i.e.
, £100) is treated as a separate debt instrument subject to the rules of § 1.988-2 (b) and §§ l.861-8T through 1.861-12T.

# Example 9.
(i) K is an accrual method U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1992, K borrows 100 British pounds (£) for 3 years at a 10% rate of interest payable on December 31 of each year with no principal payment due until the final installment. On the same day, K enters into a currency swap agreement with an unrelated bank under which K agrees to the following:
(A) On January 1, 1992, K will exchange the £100 borrowed for $150.
(B) For the period beginning January 1, 1992 and ending December 31, 1994, K will pay at the end of each month an amount determined by multiplying $150 by one month LIBOR less 65 basis points and receive from the bank on December 31st of 1992, 1993, and 1994, £10.
(C) On December 31, 1994, K will exchange $150 for £100.
Assume K satisfies the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
(ii) The pound borrowing (which constitutes a qualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and the currency swap contract (which constitutes a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) are a qualified hedging transaction as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the pound borrowing and the swap are integrated and treated as one transaction with the following consequences:
(A) The integration of the pound borrowing and the swap results in a synthetic dollar borrowing with an issue price of $150 under section 1273(b)(2).
(B) The total amount of interest and principal of the synthetic dollar borrowing is equal to the dollar payments made by K under the currency swap contract.
(C) The stated redemption price at maturity (defined in section 1273(a)(2)) is $150. Because the stated redemption price equals the issue price, there is no OID on the synthetic dollar borrowing.
(D) K may deduct the monthly variable interest payments under section 163(a) (subject to any limitations on deductibility imposed by other provisions of the Code) according to its regular method of accounting. K has also paid $150 as a return of principal in 1994.
(E) K must allocate and apportion its interest expense from the synthetic instrument under the rules of §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-12T.

# Example 10.
(i) K is an accrual method U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 1992, K loans 100 British pounds (£) for 3 years at a 10% rate of interest payable on December 31 of each year with no principal payment due until the final installment. The spot rate on January 1, 1992, is £1 = $1.50. Also on January 1, 1992, K enters into a currency swap contract with an unrelated counterparty under the terms of which K will exchange pounds for dollars pursuant to the following table:

(ii) Assume that K properly identifies the pound borrowing and the currency swap contract as a qualified hedging transaction as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iii) The pound loan (which constitutes a qualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and the currency swap contract (which constitutes a hedge under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) are a qualified hedging transaction as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the pound loan and the swap are integrated and treated as one transaction with the following consequences:
(A) The integration of the pound loan and the swap results in a synthetic dollar loan with an issue price of $150 under section 1273(b)(2).
(B) The total amount of interest and principal of the synthetic dollar loan is equal to the dollar payments received by K under the currency swap contract (i.e., $12 in 1992, $12 in 1993, and $162 in 1994).
(C) The stated redemption price at maturity (defined in section 1273(a)(2)) is $150. Because the stated redemption price equals the issue price, there is no OID on the synthetic dollar loan.
(D) K must include in income as interest $12 in 1992, 1993, and 1994.
(E) The source of the interest income shall be determined by applying sections 861(a)(1) and 862(a)(1) with reference to the pound interest income that would have been received had the transaction not been integrated.
(iv) On January 1, 1993, K transfers both the pound loan and the currency swap to B, its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, in exchange for B stock in a transfer that satisfies the requirements of section 351. Under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the transfer of both instruments is not “legging out.” Rather, K is considered to have transferred the synthetic dollar loan to B in a transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized. B's basis in the loan under section 362 is $100.

# Example 11.
(i) K is a domestic corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January 1, 2013, K borrows 100 British pounds (£) for two years at a 10% rate of interest payable on December 31 of each year with no principal payment due until maturity on December 31, 2014. Assume that the spot rate on January 1, 2013, is £1=$1. On the same date, K enters into two swap contracts with an unrelated counterparty that economically results in the transformation of the fixed rate £100 borrowing to a floating rate dollar borrowing. The terms of the swaps are as follows:
(A)
Swap #1, Currency swap.
On January 1, 2013, K will exchange £100 for $100.
(
1
) On December 31 of both 2013 and 2014, K will exchange $8 for £10;
(
2
) On December 31, 2014, K will exchange $100 for £100.
(B)
Swap #2, Interest rate swap.
On December 31 of both 2013 and 2014, K will pay LIBOR times a notional principal amount of $100 and will receive 8% times the same $100 notional principal amount.
(ii) Assume that K properly identifies the pound borrowing and the swap contracts as a qualified hedging transaction as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section and that the other relevant requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are satisfied.
(iii) On January 1, 2014, the spot exchange rate is £1=$2; the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate of interest is 9%; the market value of K's note in pounds has not changed; and K terminates swap #2. Because interest rates have increased from 8% to 9%, K will incur a loss of ($.92) (the present value of the ($1) difference between the 8% and 9% interest payments discounted at the current interest rate of 9%) with respect to the termination of such swap on January 1, 2014. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(C) of this section, K must treat swap #1 as having been sold for its fair market value on the leg-out date, which is the date swap #2 is terminated. K must realize and recognize gain of $100.92 (the present value of £110 discounted in pounds to equal £100 × $2 ($200) less the present value of $108 ($99.08)). The loss inherent in the pound borrowing from January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2014 is realized and recognized on January 1, 2014. Such loss is exchange loss in the amount of $100 (the present value of £110 that was to be paid at the end of the year discounted at pound interest rates to equal £100 times the change in exchange rates: (£100 × $1, the spot rate on January 1, 2013)−(£100 × $2, the spot rate on January 1, 2014)). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(E) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this section (regarding identification by the Commissioner), the pound borrowing and currency swap cannot be part of a qualified hedging transaction for any period after the leg-out date.
(iv) Assume the facts are the same as in paragraph (iii) of this
Example
except that on January 1, 2014, the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate of interest is 7% rather than 9%. When K terminates swap #2, K will realize gain of $0.93 (the present value of the ($1) difference between the 8% and 7% interest payments discounted at the current interest rate of 7%) received with respect to the termination on January 1, 2014. Fifty percent or more of the remaining pound cash flow of the pound borrowing remains hedged after the termination of swap #2. Accordingly, under paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(F) of this section, paragraphs (a)(6)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section do not apply, and the gain on swap #1 and the loss on the qualifying debt instrument are not taken into account. Thus, K will include in income $0.93 realized from the termination of swap #2.

(b)
Hedged executory contracts
—(1)
In general.
If the taxpayer enters into a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the executory contract and the hedge shall be integrated as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
Hedged executory contract.
A hedged executory contract is an executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section that is the subject of a hedge as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that the following requirements are satisfied—
(A) The executory contract and the hedge are identified as a hedged executory contract as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(B) The hedge is entered into (
i.e.,
settled or closed, or in the case of nonfunctional currency deposited in an account with a bank or other financial institution, such currency is acquired and deposited) on or after the date the executory contract is entered into and before the accrual date as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.
(C) The executory contract is hedged in whole or in part throughout the period beginning with the date the hedge is identified in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section and ending on or after the accrual date.
(D) None of the parties to the hedge are related. The term related means the relationships defined in section 267(b) and section 707(c)(1).
(E) In the case of a qualified business unit with a residence, as defined in section 988(a)(3)(B), outside of the United States, both the executory contract and the hedge are properly reflected on the books of the same qualified business unit.
(F) Subject to the limitations of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section, both the executory contract and the hedge are entered into by the same individual, partnership, trust, estate, or corporation. With respect to a corporation, the same corporation must enter into both the executory contract and the hedge whether or not such corporation is a member of an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated return.
(G) With respect to a foreign person engaged in a U.S. trade or business that enters into an executory contract or hedge through such trade or business, all items of income and expense associated with the executory contract and the hedge would have been effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business throughout the term of the hedged executory contract had this paragraph (b) not applied.
(ii)
Executory contract
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, an executory contract is an agreement entered into before the accrual date to pay nonfunctional currency (or an amount determined with reference thereto) in the future with respect to the purchase of property used in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business, or the acquisition of a service (or services), in the future, or to receive nonfunctional currency (or an amount determined with reference thereto) in the future with respect to the sale of property used or held for sale in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business, or the performance of a service (or services), in the future. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a contract to buy or sell stock shall be considered an executory contract. (Thus, for example, a contract to sell stock of an affiliate is an executory contract for this purpose.) On the accrual date, such agreement ceases to be considered an executory contract and is treated as an account payable or receivable.
(B)
Exceptions.
An executory contract does not include a section 988 transaction. For example, a forward contract to purchase nonfunctional currency is not an executory contract. An executory contract also does not include a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(C)
Effective date for contracts to buy or sell stock.
That part of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section which provides that a contract to buy or sell stock shall be considered an executory contract applies to contracts to buy or sell stock entered into on or after March 17, 1992.
(iii)
Hedge
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term hedge means a deposit of nonfunctional currency in a hedging account (as defined paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D) of this section), a forward or futures contract described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii), or combination thereof, which reduces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations by reference to the taxpayer's functional currency with respect to nonfunctional currency payments made or received under an executory contract. The term hedge also includes an option contract described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii), but only if the option's expiration date is on or before the accrual date. The premium paid for an option that lapses shall be integrated with the executory contract.
(B)
Special rule for series of hedges.
A series of hedges as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section shall be considered a hedge if the executory contract is hedged in whole or in part throughout the period beginning with the date the hedge is identified in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and ending on or after the accrual date. A taxpayer that enters into a series of hedges will be deemed to have satisfied the preceding sentence if the hedge that succeeds a
hedge that has been terminated is entered into no later than the business day following such termination.
(C)
Special rules for historical rate rollovers
—(
1
)
Definition.
A historical rate rollover is an extension of the maturity date of a forward contract where the new forward rate is adjusted on the rollover date to reflect the taxpayer's gain or loss on the contract as of the rollover date plus the time value of such gain or loss through the new maturity date.
(
2
)
Certain historical rate rollovers considered a hedge.
A historical rate rollover is considered a hedge if the rollover date is before the accrual date.
(
3
)
Treatment of time value component of certain historical rate rollovers that are hedges.
Interest income or expense determined under § 1.988-2(d)(2)(v) with respect to a historical rate rollover shall be considered part of a hedge if the period beginning on the first date a hedging contract is rolled over and ending on the date payment is made or received under the executory contract does not exceed 183 days. Such interest income or expense shall not be recognized and shall be an adjustment to the income from, or expense of, the services performed or received under the executory contract, or to the amount realized or basis of the property sold or purchased under the executory contract. For the treatment of such interest income or expense that is not considered part of a hedge, see § 1.988-2(d)(2)(v).
(D)
Special rules regarding deposits of nonfunctional currency in a hedging account.
A hedging account is an account with a bank or other financial institution used exclusively for deposits of nonfunctional currency used to hedge executory contracts. For purposes of determining the basis of units in such account that comprise the hedge, only those units in the account as of the accrual date shall be taken into consideration. A taxpayer may adopt any reasonable convention (consistently applied to all hedging accounts) to determine which units comprise the hedge as of the accrual date and the basis of the units as of such date.
(E)
Interest income on deposit of nonfunctional currency in a hedging account.
Interest income on a deposit of nonfunctional currency in a hedging account may be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of a hedge if such interest is accrued on or before the accrual date. However, such interest income shall be included in income as provided in section 61. For example, if a taxpayer with the dollar as its functional currency enters into an executory contract for the purchase and delivery of a machine in one year for 100 British pounds (£), and on such date deposits £90.91 in a properly identified bank account that bears interest at the rate of 10%, the interest that accrues prior to the accrual date shall be included in income and may be considered a hedge.
(iv)
Accrual date.
The accrual date is the date when the item of income or expense (including a capital expenditure) that relates to an executory contract is required to be accrued under the taxpayer's method of accounting.
(v)
Payment date.
The payment date is the date when payment is made or received with respect to an executory contract or the subsequent corresponding account payable or receivable.
(3)
Identification rules
—(i)
Identification by the taxpayer.
A taxpayer must establish a record and before the close of the date the hedge is entered into, the taxpayer must enter into the record a clear description of the executory contract and the hedge and indicate that the transaction is being identified in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Identification by the Commissioner.
If a taxpayer enters into an executory contract and a hedge but fails to satisfy one or more of the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and, based on the facts and circumstances, the Commissioner concludes that the executory contract in substance is hedged, then the Commissioner may apply the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section as if the taxpayer had satisfied all of the requirements therein, and may make appropriate adjustments. The Commissioner may apply the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section regardless of whether the executory contract and the hedge are held by the same taxpayer.
(4)
Effect of hedged executory contract
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer enters into a hedged executory contract, amounts paid or received under the hedge by the taxpayer are treated as paid or received by the taxpayer under the executory contract, or any subsequent account payable or receivable, or that portion to which the hedge relates. Also, the taxpayer recognizes no exchange gain or loss on the hedge. If an executory contract, on the accrual date, becomes an account payable or receivable, the taxpayer recognizes no exchange gain or loss on such payable or receivable for the period covered by the hedge.
(ii)
Partially hedged executory contracts.
The effect of integrating an executory contract and a hedge that partially hedges such contract is to treat the amounts paid or received under the hedge as paid or received under the portion of the executory contract being hedged, or any subsequent account payable or receivable. The income or expense of services performed or received under the executory contract, or the amount realized or basis of property sold or purchased under the executory contract, that is attributable to that portion of the executory contract that is not hedged shall be translated into functional currency on the accrual date. Exchange gain or loss shall be realized when payment is made or received with respect to any payable or receivable arising on the accrual date with respect to such unhedged amount.
(iii)
Disposition of a hedge or executory contract prior to the accrual date
—(A)
In general.
If a taxpayer identifies an executory contract as part of a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and disposes of (or otherwise terminates) the executory contract prior to the accrual date, the hedge shall be treated as sold for its fair market value on the date the executory contract is disposed of and any gain or loss shall be realized and recognized on such date. Such gain or loss shall be an adjustment to the amount received or expended with respect to the disposition or termination, if any. The spot rate on the date the hedge is treated as sold shall be used to determine subsequent exchange gain or loss on the hedge. If a taxpayer identifies a hedge as part of a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and disposes of the hedge prior to the accrual date, any gain or loss realized on such disposition shall not be recognized and shall be an adjustment to the income from, or expense of, the services performed or received under the executory contract, or to the amount realized or basis of the property sold or purchased under the executory contract.
(B)
Certain events in a series of hedges treated as a termination of the hedged executory contract.
If the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section are not satisfied, the hedged executory contract shall be terminated and the provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section shall apply to any gain or loss previously realized with respect to such hedge. Any subsequent hedging contracts entered into to reduce the risk of exchange rate movements with respect to such executory contract shall not be considered a hedge as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
(C)
Executory contracts between related persons.
If an executory contract is between related persons as defined in sections 267(b) and 707(b), and the taxpayer disposes of the hedge or terminates the executory contract prior to the accrual date, the Commissioner may redetermine the timing, source, and character of gain or loss from the hedge or the executory contract if he determines that a significant purpose for disposing of the hedge or terminating the executory contract prior to the accrual date was to affect the timing, source, or character of income, gain, expense, or loss for Federal income tax purposes.
(iv)
Disposition of a hedge on or after the accrual date.
If a taxpayer identifies a hedge as part of a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and disposes of the hedge on or after the accrual date, no gain or loss is recognized on the hedge and the booking date as defined in § 1.988-2(c)(2) of the payable or receivable for purposes of computing exchange gain or loss shall be the date such hedge is disposed of. See
Example 3
of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section.
(v)
Sections 263(g), 1092, and 1256 do not apply.
Sections 263(g), 1092, and 1256 do not apply with respect to an executory contract or hedge which comprise a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. However, sections 263(g), 1092 and 1256 may apply to the hedged executory contract if such transaction is part of a straddle.
(vi)
Examples.
The principles set forth in paragraph (b) of this section are illustrated in the following examples. The examples assume that K is an accrual method, calendar year U.S. corporation with the dollar as its functional currency.

# Example 1.
(i) On January 1, 1992, K enters into a contract with JPF, a Swiss machine manufacturer, to pay 500,000 Swiss francs for delivery of a machine on June 1, 1993. Also on January 1, 1992, K enters into a foreign currency forward agreement to purchase 500,000 Swiss francs for $250,000 for delivery on June 1, 1993. K properly identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. On June 1, 1993, K takes delivery of the 500,000 Swiss francs (in exchange for $250,000) under the forward contract and makes payment of 500,000 Swiss francs to JPF in exchange for the machine. Assume that the accrual date is June 1, 1993.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hedge is integrated with the executory contract. Therefore, K is deemed to have paid $250,000 for the machine and there is no exchange gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract. K's basis in the machine is $250,000. Section 1256 does not apply to the forward contract.

# Example 2.
(i) On January 1, 1992, K enters into a contract with S, a Swiss machine manufacturer, to pay 500,000 Swiss francs for delivery of a machine on June 1, 1993. Under the contract, K is not obligated to pay for the machine until September 1, 1993. On February 1, 1992, K enters into a foreign currency forward agreement to purchase 500,000 Swiss francs for $250,000 for delivery on September 1, 1993. K properly identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On June 1, 1993, K takes delivery of machine. Assume that under K's method of accounting the delivery date is the accrual date. On September 1, 1993, K takes delivery of the 500,000 Swiss francs (in exchange for $250,000) under the forward contract and makes payment of 500,000 Swiss francs to S.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hedge is integrated with the executory contract. Therefore K is deemed to have paid $250,000 for the machine and there is no exchange gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract. Thus K's basis in the machine is $250,000. In addition, no exchange gain or loss is recognized on the payable in existence from June 1, 1993, to September 1, 1993. Section 1256 does not apply to the forward contract.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that K disposed of the forward contract on August 1, 1993 for $10,000. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, K does not recognize the $10,000 gain. K's basis in the machine is $250,000 (the amount fixed by the forward contract), regardless of the amount in dollars that K actually pays to acquire the Sf500,000 when K pays for the machine. K has a payable with a booking date of August 1, 1993, payable on September 1, 1993 for 500,000 Swiss francs. Thus, K will realize exchange gain or loss on the difference between the amount booked on August 1, 1993 and the amount paid on September 1, 1993 under § 1.988-2(c).

# Example 4.
(i) On January 1, 1992, K enters into a contract with S, a Swiss machine repair firm, to pay 500,000 Swiss francs for repairs to be performed on June 1, 1992. Under the contract, K is not obligated to pay for the repairs until September 1, 1992. On February 1, 1992, K enters into a foreign currency forward agreement to purchase 500,000 Swiss francs for $250,000 for delivery on August 1, 1992. K properly identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On June 1, 1992, S performs the repair services. Assume that under K's method of accounting this date is the accrual date. On August 1, 1992, K takes delivery of the 500,000 Swiss francs (in exchange for $250,000) under the forward contract. On the same day, K deposits the Sf500,000 in a separate account with a bank and properly identifies the transaction as a continuation of the hedged executory contract. On September 1, 1992, K makes payment of the Sf500,000 in the account to S.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hedge is integrated with the executory contract. Therefore K is deemed to have paid $250,000 for the services and there is no exchange gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract or on the disposition of Sf500,000 in the account. Any interest on the Swiss francs in the account is included in income but is not considered part of the hedge (because the amount paid for the services must be set on or before the accrual date). In addition, no exchange gain or loss is recognized on the payable in existence from June 1, 1992, to September 1, 1992. Section 1256 does not apply to the forward contract.

# Example 5.
(i) On January 1, 1992, K enters into a contract with S, a Swiss machine manufacturer, to pay 500,000 Swiss francs for delivery of a machine on June 1, 1993. Under the contract, K is not obligated to pay for
the machine until September 1, 1993. On February 1, 1992, K enters into a foreign currency forward agreement to purchase 250,000 Swiss francs for $125,000 for delivery on September 1, 1993. K properly identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On June 1, 1993, K takes delivery of the machine. Assume that under K's method of accounting the delivery date is the accrual date. Assume further that the exchange rate is Sf1 = $.50 on June 1, 1993. On August 30, 1993, K purchases Sf250,000 for $135,000. On September 1, 1993, K takes delivery of the 250,000 Swiss francs (in exchange for $125,000) under the forward contract and makes payment of 500,000 Swiss francs (the Sf250,000 received under the contract plus the Sf250,000 purchased on August 30, 1993) to S. Assume the spot rate on September 1, 1993, is 1 Sf = $.5420 (Sf250,000 equal $135,500).
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the partial hedge is integrated with the executory contract. K is deemed to have paid $250,000 for the machine [$125,000 on the hedged portion of the Sf500,000 and $125,000 ($.50, the spot rate on June 1, 1993, times Sf250,000) on the unhedged portion of the Sf500,000]. K's basis in the machine therefore is $250,000. K recognizes no exchange gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract but K will realize exchange gain of $500 on the disposition of the Sf250,000 purchased on August 30, 1993 under § 1.988-2(a). In addition, exchange loss is realized on the unhedged portion of the payable in existence from June 1, 1993, to September 1, 1993. Thus, K will realize exchange loss of $10,500 ($125,000 booked less $135,500 paid) under § 1.988-2(c) on the payable. Section 1256 does not apply to the forward contract.

# Example 6.
(i) On January 1, 1990, K enters into a contract with S, a Swiss steel manufacturer, to buy steel for 1,000,000 Swiss francs (Sf) for delivery and payment on December 31, 1990. On January 1, 1990, the spot rate is Sf1 = $.50, the U.S. dollar interest rate is 10% compounded annually, and the Swiss franc rate is 5% compounded annually. Under K's method of accounting, the delivery date is the accrual date.
(ii) Assume that on January 1, 1990, K enters into a foreign currency forward contract to buy Sf1,000,000 for $523,800 for delivery on December 31, 1990. K properly identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the forward contract constitutes a hedge. Assuming that the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section are satisfied, the executory contract to buy steel and the forward contract are integrated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Thus, K is deemed to have paid $523,800 for the steel and will have a basis in the steel of $523,800. No gain or loss is realized with respect to the forward contract and section 1256 does not apply to such contract.
(iii) Assume instead that on January 1, 1990, K enters into a foreign currency forward contract to buy Sf1,000,000 for $512,200 for delivery on July 1, 1990. K properly identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On July 1, 1990, when the spot rate is Sf1 = $.53, K cancels the forward contract in exchange for $17,800 ($530,000−$512,200). On July 1, 1990, K enters into a second forward agreement to buy Sf1,000,000 for $542,900 for delivery on December 31, 1990. K properly identifies the second forward agreement as a hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the forward contract entered into on January 1, 1990, and the forward contract entered into on July 1, 1990, constitute a hedge. Assuming that the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section are satisfied, the executory contract to buy steel and the forward agreements are integrated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Thus, K is deemed to have paid $525,100 for the steel (the forward price in the second forward agreement of $542,900 less the gain on the first forward agreement of $17,800) and will have a basis in the steel of $525,100. No gain is realized with respect to the forward contracts and section 1256 does not apply to such contracts.
(iv) Assume instead that on January 1, 1990, K enters into a foreign currency forward contract to buy Sf1,000,000 for $512,200 for delivery on July 1, 1990. K properly identifies the executory contract and the hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On July 1, 1990, when the spot rate is Sf1 = $.53, K enters into a historical rate rollover of its $17,800 gain ($530,000−$512,200) on the forward agreement. Thus, K enters into a second foreign currency forward agreement to buy Sf1,000,000 for $524,210 for delivery on December 31, 1990. (The forward price of $524,210 is the market forward price on July 1, 1990, for the purchase of Sf1,000,000 for delivery on December 31, 1990, of $542,900 less the $17,800 gain on January 1, 1990, contract and less the time value of such gain of $890.) K properly identifies the second forward agreement as a hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. On December 31, 1990, when the spot rate is Sf1 = $.54, K takes delivery of the Sf1,000,000 (in exchange for $524,210) and purchases the steel for Sf1,000,000. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the forward contract entered into on January 1, 1990, and the forward contract entered into on July 1, 1990, which incorporates the rollover of K's gain on the January 1, 1990, contract, constitute a hedge. Assuming that the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section are satisfied, the executory contract to buy steel and the forward agreements are integrated under
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Because the period from the rollover date to the date payment is made under the executory contract does not exceed 183 days, the $890 of interest income is considered part of the hedge and is not recognized. Thus, K is deemed to have paid $524,210 for the steel and will have a basis in the steel of $524,210. No gain is realized with respect to the forward contracts and section 1256 does not apply to such contracts.
(v) Assume instead that on January 1, 1990, K purchases Sf952,380.95 (the present value of Sf1,000,000 to be paid on December 31, 1990) for $476,190.48 and on the same day deposits the Swiss francs in a separate bank account that bears interest at a rate of 5%, compounded annually. K properly identifies the transaction as a hedged executory contract. Over the period beginning January 1, 1990, and ending December 31, 1990, K receives Sf47,619.05 in interest on the account that is included in income and that has a basis of $25,714.29. (Assume that under § 1.988-2(b)(1), K uses the spot rate of Sf1 = $.54 to translate the interest income). On December 31, 1990, K makes payment of the Sf1,000,000 principal and accrued interest in the account to S. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the principal in the bank account and the interest constitute a hedge. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hedge is integrated with the executory contract. Therefore K is deemed to have paid $501,904.77 (the basis of the principal deposited plus the basis of the interest) for the steel and there is no exchange gain or loss on the disposition of the Sf1,000,000. K's basis in the steel therefore is $501,904.77.

References to this paragraph (b).
If the rules of this paragraph (b) are referred to in another paragraph of this section (
e.g.,
paragraph (c) of this section), then the rules of this paragraph (b) shall be applied for purposes of such other paragraph by substituting terms appropriate for such other paragraph. For example, paragraph (c)(2) of this section refers to the identification rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Accordingly, for purposes of paragraph (c)(2), the rules of paragraph (b)(3) will be applied by substituting the term “stock or security” for “executory contract”.
(c)
Hedges of period between trade date and settlement date on purchase or sale of publicly traded stock or security.
If a taxpayer purchases or sells stocks or securities which are traded on an established securities market and—
(1) Hedges all or part of such purchase or sale for any part of the period beginning on the trade date and ending on the settlement date; and
(2) Identifies the hedge and the underlying stock or securities as an integrated transaction under the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
then any gain or loss on the hedge shall be an adjustment to the amount realized or the adjusted basis of the stock or securities sold or purchased (and shall not be taken into account as exchange gain or loss). The term hedge means a deposit of nonfunctional currency in a hedging account (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section), or a forward or futures contract described in § 1.988-1(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii), or combination thereof, which reduces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations for any portion of the period beginning on the trade date and ending on the settlement date. The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(D) through (G), and (b)(2)(iii)(D) and (E) of this section shall apply. Sections 263(g), 1092, and 1256 do not apply with respect to stock or securities and a hedge which are subject to this paragraph (c).
(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Advance rulings regarding net hedging and anticipatory hedging systems.
In his sole discretion, the Commissioner may issue an advance ruling addressing the income tax consequences of a taxpayer's system of hedging either its net nonfunctional currency exposure or anticipated nonfunctional currency exposure. The ruling may address the character, source, and timing of both the section 988 transaction(s) making up the hedge and the underlying transactions being hedged. The procedures for obtaining a ruling shall be governed by such pertinent revenue procedures and revenue rulings as the Commissioner may provide. The Commissioner will not issue a ruling regarding hedges of a taxpayer's investment in a foreign subsidiary.
(f) [Reserved]
(g)
General effective date.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rules of this section shall apply to qualified hedging transactions, hedged executory contracts and transactions described in paragraph (c) of this section entered into on or after September 21, 1989. This section shall apply even if
the transaction being hedged (
e.g.,
the debt instrument) was entered into or acquired prior to such date. The effective date regarding advance rulings for net and anticipatory hedging shall be governed by such revenue procedures that the Commissioner may publish.

§ 1.988-6
Nonfunctional currency contingent payment debt instruments.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
This section determines the accrual of interest and the amount, timing, source, and character of any gain or loss on nonfunctional currency contingent payment debt instruments described in this paragraph (a)(1) and to which § 1.1275-4(a) would otherwise apply if the debt instrument were denominated in the taxpayer's functional currency. Except as provided by the rules in this section, the rules in § 1.1275-4 (relating to contingent payment debt instruments) apply to the following instruments—
(i) A debt instrument described in § 1.1275-4(b)(1) for which all payments of principal and interest are denominated in, or determined by reference to, a single nonfunctional currency and which has one or more non-currency related contingencies;
(ii) A debt instrument described in § 1.1275-4(b)(1) for which payments of principal or interest are denominated in, or determined by reference to, more than one currency and which has no non-currency related contingencies;
(iii) A debt instrument described in § 1.1275-4(b)(1) for which payments of principal or interest are denominated in, or determined by reference to, more than one currency and which has one or more non-currency related contingencies; and
(iv) A debt instrument otherwise described in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section, except that the debt instrument is described in § 1.1275-4(c)(1) rather than § 1.1275-4(b)(1) (
e.g.
, the instrument is issued for non-publicly traded property).
(2)
Exception for hyperinflationary currencies
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, this section shall not apply to an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if any payment made under such instrument is determined by reference to a hyperinflationary currency, as defined in § 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D). In such case, the amount, timing, source and character of interest, principal, foreign currency gain or loss, and gain or loss relating to a non-currency contingency shall be determined under the method that reflects the instrument's economic substance.
(ii)
Discretion as to method.
If a taxpayer does not account for an instrument described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section in a manner that reflects the instrument's economic substance, the Commissioner may apply the rules of this section to such an instrument or apply the principles of § 1.988-2(b)(15), reasonably taking into account the contingent feature or features of the instrument.
(b)
Instruments described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section
—(1)
In general.
Paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides rules for applying the noncontingent bond method (as set forth in § 1.1275-4(b)) in the nonfunctional currency in which a debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is denominated, or by reference to which its payments are determined (the denomination currency). Paragraph (b)(3) of this section describes how amounts determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be translated from the denomination currency of the instrument into the taxpayer's functional currency. Paragraph (b)(4) of this section describes how gain or loss (other than foreign currency gain or loss) shall be determined and characterized with respect to the instrument. Paragraph (b)(5) of this section describes how foreign currency gain or loss shall be determined with respect to accrued interest and principal on the instrument. Paragraph (b)(6) of this section provides rules for determining the source and character of any gain or loss with respect to the instrument. Paragraph (b)(7) of this section provides rules for subsequent holders of an instrument who purchase the instrument for an amount other than the adjusted issue price of the instrument. Paragraph (c) of this section provides
examples of the application of paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for the determination of the denomination currency of an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section. See paragraph (e) of this section for the treatment of an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.
(2)
Application of noncontingent bond method
—(i)
Accrued interest.
Interest accruals on an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section are initially determined in the denomination currency of the instrument by applying the noncontingent bond method, set forth in § 1.1275-4(b), to the instrument in its denomination currency. Accordingly, the comparable yield, projected payment schedule, and comparable fixed rate debt instrument, described in § 1.1275-4(b)(4), are determined in the denomination currency. For purposes of applying the noncontingent bond method to instruments described in this paragraph, the applicable Federal rate described in § 1.1275-4(b)(4)(i) shall be the rate described in § 1.1274-4(d) with respect to the denomination currency.
(ii)
Net positive and negative adjustments.
Positive and negative adjustments, and net positive and net negative adjustments, with respect to an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section are determined by applying the rules of § 1.1275-4(b)(6) (and § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(i) and (ii), if applicable) in the denomination currency. Accordingly, a net positive adjustment is treated as additional interest (in the denomination currency) on the instrument. A net negative adjustment first reduces interest that otherwise would be accrued by the taxpayer during the current tax year in the denomination currency. If a net negative adjustment exceeds the interest that would otherwise be accrued by the taxpayer during the current tax year in the denomination currency, the excess is treated as ordinary loss (if the taxpayer is a holder of the instrument) or ordinary income (if the taxpayer is the issuer of the instrument). The amount treated as ordinary loss by a holder with respect to a net negative adjustment is limited, however, to the amount by which the holder's total interest inclusions on the debt instrument (determined in the denomination currency) exceed the total amount of the holder's net negative adjustments treated as ordinary loss on the debt instrument in prior taxable years (determined in the denomination currency). Similarly, the amount treated as ordinary income by an issuer with respect to a net negative adjustment is limited to the amount by which the issuer's total interest deductions on the debt instrument (determined in the denomination currency) exceed the total amount of the issuer's net negative adjustments treated as ordinary income on the debt instrument in prior taxable years (determined in the denomination currency). To the extent a net negative adjustment exceeds the current year's interest accrual and the amount treated as ordinary loss to a holder (or ordinary income to the issuer), the excess is treated as a negative adjustment carryforward, within the meaning of § 1.1275-4(b)(6)(iii)(C), in the denomination currency.
(iii)
Adjusted issue price.
The adjusted issue price of an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is determined by applying the rules of § 1.1275-4(b)(7) in the denomination currency. Accordingly, the adjusted issue price is equal to the debt instrument's issue price in the denomination currency, increased by the interest previously accrued on the debt instrument (determined without regard to any net positive or net negative adjustments on the instrument) and decreased by the amount of any noncontingent payment and the projected amount of any contingent payment previously made on the instrument. All adjustments to the adjusted issue price are calculated in the denomination currency.
(iv)
Adjusted basis.
The adjusted basis of an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is determined by applying the rules of § 1.1275-4(b)(7) in the taxpayer's functional currency. In accordance with those rules, a holder's basis in the debt instrument is increased by the interest previously accrued on the debt instrument (translated into functional currency), without regard to any net positive or net negative adjustments on the instrument (except as provided in paragraph
(b)(7) or (8) of this section, if applicable), and decreased by the amount of any noncontingent payment and the projected amount of any contingent payment previously made on the instrument to the holder (translated into functional currency). See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section for translation rules.
(v)
Amount realized.
The amount realized by a holder and the repurchase price paid by the issuer on the scheduled or unscheduled retirement of a debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section are determined by applying the rules of § 1.1275-4(b)(7) in the denomination currency. For example, with regard to a scheduled retirement at maturity, the holder is treated as receiving the projected amount of any contingent payment due at maturity, reduced by the amount of any negative adjustment carryforward. For purposes of translating the amount realized by the holder into functional currency, the rules of paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section shall apply.
(3)
Treatment and translation of amounts determined under noncontingent bond method
—(i)
Accrued interest.
The amount of accrued interest, determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, is translated into the taxpayer's functional currency at the average exchange rate, as described in § 1.988-2(b)(2)(iii)(A), or, at the taxpayer's election, at the appropriate spot rate, as described in § 1.988-2(b)(2)(iii)(B).
(ii)
Net positive and negative adjustments
—(A)
Net positive adjustments.
A net positive adjustment, as referenced in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, is translated into the taxpayer's functional currency at the spot rate on the last day of the taxable year in which the adjustment is taken into account under § 1.1275-4(b)(6), or, if earlier, the date the instrument is disposed of or otherwise terminated.
(B)
Net negative adjustments.
A net negative adjustment is treated and, where necessary, is translated from the denomination currency into the taxpayer's functional currency under the following rules:
(
1
) The amount of a net negative adjustment determined in the denomination currency that reduces the current year's interest in that currency shall first reduce the current year's accrued but unpaid interest, and then shall reduce the current year's interest which was accrued and paid. No translation is required.
(
2
) The amount of a net negative adjustment treated as ordinary income or loss under § 1.1275-4(b)(6)(iii)(B) first is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest accrued in prior taxable years. For this purpose, the net negative adjustment shall be treated as attributable to any unpaid interest accrued in the immediately preceding taxable year, and thereafter to unpaid interest accrued in each preceding taxable year. The amount of the net negative adjustment applied to accrued but unpaid interest is translated into functional currency at the same rate used, in each of the respective prior taxable years, to translate the accrued interest.
(
3
) Any amount of the net negative adjustment remaining after the application of paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section is attributable to interest accrued and paid in prior taxable years. The amount of the net negative adjustment applied to such amounts is translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the debt instrument was issued or, if later, acquired.
(
4
) Any amount of the net negative adjustment remaining after application of paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
), (
2
) and (
3
) of this section is a negative adjustment carryforward, within the meaning of § 1.1275-4(b)(6)(iii)(C). A negative adjustment carryforward is carried forward in the denomination currency and is applied to reduce interest accruals in subsequent years. In the year in which the instrument is sold, exchanged or retired, any negative adjustment carryforward not applied to interest reduces the holder's amount realized on the instrument (in the denomination currency). An issuer of a debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section who takes into income a negative adjustment carryforward (that is not applied to interest) in the year the instrument is retired, as described in § 1.1275-4(b)(6)(iii)(C), translates such income into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the instrument was issued.
(iii)
Adjusted basis
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and paragraph (b)(7) or (8) of this section, a holder determines and maintains adjusted basis by translating the denomination currency amounts determined under § 1.1275-4(b)(7)(iii) into functional currency as follows:
(
1
) The holder's initial basis in the instrument is determined by translating the amount paid by the holder to acquire the instrument (in the denomination currency) into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the instrument was issued or, if later, acquired.
(
2
) An increase in basis attributable to interest accrued on the instrument is translated at the rate applicable to such interest under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(
3
) Any noncontingent payment and the projected amount of any contingent payments determined in the denomination currency that decrease the holder's basis in the instrument under § 1.1275-4(b)(7)(iii) are translated as follows:
(
i
) The payment first is attributable to the most recently accrued interest to which prior amounts have not already been attributed. The payment is translated into functional currency at the rate at which the interest was accrued.

(B)
Exception for interest reduced by a negative adjustment carryforward.
Solely for purposes of this § 1.988-6, any amounts of accrued interest income that are reduced as a result of a negative adjustment carryforward shall be treated as principal and translated at the spot rate on the date the instrument was issued or, if later, acquired.

Amount realized
—(A)
Instrument held to maturity
—(

)
In general.
With respect to an instrument held to maturity, a holder translates the amount realized by separating such amount in the denomination currency into the component parts of interest and principal that make up adjusted basis prior to translation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, and translating each of those component parts of the amount realized at the same rate used to translate the respective component parts of basis under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. The amount realized first shall be translated by reference to the component parts of basis consisting of accrued interest during the taxpayer's holding period as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and ordering such amounts on a last in first out basis. Any remaining portion of the amount realized shall be translated by reference to the rate used to translate the component of basis consisting of principal as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.

Subsequent purchases at discount and fixed but deferred contingent payments.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, any amount which is required to be added to adjusted basis under paragraph (b)(7) or (8) of this section shall be treated as additional interest which was accrued on the date the amount was added to adjusted basis. To the extent included in amount realized, such amounts shall be translated into functional currency at the same rates at which they were translated for purposes of determining adjusted basis. See paragraphs (b)(7)(iv) and (b)(8) of this section for rules governing the rates at which the amounts are translated for purposes of determining adjusted basis.
(B)
Sale, exchange, or unscheduled retirement
—(

)
Holder.
In the case of a sale, exchange, or unscheduled retirement, application of the rule stated in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(A) of this section shall be as follows. The holder's amount realized first shall be translated by reference to the principal component of basis as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, and then to the component of basis consisting of accrued interest as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and ordering such amounts on a first in first out basis. Any gain recognized by the holder (
i.e.
, any excess of the sale price over the holder's basis, both expressed in the denomination currency) is translated
into functional currency at the spot rate on the payment date.
(
2
)
Issuer.
In the case of an unscheduled retirement of the debt instrument, any excess of the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument over the amount paid by the issuer (expressed in denomination currency) shall first be attributable to accrued unpaid interest, to the extent the accrued unpaid interest had not been previously offset by a negative adjustment, on a last-in-first-out basis, and then to principal. The accrued unpaid interest shall be translated into functional currency at the rate at which the interest was accrued. The principal shall be translated at the spot rate on the date the debt instrument was issued.
(C)
Effect of negative adjustment carryforward with respect to the issuer.
Any amount of negative adjustment carryforward treated as ordinary income under § 1.1275-4(b)(6)(iii)(C) shall be translated at the exchange rate on the day the debt instrument was issued.
(4)
Determination of gain or loss not attributable to foreign currency.
A holder of a debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall recognize gain or loss upon sale, exchange, or retirement of the instrument equal to the difference between the amount realized with respect to the instrument, translated into functional currency as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, and the adjusted basis in the instrument, determined and maintained in functional currency as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. The amount of any gain or loss so determined is characterized as provided in § 1.1275-4(b)(8), and sourced as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(5)
Determination of foreign currency gain or loss
—(i)
In general.
Other than in a taxable disposition of the debt instrument, foreign currency gain or loss is recognized with respect to a debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section only when payments are made or received. No foreign currency gain or loss is recognized with respect to a net positive or negative adjustment, as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section (except with respect to a positive adjustment described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section). As described in this paragraph (b)(5), foreign currency gain or loss is determined in accordance with the rules of § 1.988-2(b).
(ii)
Foreign currency gain or loss attributable to accrued interest.
The amount of foreign currency gain or loss recognized with respect to payments of interest previously accrued on the instrument is determined by translating the amount of interest paid or received into functional currency at the spot rate on the date of payment and subtracting from such amount the amount determined by translating the interest paid or received into functional currency at the rate at which such interest was accrued under the rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of any payment that is treated as accrued interest shall be reduced by the amount of any net negative adjustment treated as ordinary loss (to the holder) or ordinary income (to the issuer), as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. For purposes of determining whether the payment consists of interest or principal, see the payment ordering rules in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section.
(iii)
Principal.
The amount of foreign currency gain or loss recognized with respect to payment or receipt of principal is determined by translating the amount paid or received into functional currency at the spot rate on the date of payment or receipt and subtracting from such amount the amount determined by translating the principal into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the instrument was issued or, in case of the holder, if later, acquired. For purposes of determining whether the payment consists of interest or principal, see the payment ordering rules in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section.
(iv)
Payment ordering rules
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section, payments with respect to an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall be treated as follows:
(
1
) A payment shall first be attributable to any net positive adjustment on the instrument that has not previously been taken into account.
(
2
) Any amount remaining after applying paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section shall be attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, remaining after reduction by any net negative adjustment, and shall be attributable to the most recent accrual period to the extent prior amounts have not already been attributed to such period.
(
3
) Any amount remaining after applying paragraphs (b)(5)(iv)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section shall be attributable to principal. Any interest paid in the current year that is reduced by a net negative adjustment shall be considered a payment of principal for purposes of determining foreign currency gain or loss.
(B)
Special rule for sale or exchange or unscheduled retirement.
Payments made or received upon a sale or exchange or unscheduled retirement shall first be applied against the principal of the debt instrument (or in the case of a subsequent purchaser, the purchase price of the instrument in denomination currency) and then against accrued unpaid interest (in the case of a holder, accrued while the holder held the instrument).
(C)
Subsequent purchaser that has a positive adjustment allocated to a daily portion of interest.
A positive adjustment that is allocated to a daily portion of interest pursuant to paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section shall be treated as interest for purposes of applying the payment ordering rule of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv).
(6)
Source of gain or loss.
The source of foreign currency gain or loss recognized with respect to an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall be determined pursuant to § 1.988-4. Consistent with the rules of § 1.1275-4(b)(8), all gain (other than foreign currency gain) on an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is treated as interest income for all purposes. The source of an ordinary loss (other than foreign currency loss) with respect to an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall be determined pursuant to § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(iv). The source of a capital loss with respect to an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall be determined pursuant to § 1.865-1(b)(2).
(7)
Basis different from adjusted issue price
—(i)
In general.
The rules of § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(i), except as set forth in this paragraph (b)(7), shall apply to an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section purchased by a subsequent holder for more or less than the instrument's adjusted issue price.
(ii)
Determination of basis.
If an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is purchased by a subsequent holder, the subsequent holder's initial basis in the instrument shall equal the amount paid by the holder to acquire the instrument, translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date of acquisition.
(iii)
Purchase price greater than adjusted issue price.
If the purchase price of the instrument (determined in the denomination currency) exceeds the adjusted issue price of the instrument, the holder shall, consistent with the rules of § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(i)(B), reasonably allocate such excess to the daily portions of interest accrued on the instrument or to a projected payment on the instrument. To the extent attributable to interest, the excess shall be reasonably allocated over the remaining term of the instrument to the daily portions of interest accrued and shall be a negative adjustment on the dates the daily portions accrue. On the date of such adjustment, the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument is reduced by the amount treated as a negative adjustment under this paragraph (b)(7)(iii), translated into functional currency at the rate used to translate the interest which is offset by the negative adjustment. To the extent related to a projected payment, such excess shall be treated as a negative adjustment on the date the payment is made. On the date of such adjustment, the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument is reduced by the amount treated as a negative adjustment under this paragraph (b)(7)(iii), translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the instrument was acquired.
(iv)
Purchase price less than adjusted issue price.
If the purchase price of the instrument (determined in the denomination currency) is less than the adjusted issue price of the instrument, the holder shall, consistent with the
rules of § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(i)(C), reasonably allocate the difference to the daily portions of interest accrued on the instrument or to a projected payment on the instrument. To the extent attributable to interest, the difference shall be reasonably allocated over the remaining term of the instrument to the daily portions of interest accrued and shall be a positive adjustment on the dates the daily portions accrue. On the date of such adjustment, the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument is increased by the amount treated as a positive adjustment under this paragraph (b)(7)(iv), translated into functional currency at the rate used to translate the interest to which it relates. For purposes of determining adjusted basis under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, such increase in adjusted basis shall be treated as an additional accrual of interest during the period to which the positive adjustment relates. To the extent related to a projected payment, such difference shall be treated as a positive adjustment on the date the payment is made. On the date of such adjustment, the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument is increased by the amount treated as a positive adjustment under this paragraph (b)(7)(iv), translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the adjustment is taken into account. For purposes of determining the amount realized on the instrument in functional currency under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, amounts attributable to the excess of the adjusted issue price of the instrument over the purchase price of the instrument shall be translated into functional currency at the same rate at which the corresponding adjustments are taken into account under this paragraph (b)(7)(iv) for purposes of determining the adjusted basis of the instrument.
(8)
Fixed but deferred contingent payments.
In the case of an instrument with a contingent payment that becomes fixed as to amount before the payment is due, the rules of § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(ii) shall be applied in the denomination currency of the instrument. For this purpose, foreign currency gain or loss shall be recognized on the date payment is made or received with respect to the instrument under the principles of paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Any increase or decrease in basis required under § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(ii)(D) shall be taken into account at the same exchange rate as the corresponding net positive or negative adjustment is taken into account.
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In each example, assume that the instrument described is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the instrument is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Treatment of net positive adjustment.
(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 2004, Z, a calendar year U.S. resident taxpayer whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, purchases from a foreign corporation, at original issue, a zero-coupon debt instrument with a non-currency contingency for £1000. All payments of principal and interest with respect to the instrument are denominated in, or determined by reference to, a single nonfunctional currency (the British pound). The debt instrument would be subject to § 1.1275-4(b) if it were denominated in dollars. The debt instrument's comparable yield, determined in British pounds under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and § 1.1275-4(b), is 10 percent, compounded annually, and the projected payment schedule, as constructed under the rules of § 1.1275-4(b), provides for a single payment of £1210 on December 31, 2006 (consisting of a noncontingent payment of £975 and a projected payment of £235). The debt instrument is a capital asset in the hands of Z. Z does not elect to use the spot-rate convention described in § 1.988-2(b)(2)(iii)(B). The payment actually made on December 31, 2006, is £1300. The relevant pound/dollar spot rates over the term of the instrument are as follows:
Date
Spot rate
(pounds to dollars)
Dec. 31, 2004
£1.00 = $1.00

(ii)
Treatment in 2005
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and based on the comparable yield, Z accrues £100 of interest on the debt instrument for 2005 (issue price of £1000 × 10
percent). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, Z translates the £100 at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($1.05 × £100 = $105). Accordingly, Z has interest income in 2005 of $105.
(B)
Adjusted issue price and basis.
Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument determined in pounds and Z's adjusted basis in dollars in the debt instrument are increased by the interest accrued in 2005. Thus, on January 1, 2006, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument is £1100. For purposes of determining Z's dollar basis in the debt instrument, the $1000 basis ($1.00 × £1000 original cost basis) is increased by the £100 of accrued interest, translated at the rate at which interest was accrued for 2005. See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument as of January 1, 2006, is $1105.
(iii)
Treatment in 2006
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and based on the comparable yield, Z accrues £110 of interest on the debt instrument for 2006 (adjusted issue price of £1100 × 10 percent). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, Z translates the £110 at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($1.15 × £110 = $126.50). Accordingly, Z has interest income in 2006 of $126.50.
(B)
Effect of net positive adjustment.
The payment actually made on December 31, 2006, is £1300, rather than the projected £1210. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, Z has a net positive adjustment of £90 on December 31, 2006, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the £90 net positive adjustment is treated as additional interest income and is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the last day of the year ($1.20 × £90 = $108). Accordingly, Z has a net positive adjustment of $108 resulting in a total interest inclusion for 2006 of $234.50 ($126.50 + $108 = $234.50).
(C)
Adjusted issue price and basis.
Based on the projected payment schedule, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument immediately before the payment at maturity is £1210 (£1100 plus £110 of accrued interest for 2006). Z's adjusted basis in dollars, based only on the noncontingent payment and the projected amount of the contingent payment to be received, is $1231.50 ($1105 plus $126.50 of accrued interest for 2006).
(D)
Amount realized.
Even though Z receives £1300 at maturity, for purposes of determining the amount realized, Z is treated under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section as receiving the projected amount of the contingent payment on December 31, 2006. Therefore, Z is treated as receiving £1210 on December 31, 2006. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, Z translates its amount realized into dollars and computes its gain or loss on the instrument (other than foreign currency gain or loss) by breaking the amount realized into its component parts. Accordingly, £100 of the £1210 (representing the interest accrued in 2005) is translated at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.05), resulting in an amount realized of $105; £110 of the £1210 (representing the interest accrued in 2006) is translated into dollars at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.15), resulting in an amount realized of $126.50; and £1000 of the £1210 (representing a return of principal) is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date the instrument was purchased (£1 = $1), resulting in an amount realized of $1000. Z's total amount realized is $1231.50, the same as its basis, and Z recognizes no gain or loss (before consideration of foreign currency gain or loss) on retirement of the instrument.
(E)
Foreign currency gain or loss.
Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section Z recognizes foreign currency gain under section 988 on the instrument with respect to the consideration actually received at maturity (except for the net positive adjustment), £1210. The amount of recognized foreign currency gain is determined based on the difference between the spot rate on the date the instrument matures and the rates at which the principal and interest were taken into account. With respect to the portion of the payment attributable to interest accrued in 2005, the foreign currency gain is $15 [£100 × ($1.20−$1.05)]. With respect to interest accrued in 2006, the foreign currency gain equals $5.50 [£110 × ($1.20−$1.15)]. With respect to principal, the foreign currency gain is $200 [£1000 × ($1.20−$1.00)]. Thus, Z recognizes a total foreign currency gain on December 31, 2006, of $220.50.
(F)
Source.
Z has interest income of $105 in 2005, interest income of $234.50 in 2006 (attributable to £110 of accrued interest and the £90 net positive adjustment), and a foreign currency gain of $220.50 in 2006. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and section 862(a)(1), the interest income is sourced by reference to the residence of the payor and is therefore from sources without the United States. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.988-4, Z's foreign currency gain of $220.50 is sourced by reference to Z's residence and is therefore from sources within the United States.

# Example 2. Treatment of net negative adjustment.
(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
, except that Z receives £975 at maturity instead of £1300.
(ii)
Treatment in 2005.
The treatment of the debt instrument in 2005 is the same as in
Example 1.
Thus, Z has interest income in 2005 of $105. On January 1, 2006, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument is £1100, and Z's adjusted basis in the instrument is $1105.
(iii)
Treatment in 2006
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of
this section and based on the comparable yield, Z's accrued interest for 2006 is £110 (adjusted issue price of £1100 × 10 percent). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the £110 of accrued interest is translated at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($1.15 × £110 = $126.50).
(B)
Effect of net negative adjustment.
The payment actually made on December 31, 2006, is £975, rather than the projected £1210. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, Z has a net negative adjustment of £235 on December 31, 2006, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. Z's accrued interest income of £110 in 2006 is reduced to zero by the net negative adjustment. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section the net negative adjustment which reduces the current year's interest is not translated into functional currency. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, Z treats the remaining £125 net negative adjustment as an ordinary loss to the extent of the £100 previously accrued interest in 2005. This £100 ordinary loss is attributable to interest accrued but not paid in the preceding year. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, Z translates the loss into dollars at the average rate for such year (£1 = $1.05). Accordingly, Z has an ordinary loss of $105 in 2006. The remaining £25 of net negative adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(C)
Adjusted issue price and basis.
Based on the projected payment schedule, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument immediately before the payment at maturity is £1210 (£1100 plus £110 of accrued interest for 2006). Z's adjusted basis in dollars, based only on the noncontingent payments and the projected amount of the contingent payments to be received, is $1231.50 ($1105 plus $126.50 of accrued interest for 2006).
(D)
Amount realized.
Even though Z receives £975 at maturity, for purposes of determining the amount realized, Z is treated under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section as receiving the projected amount of the contingent payment on December 31, 2006, reduced by the amount of Z's negative adjustment carryforward of £25. Therefore, Z is treated as receiving £1185 (£1210−£25) on December 31, 2006. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, Z translates its amount realized into dollars and computes its gain or loss on the instrument (other than foreign currency gain or loss) by breaking the amount realized into its component parts. Accordingly, £100 of the £1185 (representing the interest accrued in 2005) is translated at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.05), resulting in an amount realized of $105; £110 of the £1185 (representing the interest accrued in 2006) is translated into dollars at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.15), resulting in an amount realized of $126.50; and £975 of the £1185 (representing a return of principal) is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date the instrument was purchased (£1 = $1), resulting in an amount realized of $975. Z's amount realized is $1206.50 ($105 + $126.50 + $975 = $1206.50), and Z recognizes a capital loss (before consideration of foreign currency gain or loss) of $25 on retirement of the instrument ($1206.50−$1231.50 = −$25).
(E)
Foreign currency gain or loss.
Z recognizes foreign currency gain with respect to the consideration actually received at maturity, £975. Under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, no foreign currency gain or loss is recognized with respect to unpaid accrued interest reduced to zero by the net negative adjustment resulting in 2006. In addition, no foreign currency gain or loss is recognized with respect to unpaid accrued interest from 2005, also reduced to zero by the ordinary loss. Accordingly, Z recognizes foreign currency gain with respect to principal only. Thus, Z recognizes a total foreign currency gain on December 31, 2006, of $195 [£975 × ($1.20−$1.00)].
(F)
Source.
In 2006, Z has an ordinary loss of $105, a capital loss of $25, and a foreign currency gain of $195. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(iv), the $105 ordinary loss generally reduces Z's foreign source passive income under section 904(d) and the regulations thereunder. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.865-1(b)(2), the $25 capital loss is sourced by reference to how interest income on the instrument would have been sourced. Therefore, the $25 capital loss generally reduces Z's foreign source passive income under section 904(d) and the regulations thereunder. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.988-4, Z's foreign currency gain of $195 is sourced by reference to Z's residence and is therefore from sources within the United States.

# Example 3. Negative adjustment and periodic interest payments.
(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 2004, Z, a calendar year U.S. resident taxpayer whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, purchases from a foreign corporation, at original issue, a two-year debt instrument with a non-currency contingency for £1000. All payments of principal and interest with respect to the instrument are denominated in, or determined by reference to, a single nonfunctional currency (the British pound). The debt instrument would be subject to § 1.1275-4(b) if it were denominated in dollars. The debt instrument's comparable yield, determined in British pounds under §§ 1.988-2(b)(2) and 1.1275-4(b), is 10 percent, compounded semiannually. The debt instrument provides for semiannual interest payments of £30 payable each June 30, and December 31, and a contingent payment at maturity on December 31, 2006, which is projected to equal £1086.20 (consisting of a noncontingent payment of £980 and a projected payment of
£106.20) in addition to the interest payable at maturity. The debt instrument is a capital asset in the hands of Z. Z does not elect to use the spot-rate convention described in § 1.988-2(b)(2)(iii)(B). The payment actually made on December 31, 2006, is £981.00. The relevant pound/dollar spot rates over the term of the instrument are as follows:
Date

Treatment in 2005
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and based on the comparable yield, Z accrues £50 of interest on the debt instrument for the January-June accrual period (issue price of £1000 × 10 percent/2). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, Z translates the £50 at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($1.10 × £50 = $55.00). Similarly, Z accrues £51 of interest in the July-December accrual period [(£1000 + £50−£30) × 10 percent/2], which is translated at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($1.30 × £51 = $66.30). Accordingly, Z accrues $121.30 of interest income in 2005.
(B)
Adjusted issue price and basis
—(
1
)
January-June accrual period.
Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument determined in pounds and Z's adjusted basis in dollars in the debt instrument are increased by the interest accrued, and decreased by the interest payment made, in the January-June accrual period. Thus, on July 1, 2005, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument is £1020 (£1000 + £50 − £30 = £1020). For purposes of determining Z's dollar basis in the debt instrument, the $1000 basis is increased by the £50 of accrued interest, translated, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, at the rate at which interest was accrued for the January-June accrual period ($1.10 × £50 = $55). The resulting amount is reduced by the £30 payment of interest made during the accrual period, translated, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and § 1.988-2(b)(7), at the rate applicable to accrued interest ($1.10 × £30 = $33). Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis as of July 1, 2005, is $1022 ($1000 + $55 − $33).

July-December accrual period.
Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument determined in pounds and Z's adjusted basis in dollars in the debt instrument are increased by the interest accrued, and decreased by the interest payment made, in the July-December accrual period. Thus, on January 1, 2006, the adjusted issue price of the instrument is £1041 (£1020 + £51 − £30 = £1041). For purposes of determining Z's dollar basis in the debt instrument, the $1022 basis is increased by the £51 of accrued interest, translated, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, at the rate at which interest was accrued for the July-December accrual period ($1.30 × £51 = $66.30). The resulting amount is reduced by the £30 payment of interest made during the accrual period, translated, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and § 1.988-2(b)(7), at the rate applicable to accrued interest ($1.30 × £30 = $39). Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis as of January 1, 2006, is $1049.30 ($1022 + $66.30 − $39).
(C)
Foreign currency gain or loss.
Z will recognize foreign currency gain on the receipt of each £30 payment of interest actually received during 2005. The amount of foreign currency gain in each case is determined, under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, by reference to the difference between the spot rate on the date the £30 payment was made and the average exchange rate for the accrual period during which the interest accrued. Accordingly, Z recognizes $3 of foreign currency gain on the January-June interest payment [£30 × ($1.20 − $1.10)], and $3 of foreign currency gain on the July-December interest payment [£30 × ($1.40 − $1.30)]. Z recognizes in 2005 a total of $6 of foreign currency gain.
(D)
Source.
Z has interest income of $121.30 and a foreign currency gain of $6. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and section 862(a)(1), the interest income is sourced by reference to the residence of the payor and is therefore from sources without the United States. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.988-4, Z's foreign currency gain of $6 is sourced by reference to Z's residence and is therefore from sources within the United States.
(iii)
Treatment in 2006
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and based on the comparable yield, Z's accrued interest for the January-June accrual period is £52.05 (adjusted issue price of £1041 × 10 percent/2). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, Z translates the £52.05 at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($1.50 × £52.05 = $78.08). Similarly, Z accrues £53.15 of interest in the July-December accrual period [(£1041 + £52.05−£30) × 10 percent/2], which is translated at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($1.70 × £53.15 = $90.35). Accordingly, Z accrues £105.20, or $168.43, of interest income in 2006.
(B)
Effect of net negative adjustment.
The payment actually made on December 31, 2006, is £981.00, rather than the projected £1086.20.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, Z has a net negative adjustment of £105.20 on December 31, 2006, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. Z's accrued interest income of £105.20 in 2006 is reduced to zero by the net negative adjustment. Elimination of the 2006 accrued interest fully utilizes the net negative adjustment.
(C)
Adjusted issue price and basis
—(1)
January-June accrual period.
Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument determined in pounds and Z's adjusted basis in dollars in the debt instrument are increased by the interest accrued, and decreased by the interest payment made, in the January-June accrual period. Thus, on July 1, 2006, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument is £1063.05 (£1041 + £52.05 − £30 = £1063.05). For purposes of determining Z's dollar basis in the debt instrument, the $1049.30 adjusted basis is increased by the £52.05 of accrued interest, translated, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, at the rate at which interest was accrued for the January-June accrual period ($1.50 × £52.05 = $78.08). The resulting amount is reduced by the £30 payment of interest made during the accrual period, translated, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and § 1.988-2(b)(7), at the rate applicable to accrued interest ($1.50 × £30 = $45). Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis as of July 1, 2006, is $1082.38 ($1049.30 + $78.08 − $45).
(2)
July-December accrual period.
Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument determined in pounds and Z's adjusted basis in dollars in the debt instrument are increased by the interest accrued, and decreased by the interest payment made, in the July-December accrual period. Thus, immediately before maturity on December 31, 2006, the adjusted issue price of the instrument is £1086.20 (£1063.05 + £53.15 − £30 = £1086.20). For purposes of determining Z's dollar basis in the debt instrument, the $1082.38 adjusted basis is increased by the £53.15 of accrued interest, translated, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, at the rate at which interest was accrued for the July-December accrual period ($1.70 × £53.15 = $90.36). The resulting amount is reduced by the £30 payment of interest made during the accrual period, translated, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and § 1.988-2(b)(7), at the rate applicable to accrued interest ($1.70 × £30 = $51). Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis on December 31, 2006, immediately prior to maturity is $1121.74 ($1082.38 + $90.36 − $51).
(D)
Amount realized.
Even though Z receives £981.00 at maturity, for purposes of determining the amount realized, Z is treated under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section as receiving the projected amount of the contingent payment on December 31, 2006. Therefore, Z is treated as receiving £1086.20 on December 31, 2006. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, Z translates its amount realized into dollars and computes its gain or loss on the instrument (other than foreign currency gain or loss) by breaking the amount realized into its component parts. Accordingly, £20 of the £1086.20 (representing the interest accrued in the January-June 2005 accrual period, less £30 interest paid) is translated into dollars at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.10), resulting in an amount realized of $22; £21 of the £1086.20 (representing the interest accrued in the July-December 2005 accrual period, less £30 interest paid) is translated into dollars at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.30), resulting in an amount realized of $27.30; £22.05 of the £1086.20 (representing the interest accrued in the January-June 2006 accrual period, less £30 interest paid) is translated into dollars at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.50), resulting in an amount realized of $33.08; £23.15 of the £1086.20 (representing the interest accrued in the July 1-December 31, 2006 accrual period, less the £30 interest payment) is translated into dollars at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.70), resulting in an amount realized of $39.36; and £1000 (representing principal) is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date the instrument was purchased (£1 = $1), resulting in an amount realized of $1000. Accordingly, Z's total amount realized is $1121.74 ($22 + $27.30 + $33.08 + $39.36 + $1000), the same as its basis, and Z recognizes no gain or loss (before consideration of foreign currency gain or loss) on retirement of the instrument.
(E)
Foreign currency gain or loss.
Z recognizes foreign currency gain with respect to each £30 payment actually received during 2006. These payments, however, are treated as payments of principal for this purpose because all 2006 accrued interest is reduced to zero by the net negative adjustment. See paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A)(
3
) of this section. The amount of foreign currency gain in each case is determined, under paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, by reference to the difference between the spot rate on the date the £30 payment is made and the spot rate on the date the debt instrument was issued. Accordingly, Z recognizes $18 of foreign currency gain on the January-June 2006 interest payment [£30 × ($1.60 − $1.00)], and $24 of foreign currency gain on the July-December 2006 interest payment [£30 × ($1.80 − $1.00)]. Z separately recognizes foreign currency gain with respect to the consideration actually received at maturity, £981.00. The amount of such gain is determined based on the difference between the spot rate on the date the instrument matures and the rates at which the principal and interest were taken into account. With respect to the portion of the payment attributable to interest accrued in
January-June 2005 (other than the £30 payments), the foreign currency gain is $14 [£20 × ($1.80 − $1.10)]. With respect to the portion of the payment attributable to interest accrued in July-December 2005 (other than the £30 payments), the foreign currency gain is $10.50 [£21 × ($1.80 − $1.30)]. With respect to the portion of the payment attributable to interest accrued in 2006 (other than the £30 payments), no foreign currency gain or loss is recognized under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section because such interest was reduced to zero by the net negative adjustment. With respect to the portion of the payment attributable to principal, the foreign currency gain is $752 [£940 × ($1.80 − $1.00)]. Thus, Z recognizes a foreign currency gain of $42 on receipt of the two £30 payments in 2006, and $776.50 ($14 + $10.50 + $752) on receipt of the payment at maturity, for a total 2006 foreign currency gain of $818.50.
(F)
Source.
Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.988-4, Z's foreign currency gain of $818.50 is sourced by reference to Z's residence and is therefore from sources within the United States.

# Example 4. Purchase price greater than adjusted issue price.
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 2005, Z, a calendar year U.S. resident taxpayer whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, purchases a debt instrument with a non-currency contingency for £1405. All payments of principal and interest with respect to the instrument are denominated in, or determined by reference to, a single nonfunctional currency (the British pound). The debt instrument would be subject to § 1.1275-4(b) if it were denominated in dollars. The debt instrument was originally issued by a foreign corporation on December 31, 2003, for an issue price of £1000, and matures on December 31, 2006. The debt instrument's comparable yield, determined in British pounds under §§ 1.988-2(b)(2) and 1.1275-4(b), is 10.25 percent, compounded semiannually, and the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument (determined as of the issue date under the rules of § 1.1275-4(b)) provides for a single payment at maturity of £1349.70 (consisting of a noncontingent payment of £1000 and a projected payment of £349.70). At the time of the purchase, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument is £1161.76, assuming semiannual accrual periods ending on June 30 and December 31 of each year. The increase in the value of the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price is due to an increase in the expected amount of the contingent payment. The debt instrument is a capital asset in the hands of Z. Z does not elect to use the spot-rate convention described in § 1.988-2(b)(2)(iii)(B). The payment actually made on December 31, 2006, is £1400. The relevant pound/dollar spot rates over the term of the instrument are as follows:
Date
Spot rate
(pounds to dollars)
July 1, 2005

July 1-Dec. 31, 2006
£1.00 = $1.50
(ii)
Initial basis.
Under paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section, Z's initial basis in the debt instrument is $1405, Z's purchase price of £1405, translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the debt instrument was purchased (£1 = $1).
(iii)
Allocation of purchase price differential.
Z purchased the debt instrument for £1405 when its adjusted issue price was £1161.76. Under paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section, Z allocates the £243.24 excess of purchase price over adjusted issue price to the contingent payment at maturity. This allocation is reasonable because the excess is due to an increase in the expected amount of the contingent payment and not, for example, to a decrease in prevailing interest rates.
(iv)
Treatment in 2005
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and based on the comparable yield, Z accrues £59.54 of interest on the debt instrument for the July-December 2005 accrual period (issue price of £1161.76 × 10.25 percent/2). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, Z translates the £59.54 of interest at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($1.50 × £59.54 = $89.31). Accordingly, Z has interest income in 2005 of $89.31.
(B)
Adjusted issue price and basis.
Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument determined in pounds and Z's adjusted basis in dollars in the debt instrument are increased by the interest accrued in July-December 2005. Thus, on January 1, 2006, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument is £1221.30 (£1161.76 + £59.54). For purposes of determining Z's dollar basis in the debt instrument on January 1, 2006, the $1405 basis is increased by the £59.54 of accrued interest, translated at the rate at which interest was accrued for the July-December 2005 accrual period. Paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis in the instrument, as of January 1, 2006, is $1494.31 [$1405 + (£59.54 × $1.50)].
(v)
Treatment in 2006
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and based on the comparable yield, Z accrues £62.59 of interest on the debt instrument for the January-June 2006 accrual period (issue price of £1221.30 × 10.25 percent/2). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, Z translates the £62.59 of accrued interest at the average exchange rate for the
accrual period ($1.50 × £62.59 = $93.89). Similarly, Z accrues £65.80 of interest in the July-December 2006 accrual period [(£1221.30 + £62.59) × 10.25 percent/2], which is translated at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($1.50 × £65.80 = $98.70). Accordingly, Z accrues £128.39, or $192.59, of interest income in 2006.
(B)
Effect of positive and negative adjustments
—(

)
Offset of positive adjustment.
The payment actually made on December 31, 2006, is £1400, rather than the projected £1349.70. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, Z has a positive adjustment of £50.30 on December 31, 2006, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. Under paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section, however, Z also has a negative adjustment of £243.24, attributable to the excess of Z's purchase price for the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price. Accordingly, Z will have a net negative adjustment of £192.94 (£50.30−£243.24 = £192.94) for 2006.
(
2
)
Offset of accrued interest.
Z's accrued interest income of £128.39 in 2006 is reduced to zero by the net negative adjustment. The net negative adjustment which reduces the current year's interest is not translated into functional currency. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, Z treats the remaining £64.55 net negative adjustment as an ordinary loss to the extent of the £59.54 previously accrued interest in 2005. This £59.54 ordinary loss is attributable to interest accrued but not paid in the preceding year. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, Z translates the loss into dollars at the average rate for such year (£1 = $1.50). Accordingly, Z has an ordinary loss of $89.31 in 2006. The remaining £5.01 of net negative adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

January-June accrual period.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument on July 1, 2006, is £1283.89 (£1221.30 + £62.59 = £1283.89). Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iv) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section, Z's adjusted basis as of July 1, 2006, is $1588.20 ($1494.31 + $93.89).

July-December accrual period.
Based on the projected payment schedule, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument immediately before the payment at maturity is £1349.70 (£1283.89 + £65.80 accrued interest for July-December). Z's adjusted basis in dollars, based only on the noncontingent payments and the projected amount of the contingent payments to be received, is $1686.90 ($1588.20 plus $98.70 of accrued interest for July-December).
(

)
Adjustment to basis upon contingent payment.
Under paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is reduced at maturity by £243.24, the excess of Z's purchase price for the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price. For this purpose, the adjustment is translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the instrument was acquired (£1 = $1). Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument at maturity is $1443.66 ($1686.90−$243.24).
(D)
Amount realized.
Even though Z receives £1400 at maturity, for purposes of determining the amount realized, Z is treated under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section as receiving the projected amount of the contingent payment on December 31, 2006, reduced by the amount of Z's negative adjustment carryforward of £5.01. Therefore, Z is treated as receiving £1344.69 (£1349.70−£5.01) on December 31, 2006. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, Z translates its amount realized into dollars and computes its gain or loss on the instrument (other than foreign currency gain or loss) by breaking the amount realized into its component parts. Accordingly, £59.54 of the £1344.69 (representing the interest accrued in 2005) is translated at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.50), resulting in an amount realized of $89.31; £62.59 of the £1344.69 (representing the interest accrued in January-June 2006) is translated into dollars at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.50), resulting in an amount realized of $93.89; £65.80 of the £1344.69 (representing the interest accrued in July-December 2006) is translated into dollars at the rate at which it was accrued (£1 = $1.50), resulting in an amount realized of $98.70; and £1156.76 of the £1344.69 (representing a return of principal) is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the date the instrument was purchased (£1 = $1), resulting in an amount realized of $1156.76. Z's amount realized is $1438.66 ($89.31 + $93.89 + $98.70 + $1156.76), and Z recognizes a capital loss (before consideration of foreign currency gain or loss) of $5 on retirement of the instrument ($1438.66 − $1443.66 = −$5).
(E)
Foreign currency gain or loss.
Z recognizes foreign currency gain under section 988 on the instrument with respect to the entire consideration actually received at maturity, £1400. While foreign currency gain or loss ordinarily would not have arisen with respect to £50.30 of the £1400, which was initially treated as a positive adjustment in 2006, the larger negative adjustment in 2006 reduced this positive adjustment to zero. Accordingly, foreign currency gain or loss is recognized with respect to the entire £1400. Under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, however, no foreign currency gain or loss is recognized with respect to unpaid accrued interest reduced to zero by the net negative adjustment resulting in 2006, and no foreign currency gain or loss is recognized with respect to unpaid accrued interest from 2005, also reduced to zero by the ordinary loss. Therefore, the entire £1400 is treated as a return of principal
for the purpose of determining foreign currency gain or loss, and Z recognizes a total foreign currency gain on December 31, 2001, of $1400 [£1400 × ($2.00−$1.00)].
(F)
Source.
Z has an ordinary loss of $89.31, a capital loss of $5, and a foreign currency gain of $1400. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(iv), the $89.31 ordinary loss generally reduces Z's foreign source passive income under section 904(d) and the regulations thereunder. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.865-1(b)(2), the $5 capital loss is sourced by reference to how interest income on the instrument would have been sourced. Therefore, the $5 capital loss generally reduces Z's foreign source passive income under section 904(d) and the regulations thereunder. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.988-4, Z's foreign currency gain of $1400 is sourced by reference to Z's residence and is therefore from sources within the United States.

(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 2003, Z, a calendar year U.S. resident taxpayer whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, purchases at original issue a debt instrument with non-currency contingencies for £1000. All payments of principal and interest with respect to the instrument are denominated in, or determined by reference to, a single nonfunctional currency (the British pound). The debt instrument would be subject to § 1.1275-4(b) if it were denominated in dollars. The debt instrument's comparable yield, determined in British poundsunder §§ 1.988-2(b)(2) and 1.1275-4(b), is 10 percent, compounded annually, and the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument provides for payments of £310 on December 31, 2005 (consisting of a noncontingent payment of £50 and a projected amount of £260) and £990 on December 31, 2006 (consisting of a noncontingent payment of £940 and a projected amount of £50). The debt instrument is a capital asset in the hands of Z. Z does not elect to use the spot-rate convention described in § 1.988-2(b)(2)(iii)(B). The payment actually made on December 31, 2005, is £50. On December 30, 2006, Z sells the debt instrument for £940. The relevant pound/dollar spot rates over the term of the instrument are as follows:

Treatment in 2004
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and based on the comparable yield, Z accrues £100 of interest on the debt instrument for 2004 (issue price of £1000 × 10 percent). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, Z translates the £100 at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($2.00 × £100 = $200). Accordingly, Z has interest income in 2004 of $200.
(B)
Adjusted issue price and basis.
Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument determined in pounds and Z's adjusted basis in dollars in the debt instrument are increased by the interest accrued in 2004. Thus, on January 1, 2005, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument is £1100. For purposes of determining Z's dollar basis in the debt instrument, the $1000 basis ($1.00 × £1000 original cost basis) is increased by the £100 of accrued interest, translated at the rate at which interest was accrued for 2004. See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument as of January 1, 2005, is $1200 ($1000 + $200).

Treatment in 2005
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and based on the comparable yield, Z's accrued interest for 2005 is £110 (adjusted issue price of £1100 × 10 percent). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the £110 of accrued interest is translated at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($2.00 × £110 = $220).
(B)
Effect of net negative adjustment.
The payment actually made on December 31, 2005, is £50, rather than the projected £310. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, Z has a net negative adjustment of £260 on December 31, 2005, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. Z's accrued interest income of £110 in 2005 is reduced to zero by the net negative adjustment. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the net negative adjustment which reduces the current year's interest is not translated into functional currency. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, Z treats the remaining £150 net negative adjustment as an ordinary loss to the extent of the £100 previously accrued interest in 2004. This £100 ordinary loss is attributable to interest accrued but not paid in the preceding year. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(

) of this section, Z translates the loss into dollars at the average rate for such year (£1 = $2.00). Accordingly, Z has an ordinary loss of $200 in 2005. The remaining £50 of net negative adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(C)
Adjusted issue price and basis.
Based on the projected payment schedule, the adjusted
issue price of the debt instrument on January 1, 2006 is £900,
i.e.
, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument on January 1, 2005 (£1100), increased by the interest accrued in 2005 (£110), and decreased by the projected amount of the December 31, 2005, payment (£310). See paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Z's adjusted basis on January 1, 2006 is Z's adjusted basis on January 1, 2005 ($1200), increased by the functional currency amount of interest accrued in 2005 ($220), and decreased by the amount of the payments made in 2005, based solely on the projected payment schedule, (£310). The amount of the projected payment is first attributable to the interest accrued in 2005 (£110), and then to the interest accrued in 2004 (£100), and the remaining amount to principal (£100). The interest component of the projected payment is translated into functional currency at the rates at which it was accrued, and the principal component of the projected payment is translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date the instrument was issued. See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument, following the increase of adjusted basis for interest accrued in 2005 ($1200 + $220 = $1420), is decreased by $520 ($220 + $200 + $100 = $520). Z's adjusted basis on January 1, 2006 is therefore, $900.
(D)
Foreign currency gain or loss.
Z will recognize foreign currency gain on the receipt of the £50 payment actually received on December 31, 2005. Based on paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section, the £50 payment is attributable to principal since the accrued unpaid interest was completely eliminated by the net negative adjustment. The amount of foreign currency gain is determined, under paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, by reference to the difference between the spot rate on the date the £50 payment was made and the spot rate on the date the debt instrument was issued. Accordingly, Z recognizes $50 of foreign currency gain on the £50 payment. [($2.00—$1.00) × £50 = $50]. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.988-4, Z's foreign currency gain of $50 is sourced by reference to Z's residence and is therefore from sources within the United States.
(iv)
Treatment in 2006
—(A)
Determination of accrued interest.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and based on the comparable yield, Z accrues £90 of interest on the debt instrument for 2006 (adjusted issue price of £900 × 10 percent). Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, Z translates the £90 at the average exchange rate for the accrual period ($2.00 × £90 = $180). Accordingly, prior to taking into account the 2005 negative adjustment carryforward, Z has interest income in 2006 of $180.
(B)
Effect of net negative adjustment.
The £50 negative adjustment carryforward from 2005 is a negative adjustment for 2006. Since there are no other positive or negative adjustments, there is a £50 negative adjustment in 2006 which reduces Z's accrued interest income by £50. Accordingly, after giving effect to the £50 negative adjustment carryforward, Z will accrue $80 of interest income. [(£90−£50) × $2.00 = $80]
(C)
Adjusted issue price.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument determined in pounds is increased by the interest accrued in 2006 (prior to taking into account the negative adjustment carryforward). Thus, on December 30, 2006, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument is £990.
(D)
Adjusted basis.
For purposes of determining Z's dollar basis in the debt instrument, Z's $900 adjusted basis on January 1, 2006, is increased by the accrued interest, translated at the rate at which interest was accrued for 2006. See paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. Note, however, that under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section the amount of accrued interest which is reduced as a result of the negative adjustment carryforward,
i.e.
, £50, is treated for purposes of this section as principal, and is translated at the spot rate on the date the instrument was issued,
i.e.
, £1.00 = $1.00. Accordingly, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument as of December 30, 2006, is $1030 ($900 + $50 + $80).
(E)
Amount realized.
Z's amount realized in denomination currency is £940,
i.e.
, the amount of pounds Z received on the sale of the debt instrument. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section, Z's amount realized is first translated by reference to the principal component of basis (including the amount which is treated as principal under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section) and then the remaining amount realized, if any, is translated by reference to the accrued unpaid interest component of adjusted basis. Thus, £900 of Z's amount realized is translated by reference to the principal component of adjusted basis. The remaining £40 of Z's amount realized is treated as principal under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, and is also translated by reference to the principal component of adjusted basis. Accordingly, Z's amount realized in functional currency is $940. (No part of Z's amount realized is attributable to the interest accrued on the debt instrument.) Z realizes a loss of $90 on the sale of the debt instrument ($1030 basis−$940 amount realized). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and § 1.1275-4(b)(8), $80 of the loss is characterized as ordinary loss, and the remaining $10 of loss is characterized as capital loss. Under §§ 1.988-6(b)(6) and 1.1275-4(b)(9)(iv) the $80 ordinary loss is treated as a deduction that is definitely related to the interest income accrued on the debt instrument. Similarly, under §§ 1.988-6(b)(6) and 1.865-1(b)(2) the $10 capital loss is also allocated to the interest income from the debt instrument.
(F)
Foreign currency gain or loss.
Z recognizes foreign currency gain with respect to the £940 he received on the sale of the debt instrument. Under paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section, the £940 Z received is attributable to principal (and the amount which is treated as principal under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section). Thus, Z recognizes foreign currency gain on December 31, 2006, of $940. [($2.00−$1.00) × £940]. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section and § 1.988-4, Z's foreign currency gain of $940 is sourced by reference to Z's residence and is therefore from sources within the United States.
(d)
Multicurrency debt instruments
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (d), a multicurrency debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section shall be treated as an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and shall be accounted for under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. Because payments on an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section are denominated in, or determined by reference to, more than one currency, the issuer and holder or holders of the instrument are required to determine the denomination currency of the instrument under paragraph (d)(2) of this section before applying the rules of paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Determination of denomination currency
—(i)
In general.
The denomination currency of an instrument described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section shall be the predominant currency of the instrument. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the predominant currency of the instrument shall be the currency with the greatest value determined by comparing the functional currency value of the noncontingent and projected payments denominated in, or determined by reference to, each currency on the issue date, discounted to present value (in each relevant currency), and translated (if necessary) into functional currency at the spot rate on the issue date. For this purpose, the applicable discount rate may be determined using any method, consistently applied, that reasonably reflects the instrument's economic substance. If a taxpayer does not determine a discount rate using such a method, the Commissioner may choose a method for determining the discount rate that does reflect the instrument's economic substance. The predominant currency is determined as of the issue date and does not change based on subsequent events (
e.g.
, changes in value of one or more currencies).
(ii)
Difference in discount rate of greater than 10 percentage points.
This § 1.988-6(d)(2)(ii) applies if no currency has a value determined under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that is greater than 50% of the total value of all payments. In such a case, if the difference between the discount rate in the denomination currency otherwise determined under (d)(2)(i) of this section and the discount rate determined under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section with respect to any other currency in which payments are made (or determined by reference to) pursuant to the instrument is greater than 10 percentage points, then the Commissioner may determine the predominant currency under any reasonable method.
(3)
Issuer/holder consistency.
The issuer determines the denomination currency under the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and provides this information to the holders of the instrument in a manner consistent with the issuer disclosure rules of § 1.1275-2(e). If the issuer does not determine the denomination currency of the instrument, or if the issuer's determination is unreasonable, the holder of the instrument must determine the denomination currency under the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. A holder that determines the denomination currency itself must explicitly disclose this fact on a statement attached to the holder's timely filed federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the instrument.
(4)
Treatment of payments in currencies other than the denomination currency.
For purposes of applying the rules of paragraph (b) of this section to debt instruments described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, payments not denominated in (or determined by reference to) the denomination currency shall be treated as non-currency-related contingent payments. Accordingly, if the denomination currency of the instrument is determined
to be the taxpayer's functional currency, the instrument shall be accounted for under § 1.1275-4(b) rather than under this section.
(e)
Instruments issued for nonpublicly traded property
—(1)
Applicability.
This paragraph (e) applies to debt instruments issued for nonpublicly traded property that would be described in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, but for the fact that such instruments are described in § 1.1275-4(c)(1) rather than § 1.1275-4(b)(1). For example, this paragraph (e) generally applies to a contingent payment debt instrument denominated in a nonfunctional currency that is issued for non-publicly traded property. Generally the rules of § 1.1275-4(c) apply except as set forth by the rules of this paragraph (e).
(2)
Separation into components.
An instrument described in this paragraph (e) is not accounted for using the noncontingent bond method of § 1.1275-4(b) and paragraph (b) of this section. Rather, the instrument is separated into its component payments. Each noncontingent payment or group of noncontingent payments which is denominated in a single currency shall be considered a single component treated as a separate debt instrument denominated in the currency of the payment or group of payments. Each contingent payment shall be treated separately as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(3)
Treatment of components consisting of one or more noncontingent payments in the same currency.
The issue price of each component treated as a separate debt instrument which consists of one or more noncontingent payments is the sum of the present values of the noncontingent payments contained in the separate instrument. The present value of any noncontingent payment shall be determined under § 1.1274-2(c)(2), and the test rate shall be determined under § 1.1274-4 with respect to the currency in which each separate instrument is considered denominated. No interest payments on the separate debt instrument are qualified stated interest payments (within the meaning of § 1.1273-1(c)) and the
de minimis
rules of section 1273(a)(3) and § 1.1273-1(d) do not apply to the separate debt instrument. Interest income or expense is translated, and exchange gain or loss is recognized on the separate debt instrument as provided in § 1.988-2(b)(2), if the instrument is denominated in a nonfunctional currency.
(4)
Treatment of components consisting of contingent payments
—(i)
General rule.
A component consisting of a contingent payment shall generally be treated in the manner provided in § 1.1275-4(c)(4). However, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, the test rate shall be determined by reference to the U.S. dollar unless the dollar does not reasonably reflect the economic substance of the contingent component. In such case, the test rate shall be determined by reference to the currency which most reasonably reflects the economic substance of the contingent component. Any amount received in nonfunctional currency from a component consisting of a contingent payment shall be translated into functional currency at the spot rate on the date of receipt. Except in the case when the payment becomes fixed more than six months before the payment is due, no foreign currency gain or loss shall be recognized on a contingent payment component.
(ii)
Certain delayed contingent payments
—(A)
Separate debt instrument relating to the fixed component.
The rules of § 1.1275-4(c)(4)(iii) shall apply to a contingent component the payment of which becomes fixed more than 6 months before the payment is due. For this purpose, the denomination currency of the separate debt instrument relating to the fixed payment shall be the currency in which payment is to be made and the test rate for such separate debt instrument shall be determined in the currency of that instrument. If the separate debt instrument relating to the fixed payment is denominated in nonfunctional currency, the rules of § 1.988-2(b)(2) shall apply to that instrument for the period beginning on the date the payment is fixed and ending on the payment date.
(B)
Contingent component.
With respect to the contingent component, the issue price considered to have been paid by the issuer to the holder under § 1.1275-4(c)(4)(iii)(A) shall be translated, if necessary, into the functional currency of the issuer or holder at the
spot rate on the date the payment becomes fixed.
(5)
Basis different from adjusted issue price.
The rules of § 1.1275-4(c)(5) shall apply to an instrument subject to this paragraph (e).
(6)
Treatment of a holder on sale, exchange, or retirement.
The rules of § 1.1275-4(c)(6) shall apply to an instrument subject to this paragraph (e).
(f)
Rules for nonfunctional currency tax exempt obligations described in § 1.1275-4(d)
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, section 1.988-6 shall not apply to a debt instrument the interest on which is excluded from gross income under section 103(a).
(2)
Operative rules.
[Reserved]
(g)
Effective date.
This section shall apply to debt instruments issued on or after October 29, 2004.
[T.D. 9157, 69 FR 52819, Aug. 30, 2004]
§ 1.989(a)-1
Definition of a qualified business unit.
(a)
Applicability
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules relating to the definition of the term “qualified business unit” (QBU) within the meaning of section 989.
(2)
Effective date.
These rules shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. However, any person may apply on a consistent basis § 1.989(a)-1T (c) of the Temporary Income Tax Regulations in lieu of § 1.989(a)-1 (c) to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and on or before February 5, 1990. For the text of the temporary regulation, see 53 FR 20612 (June 8, 1988).
(b)
Definition of a qualified business unit
—(1)
In general.
A QBU is any separate and clearly identified unit of a trade or business of a taxpayer provided that separate books and records are maintained.
(2)
Application of the QBU definition
—(i)
Persons
—(A)
Corporations.
A corporation is a QBU.
(B)
Individuals.
An individual is not a QBU.
(C) [Reserved]
(D)
Trusts and estates.
A trust or estate is a QBU of a beneficiary.
(ii)
Activities.
Activities of a corporation, partnership, trust, estate, or individual qualify as a QBU if—
(A) The activities constitute a trade or business; and
(B) A separate set of books and records is maintained with respect to the activities.
(3)
Special rule.
Any activity (wherever conducted and regardless of its frequency) that produces income or loss that is, or is treated as, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States shall be treated as a separate QBU, provided the books and records requirement of paragraph (d)(2) of this section is satisfied.
(4)
Applicability date.
Generally, paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. However, if pursuant to § 1.987-15(b), a taxpayer chooses to apply §§ 1.987-1 through 1.987-15 to a taxable year before the first taxable year described in § 1.987-15(a)(1), then paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section applies to that taxable year.
See
§ 1.989(a)-1(b)(4), as contained in 26 CFR in part 1 in effect on April 1, 2024, for a prior applicability date for paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(c)
Trade or business.
The determination as to whether activities constitute a trade or business is ultimately dependent upon an examination of all the facts and circumstances. Generally, a trade or business for purposes of section 989(a) is a specific unified group of activities that constitutes (or could constitute) an independent economic enterprise carried on for profit, the expenses related to which are deductible under section 162 or 212 (other than that part of section 212 dealing with expenses incurred in connection with taxes). To constitute a trade or business, a group of activities must ordinarily include every operation which forms a part of, or a step in, a process by which an enterprise may earn income or profit. Such group of activities must ordinarily include the collection of income and the payment of expenses. It is not necessary that the activities carried out by a QBU constitute a different trade or business from those carried out by other QBUs of the taxpayer. A vertical, functional, or geographic division of the same trade or business
may be a trade or business for this purpose provided that the activities otherwise qualify as trade or business under this paragraph (c). However, activities that are merely ancillary to a trade or business will not constitute a trade or business under this paragraph (c). Activities of an individual as an employee are not considered by themselves to constitute a trade or business under this paragraph (c).
(d)
Separate books and records
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a separate set of books and records shall include books of original entry and ledger accounts, both general and subsidiary, or similar records. For example, in the case of a taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, the books of original entry include a cash receipts and disbursements journal where each receipt and each disbursement is recorded. Similarly, in the case of a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting, the books of original entry include a journal to record sales (accounts receivable) and a journal to record expenses incurred (accounts payable). In general, a journal represents a chronological account of all transactions entered into by an entity for an accounting period. A ledger account, on the other hand, chronicles the impact during an accounting period of the specific transactions recorded in the journal for that period upon the various items shown on the entity's balance sheet (
i.e.,
assets, liabilities, and capital accounts) and income statement (
i.e.,
revenues and expenses).
(2)
Special rule.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, books and records include books and records used to determine income or loss that is, or is treated as, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
(3)
Proper reflection on the books of the taxpayer or qualified business unit.
The principles of § 1.987-2(b) apply in determining whether an asset, liability, or item of income, gain, deduction, or loss is reflected on the books of a qualified business unit (and therefore is attributable to such unit).
(4)
Applicability date.
Generally, paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. However, if pursuant to § 1.987-15(b), a taxpayer applies §§ 1.987-1 through 1.987-15 to a taxable year before the first taxable year described in § 1.987-15(a)(1), then paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies to that taxable year.
See
§ 1.989(a)-1(d)(4), as contained in 26 CFR in part 1 in effect on April 1, 2024, for a prior applicability date for paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X is a domestic corporation. Corporation X manufactures widgets in the U.S. for export. Corporation X sells widgets in the United Kingdom through a branch office in London. The London office has its own employees and solicits and processes orders. Corporation X maintains in the U.S. a separate set of books and records for all transactions conducted by the London office. Corporation X is a QBU under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of its corporate status. The London branch office is a QBU under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section because (1) the sale of widgets is a trade or business as defined in paragraph (c) of this section; and (2) a complete and separate set of books and records (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) is maintained with respect to its sales operations.

# Example 2.
A domestic corporation incorporates a wholly-owned subsidiary in Switzerland. The domestic corporation is a manufacturer that markets its product abroad primarily through the Swiss subsidiary. To facilitate sales of the parent's product in Europe, the Swiss subsidiary has branch offices in France and West Germany that are responsible for all marketing operations in those countries. Each branch has its own employees, solicits and processes orders, and maintains a separate set of books and records. The domestic corporation and the Swiss subsidiary are both QBUs under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of their corporate status. The French and West German branches are QBUs of the Swiss subsidiary. They satisfy paragraph (b)(2)(ii) because each constitutes a trade or business (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) and because separate sets of books and records (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) of their respective operations is maintained. Each branch is considered to have a trade or business although each is a geographical division of the same trade or business.

# Example 3.
W is a domestic corporation that manufactures product X in the United States for sale worldwide. All of W's sales functions are conducted exclusively in the
United States. W employs individual Q to work in France. Q's sole function is to act as a courier to deliver sales documents to customers in France. With respect to Q's activities in France, a separate set of books and records as described in paragraph (d) is maintained. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Q's activities in France do not constitute a QBU since they are merely ancillary to W's manufacturing and selling business. Q is not considered to have a QBU because an individual's activities as an employee are not considered to constitute a trade or business of the individual under paragraph (c).

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example (3) except that the courier function is the sole activity of a wholly-owned French subsidiary of W. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the French subsidiary is considered to be a QBU.

# Example 5.
A corporation incorporated in the Netherlands is a subsidiary of a domestic corporation and a holding company for the stock of one or more subsidiaries incorporated in other countries. The Dutch corporation's activities are limited to paying its directors and its administrative expenses, receiving capital contributions from its United States parent corporation, contributing capital to its subsidiaries, receiving dividend distributions from its subsidiaries, and distributing dividends to its domestic parent corporation. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Netherlands corporation is considered to be a QBU.

# Example 6.
Taxpayer A, an individual resident of the United States, is engaged in a trade or business wholly unrelated to any type of investment activity. A also maintains a portfolio of foreign currency-denominated investments through a foreign broker. The broker is responsible for all activities necessary to the management of A's investments and maintains books and records as described in paragraph (d) of this section, with respect to all investment activities of A. A's investment activities qualify as a QBU under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to the extent the activities engaged in by A generate expenses that are deductible under section 212 (other than that part of section 212 dealing with expenses incurred in connection with taxes).

# Example 7.
Taxpayer A, an individual resident of the United States, is the sole shareholder of foreign corporation (FC) whose activities are limited to trading in stocks and securities. FC is a QBU under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

# Example 8.
Taxpayer A, an individual resident of the United States, markets and sells in Spain and in the United States various products produced by other United States manufacturers. A has an office and employs a salesman to manage A's activities in Spain, maintains a separate set of books and records with respect to his activities in Spain, and is engaged in a trade or business as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the activities of A in Spain are considered to be a QBU.

# Example 9.
Foreign corporation FX is incorporated in Mexico and is wholly owned by a domestic corporation. The domestic corporation elects to treat FX as a domestic corporation under section 1504(d). FX operates entirely in Mexico and maintains a separate set of books and records with respect to its activities in Mexico. FX is a QBU under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. The activities of FX in Mexico also constitute a QBU under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

# Example 10.
F, a foreign corporation, computes a gain of $100 from the disposition of a United States real property interest (as defined in section 897(c)). The gain is taken into account as if F were engaged in a trade or business in the United States and as if such gain were effectively connected with such trade or business. F is a QBU under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of its corporate status. F's disposition activity constitutes a separate QBU under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

§ 1.989(b)-1
Definition of weighted average exchange rate.
For purposes of section 989(b)(3) and (4), the term “weighted average exchange rate” means the simple average of the daily exchange rates (determined by reference to a qualified source of exchange rates described in § 1.988-1(d)(1)), excluding weekends, holidays and any other nonbusiness days for the taxable year.

# Domestic International Sales Corporations
§ 1.991-1
Taxation of a domestic international sales corporation.
(a)
In general.
A corporation which is a DISC for a taxable year is not subject to any tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code (sections 1 through 1564) for such taxable year, except for the tax imposed by chapter 5 thereof (sections 1491 through 1494) on certain transfers to avoid tax. Thus, for example, a corporation which is a DISC for a taxable
year is not subject for such year to the corporate income tax (section 11), the minimum tax on tax preferences (sections 56 through 58), or the accumulated earnings tax (sections 531 through 537). A DISC is liable for the payment of all taxes payable by corporations under other subtitles of the Code, such as, for example, income taxes withheld at the source and other employment taxes under subtitle C and the interest equalization tax and other miscellaneous excise taxes imposed by subtitle D. In addition, a DISC is subject to the provisions of chapter 3 of subtitle A (including section 1461), relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations and tax-free covenant bonds. See § 1.992-1 for the definition of the term “DISC.”
(b)
Determination of taxable income
—(1)
In general.
Although a DISC is not subject to tax under subtitle A of the Code (other than chapter 5 thereof), a DISC's taxable income shall be determined for each taxable year in order to determine, for example, the amount deemed distributed for that taxable year to its shareholders pursuant to § 1.995-2. Except as otherwise provided in the Code and the regulations thereunder, the taxable income of a DISC shall be determined in the same manner as if the DISC were a domestic corporation which had not elected to be treated as a DISC. Thus, for example, a DISC chooses its method of depreciation, inventory method, and annual accounting period in the same manner as if it were a corporation which had not elected to be treated as a DISC. Any elections affecting the determination of taxable income shall be made by the DISC. Thus, as a further example, a DISC which makes an installment sale described in section 453 is able to avail itself of the benefits of section 453:
Provided,
The DISC complies with the election requirements of such section. See § 1.995-2(e) and § 1.996-8 and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to the application for a taxable year of a DISC of a deduction under section 172 for a net operating loss carryback or carryover or of a capital loss carryback or carryover under section 1212.
(2)
Choice of method of accounting.
A DISC may, generally, choose any method of accounting permissible under section 446(c) and the regulations thereunder. However, if a DISC is a member of a controlled group (as defined in § 1.993-1(k)), the DISC may not choose a method of accounting which, when applied to transactions between the DISC and other members of the controlled group, will result in a material distortion of the income of the DISC or any other member of the controlled group. Such a material distortion of income would occur, for example, if a DISC chooses to use the cash method of accounting where the DISC acts as commission agent in a substantial volume of sales of property by a related corporation which uses the accrual method of accounting and which customarily pays commissions to the DISC more than 2 months after such sales. As a further example, a material distortion of income would occur if a DISC chooses to use the accrual method of accounting where the DISC leases a substantial amount of property from a related corporation which uses the cash method of accounting, if the DISC customarily accrues any portion of the rent on such property more than 2 months before the rent is paid. Changes in the method of accounting of a DISC are subject to the requirements of section 446(e) and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Choice of annual accounting period
—(i)
In general.
A DISC may choose its annual accounting period without regard to the annual accounting period of any of its stockholders. In general, changes in the annual accounting period of a DISC are subject to the requirements of section 442 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
Transition rule for change in taxable year in order to become a DISC.
A corporation may, without the consent of the Commissioner, change its annual accounting period and adopt a new taxable year beginning on the first day of any month in 1972:
Provided,
That—
(
a
) Such change has the effect of accelerating the time as of which such corporation can become a DISC,
(
b
) The Commissioner is notified of such change by means of a statement filed (with the regional service center with which such corporation files its election to be treated as a DISC) not
later than the end of the period during which such corporation may file an election to be treated as a DISC for such new taxable year, and
(
c
) The short period required to effect such change is not a taxable year in which such corporation has a net operating loss as defined in section 172.
Thus, for example, if a corporation which uses the calendar year for its taxable year does not complete arrangements to become a DISC until May 15, 1972, such corporation can, pursuant to this subdivision, change its annual accounting period and adopt a taxable year beginning on the first day of any month in 1972 after May. A change to a new annual accounting period made pursuant to this subdivision is effective only if the corporation which makes such change qualifies as a DISC for such new period. A corporation may change its annual accounting period and adopt a new taxable year pursuant to this subdivision without regard to the provisions of § 1.1502-76 (relating to the taxable year of members of a group). A copy of the statement described in (
b
) of this subdivision shall be attached to the return of a corporation for the new taxable year to which such corporation changes pursuant to this subdivision. A corporation which changes its annual accounting period pursuant to this subparagraph will not be permitted under section 442 to change its annual accounting period at any time before 1982, except with the consent of the Commissioner as provided in § 1.442-1(b)(1) or pursuant to subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(4)
Transition rule for change of taxable year of certain DISC's.
In the case of a DISC all of the shares of which are held by a single shareholder or by members of a group who file a consolidated return, such DISC may (without the consent of the Commissioner) change its annual accounting period and adopt a taxable year beginning in 1972 which is the same as the taxable year of such shareholder or the members of such group. A change to a new annual accounting period may be made by a DISC pursuant to this subparagraph even if such DISC has changed its annual accounting period pursuant to subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph.
(5)
Transition rule for beginning of first taxable year of certain corporations.
If a corporation organized before January 1, 1972, neither acquires assets (other than cash or other property acquired as consideration for the issuance of stock) nor begins doing business prior to January 1, 1972, the first taxable year of such corporation is deemed to begin at the time such corporation acquires any asset (other than cash or other property acquired as consideration for the issuance of stock) or begins doing business, whichever is earlier:
Provided,
That such corporation is a DISC for such first taxable year. For purposes of § 1.6012-2(a), such corporation is treated as not coming into existence until the beginning of such first taxable year.
(c)
Effective date.
The provisions of this section and the regulations under sections 992 through 997 apply with respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1971, except that a corporation may not be a DISC for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1972.
(d)
Related statutes.
For rules relating to the transfer, during a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1976, to a DISC of assets of an export trade corporation (as defined in section 971), where a parent owns all the outstanding stock of both such DISC and such export trade corporation, see section 505(b) of the Revenue Act of 1971 (85 Stat. 551). For rules regarding limitations on the qualification of a corporation as an export trade corporation for any taxable year beginning after October 31, 1971, see section 971(a)(3).
[T.D. 7323, 39 FR 34402, Sept. 25, 1974, as amended by T.D. 7854, 47 FR 51738, Nov. 17, 1982]
§ 1.992-1
Requirements of a DISC.
(a)
“DISC” defined.
The term “DISC” refers to a domestic international sales corporation. The term “DISC” means a corporation which, for a taxable year—
(1) Is duly incorporated and existing under the laws of any State or the District of Columbia,
(2) Satisfies the gross receipts test described in paragraph (b) of this section,
(3) Satisfies the assets test described in paragraph (c) of this section,
(4) Satisfies the capitalization requirement described in paragraph (d) of this section,
(5) Satisfies the requirement that an election to be treated as a DISC be in effect for such year, as described in paragraph (e) of this section,
(6) [Reserved]
(7) Maintains separate books and records, and
(8) Is not an ineligible corporation described in paragraph (f) of this section.
A corporation which satisfies the requirements described in subparagraphs (1) through (8) of this paragraph for a taxable year is treated as a separate corporation for Federal tax purposes and qualifies as a DISC, even though such corporation would not be treated (if it were not a DISC) as a corporate entity for Federal income tax purposes. An association cannot qualify as a DISC even if such association is taxable as a corporation pursuant to section 7701(a)(3). In addition, a corporation created or organized in, or under the law of, a possession of the United States cannot qualify as a DISC. The rules contained in this paragraph constitute a relaxation of the general rules of corporate substance otherwise applicable under the Code. The separate incorporation of a DISC is required under section 992(a)(1) to make it possible to keep a better record of the income which is subject to the special treatment provided by sections 991 through 996, but this does not necessitate in all other respects the separate relationships which otherwise would be required between a parent corporation and its subsidiary. However, this relaxation of the general rules of corporate substance does not apply with respect to other corporations in other contexts. In the case of a transaction between a DISC and a person related to such DISC for purposes of section 482, see § 1.993-1(l) for rules for determining whether income is income of a DISC to which the intercompany pricing rules authorized by section 994 apply.
(b)
Gross receipts test.
In order for a corporation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to be a DISC for a taxable year, 95 percent or more of its gross receipts (as defined in § 1.993-6) for such year must consist of qualified export receipts (as defined in § 1.993-1). Gross receipts for a taxable year are determined in accordance with the method of accounting adopted by the corporation pursuant to § 1.991-1(b)(2). However, for rules regarding gross receipts in the case of a commission sale by such corporation, see § 1.993-6.
(c)
Assets test
—(1)
In general.
In order for a corporation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to be a DISC for a taxable year, the adjusted basis (determined under section 1011) of its qualified export assets at the close of such year must equal or exceed 95 percent of the sum of the adjusted bases (determined under section 1011) of all assets of such corporation at the close of such year.
(2)
Assets acquired to meet assets test.
For purposes of determining whether the requirements of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are satisfied by a corporation at the end of a taxable year, an asset which is a qualified export asset is treated as not being an asset of such corporation at such time if such asset is held for a total of 60 days or less and is acquired directly or indirectly through borrowing, unless the acquisition of such asset is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate to have been for bona fide purposes. Such acquisition is deemed to have been for bona fide purposes if, for example, it is made in the usual course of the corporation's trade or business.
(d)
Capitalization requirement
—(1)
In general.
To qualify as a DISC for a taxable year, a corporation must have, on each day of that taxable year, only one class of stock. The par value (or, in the case of stock without par value, the stated value) of the corporation's outstanding stock must be on each day of the taxable year at least $2,500. In the case of a corporation which elects to be treated as a DISC for its first taxable year, the requirements of this paragraph (d)(1) are satisfied if the corporation has no more than one class of stock at any time during the year and if the par value (or, in the case of stock without par value, the stated value) of the corporation's outstanding stock is at least $2,500 on the last day of the period within which the election must be made and on each succeeding day of
the year. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), the stated value of shares is the aggregate amount of the consideration paid for such shares which is not allotted to paid in surplus, or other surplus. The law of the State of incorporation of the DISC determines what consideration may be used to capitalize the DISC. A corporation will not be a qualified DISC unless at least $2,500 of valid consideration was used for this purpose. If a corporation has a realized or unrealized loss during a taxable year which results in the impairment of all or part of the capital required under this paragraph (d)(1), that impairment does not result in disqualification under this paragraph (d)(1), provided that the corporation does not take any legal or formal action under State law to reduce capital for that year below the amount required under this paragraph (d)(1).
(2)
Treatment of debt payable to shareholders
—(i)
In general.
Purported debt of a DISC payable to any person, whether or not such person is a shareholder or a member of a controlled group (as defined in § 1.993-1(k)) of which such DISC is a member, is treated as debt for all purposes of the Code, provided that such purported debt—
(
a
) Would qualify as debt for purposes of the Code if the DISC were a corporation which did not qualify as a DISC,
(
b
) Qualifies under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, or
(
c
) Are trade accounts payable described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.
Such debt is not treated as stock, and interest payable by the DISC on such debt is treated as interest by both the DISC and the holder of such debt. Payment of the principal of such debt by a DISC does not constitute the payment of a dividend by such DISC. The provisions of this subparagraph apply for a taxable year of a DISC, even though debt described in this subparagraph would be treated as stock of the corporation if such corporation did not qualify as a DISC for such year.
(ii)
Safe harbor rule.
Purported debt of a DISC will in no event be treated as other than debt for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph if—
(
a
) It is a written obligation to pay a sum certain on or before a fixed maturity date,
(
b
) Interest is payable on such purported debt at an arm's length interest rate (as determined under § 1.482-2(a)(2)), expressed as a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of principal,
(
c
) Such purported debt is not convertible into stock or into other purported debt unless such other purported debt qualifies under this subparagraph as debt of the DISC,
(
d
) Such purported debt does not confer voting rights upon its holder, except in the event of default thereon, and
(
e
) Interest and principal are paid in accordance with the terms of such purported debt or with any modification of such terms consistent with (
a
) through (
d
) of this subdivision.
The determination of whether purported debt of a DISC constitutes debt described in this subdivision is made without regard to the proportion of debt of the DISC held by any of its shareholders, to the ratio of the outstanding debt of the DISC to its equity, or to the amount of outstanding debt of such DISC. The provisions of (
e
) of this subdivision do not prevent the modification of the terms of debt of a DISC where, for example, a DISC becomes unable to make timely payments of principal required under such terms, provided that such modification is consistent with (
a
) through (
d
) of this subdivision.
(iii)
Trade accounts payable.
Trade accounts payable of a DISC which arise in the normal course of its trade or business (such as in consideration for inventory or supplies) constitute debt of the DISC (whether or not such accounts payable are debt described in subdivision (i) (
a
) or (
b
) of this subparagraph), provided that such accounts are payable within 15 months after they arise. If such accounts are payable more than 15 months after they arise, they are debt of such DISC only if they are debt described in subdivision (i) (
a
) or (
b
) of this subparagraph.
(iv)
Relation of subparagraph to other corporations.
The provisions of this subparagraph generally constitute a relaxation of the ordinary rules used in determining whether purported debt of a corporation is debt or equity. This relaxation is in recognition of the principle that a corporation may qualify as a DISC even though it has relatively little capital. This relaxation does not apply with respect to purported debt of other corporations in other contexts. The provisions of subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph apply only for taxable years for which a corporation qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC.
(3)
Classes of stock.
[Reserved]
(e)
Election in effect.
In order for a corporation to be a DISC for a taxable year, an election to be treated as a DISC must be made by such corporation pursuant to § 1.992-2 and must be in effect for such taxable year. A corporation does not become or remain a DISC solely by making such an election. A corporation is a DISC for a taxable year only if such an election is in effect for that year and the corporation also satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. See § 1.992-2 for rules regarding the time and manner of making such an election.
(f)
Ineligible corporations.
The following corporations shall not be eligible to be treated as a DISC—
(1) A corporation exempt from tax by reason of section 501,
(2) A personal holding company (as defined in section 542),
(3) A financial institution to which section 581 or 593 applies,
(4) An insurance company subject to the tax imposed by subchapter L,
(5) A regulated investment company (as defined in section 851(a)),
(6) A China Trade Act corporation receiving the special deduction provided in section 941(a), or
(7) An electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)).
(g)
Status as DISC after having filed return as a DISC.
Under section 992(a)(2), notwithstanding the failure of a corporation to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for a taxable year, such corporation will be treated as a DISC for purposes of the Code for such taxable year (and, thus, will not be able to claim that it is not eligible to be a DISC) if—
(1) Such corporation files a return as a DISC for such taxable year,
(2) Such corporation does not notify the district director, more than 30 days before the expiration of the period of limitation (including extensions thereof) on assessment for underpayment of tax for such taxable year (as determined under section 6501 and the regulations thereunder), that it is not a DISC for such taxable year, and
(3) The Internal Revenue Service has not issued, within such period of limitation (including extensions thereof) on assessment for underpayment of tax for such taxable year, a notice of deficiency based on a determination that such corporation is not a DISC for such taxable year.
A corporation is treated as a DISC, for all purposes, pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph for any taxable year for which it meets the requirements of this paragraph, even if such corporation is an ineligible corporation described in paragraph (f) of this section for such taxable year. Thus, for example, a corporation which is treated as a DISC for a taxable year pursuant to this paragraph is treated as a DISC for that taxable year for purposes of § 1.992-2(e)(3) (relating to the termination of a DISC election if a corporation is not a DISC for each of any 5 consecutive taxable years). If a corporation is treated as a DISC for a taxable year pursuant to this paragraph, persons who held stock of such corporation at any time during such taxable year are treated, with respect to such stock, as holders of stock in a DISC for the period or periods during which they held such stock within such taxable year.
(h)
Definition of “former DISC”.
Under section 992(a)(3), the term “former DISC” refers to a corporation which is not a DISC for a taxable year but which was (or was treated as) a DISC for a prior taxable year. However, a corporation is not a former DISC for a taxable year unless such corporation has, at the beginning of such taxable year, undistributed previously taxed income (as defined in § 1.996-3(c) or accumulated DISC income (as defined in
§ 1.996-3(b)). A corporation which is a former DISC for a taxable year is a former DISC for all purposes of the Code.
(Secs. 385 and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (83 Stat. 613 and 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 385 and 7805))
[T.D. 7323, 39 FR 34403, Sept. 25, 1974, as amended by T.D. 7420, 41 FR 20654, May 20, 1976; 41 FR 22267, June 2, 1976; T.D. 7747, 45 FR 86459, Dec. 31, 1980; T.D. 7920, 48 FR 50712, Nov. 3, 1983; T.D. 8371, 56 FR 55234, Oct. 25, 1991]
§ 1.992-2
Election to be treated as a DISC.
(a)
Manner and time of election
—(1)
Manner
—(i)
In general.
A corporation can elect to be treated as a DISC for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the election is made by the corporation filing Form 4876 with the service center with which it would file its income tax return if it were subject for such taxable year to all the taxes imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The form shall be signed by any person authorized to sign a corporation return under section 6062, and shall contain the information required by such form. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c) of this section, such election to be treated as a DISC shall be valid only if the consent of every person who is a shareholder of the corporation as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which such election is effective is on or attached to such Form 4876 when filed with the service center.
(ii)
Transitional rule for corporations electing during 1972.
If the first taxable year for which an election by a corporation to be treated as a DISC is a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971, and on or before December 31, 1972, such election may be made either in the manner prescribed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph or by filing, at the place prescribed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a statement captioned “Election to be Treated as a DISC.” Such statement of election shall be valid only if the consent of each shareholder is filed with the service center in the form, and at the time, prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Such statement shall be signed by any person authorized to sign a corporation return under section 6062 and shall include the name, address, and employer identification number (if known) of the corporation, the beginning date of the first taxable year for which the election is effective, the number of shares of stock of the corporation issued and outstanding as of the earlier of the beginning of the first taxable year for which the election is effective or the time the statement is filed, the number of shares held by each shareholder as of the earlier of such dates, and the date and place of incorporation. As a condition of the election being effective, a corporation which elects to become a DISC by filing a statement in accordance with this subdivision must furnish (to the service center with which the statement was filed) such additional information as is required by Form 4876 by March 31, 1973.
(2)
Time of making election
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a corporation making an election to be treated as a DISC for its first taxable year, such election shall be made within 90 days after the beginning of such taxable year. In the case of a corporation which makes an election to be treated as a DISC for any taxable year beginning after March 31, 1972 (other than the first taxable year of such corporation), the election shall be made during the 90-day period immediately preceding the first day of such taxable year.
(ii)
Transitional rules for certain corporations electing during 1972.
In the case of a corporation which makes an election to be treated as a DISC for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971, and on or before March 31, 1972 (other than its first taxable year), the election shall be made within 90 days after the beginning of such taxable year.
(b)
Consent by shareholders
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Time and manner of consent.
Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, subject to certain exceptions, the election to be treated as a DISC is not valid unless each person who is a shareholder as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which the election is effective signs either the statement of consent on Form 4876 or a separate
statement of consent attached to such form. A shareholder's consent is binding on such shareholder and all transferees of his shares and may not be withdrawn after a valid election is made by the corporation. In the case of a corporation which files an election to become a DISC for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, if a person who is a shareholder as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which the election is effective does not consent by signing the statement of consent set forth on Form 4876, such election shall be valid (except in the case of an extension of the time for filing granted under the provisions of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph or paragraph (c) of this section) only if the consent of such shareholder is attached to the Form 4876 upon which such election is made.
(ii)
Form of consent.
A consent other than the statement of consent set forth on Form 4876 shall be in the form of a statement which is signed by the shareholder and which sets forth (
a
) the name and address of the corporation and of the shareholder and (
b
) the number of shares held by each such shareholder as of the time the consent is made and (if the consent is made after the beginning of the corporation's taxable year for which the election is effective) as of the beginning of such year. If the consent is made by a recipient of transferred shares pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the statement of consent shall also set forth the name and address of the person who held such shares as of the beginning of such taxable year and the number of such shares. Consent shall be made in the following form: “I (insert name of shareholder), a shareholder of (insert name of corporation seeking to make the election) consent to the election of (insert name of corporation seeking to make the election) to be treated as a DISC under section 992(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The consent so made by me is irrevocable and is binding upon all transferees of my shares in (insert name of corporation seeking to make the election).” The consents of all shareholders may be incorporated in one statement.
(iii)
Who may consent.
Where stock of the corporation is owned by a husband and wife as community property (or the income from such stock is community property), or is owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants by the entirety, each person having a community interest in such stock or the income therefrom and each tenant in common, joint tenant, and tenant by the entirety must consent to the election. The consent of a minor shall be made by his legal guardian or by his natural guardian if no legal guardian has been appointed. The consent of an estate shall be made by the executor or administrator thereof. The consent of a trust shall be made by the trustee thereof. The consent of an estate or trust having more than one executor, administrator, or trustee, may be made by any executor, administrator, or trustee, authorized to make a return of such estate or trust pursuant to section 6012(b)(5). The consent of a corporation or partnership shall be made by an officer or partner authorized pursuant to section 6062 or 6063, as the case may be, to sign the return of such corporation or partnership. In the case of a foreign person, the consent may be signed by any individual (whether or not a U.S. person) who would be authorized under sections 6061 through 6063 to sign the return of such foreign person if he were a U.S. person.
(2)
Transitional rule for corporations electing during 1972.
In the case of a corporation which files an election to be treated as a DISC for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971, and on or before December 31, 1972, such election shall be valid only if the consent of each person who is a shareholder as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which such election is effective is filed with the service center with which the election was filed within 90 days after the first day of such taxable year or within the time granted for an extension of time for filing such consent. The form of such consent shall be the same as that prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Such consent shall be attached to the statement of election or shall be filed separately (with such service center) with a copy of the statement of election. An extension of time for filing a consent may be granted in the manner,
and subject to the conditions, described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(3)
Extension of time to consent.
An election which is timely filed and would be valid except for the failure to attach the consent of any shareholder to the Form 4876 upon which the election was made or to comply with the 90-day requirement in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph or paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as the case may be, will not be invalid for such reason if it is shown to the satisfaction of the service center that there was reasonable cause for the failure to file such consent, and if such shareholder files a proper consent to the election within such extended period of time as may be granted by the Internal Revenue Service. In the case of a late filing of a consent, a copy of the Form 4876 or statement of election shall be attached to such consent and shall be filed with the same service center as the election. The form of such consent shall be the same as that set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. In no event can any consent be made pursuant to this paragraph on or after the last day of the first taxable year for which a corporation elects to be treated as a DISC.
(c)
Consent by holder of transferred shares
—(1)
In general.
If a shareholder of a corporation transfers—
(i) Prior to the first day of the first taxable year for which such corporation elects to be treated as a DISC, some or all of the shares held by him without having consented to such election, or
(ii) On or before the 90th day after the first day of the first taxable year for which such corporation elects to be treated as a DISC, some or all of the shares held by him as of the first day of such year (or if later, held by him as of the time such shares are issued) without having consented to such election, then consent may be made by any recipient of such shares on or before the 90th day after the first day of such first taxable year. If such recipient fails to file his consent on or before such 90th day, an extension of time for filing such consent may be granted in the manner, and subject to the conditions, described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. In addition, if the transfer occurs more than 90 days after the first day of such taxable year, an extension of time for filing such consent may be granted to such recipient only if it is determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section that an extension of time would have been granted the transferor for the filing of such consent if the transfer had not occurred. A consent which is not attached to the original Form 4876 or statement of election (as the case may be) shall be filed with the same service center as the original Form 4876 or statement of election and shall have attached a copy of such original form or statement of election. The form of such consent shall be the same as that set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. For the purposes of this paragraph, a transfer of shares includes any sale, exchange, or other disposition, including a transfer by gift or at death.
(2)
Requirement for the filing of an amended Form 4876 or statement of election.
In any case in which a consent to a corporation's election to be treated as a DISC is made pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, such corporation must file an amended Form 4876 or statement of election (as the case may be) reflecting all changes in ownership of shares. Such form must be filed with the same service center with which the original Form 4876 or statement of election was filed by such corporation.
(d)
Effect of election
—(1)
Effect on corporation.
A valid election to be treated as a DISC remains in effect (without regard to whether the electing corporation qualifies as a DISC for a particular year) until terminated by any of the methods provided in paragraph (e) of this section. While such election is in effect, the electing corporation is subject to sections 991 through 997 and other provisions of the Code applicable to DISC's for any taxable year for which it qualifies as a DISC (or is treated as qualifying as a DISC pursuant to § 1.992-1(g)). Such corporation is also subject to such provisions for any taxable year for which it is treated as a former DISC as a result of qualifying or being treated as a DISC for any taxable year for which such election was in effect.
(2)
Effect on shareholders.
A valid election by a corporation to be treated as
a DISC subjects the shareholders of such corporation to the provisions of section 995 (relating to the taxation of the shareholders of a DISC or former DISC) and to all other provisions of the Code relating to the shareholders of a DISC or former DISC. Such provisions of the Code apply to any person who is a shareholder of a DISC or former DISC whether or not such person was a shareholder at the time the corporation elected to become a DISC.
(e)
Termination of election
—(1)
In general.
An election to be treated as a DISC is terminated only as provided in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph.
(2)
Revocation of election
—(i)
Manner of revocation.
An election by a corporation to be treated as a DISC may be revoked by the corporation for any taxable year of the corporation after the first taxable year for which the election is effective. Such revocation shall be made by the corporation filing a statement that the corporation revokes its election under section 992(b) to be treated as a DISC. Such statement shall indicate the corporation's name, address, employer identification number, and the first taxable year of the corporation for which the revocation is to be effective. The statement shall be signed by any person authorized to sign a corporation return under section 6062. Such revocation shall be filed with the service center with which the corporation filed its election, except that, if it filed an annual information return under section 6011(e)(2), the revocation shall be filed with the service center with which it filed its last such return.
(ii)
Years for which revocation is effective.
If a corporation files a statement revoking its election to be treated as a DISC during the first 90 days of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which such election is effective), such revocation will be effective for such taxable year and all taxable years thereafter. If the corporation files a statement revoking its election to be treated as a DISC after the first 90 days of a taxable year, the revocation will be effective for all taxable years following such taxable year.
(3)
Continued failure to be a DISC.
If a corporation which has elected to be treated as a DISC does not qualify as a DISC (and is not treated as a DISC pursuant to § 1.992-1(g)) for each of any 5 consecutive taxable years, such election terminates and will not be effective for any taxable year after such fifth taxable year. Such termination will be effective automatically, without notice to such corporation or to the Internal Revenue Service. If, during any 5-year period for which an election is effective, the corporation should qualify as a DISC (or be treated as a DISC pursuant to § 1.992-1(g)) for a taxable year, a new 5-year period shall automatically start at the beginning of the following taxable year.
(4)
Election after termination.
If a corporation has made a valid election to be treated as a DISC and such election terminates in either manner described in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph, such corporation is eligible to reelect to be treated as a DISC at any time by following the procedures described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. If a corporation terminates its election and subsequently reelects to be treated as a DISC, the corporation and its shareholders continue to be subject to sections 995 and 996 with respect to the period during which its first election was in effect. Thus, for example, distributions upon disqualification includible in the gross incomes of shareholders of a corporation pursuant to section 995(b)(2) continue to be so includible for taxable years for which a second election of such corporation is in effect without regard to the second election.
[T.D. 7323, 39 FR 34405, Sept. 25, 1974, as amended by T.D. 7420, 41 FR 20655, May 20, 1976]
§ 1.992-3
Deficiency distributions to meet qualification requirements.
(a)
In general.
A corporation which meets the requirements described in § 1.992-1 for treatment as a DISC for a taxable year, other than the 95 percent of gross receipts test described in § 1.992-1(b) or the 95-percent assets test described in § 1.992-1(c), or both tests, may nevertheless qualify as a DISC for
such year by making deficiency distributions (attributable to its gross receipts other than qualified export receipts and its assets other than qualified export assets) if all of the following requirements are satisfied:
(1) The corporation distributes the amount determined under paragraph (b) of this section as a deficiency distribution. The amount of a deficiency distribution is determined without regard to the amount by which the corporation fails to meet either test.
(2) The reasonable cause requirements prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied with respect to both the corporation's failure to meet either test and its failure to make a deficiency distribution prior to the time the distribution is made.
(3) The corporation makes such deficiency distribution pro rata to all its shareholders.
(4) The corporation designates the distribution, at the time of the distribution, as a deficiency distribution, pursuant to section 992(c), to meet the qualification requirements to be a DISC. Such designation shall be in the form of a communication sent at the time of such distribution to each shareholder and to the service center with which the corporation has filed or will file its return for the taxable year to which the distribution relates. A corporation may not retroactively designate a prior distribution as a deficiency distribution to meet qualification requirements. Subject to the limitation described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a corporation may make a deficiency distribution with respect to a taxable year at any time after the close of such taxable year or, in the case of a deficiency distribution made on or before September 29, 1975, at any time during or after such taxable year.
See sections 246(d), 904(f), 995, and 996 for rules regarding the treatment of a deficiency distribution to meet qualification requirements by the shareholders and the corporation.
(b)
Amount of deficiency distribution
—(1)
In general.
In order to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of a deficiency distribution must be, if the corporation fails to meet—
(i) The 95 percent of gross receipts test, the amount determined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph,
(ii) The 95-percent assets test, the amount determined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, and
(iii) Both such tests, except as provided in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, the sum of the amounts determined in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph.
(2)
Computation of deficiency distribution to meet 95 percent of gross receipts test
—(i)
In general.
If a corporation fails to meet the 95 percent of gross receipts test described in § 1.992-1(b) for its taxable year, the amount of the deficiency distribution required by this subparagraph is an amount equal to the sum of its taxable income (if any) from each transaction giving rise to gross receipts (as defined in § 1.993-6) which are not qualified export receipts (as defined in § 1.993-1). A corporation's taxable income from a transaction shall be the amount of such gross receipts from such transaction reduced only by (
a
) its cost of goods sold attributable to such gross receipts, and by (
b
) its expenses, losses, and other deductions properly apportioned or allocated thereto in a manner consistent with the rules set forth in § 1.861-8. For purposes of this subdivision, however, any expenses, losses, or other deductions which cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income in such manner shall not reduce such gross receipts. If the corporation is a commission agent for a principal in a transaction, the corporation's taxable income is the amount of the commission from such transaction reduced only by the amounts described in (
b
) of this subdivision.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(
a
) X and Y are calendar year taxpayers. X, a domestic manufacturing company, owns all the stock of Y, which seeks to qualify as a DISC for 1973. During 1973, X manufactures a machine which is eligible to be export property as defined in § 1.993-3. Y is made a commission agent with respect to exporting such machine. Thereafter, during 1973 Y is considered to receive gross receipts of $100,000, as determined under section 993(f), attributable to X's sale of the machine in a manner which causes the gross receipts
to be excluded receipts pursuant to section 993(a)(2) and, therefore, not qualified export receipts. Y's total gross receipts for 1973 are $1 million of which $900,000 (
i.e.,
90 percent) are qualified export receipts. Therefore, Y does not satisfy the 95 percent of gross receipts test for 1973 because less than 95 percent of its gross receipts are qualified export receipts. Y has $9,000 of expenses properly apportioned or allocated to its gross income from such sale and $1,000 of other expenses which cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income, determined in a manner consistent with the rules set forth in § 1.861-8. In order to satisfy the 95 percent of gross receipts test for 1973, if the commission due from X to Y were $15,000, Y must make a deficiency distribution of $6,000 computed as follows:
Y's commission (gross income) from the transaction
$15,000
Less: Y's expenses apportioned or allocated to its gross income from the transaction
9,000
Required deficiency distribution by reason of $100,000 of gross receipts which are not qualified export receipts
6,000
(
b
) If the commission due from X to Y were $9,400, resulting in a net loss of $600 to Y ($9,400 to $10,000), Y must make a deficiency distribution of $400 computed as follows:
Y's commissions (gross income) from the transaction
$9,400
Less: Y's expenses apportioned or allocated to its gross income from the transaction
9,000
Required deficiency distribution by reason of $100,000 of gross receipts which are not qualified export receipts
400
(
c
) If the commission due from X to Y were $8,500, Y would not be required to make a deficiency distribution since, under this subparagraph, there would be no taxable income attributable to gross receipts from the sale.
(3)
Computation of deficiency distribution to meet 95 percent assets test
—(i)
In general.
If a corporation fails to meet the 95 percent assets test described in § 1.992-1(c) for its taxable year, the amount of the deficiency distribution required by this subparagraph is an amount equal to the fair market value as of the last day of such taxable year of the assets which are not qualified export assets held by such corporation on such last day.
(ii)
Asset held for more than 1 year.
In the case of a corporation which holds continuously an asset which is not a qualified export asset at the close of more than 1 taxable year, it must distribute an amount equal to its fair market value (or, if greater, the amount determined under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) only once if, at the close of the first such taxable year, such corporation reasonably believed that such asset was a qualified export asset. This subdivision shall not apply for any taxable year beginning after the date the corporation knows (or a reasonable man would have known) that an asset is not a qualified export asset and in order to qualify for each such year, the corporation must distribute the fair market value of such asset for each such year.
(4)
Computation in the case of a failure to meet both tests as a result of a single transaction.
If a corporation fails to meet both the 95 percent of gross receipts test and the 95 percent assets test for a taxable year, and if the corporation holds at the end of such year assets (other than cash or qualified export assets) which were received as proceeds of a sale or exchange during such year which resulted in gross receipts other than qualified export receipts, then the amount of the deficiency distribution required by this paragraph with respect to such sale or exchange and assets held is the larger of the amount required by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph with respect to the sale or exchange or the amount required by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph with respect to such assets held. Thus, for example, if a corporation sells property which is not a qualified export asset for $100, receives $85 in cash and a note for $15, and derives $25 of taxable income from the sale as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, it must distribute $25. If the provisions of this subparagraph are applied with respect to assets of a DISC (other than qualified export assets), such provisions do not apply to any property received as proceeds from a sale or exchange of such assets.
(c)
Reasonable cause for failure
—(1)
In general.
If for a taxable year, a corporation has failed to meet the 95 percent of gross receipts test, the 95 percent assets test, or both tests, such corporation may satisfy any such test for such year by means of a deficiency distribution in the amount determined under paragraph (b) of this section only if the reasonable cause requirements of this
subparagraph are satisfied. Such reasonable cause requirements are satisfied if—
(i) There is reasonable cause (as determined in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) for such corporation's failure to satisfy such test and to make such distribution prior to the date on which it was made, the time limit in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for making the distribution is satisfied, and interest (if required) is paid in the amount and in the manner prescribed by subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, or
(ii) The time and “70-percent” requirements of the reasonable cause test of paragraph (d) of this section are satisfied.
(2)
Determination of reasonable cause.
In general, whether a corporation's failure to meet the 95 percent of gross receipts test, the 95 percent assets test, or both tests for a taxable year and its failure to make a pro rata distribution prior to the date on which it was made will be considered for reasonable cause where the action or inaction which resulted in such failure occurred in good faith, such as failure to meet the 95 percent assets test resulting from blocked currency or expropriation, or failure to meet either test because of reasonable uncertainty as to what constitutes a qualified export receipt or a qualified export asset. For further examples, if a corporation's reasonable determination of the percentage of its total gross receipts that are qualified export receipts is subsequently redetermined to be less than 95 percent as a result of a price adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service under section 482, or if the corporation has a casualty loss for which it receives an unanticipated insurance recovery which causes its qualified export receipts to be less than 95 percent of its total gross receipts, then the failure to satisfy the 95 percent of gross receipts test is considered to be due to reasonable cause.
(3)
Time limit for deficiency distribution.
Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the time limit prescribed by this subparagraph for making a deficiency distribution is satisfied if the amount of the distribution required by paragraph (b) of this section is made within 90 days from the date of the first written notification to the corporation by the Internal Revenue Service that it had not satisfied the 95 percent of gross receipts test or the 95 percent assets test or both tests, for a taxable year. Upon a showing by the corporation that an extension of the 90-day time limit is reasonable and necessary, the Commissioner may grant such extension of such time limit. In any case in which a corporation contests the decision of the Internal Revenue Service that such corporation has not met the 95 percent of gross receipts test, the 95 percent assets test, or both tests, an extension of the 90-day time limit will be allowed until 30 days after the final determination of such contest. The date of the final determination of such contest shall, for purposes of section 992(c), be established in the manner specified in subdivisions (i) through (iv) of this subparagraph:
(i) The date of final determination by a decision of the United States Tax Court is the date upon which such decision becomes final, as prescribed in section 7481.
(ii) The date of final determination in a case which is contested in a court (and upon which there is a judgment) other than the Tax Court is the date upon which the judgment becomes final and will be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each particular case. For example, ordinarily a judgment of a United States district court becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed for taking an appeal, if no such appeal is duly taken within such time; and a judgment of the United States Court of Claims becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari if no such petition is duly filed within such time.
(iii) The date of a final determination by a closing agreement, made under section 7121, is the date such agreement is approved by the Commissioner.
(iv) A final determination under section 992(c) may be made by an agreement signed by the district director or director of the service center with which the corporation files its annual return or by such other official to
which authority to sign has been delegated, and by or on behalf of the taxpayer. The agreement shall set forth the total amount of the deficiency distribution to be paid to the shareholders of the DISC for the taxable year or years. An agreement under this subdivision shall be sent to the taxpayer at his last known address by either registered or certified mail. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2 of this chapter. If registered mail is used for such purpose, the date of registration is considered the date of final determination; if certified mail is used for such purpose, the date of postmark on the sender's receipt for such mail is considered the date of final determination. If the corporation makes a deficiency distribution before such registration or postmark date but on or after the date the district director or director of the service center or other official has signed the agreement, the date of signature by the district director or director of the service center or other official is considered the date of final determination. If the corporation makes a deficiency distribution before the district director or director of the service center or other official signs the agreement, the date of final determination is considered to be the date of the making of the deficiency distribution. During any extension of time the interest charge provided in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph will continue to accrue at the rate provided for in such subparagraph.
(4)
Payment of interest for delayed distribution
—(i)
In general.
If a corporation makes a deficiency distribution after the 15th day of the ninth month after the close of the taxable year with respect to which such distribution is made, such distribution will not be deemed to satisfy the 95 percent of gross receipts test or the 95 percent assets test for such year unless such corporation pays to the Internal Revenue Service a charge determined by multiplying (a) an amount equal to 4
1/2
percent of such distribution by (
b
) the number of its taxable years which begin (
1
) after the taxable year with respect to which the distribution is made and (
2
) before such distribution is made. Such charge must be paid, within the 30-day period beginning with the day on which such distribution is made, to the service center with which the corporation files its annual information return for its taxable year in which the distribution is made. For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, such charge is considered interest.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, meets the 95 percent assets test but fails to meet the 95 percent of gross receipts test for 1972 and does not by September 15, 1973, make the deficiency distribution required by reason of its failure to meet such test. Assume that reasonable cause exists for the corporation's failure to meet the 95 percent of gross receipts test and failure to make the required deficiency distribution. If X makes the required deficiency distribution, in the amount of $10,000, on April 1, 1976, X must pay on or before April 30, 1976, to the service center with which it files its annual information return a charge of $1,800, computed as follows:
Deficiency distribution made by X
$10,000
Multiplied by 4
1/2
percent
.045
Intermediate product
450
Multiplied by: Number of X's taxable years beginning after 1972 and before April 1, 1976
4
Charge to be paid service center because of late deficiency distribution (which is considered interest)
1,800
(d)
Certain distributions deemed for reasonable cause.
If a corporation makes a distribution in the amount required by paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a taxable year on or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the close of such year, it will be deemed to have acted with reasonable cause with respect to its failure to satisfy the 95 percent of gross receipts test, the 95 percent assets test, or both tests, for such year and its failure to make such distribution prior to the date on which the distribution was made if—
(1) At least 70 percent of the gross receipts of such corporation for such taxable year consist of qualified export receipts, and
(2) The sum of the adjusted bases of the qualified export assets held by such corporation on the last day of each
month of the taxable year equals or exceeds 70 percent of the sum of the adjusted bases of all assets held by the corporation on each such day.
[T.D. 7323, 39 FR 34407, Sept. 25, 1974; 39 FR 36009, Oct. 7, 1974, as amended by T.D. 7420, 41 FR 20655, May 20, 1976; T.D. 7854, 47 FR 51739, Nov. 17, 1982; T.D. 8939, 66 FR 2819, Jan. 12, 2001]
§ 1.992-4
Coordination with personal holding company provisions in case of certain produced film rents.
(a)
In general.
Section 992(d)(2) provides that a personal holding company is not eligible to be treated as a DISC. Section 543(a)(5)(B) provides that, for purposes of section 543, the term “produced film rents” means payments received with respect to an interest in a film for the use of, or the right to use, such film, but only to the extent that such interest was acquired before substantial completion of production of such film. Under section 992(e), if such produced film rents are included in the ordinary gross income (as defined in section 543(b)(1)) of a qualified subsidiary for a taxable year of such subsidiary, and such interest was acquired by such subsidiary from its parent, such interest is deemed (for purposes of the application of sections 541, 543(b)(1), and 992(d)(2), and § 1.992-1(f) for such taxable year) to have been acquired by such subsidiary at the time such interest was acquired by such parent. Thus, for example, if a parent acquires an interest in a film before it is substantially completed, then substantially completes such film prior to transferring an interest in such motion picture to a qualified subsidiary, the qualified subsidiary is considered as having acquired such interest prior to substantial completion of such motion picture for purposes of determining whether payments from the rental of such motion picture will be classified as produced film rents of such subsidiary. The provisions of section 992(e) and this section are not applicable in determining whether payments received with respect to an interest in a film are included in the ordinary gross income of a parent or a qualified subsidiary. Thus, even though a qualified subsidiary is treated pursuant to this section as having acquired an interest in a film at the time such interest was acquired by such subsidiary's parent, payments received by such parent with respect to such interest prior to the transfer of such interest to such subsidiary are includible in the ordinary gross income of such parent and not includible in the ordinary gross income of such subsidiary.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Qualified subsidiary.
For purposes of this section, a corporation is a qualified subsidiary for a taxable year if—
(i) Such corporation was established for the purpose of becoming a DISC,
(ii) Such corporation would qualify (or be treated) as a DISC for such taxable year if it is not a personal holding company, and
(iii) On every day of such taxable year on which shares of such corporation are outstanding, at least 80 percent of such shares are held directly by a second corporation.
(2)
Parent.
For purposes of this section, the term “parent” means a second corporation referred to in subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph.
[T.D. 7323, 39 FR 34409, Sept. 25, 1974]
§ 1.993-1
Definition of qualified export receipts.
(a)
In general.
For a corporation to qualify as a DISC, at least 95 percent of its gross receipts for a taxable year must consist of qualified export receipts. Under section 993(a), the term “qualified export receipts” means any of the eight amounts described in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section, except to the extent that any of the eight amounts is an excluded receipt within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section. For purposes of this section and §§ 1.993-2 through 1.993-6—
(1)
DISC.
All references to a DISC mean a DISC, except when the context indicates that such term means a corporation in the process of meeting the conditions necessary for that corporation to become a DISC, or a corporation being tested as to whether it qualifies as a DISC.
(2)
Sale, lease, and license.
The term “sale” includes an exchange or other disposition and the term “lease” includes a rental or a sublease. The term “license” includes a sublicense. All rules under this section and §§ 1.993-2
through 1.993-6 applicable to leases of export property apply in the same manner to licenses of export property. See § 1.993-3(f)(3) for a description of intangible property which cannot be export property.
(3)
Gross receipts.
The term “gross receipts” is defined by section 993(f) and § 1.993-6.
(4)
Qualified export assets.
The term “qualified export assets” is defined by section 993(b) and § 1.993-2.
(5)
Export property.
The term “export property” is defined by section 993(c) and § 1.993-3.
(6)
Related person.
The term “related person” means a person who is related to another person if either immediately before or after a transaction—
(i) The relationship between such persons would result in a disallowance of losses under section 267 (relating to disallowance of losses, etc., between related taxpayers), or section 707(b) (relating to losses disallowed, etc., between partners and controlled partnerships), and the regulations thereunder, or
(ii) Such persons are members of the same controlled group of corporations, as defined in section 1563(a) (relating to definition of controlled group of corporations), except that (
a
) “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a) and the regulations thereunder, and (
b
) the provisions of section 1563(b) shall not apply in determining whether such persons are members of the same controlled group.
(7)
Related supplier.
The term “related supplier” is defined by § 1.994-1(a)(3)(ii).
(8)
Controlled group.
The term “controlled group” is defined by paragraph (k) of this section.
(b)
Sales of export property.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC include gross receipts from the sale of export property by such DISC, or by any principal for whom such DISC acts as a commission agent (whether or not such principal is a related supplier), pursuant to the terms of a contract entered into with a purchaser by such DISC or by such principal at any time or by any other person and assigned to such DISC or such principal at any time prior to the shipment of such property to the purchaser. Any agreement, oral or written, which constitutes a contract at law, satisfies the contractual requirement of this paragraph. Gross receipts from the sale of export property, whenever received, do not constitute qualified export receipts unless the seller (or the corporation acting as commission agent for the seller) is a DISC at the time of the shipment of such property to the purchaser. For example, if a corporation which sells export property under the installment method is not a DISC for the taxable year in which the property is shipped to the purchaser, gross receipts from such sale do not constitute qualified export receipts for any taxable year of the corporation.
(c)
Leases of export property
—(1)
In general.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC include gross receipts from the lease of export property provided that—
(i) Such property is held by such DISC (or by a principal for whom such DISC acts as commission agent with respect to the lease) either as an owner or lessee at the beginning of the term of such lease, and
(ii) Such DISC qualified (or was treated) as a DISC for its taxable year in which the term of such lease began.
(2)
Prepayment of lease receipts.
If part or all of the gross receipts from a lease of property are prepaid, then—
(i) All such prepaid gross receipts are qualified export receipts of a DISC if it is reasonably expected at the time of such prepayment that throughout the term of such lease they would be qualified export receipts if received not as a prepayment; or
(ii) If it is reasonably expected at the time of such prepayment that throughout the term of such lease they would not be qualified export receipts if received not as a prepayment, then only those prepaid receipts, for the taxable years of the DISC for which they would be qualified export receipts, are qualified export receipts.
Thus, for example, if a lessee makes a prepayment of the first and last years' rent, and it is reasonably expected that the leased property will be export property for the first half of the lease period but not the second half of such period, the amount of the prepayment which represents the first year's rent
will be considered qualified export receipts if it would otherwise qualify, whereas the amount of the prepayment which represents the last year's rent will not be considered qualified export receipts.
(d)
Related and subsidiary services
—(1)
In general.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC include gross receipts from services furnished by such DISC which are related and subsidiary to any sale or lease (as described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section) of export property by such DISC or with respect to which such DISC acts as a commission agent, provided that such DISC derives qualified export receipts from such sale or lease. Such services may be performed within or without the United States.
(2)
Services furnished by DISC.
Services are considered to be furnished by a DISC for purposes of this paragraph if such services are provided by—
(i) The person who sold or lease the export property to which such services are related and subsidiary, provided that the DISC acts as a commission agent with respect to the sale or lease of such property and with respect to such services,
(ii) The DISC as principal, or any other person pursuant to a contract between such person and such DISC, provided the DISC acted as principal or commission agent with respect to the sale or lease of such property, or
(iii) A member of the same controlled group as the DISC where the sale or lease of the export property is made by another member of such controlled group provided, however, that the DISC act as principal or commission agent with respect to such sale or lease and as commission agent with respect to such services.
(3)
Related services.
A service is related to a sale or lease of export property if—
(i) Such service is of the type customarily and usually furnished with the type of transaction in the trade or business in which such sale or lease arose and
(ii) The contract to furnish such service—
(
a
) Is expressly provided for in or is provided for by implied warranty under the contract of sale or lease,
(
b
) Is entered into on or before the date which is 2 years after the date on which the contract under which such sale or lease was entered into, provided that the person described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph which is to furnish such service delivers to the purchaser or lessor a written offer or option to furnish such services on or before the date on which the first shipment of goods with respect to which the service is to be performed is delivered, or
(
c
) Is a renewal of the services contract described in (
a
) or (
b
) of this subdivision. Services which may be related to a sale or lease of export property include but are not limited to warranty service, maintenance service, repair service, and installation service. Transportation (including insurance related to such transportation) may be related to a sale or lease of export property, provided that the cost of such transportation is included in the sale price or rental of the property or, if such cost is separately stated, is paid by the DISC (or its principal) which sold or leased the property to the person furnishing the transportation service. Financing or the obtaining of financing for a sale or lease is not a related service for purposes of this paragraph.
(4)
Subsidiary services
—(i)
In general.
Services related to a sale or lease of export property are subsidiary to such sale or lease only if it is reasonably expected at the time of such sale or lease that the gross receipts from all related services furnished by the DISC (as defined in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph) will not exceed 50 percent of the sum of (a) the gross receipts from such sale or lease and (b) the gross receipts from related services furnished by the DISC (as described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph). In the case of a sale, reasonable expectations at the time of the sale are based on the gross receipts from all related services which may reasonably be expected to be performed at any time before the end of the 10-year period following the date of such-sale. In the case of a lease, reasonable expectations at the time of the lease are based on the gross receipts from all related services which may reasonably be expected to be performed at any time before the
end of the term of such lease (determined without regard to renewal options).
(ii)
Allocation of gross receipts from services.
In determining whether the services related to a sale or lease of export property are subsidiary to such sale or lease, the gross receipts to be treated as derived from the furnishing of services may not be less than the amount of gross receipts reasonably allocated to such services as determined under the facts and circumstances of each case without regard to whether—
(
a
) Such services are furnished under a separate contract or under the same contract pursuant to which such sale or lease occurs or
(
b
) The cost of such services is specified in the contract of sale or lease.
(iii)
Transactions involving more than one item of export property.
If more than one item of export property is sold or leased in a single transaction pursuant to one contract, the total gross receipts from such transaction and the total gross receipts from all services related to such transaction are each taken into account in determining whether such services are subsidiary to such transaction. However, the provisions of this subdivision apply only if such items could be included in the same product line, as determined under § 1.994-1(c)(7).
(iv)
Renewed service contracts.
If under the terms of a contract for related services, such contract is renewable within 10 years after a sale of export property, or during the term of a lease of export property, related services to be performed under the renewed contract are subsidiary to such sale or lease if it is reasonably expected at the time of such renewal that the gross receipts from all related services which have been and which are to be furnished by the DISC (as described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) will not exceed 50 percent of the sum of (
a
) the gross receipts from such sale or lease and (
b
) the gross receipts from related services furnished by the DISC (as so described). Reasonable expectations are determined as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(v)
Parts used in services.
In a services contract described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph provides for the furnishing of parts in connection with the furnishing of related services, gross receipts from the furnishing of such parts are not taken into account in determining whether under this subparagraph the services are subsidiary. See paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to determine whether the gross receipts from the furnishing of parts consitute qualified export receipts. See § 1.993-3(c)(2)(iv) and (e)(3) for rules regarding the treatment of such parts with respect to the manufacture of export property and the foreign content of such property, respectively.
(5)
Relation to leases.
If the gross receipts for services which are related and subsidiary to a lease of property have been prepaid at any time for all such services which are to be performed before the end of the term of such lease, then as of the time of the prepayment the rules in paragraph (c)(2) of this section (relating to prepayment of lease receipts) will determine whether prepaid services under this subdivision are qualified export receipts. Thus, for example if it is reasonably expected that leased property will be export property for the first year of the term of the lease but will not be export property for the second year of the term, prepaid gross receipts for related and subsidiary services to be furnished in the first year may be qualified export receipts. However, any prepaid gross receipts for such services to be furnished in the second year cannot be qualified export receipts.
(6)
Relation with export property determination.
The determination as to whether gross receipts from the sale or lease of export property constitute qualified export receipts does not depend upon whether services connected with such sale or lease are related and subsidiary to such sale or lease. Thus, for example, assume that a DISC receives gross receipts of $1,000 from the sale of export property and gross, receipts of $1,100 from installation and maintenance services which are to be furnished by such DISC within 10 years after the sale and which are related to such sale. The $1,100 which the DISC receives for such services would not be qualified export receipts since the gross receipts from the services exceed
50 percent of the sum of the gross receipts from the sale and the gross receipts from the related services furnished by such DISC. The $1,000 which the DISC receives from the sale of export property would, however, be a qualified export receipt if the sale met the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(e)
Gains from sales of certain qualified export assets.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC include gross receipts from the sale by such DISC of any assets (wherever located) which, as of the date of such sale, are qualified export assets as defined in § 1.993-2 even though such assets are not export property (as defined in § 1.993-3). Gross receipts are derived from the sale of such assets only where such sale results in recognized gain (see § 1.993-6(a)). For purposes of this paragraph, losses from the sale of such qualified export assets shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the DISC's qualified export receipts.
(f)
Dividends.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC for a taxable year include all dividends includible in the gross income of such DISC for such taxable year with respect to the stock of related foreign export corporations (as defined in § 1.993-5) and all amounts includible in the gross income of such DISC with respect to such corporations pursuant to section 951 (relating to amounts included in the gross income of U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations).
(g)
Interest on obligations which are qualified export assets.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC include interest on any obligation which is a qualified export asset of such DISC, including any amount includible in gross income as interest (such as, for example, an amount treated as original issue discount pursuant to section 1232) or as imputed interest under section 483. Gain from the sale of obligations described in this paragraph is treated (to the extent such gain is not treated as interest on such obligations) as qualified export receipts pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
(h)
Engineering and architectural services
—(1)
In general.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC include gross receipts from engineering services (as described in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph) or architectural services (as described in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph) or architectural services (as described in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph) furnished by such DISC (as described in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph) for a construction project (as defined in subparagraph (8) of this paragraph) located, or proposed for location, outside the United States. Such services may be performed within or without the United States.
(2)
Services included.
Engineering and architectural services include feasibility studies for a proposed construction project whether or not such project is ultimately initiated.
(3)
Excluded services.
Engineering and architectural services do not include—
(i) Services connected with the exploration for minerals or
(ii) Technical assistance or knowhow.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “technical assistance or knowhow” includes activities or programs designed to enable business, commerce, industrial establishments, and governmental organizations to acquire or use scientific, architectural, or engineering information.
(4)
Other services.
Receipts from the performance of construction activities other than engineering and architectural services constitute qualified export receipts to the extent that such activities are related and subsidiary services (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section) with respect to a sale or lease of export property.
(5)
Engineering services.
For purposes of this paragraph, engineering services in connection with any construction project (within the meaning of subparagraph (8) of this paragraph) include any professional services requiring engineering education, training, and experience and the application of special knowledge of the mathematical, physical, or engineering sciences to such professional services as consultation, investigation, evaluation, planning, design, or responsible supervision of construction for the purpose of assuring compliance with plans, specifications, and design.
(6)
Architectural services.
For purposes of this paragraph, architectural services include the offering or furnishing
of any professional services such as consultation, planning, aesthetic, and structural design, drawings and specifications, or responsible supervision of construction (for the purpose of assuring compliance with plans, specifications, and design) or erection, in connection with any construction project (within the meaning of subparagraph (8) of this paragraph).
(7)
Definition of “furnished by such DISC”.
For purposes of this paragraph, architectural and engineering services are considered furnished by a DISC if such services are provided—
(i) By the DISC,
(ii) By another person (whether or not a United States person) pursuant to a contract entered into by such person with the DISC at any time prior to the furnishing of such services, provided that the DISC acts as principal with respect to the furnishing of such services, or
(iii) By another person (whether or not a United States person) pursuant to a contract for the furnishing of such services entered into at any time prior to the furnishing of such services provided that the DISC acts as commission agent with respect to such services.
(8)
Definition of “construction project”.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “construction project” includes the erection, expansion, or repair (but not including minor remodeling or minor repairs) of new or existing buildings or other physical facilities including, for example, roads, dams, canals, bridges, tunnels, railroad, tracks, and pipelines. The term also includes site grading and improvement and installation of equipment necessary for the construction. Gross receipts from the sale or lease of construction equipment are not qualified export receipts unless such equipment is export property (as defined in § 1.993-3).
(i)
Managerial services
—(1)
In general.
Qualified export receipts of a first DISC for its taxable year include gross receipts from the furnishing of managerial services provided for another DISC, which is not a related person, to aid such unrelated DISC in deriving qualified export receipts, provided that at least 50 percent of the gross receipts of the first DISC for such year consists of qualified export receipts derived from the sale or lease of export property and the furnishing of related and subsidiary services, as described in paragraph (b), (c), and (d) of this section, respectively.
For purposes of this paragraph, managerial services are considered furnished by a DISC if such services are provided—
(i) By the first DISC,
(ii) By another person (whether or not a United States person) pursuant to a contract entered into by such person with the first DISC at any time prior to the furnishing of such services, provided that the first DISC acts as principal with respect to the furnishing of such services, or
(iii) By another person (whether or not a United States person) pursuant to a contract for the furnishing of such services entered into at any time prior to the furnishing of such services provided that the DISC acts as commission agent with respect to such services.
(2)
Definition of “managerial services.”
The term “managerial services” as used in this paragraph means activities relating to the operation of another unrelated DISC which derives qualified export receipts from the sale or lease of export property and from the furnishing of services related and subsidiary to such sales or leases. Such term includes staffing and operational services necessary to operate such other DISC, but does not include legal, accounting, scientific, or technical services. Examples of managerial services are: (i) Export market studies, (ii) making shipping arrangements, and (iii) contracting potential foreign purchasers.
(3)
Status of recipient of managerial services
—(i)
In general.
Qualified export receipts of a first DISC include receipts from the furnishing of managerial services during any taxable year of a recipient if such recipient qualifies as a DISC (within the meaning of § 1.992-1(a) for such taxable year.
(ii)
Recipient deemed to qualify as a DISC.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a recipient is deemed to qualify as a DISC for its taxable year if the first DISC obtains from
such recipient a copy of such recipient's election to be treated as a DISC as described in § 1.992-2(a) together with such recipient's sworn statement that such election has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center. The recipient may mark out the names of its shareholders on a copy of its election to be treated as a DISC before submitting it to the first DISC. The copy of the election and the sworn statement of such recipient must be received by the first DISC within 6 months after the beginning of the first taxable year of the recipient during which such first DISC furnishes managerial services for such recipient. The copy of the election and the sworn statement of the recipient need not be obtained by the first DISC for subsequent taxable years of the recipient.
(iii)
Recipient not treated as a DISC.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a recipient of managerial services is not treated as a DISC with respect to such services performed during a taxable year for which such recipient does not qualify as a DISC if the DISC performing such services does not believe or if a reasonable person would not believe (taking into account the furnishing DISC's managerial relationship with such recipient DISC) at the beginning of such taxable year that the recipient will qualify as a DISC for such taxable year.
(j)
Excluded receipts
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section, qualified export receipts of a DISC do not include any of the five amounts described in subparagraphs (2) through (6) of this paragraph.
(2)
Sales and leases of property for ultimate use in the United States.
Property which is sold or leased for ultimate use in the United States does not constitute export property. See § 1.993-3(d)(4) (relating to determination of where the ultimate use of the property occurs). Thus, qualified export receipts of a DISC described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section do not include gross receipts of the DISC from the sale or lease of such property.
(3)
Sales of export property accomplished by subsidy.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC do not include gross receipts described in paragraph (b) of this section if the sale of export property (whether or not such property consists of agricultural products) is pursuant to any of the following:
(i) The development loan program, or grants under the technical cooperation and development grants program of the Agency for International Development, or grants under the military assistance program administered by the Department of Defense, pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2151), unless the DISC shows to the satisfaction of the district director that, under the conditions existing at the time of the sale, the purchaser had a reasonable opportunity to purchase, on competitive terms and from a seller who was not a U.S. person, goods which were substantially identical to such property and which were not manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted (as described in § 1.993-3(c)) in the United States,
(ii) The Pub. L. 480 program authorized under title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1691, 1701-1710),
(iii) For taxable years ending before January 1, 1974, the Barter program of the Commodity Credit Corporation authorized by section 4(h) of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 714b(h)), and section 303 of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1692) but only if the taxpayer treats such sales as sales giving rise to excluded receipts,
(iv) The Export Payment program of the Commodity Credit Corporation authorized by sections 5(d) and (f) of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 714c (d) and (f)),
(v) The section 32 export payment programs authorized by section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935, as amended (7 U.S.C. 612c), and
(vi) For taxable years beginning after November 3, 1972, the Export Sales program of the Commodity Credit Corporation authorized by sections 5 (d) and (f) of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 714c (d) and (f)), other than the GSM-4 program provided under 7 CFR
part 1488, and section 407 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1427), for the purpose of disposing of surplus agricultural commodities and exporting or causing to be exported agricultural commodities, except that for taxable years beginning on or before November 3, 1972, the taxpayer may treat such sales as sales giving rise to excluded receipts.
(4)
Sales or lease of export property and furnishing of engineering or architectural services for use by the United States
—(i)
In general.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC do not include gross receipts described in paragraph (b), (c), or (h) of this section if a sale or lease of export property, or the furnishing of engineering or architectural services, is for use by the United States or an instrumentality thereof in any case in which any law or regulation requires in any manner the purchase or lease of property manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States or requires the use of engineering or architectural services performed by a U.S. person. For example, a sale by a DISC of export property to the Department of Defense for use outside the United States would not produce qualified export receipts for such DISC if the Department of Defense purchased such property from appropriated funds subject to any provisions of the Armed Services Procurement Regulations (32 CFR subchapter A, part 6, subpart A) or any appropriations act for the Department of Defense for the applicable year which restricts the availability of such appropriated funds to the procurement of items which are grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States.
(ii)
Direct or indirect sales or leases.
Any sale or lease of export property is for use by the United States or an instrumentality thereof is such property is sold or leased by a DISC (or by a principal for whom such DISC acts as commission agent) to—
(
a
) A person who is a related person with respect to such DISC or such principal and who sells or leases such property for use by the United States or an instrumentality thereof or
(
b
) A person who is not a related person with respect to such DISC or such principal if, at the time of such sale or lease, there is an agreement or understanding that such property will be sold or leased for use by the United States or an instrumentality thereof (or if a reasonable person would have known at the time of such sale or lease that such property would be sold or leased for use by the United States or an instrumentality thereof) within 3 years after such sale or lease.
(iii)
Excluded programs.
The provisions of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph do not apply in the case of a purchase by the United States or an instrumentality thereof if such purchase is pursuant to—
(
a
) The Foreign Military Sales Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2751
et seq.
), or a program under which the U.S. Government purchases property for resale, on commercial terms, to a foreign government or agency or instrumentality thereof, or
(
b
) A program (whether bilateral or multilateral) under which sales to the U.S. Government are open to international competitive bidding.
(5)
Services.
Qualified export receipts of a DISC do not include gross receipts described in paragraph (d) of this section (concerning related and subsidiary services) if the services from which such gross receipts are derived are related and subsidiary to the sale or lease of property which results in excluded receipts pursuant to this paragraph.
(6)
Receipts within controlled group
—(i)
In general.
Gross receipts of a corporation do not constitute qualified export receipts for any taxable year of such corporation if—
(
a
) At the time of the sale, lease, or other transaction resulting in such gross receipts, such corporation and the person from whom such receipts are directly or indirectly derived (whether or not such corporation and such person are the same person) are members of the same controlled group (as defined in paragraph (k) of this section) and
(
b
) Such corporation and such person each qualifies (or is treated under section 992(a)(2)) as a DISC for its taxable year in which its receipts arise.
Thus, for example, assume that R, S, X, and Y are members of the same controlled group and that X and Y are
DISC's. If R sells property to S and pays X a commission relating to that sale and if S sells the same property to an unrelated foreign party and pays Y a commission relating to that sale, the receipts received by X from the sale of such property by R to S will be considered to be derived from Y, a DISC which is a member of the same controlled group as X, and thus will not result in qualified export receipts to X. The receipts received by Y from the sale to an unrelated foreign party may, however, result in qualified export receipts to Y. For another example, if R and S both assign the commissions to X, receipts derived from the sale from R to S will be considered to be derived from X acting as commission agent for S and will not result in qualified export receipts to X. Receipts derived by X from the sale of property by S to an unrelated foreign party, may, however, constitute qualified export receipts.
(ii)
Leased property.
See § 1.993-3(f)(2) regarding property not constituting export property in certain cases where such property is leased to any corporation which is a member of the same controlled group as the lessor.
(k)
Definition of “controlled group”.
For purposes of sections 991 through 996 and the regulations thereunder, the term “controlled group” has the same meaning as is assigned to the term “controlled group of corporations” by section 1563(a), except that (1) the phrase “more than 50 percent” is substituted for the phrase “at least 80 percent” each place the latter phrase appears in section 1563(a), and (2) section 1563(b) shall not apply. Thus, for example, a foreign corporation subject to tax under section 881 may be a member of a controlled group. Furthermore, two or more corporations (including a foreign corporation) are members of a controlled group at any time such corporations meet the requirements of section 1563(a) (as modified by this paragraph).
(l)
DISC's entitlement to income
—(1)
Application of section 994.
A corporation which meets the requirements of § 1.992-1(a) to be treated as a DISC for a taxable year is entitled to income, and the intercompany pricing rules of section 994(a)(1) or (2) apply, in the case of any transactions described in § 1.994-1(b) between such DISC and its related supplier (as defined in § 1.994-1(a)(3)). For purposes of this subparagraph, such DISC need not have employees or perform any specific function.
(2)
Other transactions.
In the case of a transaction to which the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph do not apply but from which a DISC derives gross receipts, the income to which the DISC is entitled as a result of the transaction is determined pursuant to the terms of the contract for such transaction and, if applicable, section 482 and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P Corporation forms S Corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary. S qualifies as a DISC for its taxable year. S has no employees on its payroll. S is granted a franchise with respect to specified exports of P. P will sell such exports to S for resale by S. Such exports are of a type which produce qualified export receipts as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. P's sales force will solicit orders in the name of S using S's order forms. S places orders with P only when S itself has received orders. No inventory is maintained by S. P makes shipments directly to customers of S. Employees of P will act for S and billings and collections will be handled by P in the name of S. Under these facts, the income derived by S for such taxable year from the purchase and resale of the specified export is treated for Federal income tax purposes as the income of S, and the amount of income allocable to S will be determined under section 994 of the Code.

# Example 2.
P Corporation forms S Corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary. S qualifies as a DISC for its taxable year. S has no employees on its payroll. S is granted a sales franchise with respect to specified exports of P and will receive commissions with respect to such exports. Such exports are of a type which will produce gross receipts for S which are qualified export receipts as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. P's sales force will solicit orders in the name of P. Billings and collections are handled directly by P. Under these facts, the commissions paid to S for such taxable year with respect to the specified exports shall be treated for Federal income tax purposes as the income of S, and the amount of income allocable to S is determined under section 994 of the Code.
[T.D. 7514, 42 FR 55454, Oct. 17, 1977; 42 FR 60910, Nov. 30, 1977, as amended by T.D. 7854, 47 FR 51739, Nov. 17, 1982]
§ 1.993-2
Definition of qualified export assets.
(a)
In general.
For a corporation to qualify as a DISC, at the close of its taxable year it must have qualified export assets with adjusted bases equal to at least 95 percent of the sum of the adjusted bases of all its assets. An asset which is a qualified export asset under more than one paragraph of this section shall be taken into account only once in determining the sum of the adjusted bases of all qualified export assets. Under section 993(b), the qualified export assets held by a corporation are—
(1) Export property as defined in § 1.993-3 (see paragraph (b) of this section),
(2) Business assets described in paragraph (c) of this section,
(3) Trade receivables described in paragraph (d) of this section,
(4) Temporary investments to the extent described in paragraph (e) of this section,
(5) Producer's loans as defined in § 1.993-4 (see paragraph (f) of this section),
(6) Stock or securities (described in paragraph (g) of this section) of related foreign export corporations as defined in § 1.993-5,
(7) Export-Import Bank and other obligations described in paragraph (h) of this section,
(8) Financing obligations described in paragraph (i) of this section, and
(9) Funds awaiting investment described in paragraph (j) of this section.
(b)
Export property.
In general, export property is certain property held for sale or lease which meets the requirements of § 1.993-3.
(c)
Business assets.
For purposes of this section, business assets are assets used by a DISC (other than as a lessor) primarily in connection with—
(1) The sale, lease, storage, handling, transportation, packaging, assembly, or servicing of export property, or
(2) The performance of engineering or architectural services (described in § 1.993-1(h)) or managerial services (described in § 1.993-1(i)) in furtherance of the production of qualified export receipts.
Assets used primarily in the manufacture, production, growth, or extraction (within the meaning of § 1.993-3(c)) of property are not business assets.
(d)
Trade receivables
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, trade receivables are accounts receivable and evidences of indebtedness which arise by reason of transactions of such corporation or of another corporation which is a DISC and which is a member of a controlled group which includes such corporation described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (G), or (H), of section 993(a)(1) and which are due the DISC (or, if it acts as an agent, due its principal) and held by the DISC.
(2)
Trade receivables representing commissions.
If a DISC acts as commission agent for a principal in a transaction described in § 1.993-1 (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), or (i) which results in qualified export receipts for the DISC, and if an account receivable or evidence of indebtedness held by the DISC and representing the commission payable to the DISC as a result of the transaction arises (and, in the case of an evidence of indebtedness, designated on its face as representing such commission), such account receivable or evidence of indebtedness shall be treated as a trade receiveable. If, however, the principal is a related supplier (as defined in § 1.994-1(a)(3)) with respect to the DISC, such account receivable or evidence of indebtedness will not be treated as a trade receivable unless it is payable and paid in a time and manner which satisfy the requirements of § 1.994-1(e)(3) or (5) (relating to initial payment of transfer price or commission and procedure for adjustments to transfer price or commission, respectively), as the case may be. However, see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for rules regarding certain accounts receivable representing commissions payable to a DISC by its related supplier.
(3)
Indebtedness arising under § 1.994-1(e).
An indebtedness arising under § 1.994-1(e)(3)(iii) (relating to initial payment of transfer price or commission) in favor of a DISC is not a qualified export asset. An indebtedness arising under § 1.994-1(e)(5)(i) (relating to procedure for adjustments to transfer price or commission) in favor of a DISC is a trade receivable if it is paid in the time and manner described in § 1.994-
1(e)(5)(i) and (ii) and if it otherwise satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If such an indebtedness is not paid in the time and manner described in § 1.994-1(e)(5)(i) and (ii), it is not a qualified export asset.
(e)
Temporary investments
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, temporary investments are money, bank deposits (not including time deposits of more than 1 year), and other similar temporary investments to the extent maintained by a DISC as reasonably necessary to meet its requirements for working capital. For purposes of this paragraph, a temporary investment is an obligation, including an evidence of indebtedness as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, which is a demand obligation or has a period remaining to maturity of not more than 1 year at the date it is acquired by the DISC. A temporary investment does not include trade receivables.
(2)
Determination of amount of working capital maintained.
For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) The working capital of a DISC is the excess of its current assets over current liabilities.
(ii) Current assets are cash and other assets (other than trade receivables) which may reasonably be expected to be converted into cash or sold or consumed during the current normal operating cycle of the DISC's trade or business.
(iii) Current liabilities are obligations (or portions of obligations) due within the current normal operating cycle of the trade or business of the DISC whose satisfaction when due is reasonably expected to require the use of current assets.
(iv) Generally accepted financial accounting treatments will be accepted, and
(v) Current assets (other than temporary investments) are taken into account before temporary investments, and trade receivables are never taken into account, in determining whether such temporary investments are maintained by the DISC as reasonably necessary to meet his current liabilities and its requirements for working capital.
(3)
Determination of amount of working capital reasonably required.
For purposes of this paragraph, a determination of the amount of money, bank deposits, and other similar temporary investments reasonably necessary to meet the requirements of the DISC for working capital will depend upon the nature and volume of the activities of the DISC existing at the end of the DISC's taxable year for which such determination is made, such as, for example—
(i) In the case of a DISC which purchases and sells inventory, the amount of working capital reasonably required is limited to an amount reasonably necessary to meet the ordinary operating expenses during the current normal operating cycle of the trade or business of the DISC, an amount reasonably needed to meet specific and definite plans for expansion and any amounts necessary for reasonably anticipated extraordinary business expenses.
(ii) In the case of a DISC which actively conducts a trade or business (including the employment of a sales force) and receives commissions in respect of goods to which such DISC does not have title, the amount of working capital required will depend upon the nature and volume of the activities of the DISC which produce such income as they exist on the applicable determination date. In determining the amount of working capital which is reasonably required for the production of such income, the anticipated future needs of the business will be taken into account to the extent that such needs relate to the year of the DISC following the applicable determination date. Anticipated future needs relating to a later period will not be taken into account unless it is clearly established that such needs are reasonably related to the production of such income as of the applicable determination date.
(iii) In the case of a DISC which does not actively conduct a trade or business, and which receives commissions solely by reason of section 994(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b) with respect to goods to which such DISC does not have title, no working capital would be required beyond a de minimis amount unless it appears from the facts and circumstances that additional working capital will be required.
(iv) In the case of a DISC deriving income from the leasing of property, the amount of working capital required will be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances in such case.
(4)
Relationship of working capital to other qualified export assets.
If a temporary investment is a qualified export asset under any provision of this section (other than this paragraph), this paragraph shall not affect its status as a qualified export asset. However, any such temporary investment is taken into account before other temporary investments in determining whether such other temporary investments are maintained by a DISC as reasonably necessary to meet its requirements for working capital. Current assets (other than temporary investments) are taken into account before temporary investments, and trade receivables are never taken into account, in determining whether such temporary investments are maintained by the DISC as reasonably necessary requirements for working capital. An obligation issued or incurred by a member of a controlled group (as defined in § 1.993-1(k)) of which the DISC is a member is not a qualified export asset under this paragraph. For rules regarding working capital as of the end of each month of a taxable year for purposes of the 70-percent reasonableness standard with respect to certain deficiency distributions, see paragraph (j)(3) of this section.
(f)
Producer's loans.
For purposes of this section, a producer's loan is an evidence of indebtedness arising in connection with producer's loans which are made by a DISC and which meet the requirements of § 1.993-4. If a producer's loan is a qualified export asset, interest accrued with respect to the producer's loan will also be treated as a qualified export asset provided that payment is made in the form of money, property (valued at its fair market value on its date of transfer and including accounts receivable for sales by or through a DISC), a written obligation which qualifies as a debt under the safe harbor rule of § 1.992-1(d)(2)(ii), or an accounting entry offsetting the account receivable against an existing debt owed by the person in whose favor the account receivable was established to the person with whom it engaged in the transaction and that payment is made no later than 60 days following the close of the taxable year of accrual of the interest. This paragraph (f) is effective for taxable years beginning after January 10, 1985 except that the taxpayer may at its option apply the provisions of this paragraph to taxable years ending after December 31, 1971.
(g)
Stock or securities of related foreign corporations.
For purposes of this section, the term “stock or securities”, with respect to a related foreign export corporation (as defined in § 1.993-5), has the same meaning as such term has as used in section 351 (relating to transfers to controlled corporations), except that the term “securities” does not include obligations which are repaid, in whole or in part, at any time during the taxable year of the DISC following the taxable year of the DISC during which such obligations were acquired by the DISC or were issued, unless the DISC demonstrates to the satisfaction of the district director that the repayment was for bona fide business purposes and not for the purpose of avoidance of Federal income taxes.
(h)
Export-Import Bank obligations.
For purposes of this section, the term “Export-Import Bank obligations” means obligations issued, guaranteed, insured, or reinsured (in whole or in part) by the Export-Import Bank of the United States or by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association, but only if such obligations are acquired by the DISC—
(1) From the Export-Import Bank of the United States,
(2) From the Foreign Credit Insurance Association, or
(3) From the person selling or purchasing the goods or services by reason of which such obligations arose, or from any corporation which is a member of the same controlled group (as defined in § 1.993-1(k)) as such person.
For purposes of this paragraph, obligations issued by a person described in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph are treated as acquired from such person by the DISC if acquired from any person not more than 90 days after the date of original issue (as defined in § 1.1232-3(b)(3)). Examples of specific types of Export-Import Bank obligations include debentures issued
by such bank and certificates of loan participation.
(i)
Financing obligations.
For purposes of this section, financing obligations are obligations (held by a DISC) of a domestic corporation organized solely for the purpose of financing sales of export property pursuant to an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States under which such corporation makes export loans guaranteed by such Bank.
(j)
Funds awaiting investment
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, subject to the limitation descibed in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if, at the close of a DISC's taxable year, the sum of the DISC's money, bank deposits, and other similar temporary investments is determined under paragraph (e) of this section to exceed an amount reasonably necessary to meet the DISC's requirements for working capital, the amount of the DISC's bank deposits in the United States to the extent of the amount of this excess are funds awaiting investment at the close of such taxable year.
(2)
Limitation.
Bank deposits described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are funds awaiting investment only if, by the last day of each of the sixth, seventh, and eighth months after the close of such taxable year, the sum of the adjusted bases of the qualified export assets of the DISC (other than such bank deposits) equals or exceeds 95 percent of the sum of the adjusted bases of all assets of the DISC (including such bank deposits) it held on the last day of such taxable year. For purposes of this subparagraph, the adjusted bases of assets of a DISC are determined as of the end of each of the months referred to in this subparagraph. Funds awaiting investment as described in this paragraph need not be traceable to any of the qualified export assets held by the DISC at the end of any of the months referred to in this subparagraph.
(3)
Coordination with certain deficiency distribution provisions.
Under section 992(c)(3) and § 1.992-3(d) a deficiency distribution made on or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the end of a corporation's taxable year is deemed to be for reasonable cause if certain requirements are met, including the requirement (described in section 992(c)(3)(B) and § 1.992-3(d)(2)) that the sum of the adjusted bases of the qualified export assets held by the corporation on the last day of each month of such year equals or exceeds 70 percent of the sum of the adjusted bases of all assets held by the corporation on each such last day. If, on any such last day, the sum or a DISC's money, bank deposits, and other similar temporary investments is determined under paragraph (e) of this section to exceed an amount reasonably necessary to meet the DISC's requirements for working capital, the amount of the DISC's bank deposits to the extent of the amount of this excess are funds awaiting investment on such last day, if either—
(i) The requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are satisfied with respect to the taxable year of the DISC which includes such month or
(ii) At the close of such taxable year the sum of the DISC's money, bank deposits, and other similar temporary investments is determined under paragraph (e) of this section not to exceed an amount reasonably necessary to meet the DISC's requirements for working capital.

§ 1.993-3
Definition of export property.
(a)
General rule.
Under section 993(c), except as otherwise provided with respect to excluded property in paragraph (f) of this section and with respect to certain short supply property in paragraph (i) of this section, export property is property in the hands of any person (whether or not a DISC)—
(1) Manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States by any person or persons other than a DISC (see paragraph (c) of this section),
(2) Held primarily for sale or lease in the ordinary course of a trade or business to any person for direct use, consumption, or disposition outside the
United States (see paragraph (d) of this section),
(3) Not more than 50 percent of the fair market value of which is attributable to articles imported into the United States (see paragraph (e) of this section), and
(4) Which is not sold or leased by a DISC, or with a DISC as commission agent, to another DISC which is a member of the same controlled group (as defined in § 1.993-1(k)) as the DISC.
(b)
Services.
For purposes of this section, services (including the written communication of services in any form) are not export property. Whether an item is property or services shall be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances attending the development and disposition of the item. Thus, for example, the preparation of a map of a particular construction site would constitute services and not export property, but standard maps prepared for sale to customers generally would not constitute services and would be export property if the requirements of this section were otherwise met.
(c)
Manufacture, production, growth, or extraction of property
—(1)
By a person other than a DISC.
Export property may be manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States by any person, provided that such person does not qualify (and is not treated) as a DISC. Property held by a DISC which was manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted by it at a time when it did not qualify (and was not treated) as a DISC is not export property of the DISC. Property which sustains further manufacture or production outside the United States prior to sale or lease by a person but after manufacture or production in the United States will not be considered as manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States by such person.
(2)
Manufactured or produced
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, property which is sold or leased by a person is considered to be manufactured or produced by such person if such property is manufactured or produced (within the meaning of either subdivision (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this subparagraph) by such person or by another person pursuant to a contract with such person. Except as provided in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, manufacture or production of property does not include assembly or packaging operations with respect to property.
(ii)
Substantial transformation.
Property is manufactured or produced by a person if such property is substantially transformed by such person. Examples of substantial transformation of property would include the conversion of woodpulp to paper, steel rods to screws and bolts, and the canning of fish.
(iii)
Operations generally considered to constitute manufacturing.
Property is manufactured or produced by a person if the operations performed by such person in connection with such property are substantial in nature and are generally considered to constitute the manufacture or production of property.
(iv)
Value added to property.
Property is manufactured or produced by a person if with respect to such property conversion costs (direct labor and factory burden including packaging or assembly) of such person account for 20 percent of more of—
(
a
) The cost of goods sold or inventory amount of such person for such property is such property is sold or held for sale, or
(
b
) The adjusted basis of such person for such property, as determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1011, if such property is held for lease or leased.
The value of parts provided pursuant to a services contract, as described in § 1.993-1 (d)(4)(v), is not taken into account in applying this subdivision.
(d)
Primary purpose of which property is held
—(1)
In general
—(i)
General rule.
Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, export property (
a
) must be held primarily for the purpose of sale or lease in the ordinary course of trade or business to a DISC, or to any other person, and (
b
) such sale or lease must be for direct use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States. Thus, property cannot qualify as export property unless it is sold or leased for direct use, consumption or disposition outside the United States. Property is sold or leased for direct use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States if such sale or lease satisfies the destination test described in subparagraph (2)
of this paragraph, the proof of compliance requirements described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, and the use outside the United States test described in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(ii)
Factors not taken into account.
In determining whether property which is sold or leased to a DISC is sold or leased for direct use consumption, or disposition outside the United States, the fact that the acquiring DISC holds the property in inventory or for lease prior to the time it sells or leases it for direct use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States will not affect the characterization of the property as export property. Export property need not be physically segregated from other property.
(2)
Destination test.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the destination test in this subparagraph is satisfied with respect to property sold or leased by a seller or lessor only if it is delivered by such seller or lessor (or an agent of such seller or lessor) regardless of the F.O.B. point or the place at which title passes or risk of loss shifts from the seller or lessor—
(
a
) Within the United States to a carrier or freight forwarder for ultimate delivery outside the United States to a purchaser or lessee (or to a subsequent purchaser or sublessee),
(
b
) Within the United States to a purchaser or lessee, if such property is ultimately delivered, directly used, or directly consumed outside the United States (including delivery to a carrier or freight forwarder for delivery outside the United States) by the purchaser or lessee (or a subsequent purchaser or sublessee) within 1 year after such sale or lease,
(
c
) Within or outside the United States to a purchaser or lessee which, at the time of the sale or lease, is a DISC and is not a member of the same controlled group (as defined in § 1.993-1(k)) as the seller or lessor,
(
d
) From the United States to the purchaser or lessee (or a subsequent purchaser or sublessee) at a point outside the United States by means of a ship, aircraft, or other delivery vehicle, owned, leased, or chartered by the seller or lessor,
(
e
) Outside the United States to a purchaser or lessee from a warehouse, a storage facility, or assembly site located outside the United States, if such property was previously shipped by such seller or lessor from the United States, or
(
f
) Outside the United States to a purchaser or lessee if such property was previously shipped by such seller or lessor from the United States and if such property is located outside the United States pursuant to a prior lease by the seller or lessor, and either (
1
) such prior lease terminated at the expiration of its term (or by the action of the prior lessee acting alone), (
2
) the sale occurred or the term of the subsequent lease began after the time at which the term of the prior lease would have expired, or (
3
) the lessee under the subsequent lease is not a related person (as defined in § 1.993-1(a)(6)) with respect to the lessor and the prior lease was terminated by the action of the lessor (acting alone or together with the lessee).
(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph (other than (
c
) and (
f
)(
3
) of subdivision (i) thereof), any relationship between the seller or lessor and any purchaser, subsequent purchaser, lessee, or sublessee is immaterial.
(iii) In no event is the destination test of this subparagraph satisfied with respect to property which is subject to any use (other than a resale or sublease), manufacture, assembly, or other processing (other than packaging) by any person between the time of the sale or lease by such seller or lessor and the delivery or ultimate delivery outside the United States described in this subparagraph.
(iv) If property is located outside the United States at the time it is purchased by a person or leased by a person as lessee, such property may be export property in the hands of such purchaser or lessee only if it is imported into the United States prior to its further sale or lease (including a sublease) outside the United States. Paragraphs (a)(3) and (e) of this section (relating to 50 percent foreign content test) are applicable in determining whether such property is export property. Thus, for example, if such property is not subjected to manufacturing or production
(as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) within the United States after such importation, it does not qualify as export property.
(3)
Proof of compliance with destination test
—(i)
Delivery outside the United States.
For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (other than subdivision (i)(
c
) thereof), a seller or lessor shall establish ultimate delivery, use, or consumption of property outside the United States by providing—
(
a
) A facsimile or carbon copy of the export bill of lading issued by the carrier who delivers the property,
(
b
) A certificate of an agent or representative of the carrier disclosing delivery of the property outside the United States,
(
c
) A facsimile or carbon copy of the certificate of lading for the property executed by a customs officer of the country to which the property is delivered,
(
d
) If such country has no customs administration, a written statement by the person to whom delivery outside the United States was made,
(
e
) A facsimile or carbon copy of the shipper's export declaration, a monthly shipper's summary declaration filed with the Bureau of Customs, or a magnetic tape filed in lieu of the Shipper's Export Declaration, covering the property,
(
f
) Any other proof (including evidence as to the nature of the property or the nature of the transaction) which establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the property was ultimately delivered, or directly sold, or directly consumed outside the United States within 1 year after the sale or lease.
(ii) The requirements of subdivision (i) (
a
), (
b
), (
c
), or (
e
) of this subparagraph will be considered satisfied even though the name of the ultimate consignee and the price paid for the goods is marked out provided that, in the case of a Shipper's Export Declaration or other document listed in such subdivision (
e
) or a document such as an export bill of lading such document still indicates the country in which delivery to the ultimate consignee is to be made and, in the case of a certificate of an agent or representative of the carrier, that such document indicates that the property was delivered outside the United States.
(iii) A seller or lessor shall also establish the meeting of the requirement of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph (other than subdivision (
c
) thereof), that the property was delivered outside the United States without further use, manufacture, assembly, or other processing within the United States.
(iv)
Sale or lease to an unrelated DISC.
For purposes of subparagraph (2)(i)(
c
) of this paragraph, a purchaser or lessee of property is deemed to qualify as a DISC for its taxable year if the seller or lessor obtains from such purchaser or lessee a copy of such purchaser's or lessee's election to be treated as a DISC as described in § 1.992-2(a) together with such purchaser's or lessee's sworn statement that such election has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center. The copy of the election and the sworn statement of such purchaser or lessee must be received by the seller or lessor within 6 months after the sale or lease. A purchaser or lessee is not treated as a DISC with respect to a sale or lease during a taxable year for which such purchaser or lessee does not qualify as a DISC if the seller or lessor does not believe or if a reasonable person would not believe at the time such sale or lease is made that the purchaser or lessee will qualify as a DISC for such taxable year.
(v)
Failure of proof.
If a seller or lessor fails to provide proof of compliance with the destination test as required by this subparagraph, the property sold or leased is not export property.
(4)
Sales and leases of property for ultimate use in the United States
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the use test in this subparagraph is satisfied with respect to property which—
(
a
) Under subdivisions (ii) through (iv) of this subparagraph is not sold for ultimate use in the United States or
(
b
) Under subdivision (v) of this subparagraph is leased for ultimate use outside the United States.
(ii)
Sales of property for ultimate use in the United States.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a purchaser of property (including components, as defined in subdivision (vii) of this subparagraph) is deemed to use
such property ultimately in the United States if any of the following conditions exists:
(
a
) Such purchaser is a related person (as defined in § 1.993-1(a)(6)) with respect to the seller and such purchaser ultimately uses such property, or a second product into which such property is incorporated as a component, in the United States.
(
b
) At the time of the sale, there is an agreement or understanding that such property, or a second product into which such property is incorporated as a component, will be ultimately used by the purchaser in the United States.
(
c
) At the time of the sale, a reasonable person would have believed that such property or such second product would be ultimately used by such purchaser in the United States unless, in the case of a sale of components, the fair market value of such components at the time of delivery to the purchaser constitutes less than 20 percent of the fair market value of the second product into which such components are incorporated (determined at the time of completion of the production, manufacture or assembly of such second product).
For purposes of (b) of this subdivision, there is an agreement or understanding that property will ultimately be used in the United States if, for example, a component is sold abroad under an express agreement with the foreign purchaser that the component is to be incorporated into a product to be sold back to the United States. As a further example there would also be such an agreement or understanding if the foreign purchaser indicated at the time of the sale or previously that the component is to be incorporated into a product which is designed principally for the United States market. However, such an agreement or understanding does not result from the mere fact that a second product, into which components exported from the United States have been incorporated and which is sold on the world market, is sold in substantial quantities in the United States.
(iii)
Use in the United States.
For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, property (including components incorporated into a second product) is or would be ultimately used in the United States by such purchaser if, at any time within 3 years after the purchase of such property or components, either such property or components (or the second product into which such components are incorporated) is resold by such purchaser for use by a subsequent purchaser within the United States or such purchaser or subsequent purchaser fails, for any period of 365 consecutive days, to use such property or second product predominantly outside the United States as defined in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph).
(iv)
Sales to retailers.
For purposes of subdivision (ii)(
c
) of this subparagraph, property sold to any person whose principal business consists of selling from inventory to retail customers at retail outlets ouside the United States will be considered as property for ultimate use outside the United States.
(v)
Leases of property for ultimate use outside the United States.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph a lessee of property is deemed to use such property ultimately outside the United States during a taxable year of the lessor if such property is used predominantly outside the United States (as defined in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph) by the lessee during the portion of the lessor's taxable year which is included within the term of the lease. A determination as to whether the ultimate use of leased property satisfies the requirements of this subdivision is made for each taxable year of the lessor. Thus, leased property may be used predominantly outside the United States for a taxable year of the lessor (and thus, constitute export property if the remaining requirements of this section are met) even if the property is not used predominantly outside the United States in earlier taxable years or later taxable years of the lessor.
(vi)
Predominant use outside the United States.
For purposes of this subparagraph, property is used predominantly outside the United States for any period if, during such period, such property is located outside the United States more than 50 percent of the time. An aircraft, railroad rolling stock, vessel, motor vehicle, container,
or other property used for transportation purposes in deemed to be used predominantly outside the United States for any period if, during such period, either such property is located outside the United States more than 50 percent of the time or more than 50 percent of the miles traversed in the use of such property are traversed in outside the United States. However, any such property is deemed to be within the United States at all times during which it is engaged in transport between any two points within the United States, except where such transport constitutes uninterrupted international air transportation within the meaning of section 4262(c)(3) and the regulations thereunder (relating to tax on air transportation of persons). For purposes of applying section 4262(c)(3) to this subdivision, the term “United States” has the same meaning as in § 1.993-7.
(vii)
Component.
For purposes of this subparagraph, a component is property which is (or is reasonably expected to be) incorporated into a second product by the purchaser of such component by means of production, manufacture, or assembly.
(e)
Foreign content of property
—(1)
The 50 percent test.
Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, no more than 50 percent of the fair market value of export property may be attributable to the fair market value of articles which were imported into the United States. For purposes of this paragraph, articles imported into the United States are referred to as “foreign content”. The fair market value of the foreign content of export property is computed in accordance with subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. The fair market value of export property which is sold to a person who is not a related person with respect to the seller is the sale price for such property (not including interest finance or carrying charges, or similar charges)
(2)
Application of 50 percent test.
The 50 percent test described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is applied on an item-by-item basis If, however, a person sells or leases a substantial volume of substantially identical export property in a taxable year and if all of such property contains substantially identical foreign content is substantially the same proportion, such person may determine the portion of foreign content contained in such property on an aggregate basis.
(3)
Parts and services.
If, at the time property is sold or leased the seller or lessor agrees to furnish parts pursuant to a services contract (as provided in § 1.993-1(d)(4)(v)) and the price for the parts is not separately stated, the 50 percent test described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is applied on an aggregate basis to the property and parts. If the price for the parts is described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is applied separately to the property and to the parts.
(4)
Computation of foreign content
—(i)
Valuation.
For purposes of applying the 50 percent test described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, it is necessary to determine the fair market value of all articles which constitute foreign content of the property being tested to determine if it is export property. The fair market value of such imported articles is determined as of the time such articles are imported into the United States. With respect to articles imported into the United States before July 1, 1980, the fair market value of such articles is their appraised value as determined under section 402 or 402a of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a or 1402) in connection with their importation. With respect to articles imported into the United States on or after July 1, 1980, the fair market value of such articles is their appraised value as determined under section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a) in connection with their importation. The appraised value of such articles is the full dutiable value of such articles, determined, however, without regard to any special provision in the United States tariff laws which would result in a lower dutiable value. Thus, an article which is imported into the United States is treated as entirely imported even if all or a portion of such article was originally manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States.
(ii)
Evidence of fair market value.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the fair market value of imported articles constituting foreign
content may be evidenced by the customs invoice issued on the importation of such articles into the United States. If the holder of such articles is not the importer (or a related person with respect to the importer), the fair market value of such articles may be evidenced by a certificate based upon information contained in the customs invoice and furnished to the holder by the person from whom such articles (or property incorporating such articles) were purchased. If a customs invoice or certificate described in the preceding sentence is not available to a person purchasing property, such person shall establish that no more than 50 percent of the fair market value of such property is attributable to the fair market value of articles which were imported into the United States.
(iii)
Interchangeable component articles.
(
a
) Where identical or similar component articles can be incorporated interchangeably into property and a person acquires some such component articles that are imported into the United States and other such component articles that are not imported into the United States, the determination whether imported component articles were incorporated in such property as is exported from the United States shall be made on a substitution basis as in the case of the rules relating to drawback accounts under the customs laws. See section 313(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(b)).
(
b
) The provisions of (
a
) of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Assume that a manufacturer produces a total of 20,000 electronic devices. The manufacturer exports 5,000 of the devices and subsequently sells 11,000 of the devices to a DISC which exports the 11,000 devices. The major single component article in each device is a tube which represents 60 percent of the fair market value of the device at the time the device is sold by the manufacturer. The manufacturer imports 8,000 of the tubes and produces the remaining 12,000 tubes. For purposes of this subdivision, in accordance with the substitution principle used in the customs drawback laws, the 5,000 devices exported by the manufacturer are each treated as containing an imported tube because the devices were exported prior to the sale to the DISC. The remaining 3,000 imported tubes are treated as being contained in the first 3,000 devices purchased and exported by the DISC. Thus, since the 50 percent test is not met with respect to the first 3,000 devices purchased and exported by the DISC, those devices are not export property. The remaining 8,000 devices purchased and exported by the DISC are treated as containing tubes produced in United States, and those devices are export property (if they otherwise meet the requirements of this section).
(f)
Excluded property
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the following property is not export property—
(i) Property described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (relating to property leased to a member of a controlled group),
(ii) Property described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (relating to certain types of intangible property),
(iii) Products described in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to depletable products), and
(iv) Products described in paragraph (h) of this section (relating to certain export controlled products).
(2)
Property leased to member of controlled group
—(i)
In general.
Property leased to a person (whether or not a DISC) which is a member of the same controlled group (as defined in § 1.993-1(k)) as the lessor constitutes export property for any period of time only if during the period—
(
a
) Such property is held for sublease, or is subleased, by such person to a third person for the ultimate use of such third person;
(
b
) Such third person is not a member of the same controlled group; and
(
c
) Such property is used predominantly outside the United States by such third person.
(ii)
Predominant use.
The provisions of paragraph (d)(4)(vi) of this section apply in determining under subdivision (i)(
c
) of this subparagraph whether such property is used predominently outside the United States by such third person.
(iii)
Leasing rule.
For purposes of this subparagraph, leased property is deemed to be ultimately used by a member of the same controlled group as the lessor if such property is leased to a person which is not a member of such controlled group but which subleases such property to a person which is a member of such controlled group.
Thus, for example, if X, a DISC for the taxable year, leases a movie film to Y, a foreign corporation which is not a member of the same controlled group as X, and Y then subleases the film to persons which are members of such group for showing to the general public, the film is not export property. On the other hand, if X, a DISC for the taxable year, leases a movie film to Z, a foreign corporation which is a member of the same controlled group as X, and Z then subleases the film to Y, another foreign corporation, which is not a member of the same controlled group for showing to the general public, the film is not disqualified under this subparagraph from being export property.
(iv)
Certain copyrights.
With respect to a copyright which is not excluded by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from being export property, the ultimate use of such property is the sale or exhibition of such property to the general public. Thus, if A, a DISC for the taxable year, leases recording tapes to B, a foreign corporation which is a member of the same controlled group as A, and if B makes records from the recording tape and sells the records to C, another foreign corporation, which is not a member of the same controlled group, for sale by C to the general public, the recording tape is not disqualified under this subparagraph from being export property, notwithstanding the leasing of the recording tape by A to a member of the same controlled group, since the ultimate use of the tape is the sale of the records (
i.e.,
property produced from the recording tape).
(3)
Intangible property.
Export property does not include any patent, invention, model, design, formula, or process, whether or not patented, or any copyright (other than films, tapes, records, or similar reproductions, for commercial or home use), goodwill, trademark, tradebrand, franchise, or other like property. Although a copyright such as a copyright on a book does not constitute export property, a copyrighted article (such as a book) if not accompanied by a right to reproduce it is export property if the requirements of this section are otherwise satisfied. However, a license of a master recording tape for reproduction outside the United States is not disqualified under this subparagraph from being export property.
(g)
Depletable products
—(1)
In general.
Under section 993(c)(2)(C), a product or commodity which is a depletable product (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) or contains a depletable product is not export property if—
(i) It is a primary product from oil, gas, coal, or uranium (as described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph), or
(ii) It does not qualify as a 50-percent manufactured or processed product (as described in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph).
(2)
Definition of “depletable product”.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “depletable product” means any product or commodity of a character with respect to which a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 613 or 613A. Thus, the term depletable product includes any mineral extracted from a mine, an oil or gas well, or any other natural deposit, whether or not the DISC or related supplier is allowed a deduction, or is eligible to take a deduction, for depletion with respect to the mineral in computing its taxable income. Thus, for example, iron ore purchased by a DISC from a broker is a depletable product in the hands of the DISC for purposes of this paragraph even though the DISC is not eligible to take a deduction for depletion under section 613 or 613A.
(3)
Primary product from oil, gas, coal, or uranium.
A primary product from oil, gas, coal, or uranium is not export property. For purposes of this paragraph—
(i)
Primary product from oil.
The term “primary product from oil” means crude oil and all products derived from the destructive distillation of crude oil, including—
(
a
) Volatile products,
(
b
) Light oils such as motor fuel and kerosene,
(
c
) Distillates such as naphtha,
(
d
) Lubricating oils,
(
e
) Greases and waxes, and
(
f
) Residues such as fuel oil.
For purposes of this paragraph, a product or commodity derived from shale oil which would be a primary product from oil if derived from crude oil is considered a primary product from oil.
(ii)
Primary product from gas.
The term “primary product from gas” means all gas and associated hydrocarbon components from gas wells or oil wells, whether recovered at the lease or upon further processing, including—
(
a
) Natural gas,
(
b
) Condensates,
(
c
) Liquefied petroleum gases such as ethane, propane, and butane, and
(
d
) Liquid products such as natural gasoline.
(iii)
Primary product from coal.
The term “primary product from coal” means coal and all products recovered from the carbonization of coal including—
(
a
) Coke,
(
b
) Coke-oven gas,
(
c
) Gas liquor,
(
d
) Crude light oil, and
(
e
) Coal tar.
(iv)
Primary product from uranium.
The term “primary product from uranium” means uranium ore and uranium concentrates (known in the industry as “yellow cake”), and nuclear fuel materials derived from the refining of uranium ore and uranium concentrates, or produced in a nuclear reaction, including—
(
a
) Uranium hexafluoride,
(
b
) Enriched uranium hexafluoride,
(
c
) Uranium metal,
(
d
) Uranium compounds, such as uranium carbide,
(
e
) Uranium dioxide, and
(
f
) Plutonium fuels.
(v)
Primary products and changing technology.
The primary products from oil, gas, coal, or uranium described in subdivisions (i) through (iv) of this subparagraph and the processes described in those subdivisions are not intended to represent either the only primary products from oil, gas, coal, or uranium, or the only processes from which primary products may be derived under existing and future technologies, such as the gasification and liquefaction of coal.
(vi)
Petrochemicals.
For purposes of this paragraph, petrochemicals are not considered primary products from oil, gas, or coal.
(4)
50-percent manufactured or processed product
—(i)
In general.
A product or commodity (other than a primary product from oil, gas, coal, or uranium) which is or contains a depletable product is not excluded from the term “export property” by reason of section 993(c)(2)(C) if it is a 50-percent manufactured or processed product. Such a product or commodity is a “50-percent manufactured or processed product” if, after the cutoff point of the depletable product, it is manufactured or processed (as defined in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) and either the cost test described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph or the fair market value test described in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph is satisfied. To determine cutoff point, see subdivisions (vi) and (vii) of this subparagraph.
(ii)
Manufactured or processed.
A product is manufactured or processed if it is manufactured or produced within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, except that for purposes of this subdivision the term manufacturing or processing does not include any excluded process (as defined in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) and the term conversion costs (as used in subdivision (iv) of such paragraph (c)(2)) does not include any costs attributable to any excluded process.
(iii)
Excluded processes.
For purposes of this paragraph, excluded processes are extracting (
i.e.,
all processes which are applied before the cutoff point of the mineral to which such processes are applied), and handling, packing, packaging, grading, storing, and transporting.
(iv)
Cost test.
A product or commodity will qualify as a 50-percent manufactured or processed product if—
(
a
) Its manufacturing and processing costs (that is, the portion of the cost of goods sold or inventory amount of the product or commodity attributable to the aggregate cost of manufacturing or processing each mineral contained therein) equal or exceed—
(
b
) An amount equal to either of the following:
(
1
) 50 percent of its cost of goods sold or inventory amount (decreased, at the DISC's option, by the portion of such cost or amount the DISC establishes is allocable to the difference between each prior owner's selling price for each depletable product contained in such product or commodity and such
prior owner's cost of goods sold with respect thereto).
(
2
) The aggregate of the cost at the cutoff point (see subdivisions (vi) and (vii) of this subparagraph) properly attributable to each mineral contained in such product or commodity. However, if this subdivision (
2
) is applied, then the amount in (
a
) of this subparagraph (iv) shall be decreased and the amount in this subdivision (
2
) shall be increased, by so much of the cost of goods sold or inventory amount of the product or commodity as is properly allocable to any process other than transportation applied after the cutoff point of such mineral which would be a mining process (within the meaning of § 1.613-4) were it applied before such point.
(v)
Fair market value test.
A product or commodity will qualify as a 50-percent manufactured or processed product if—
(
a
) The excess of its fair market value on the date it is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of (or, if not sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, the last day of the DISC's taxable year) over the portion thereof properly allocable to excluded processes other than extracting is equal to or greater than
(
b
) Twice the aggregate of the fair market value at the cutoff point for each mineral contained in such product or commodity.
For purposes of this subdivision (v), the fair market value of a product or commodity on the date it is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of is the price at which it is disposed of, subject to any adjustment that may be required under the arm's length standard of section 482 and the regulations thereunder. If such product or commodity is not sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, then, for purposes of section 992(a)(1)(B) (relating to the 95-percent test with respect to qualified export assets), the fair market value of a product or commodity on the last day of the DISC's taxable year is the arm's length price at which such product or commodity would have been sold on such date, determined by applying the principles of section 482 and the regulations thereunder.
(vi)
Cutoff point of a mineral.
For purposes of this subparagraph:
(
a
) The cutoff point is the point at which gross income from the property (within the meaning of section 613(a)) was in fact determined.
(
b
) The cost at the cutoff point is deemed to be the amount of the gross income from the property of the taxpayer eligible for a depletion deduction with respect to the mineral.
(
c
) The fair market value at the cutoff point is deemed to be the amount of the gross income from the property of the taxpayer eligible for a depletion deduction with respect to the mineral, except that, if (
1
) the fair market value of a product or commodity on the date specified in subdivision (v)(
a
) of this subparagraph exceeds the aggregate of the fair market value at the cutoff point for each mineral contained therein and (
2
) 10 percent or more of such excess is attributable to a net increase in the fair market values of such minerals by reason of factors other than manufacturing or processing or the application of excluded processes (such as, for example, increases in the fair market values of some minerals by reason of inflation or speculation exceed decreases in such values of other minerals by reason of deflation or speculation), then the aggregate of the fair market value at the cutoff point for each such mineral shall be increased to reflect the net excess so attributable.
(
d
) The provisions of this subdivision (vi) are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
An integrated manufacturer, X, on February 1, 1976, had gross income from the property (within the meaning of section 613(a)) of $50 with respect to a specified volume of a mineral. Thus, the cost at the cutoff point of the mineral was $50. X converted the mineral into a product which it sold on July 15, 1976, for $75. Of the $25 excess of the selling price over the gross income from the property, $23 was attributable to manufacturing, processing, and the application or excluded processes, and $2 was attributable to an increase in the fair market value of the mineral due to inflation between February 1 and July 15, 1976. Since only 8 percent of such excess ($2/$25) was attributable to factors other than manufacturing, processing, and the application of excluded processes, the fair market value at the cutoff point of the mineral is $50. However, had $3 of the $25 excess, or 12 percent, been attributable to an increase in the fair market value of the mineral due to inflation, then the fair market
value at the cutoff point of the mineral would be $53.
(vii) [Reserved]
(viii)
Special rule for certain used products and scrap products.
If a product or commodity is a used 50-percent manufactured or processed product, or is recovered as scrap from a 50-percent manufactured or processed product, such product or commodity will be treated as a 50-percent manufactured or processed product.
(ix)
Special rule for byproducts and waste products.
For purposes of applying the cost test or fair market value test of subdivision (iv) or (v) of this subparagraph if a depletable product is recovered from a manufacturing process as a byproduct or waste product, then the cost and fair market value at the cutoff point are each deemed to be the lesser of—
(
a
) The fair market value of the waste product or byproduct containing the depletable product, determined as of the date the byproduct or waste product is recovered, or
(
b
) The amount the cost at the cut-off point would be for a depletable product of like kind and grade which is extracted, determined as of the date the byproduct or waste product is recovered.
For purposes of (
b
) of this subdivision the cutoff point for the depletable product of like kind and grade is deemed to be the point at which gross income from the property would be determined if such depletable product were sold by the taxpayer eligible to take a deduction for depletion after the completion of all mining processes applied to the depletable product and before the application of any nonmining process.
(x)
Proof of satisfaction of 50-percent manufactured or processed test.
(
a
) No substantiation is required to establish that either the cost test or the fair market value test of subdivisions (iv) or (v) of this subparagraph is satisfied or that a product or commodity qualifies under (viii) of this subdivision as either a used 50-percent manufactured or processed product or as scrap from a 50-percent manufactured or processed product as long as it is reasonably obvious, on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances, that either the cost test or fair market value test is satisfied, or that the product or commodity qualifies as either as used 50-percent manufactured or processed product or as scrap from a 50-percent manufactured or processed product. Thus, for example, in the case of a DISC exporting a high precision lens at least 50 percent of the fair market value of which is obviously attributable to grinding, no substantiation of gross income from the property properly allocable to the depletable products contained in the lens, cost, or fair market values will be required.
(
b
) In cases in which satisfaction of either the cost test or the fair market value test is not reasonably obvious, a DISC will be required to substantiate the gross income from the property properly allocable to each depletable product in a product or commodity and either all costs or fair market values relied upon the DISC.
(
c
) For purposes of substantiating (
1
) gross income from the property properly allocable to a depletable product, (
2
) costs, and (
3
) fair market values, the DISC and related supplier shall each identify items in (or that were in) inventory in the same manner each used to identify items in inventory for purposes of computing Federal income tax.
(xi)
Application of 50-percent test.
The 50-percent test described in this subparagraph is applied on an item-by-item basis. If, however, a DISC sells a substantial volume of substantially identical products or commodities and if all or a group of such products or commodities contain substantially identical depletable products in substantially the same proportions and have cost or fair market value relationships (as the case may be) that are in substantially the same proportions, such DISC may apply the 50-percent test on an aggregate basis with respect to all such products or commodities, or group, as the case may be.
(5)
Effective dates.
Except as provided in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, section 993(c)(2)(C) applies—
(i) With respect to any product or commodity not owned by a DISC, to sales, exchanges, or other dispositions made after March 18, 1975, with respect
to which the DISC derives gross receipts.
(ii) With respect to any product or commodity acquired by a DISC after March 18, 1975.
(iii) With respect to any product or commodity owned by a DISC on March 18, 1975, to sales, exchanges, or other dispositions made after March 18, 1976, and to owning such product or commodity after such date.
For purposes of this paragraph and subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, the date of a sale, exchange, or other disposition of a product or commodity is the date as of which title to such product or commodity passes. The accounting method of a person is not determinative of the date of a sale, exchange, or other disposition.
(6)
Fixed contracts.
Section 1101(f) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 provides an exception to the effective date rules in this paragraph and in paragraph (h) of this section. Section 1101(f)(2) of the Act provides that section 993(c)(2)(C) and (D) shall not apply to sales, exchanges, and other dispositions made after March 18, 1975, but before March 19, 1980, if they are made pursuant to a fixed contract. Section 1101(f)(2) also defines fixed contract. Under that definition, if the seller can vary the price of the product for unspecified cost increases (which could include tax cost increases), or if the quantity of products or commodities to be sold can be increased or decreased under the contract by the seller without penalty, the contract is not to be considered a fixed contract with respect to the amount over which the seller has discretion. For example, if a contract calls for a minimum delivery of
x
amount of a product but allows the seller to refuse to deliver goods beyond that minimum amount (or allows a renegotiation of the sales price of goods beyond that amount), then with respect to the amount above the minimum the contract is not a fixed quantity contract.
(h)
Export controlled products
—(1)
In general.
An export controlled product is not export property. A product or commodity may be an export controlled product at one time but not an export controlled product at another time. For purposes of this paragraph, a product or commodity is an “export controlled product” at a particular time if at that time the export of such product or commodity is prohibited or curtailed under section 4(b) of the Export Administration Act of 1969 or section 7(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, to effectuate the policy relating to the protection of the domestic economy set forth in such Acts (paragraph (2)(A) of section 3 of the Export Administration Act of 1969 and paragraph (2)(C) of section 3 of the Export Administration Act of 1979). Such policy is to use export controls to the extent necessary “to protect the domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce materials and to reduce the serious inflationary impact of foreign demand.”
(2)
Products considered export controlled products
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph, an export controlled product is a product or commodity which is subject to short supply export controls under 15 CFR part 377. A product or commodity is considered an export controlled product for the duration of each control period which applies to such product or commodity. A control period of a product or commodity begins on and includes the initial control date (as defined in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) and ends on and includes the final control date (as defined in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph).
(ii)
Initial control date.
The initial control date of a product or commodity which was subject to short supply export controls on March 19, 1975, is March 19, 1975. The initial control date of a product or commodity which is subject to short supply export controls after March 19, 1975, is the effective date stated in the regulations to 15 CFR part 377 which subjects such product or commodity to short supply export controls. If there is no effective date stated in such regulations, the initial control date of such product or commodity is the date on which such regulations are filed for publications in the
Federal Register.
(iii)
Final control date.
The final control date of a product or commodity is the effective date stated in the regulations to 15 CFR part 377 which removes such product or commodity from short supply export controls. If there is no
effective date stated in such regulations, the final control date of such product or commodity is the date on which such regulations are filed for publication in the
Federal Register.
(iv)
Expiration of Export Administration Act.
An initial control date and a final control date cannot occur after the expiration date of the Export Administration Act under the authority of which the short supply export controls were issued.
(3)
Effective dates
—(i)
Products controlled on March 19, 1975.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, if a product or commodity was subject to short supply export controls on March 19, 1975, this paragraph applies—
(
a
) With respect to any such product or commodity not owned by a DISC, to sales, exchanges, other dispositions, or leases made after March 18, 1975, with respect to which the DISC derives gross receipts.
(
b
) With respect to any such product or commodity acquired by a DISC after March 18, 1975, and
(
c
) With respect to any such product or commodity owned by a DISC on March 18, 1975, to sales, exchanges, other dispositions, and leases made after March 18, 1976, and to owning such product or commodity after such date.
(ii)
Products first controlled after March 19, 1975.
If a product or commodity becomes subject to short supply export controls after March 19, 1975, this paragraph applies to sales, exchanges, other dispositions, or leases of such product or commodity made on or after the initial control date of such product or commodity, and to owning such product or commodity on or after such date.
(iii)
Date of sale, exchange, lease, or other disposition.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the date of sale, exchange, or other disposition of a product or commodity is the date as of which title to such product or commodity passes. The date of a lease is the date as of which the lessee takes possession of a product or commodity. The accounting method of a person is not determinative of the date of sale, exchange, other disposition, or lease.
(iv)
Property in short supply.
If the President determines that the supply of any property which is otherwise export property as defined in this section is insufficient to meet the requirements of the domestic economy, he may by Executive order designate such property as in short supply. Any property so designated will be treated as property which is not export property during the period beginning with the date specified in such Executive order and ending with the date specified in an Executive order setting forth the President's determination that such property is no longer in short supply.
[T.D. 7514, 42 FR 55461, Oct. 17, 1977, as amended by T.D. 7513, 42 FR 57309, Nov. 2, 1977; T.D. 7854, 47 FR 51740, Nov. 17, 1982]
§ 1.993-4
Definition of producer's loans.
(a)
General rule
—(1)
Definition.
Under section 993(d), a loan made by a DISC to a person, referred to in this section as the “borrower,” is a producer's loan if—
(i) The loan is made out of accumulated DISC income within the meaning of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(ii) The loan is evidenced by an obligation described in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(iii) The requirement as to the trade or business of the borrower described in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph is satisfied.
(iv) At the time the loan is made, the obligation referred to in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph bears a legend stating “This Obligation Is Designated A Producer's Loan Within The Meaning of section 993(d) of the Internal Revenue Code” or words of substantially the same meaning.
(v) The limitation as to the export-related assets of the borrower described in paragraph (b) of this section is satisfied.
(vi) The requirement as to the increased investment of the borrower in export-related assets described in paragraph (c) of this section is satisfied, and
(vii) The requirement of paragraph (d) of this section as to proof of compliance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section is satisfied.
(2)
Application of this section
—(i)
In general.
A loan which is a producer's loan is a qualified export asset of the DISC (see § 1.993-2(a)(5) and (F)). The interest on a producer's loan is a qualified export receipt of the DISC (see § 1.993-1(g)). A producer's loan is not a dividend to a borrower which is also a shareholder of the DISC making the loan. For rules with respect to deemed distributions by reason of the amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans, see section 995(b)(1)(G) and (d) and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
No tracing of loan proceeds.
For purposes of applying this section, in order to qualify as a producer's loan, the proceeds of the loan need not be traced to an investment in any specific asset.
(iii)
Unrelated borrower.
For purposes of applying this section, it is not necessary for a borrower to be a related person with respect to the DISC from which it receives a producer's loan, or a member of the same controlled group as the DISC.
(iv)
Unpaid balance of producer's loans.
For purposes of applying this section, the unpaid balance of producer's loans does not include the unpaid balance of any producer's loan to the extent the loan has been deducted or charged off by the DISC as totally or partially worthless under section 165 or 166.
(v)
Refinancing, renewal, and extension.
For purposes of applying this section, the refinancing, renewal, or extension of a producer's loan shall be treated as the making of a new loan which may qualify as a producer's loan only if the requirements of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are met.
(vi)
Events subsequent to time loan is made.
The determination as to whether a loan qualifies as a producer's loan is made on the basis of the relevant facts taken into account for purposes of determining whether the loan was a producer's loan when made. Thus, for example, if the accumulated DISC income of the lender is later reduced below the unpaid balance of all producer's loans previously made by the DISC, such subsequent decrease in the amount of accumulated DISC income will not result in later disqualification of such loan (or part thereof) as a producer's loan. Similarly, if a loan (or part of a loan) does not qualify as a producer's loan because of an insufficient amount of accumulated DISC income at the time the loan is made, a subsequent increase in the amount of accumulated DISC income will not result in later qualification of such loan (or part thereof) as a producer's loan. As a further example, for purposes of applying the borrower's export related assets limitation described in paragraph (b) of this section, a loan which qualifies as a producer's loan when made will not later be disqualified if property, the gross receipts from the sale or lease of which were includible in the numerator of the fraction described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section at the time of sale or lease by the borrower, is later characterized as excluded property (as defined in § 1.993-3(f)).
(vii)
Application of tests under paragraphs (b) and (c) on controlled group bases.
If the borrower is a member of a controlled group (as defined in § 1.993-1(k)) at the time a loan is made, all amounts that must be determined for purposes of applying the limitation and increased investment requirement with respect to the export-related assets of the borrower (described in paragraphs (b) and (c), respectively, of this section) may be determined at the election of the borrower by aggregating such amounts for all members of the controlled group, determined for the taxable year of each member of the controlled group during which the loan is made, excluding only such members of the group as are DISC's or foreign corporations for such year. However, such amounts may be included only to the extent that such amounts have not already been taken into account in applying the limitation and increased investment requirement with respect to any other borrower. Amounts to be aggregated for all such members if such election is made include, for example, gross receipts (described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section) and export-related assets (described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). The borrower may make such election by causing its written statement of election to be attached to the lending DISC's return under section 6011(e)(2) for the
first taxable year of the lending DISC within which or with which the borrower's taxable year for which the election is to apply ends. An election once made is binding on all members of the controlled group which includes the borrower with respect to all taxable years of the borrower beginning with its first taxable year for which the election is made. A borrower who makes such election may revoke it only if it secures the consent of the Commissioner to such revocation upon application made through the lending DISC.
(3)
Loan out of accumulated DISC income
—(i)
In general.
A loan is a producer's loan only to the extent that it is made out of accumulated DISC income. A loan is made out of accumulated DISC income only if the amount of the loan, when added to the unpaid balance at the time such loan is made of all other producer's loans made by a DISC, does not exceed the amount of accumulated DISC income of the DISC at the beginning of the month in which the loan is made. The amount of accumulated DISC income at the beginning of any month is determined as if the DISC's taxable year closed at the end of the immediately preceding month.
(ii)
Presumption.
A loan made during a taxable year shall be deemed under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to have been made out of accumulated DISC income if the balance of producer's loans at the beginning of the year and those made during the year do not exceed accumulated DISC income at the end of the year.
(iii)
Deemed distributions.
For purposes of this subparagraph, accumulated DISC income as of the end of any taxable year (or month) shall be determined without regard to deemed distributions under section 995(b)(1)(G) for the amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans for such year (or for the taxable year for which such month is a part) but actual distributions shall be taken into account.
(4)
Evidence and terms of obligation.
A loan is a producer's loan only if the loan is evidenced by a note or other evidence of indebtedness which is made by the borrower and which has a stated maturity date not more than 5 years from the date the loan is made. Accordingly, a loan which does not have a stated maturity date or which has a stated maturity date more than 5 years from the date such loan is made can never meet the 5-year requirement of this subparagraph. Thus, for example, even if there is a period of less than 5 years remaining to the stated maturity date of a loan, the loan can never be a producer's loan if it had a stated maturity date more than 5 years from the date it was made. For a further example, if a loan having a period remaining to maturity of 2 years is extended for a further period of 3 years (making a total of 5 years to maturity from the date of the extension), the extension of the loan would under subparagraph (2)(v) of this paragraph constitute the making of a new producer's loan and the original producer's loan would terminate. If, however, a loan having a period remaining to maturity of 2 years is extended for a further period of 4 years (making a total of 6 years to maturity from the date of the extension), the original producer's loan will terminate and the new loan will not be a producer's loan. If a producer's loan is not paid in full at its maturity date and is not formally refinanced, renewed, or extended, such loan shall be deemed to be a new loan which does not have a stated maturity date and, thus, will not be a producer's loan. For purposes of this subparagraph, an evidence of indebtedness is a written instrument of indebtedness. Section 482 and the regulations thereunder are applicable to determine, in the case of a loan by the DISC to a borrower which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests as the DISC within the meaning of section 482, whether the interest charged on such loan is at an arm's length rate.
(5)
Borrower's trade or business.
A loan is a producer's loan only if the loan is made to a person engaged in the United States in the manufacture, production, growth, or extraction (within the meaning of § 1.993-3(c)) of export property determined without regard to § 1.993-3(f)(1)(iii) and (iv). The borrower may also be engaged in other trades or businesses and the loan need not be traceable to specific investments in export property.
(b)
Borrower's export related assets limitation
—(1)
General rule.
A loan to a borrower is a producer's loan only to the extent that the amount of the loan, when added to the unpaid balance of all other producer's loans made by all DISC's to the borrower which are outstanding at the time the loan is made, does not exceed an amount equal to the amount of the borrower's export-related assets (determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) multiplied by the fraction set forth in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(2)
Amount of export-related assets
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the amount of the borrower's export-related assets is the sum of the amounts described in subdivisions (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph.
(ii)
Borrower's plant and equipment.
The amount described in this subdivision is the sum of the borrower's adjusted bases (determined as of the beginning of the borrower's taxable year in which a loan is made to it) for plant, machinery, equipment, and supporting production facilities, which are located in the United States. Supporting production facilities are all property used primarily in connection with the manufacture, production, growth, or extraction (within the meaning of § 1.993-3(c)) or storage, handling, transportation, or assembly of property by the borrower.
(iii)
Borrower's property held primarily for sale or lease.
The amount described in this subdivision is the amount of the borrower's property (at the beginning of the taxable year of the borrower in which a loan is made to it) held primarily for sale or lease to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. The amount of such property held for sale is determined under the methods of identifying and valuing inventory normally used by the borrower. The amount of such property held for lease or leased is the borrower's adjusted bases, determined under section 1011, for such property.
(iv)
Borrower's research and experimental expenditures.
The amount described in this subdivision is the aggregate amount, whether or not charged to capital account, of research and experimental expenditures (within the meaning of section 174) incurred in the United States by the borrower during each of its taxable years which begin after December 31, 1971, and precede the taxable year in which the loan is made to the borrower. Such research and experimental expenditures need bear no relationship to export property (as defined in § 1.993-3) of the borrower. The aggregate amount of all such expenditures for each of such preceding taxable years is taken into account for purposes of this subparagraph, regardless of whether all or any portion of the aggregate amount has been taken into account with respect to producer's loans made to the borrower by any DISC in preceding taxable years. The aggregate amount of all such expenditures shall include such expenditures of a corporation, the assets of which were acquired by the borrower in a distribution or a transfer described in section 381(a)(1) or (2) (relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions).
(3)
Fraction referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph
—(i)
Numerator of fraction.
The numerator of the fraction set forth in this subparagraph is the sum of the borrower's gross receipts for each of its 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the loan is made (but not including any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1972) from the sale or lease of export property (determined without regard to § 1.993-3(f)(1)(iii) and (iv)) which is manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted (within the meaning of § 1.993-3(c)) by the borrower whether or not sold or leased directly or through a related domestic person (notwithstanding § 1.993-3(a)(4) and (f)(2)). For purposes of the preceding sentence, with respect to a sale or lease to a related DISC in which the transfer price is determined under section 994(a)(1) or (2), the rules under § 1.994-1(c)(5) (relating to incomplete transactions) shall be applied, and with respect to all other sales and leases the rules under § 1.994-1(c)(5) other than subdivision (i)(
d
) thereof shall be applied.
(ii)
Denominator of fraction.
The denominator of the fraction set forth in this subparagraph is the sum of the amount included in the numerator and all other gross receipts of the borrower, for each of its taxable years for which
gross receipts are included in the numerator of the fraction, from all sales or leases of all property held by the borrower primarily for sale or lease to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and this subdivision, if such property is sold or leased to a domestic related person which resells or subleases such property, the borrower's gross receipts shall be the gross receipts derived by the domestic related person from the resale or sublease of the export property.
(iii)
Taxable years.
If the borrower has not engaged in the sale or lease of property (as described in this subparagraph) for the 3 immediately preceding taxable years, or if 3 taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, have not elapsed, the fraction will be computed on the basis of such gross receipts for its taxable years immediately preceding the loan and beginning after December 31, 1971, during which the borrower has so engaged. No producer's loans can be made to a borrower until after the end of the first taxable year of the borrower beginning after December 31, 1971.
(c)
Requirement for increased investment in export-related assets
—(1)
In general.
A loan to a borrower is a producer's loan only to the extent that the amount of the loan, when added to the unpaid balance of all other producer's loans made by all DISC's to the borrower during the borrower's taxable year during which such loan is made, does not exceed the amount of the borrower's increase for the year in investment in export-related assets. Such increase for any taxable year is the sum of—
(i) The increase (if any) in the borrowers adjusted basis of certain types of assets as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and
(ii) The amount (if any) during the year of its research and experimental expenditures as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.
(2)
Increase in adjusted basis.
The amount under this subparagraph is the amount (not less than zero) by which—
(i) The borrower's adjusted basis (determined as of the end of its taxable year in which the producer's loan is made) in all of its property which is described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) (plant and equipment), and (iii) (property held primarily for sale or lease) of this section, including any such property acquired by it during such taxable year, exceeds
(ii) Its adjusted bases in all such property (determined as of the beginning of such year).
(3)
Ordering rule.
If during the borrower's taxable year the amount of increase in investment in export-related assets determined under this subparagraph is exceeded by amounts loaned to the borrower during such year that would otherwise qualify as producer's loans, such loans shall be applied in the order made against the amount of such increase in order to determine which loans qualify as producer's loans.
(d)
Proof of borrower's compliance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a DISC shall be prepared to establish initially the compliance of the borrower with the requirements of such paragraphs by providing the written statement of the borrower, certified by a certified public accountant, stating that the borrower has complied with the limitation and increased investment requirement in section 993(d)(2) and (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. In lieu of certification by a certified public accountant, the DISC may attach to its return a statement signed by the borrower under penalties of perjury on a form provided by the Internal Revenue Service certifying that the borrower has complied with the limitation and increased investment requirement in section 993(d)(2) and (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. For taxable years ending after October 17, 1977, the DISC must attach either the certification by the certified public accountant or the certification by the borrower to its return. Additional full substantiation of the borrower's compliance with the requirements of such paragraphs may be required by the district director. If full substantiation of such compliance is not provided by the DISC (or the borrower) when required, the loan shall be deemed not to be a producer's loan.
(e)
Special limitation in the case of domestic film maker
—(1)
General rule.
The
limitation of paragraph (b) of this section as to the export-related assets of the borrower will be considered satisfied if the DISC—
(i) Is engaged in the trade or business of selling or leasing films which are export property, or is acting as a commission agent for a person who is so engaged,
(ii) Makes a loan to a borrower which is a domestic film maker (as defined in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph) for the purpose of making a film, and
(iii) The amount of such loan, when added to the unpaid balance of all other producer's loans made by all DISC's to the borrower which are outstanding at the time the loan is made, does not exceed an amount determined by multiplying—
(
a
) The sum of (
1
) the amount of the export-related assets of the borrower (determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section as of the beginning of the borrower's taxable year in which the loan is made), plus (
2
) the amount of a reasonable estimate of the amount of such export related assets obtained or to be obtained by the borrower during such year and subsequent years with respect to films as to which filming begins within such year by
(
b
) The percentage which, based on the experience of other film makers of similar films for the 5 calendar years preceding the calendar year in which the loan is made, the annual gross receipts (as described in § 1.993-6(a)(1), whether or not such films constitute property described therein) of such other film makers from the sale or lease of such films outside the United States is of the annual gross receipts of such other film makers from all sales or leases of such films.
(2)
Purpose of loan.
A loan by a DISC will be deemed to be for the making of a film if there exists a written agreement between the DISC and the borrower, executed at or before the time the loan is made, stating that the loan is made or to be made to enable the borrower to make such film.
(3)
Reasonable estimate of amounts.
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(iii)(
a
)(
2
) of this paragraph, a reasonable estimate shall be based on the conditions known by the DISC and borrower to exist at the time a loan is made (or which the DISC and borrower have reason to know to exist at such time).
(4)
Experience of film makers.
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(iii)(
b
) of this paragraph, the experience of other film makers of similar films for the 5 calendar years preceding the calendar year in which the loan is made shall be derived from such records and statistics as are acknowledged in the trade as reasonably reliable.
(5)
Domestic film maker.
For purposes of this section, a borrower is a domestic film maker with respect to a film if—
(i) The borrower is a U.S. person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30), except that (
a
) with respect to a partnership all of the partners must be U.S. persons and (
b
) with respect to a corporation all of its officers and at least a majority of its directors must be U.S. persons,
(ii) The borrower is engaged in the trade or business of making the film with respect to which the loan is made,
(iii) Each studio, if any, used or to be used for filming or for recording sound incorporated into such film is located in the United States (as defined in section 7701(a)(9)),
(iv) At least 80 percent of the aggregate playing time of the film is or will be photographed within the United States (as defined in section 7701(a)(9)), and
(v) At least 80 percent of the total amount (not including any amount which is contingent upon receipts or profits of such film and which is fully taxable by the United States) paid or to be paid for services performed in the making of the film is either paid or to be paid to persons who are U.S. persons at the time such services are performed or consists of amounts which are fully taxable by the United States.
(6)
Amounts as fully taxable.
For purposes of subparagraph (5)(v) of this paragraph, an amount is considered fully taxable by the United States if the entire amount is included in gross income under section 61 or is subject to withholding under any provision of U.S. law or treaty to which the U.S. is a party and is not exempt from taxation under any provision of such law or treaty. Where a nonresident alien individual is engaged for the making of
a film or where a foreign corporation is engaged to furnish the services of one of its officers or employees for the making of a film, the amount paid such individual or corporation will be considered as fully taxable by the United States only if it meets the test of this subparagraph.
[T.D. 7514, 42 FR 55464, Oct. 17, 1977, as amended by T.D. 7513, 42 FR 57311, Nov. 2, 1977; T.D. 7514, 42 FR 60910, Nov. 30, 1977; T.D. 7854, 47 FR 51741, Nov. 17, 1982]
§ 1.993-5
Definition of related foreign export corporation.
(a)
General rule
—(1)
Definition.
Under section 993(e), a foreign corporation is a related foreign export corporation with respect to a DISC if—
(i) It is a foreign international sales corporation described in paragraph (b) of this section,
(ii) It is a real property holding company described in paragraph (c) of this section, or
(iii) It is an associated foreign corporation described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Application of this section.
It is necessary to determine whether a foreign corporation is a related foreign export corporation with respect to a DISC for the following two purposes:
(i)
Qualified export assets.
Under § 1.993-2(g), the stock or securities of a related foreign export corporation held by the DISC are qualified export assets.
(ii)
Qualified export receipts.
Under § 1.993-1 (e), (f), and (g), certain receipts of the DISC with respect to stock or securities of a related foreign export corporation held by the DISC are qualified export receipts.
(b)
Foreign international sales corporation
—(1)
In general.
A foreign corporation is a foreign international sales corporation with respect to a taxable year of a DISC if—
(i) On each day during such taxable year of the DISC on which the foreign corporation has stock issued and outstanding, the DISC owns directly stock of the foreign corporation possessing more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the foreign corporation entitled to vote as determined under the principles of § 1.957-1(b) (relating to definition of controlled foreign corporation),
(ii) 95 percent or more of such foreign corporation's gross receipts (as defined in § 1.993-6) for its taxable year ending with or within such taxable year of the DISC consists of qualified export receipts described in § 1.993-1 (b) through (e) or interest described in § 1.993-1(g) derived from any obligations described in § 1.993-2 (d) or (e), and
(iii) The sum of the adjusted bases of the assets of the foreign corporation which are qualified export assets described in § 1.993-2 (b) through (e) and which are held by the foreign corporation at the close of its taxable year which ends with or within such taxable year of the DISC equals or exceeds 95 percent of the sum of the adjusted bases of all assets held by the foreign corporation at the close of such taxable year.
(2)
Certain determinations.
The determinations as to whether gross receipts are qualified export receipts described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph and as to whether assets are qualified export assets described in subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph are made by applying the requirements of §§ 1.993-1 and 1.993-2 to the foreign corporation as if it were a domestic corporation being tested to determine whether it is a DISC. For purposes of making either of such determinations, the principles of accounting applicable for purposes of computing earnings and profits under § 1.964-1 (relating to a controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits) shall apply.
(c)
Real property holding company
—(1)
In general.
A foreign corporation is a real property holding company with respect to a taxable year of a DISC if—
(i) On each day during such taxable year of the DISC on which the foreign corporation has stock issued and outstanding, the DISC owns directly stock of the foreign corporation possessing more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the foreign corporation entitled to vote as determined under the principles of § 1.957-1(b) and
(ii) The sole function of the foreign corporation is to hold title to real property situated outside the United States for the exclusive use of the
DISC, title to which may not be held by the DISC (and, if the DISC subleases such property to a related supplier, as described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, by such related supplier) under the law of the country in which such property is situated.
(2)
Activities of the foreign corporation.
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, a foreign corporation which holds title to real property situated outside the United States may also perform activities with respect to such property (such as management, maintenance, and payment of taxes) which are ancillary to its function of holding title to such property.
(3)
Exclusive use by the DISC.
Real property held by the foreign corporation must be used exclusively by the DISC whether under a lease or any other arrangement. Real property is not so used by the DISC if the DISC subleases such property to any other person. If, however, during a taxable year of the DISC—
(i) 90 percent or more of the qualified export receipts of the DISC for such year are derived from transactions with respect to which it is a commission agent for a related supplier (as defined in § 1.994-1(a)(3)(ii)), and
(ii) The DISC subleases such property to such related supplier
then such property will be considered as used exclusively by the DISC during such year if such related supplier does not sublease such property.
(d)
Associated foreign corporation
—(1)
In general.
A foreign corporation is an associated foreign corporation with respect to a taxable year of the DISC if—
(i) On each day during such taxable year of the DISC on which the foreign corporation has stock issued and outstanding, the DISC, or one or more members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) as the DISC, owns (within the meaning of section 1563 (d) and (e)) stock of the foreign corporation possessing less than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the foreign corporation entitled to vote, as determined under the principles of § 1.957-1(b), or owns no stock of such corporation, and
(ii) The ownership of stock, or of securities (as defined in § 1.993-2(g)), of the foreign corporation by the DISC or by one or more members of such controlled group of corporations reasonably furthers a transaction or transactions giving rise to qualified export receipts for the DISC.
(2)
Controlled group of corporations.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “controlled group of corporations” has the same meaning assigned to the term in section 1563(a) and not section 993(a)(3) and § 1.993-1(k). Thus, for purposes of this paragraph, the test of control is 80 percent control and, since the rules of section 1563(b) apply, only domestic members are considered to be members of the controlled group.
(3)
Furtherance of qualified export receipts.
Ownership of stock or securities of a foreign corporation will be considered as reasonably furthering a transaction or transactions giving rise to qualified export receipts for a DISC if—
(i) The ownership is necessary to obtain or maintain the foreign corporation as a customer of the DISC or of a related supplier, as defined in § 1.994-1(a)(3)(ii) of the DISC or to aid the sales distribution system of the DISC or of such related supplier, and
(ii) The amount of the investment in the foreign corporation bears a reasonable relationship to the amount of the DISC's annual net profit from transactions in its trade or business which it may reasonably expect to derive on account of such ownership.
In determining whether the amount of the investment is reasonable, there shall be taken into account any stock or securities of the foreign corporation owned by any other foreign corporation which, if it were a domestic corporation, would be a member of the same controlled group of corporations as the DISC.
[T.D. 7514, 42 FR 55467, Oct. 17, 1977; 42 FR 60910, Nov. 30, 1977]
§ 1.993-6
Definition of gross receipts.
(a)
General rule.
Under section 993(f), for purposes of sections 991 through 996, the gross receipts of a person for a taxable year are—
(1) The total amounts received or accrued by the person from the sale or
lease of property held primarily for sale or lease in the ordinary course of a trade or business, and
(2) Gross income recognized from all other sources, such as, for example, from—
(i) The furnishing of services (whether or not related to the sale or lease of property described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph),
(ii) Dividends and interest,
(iii) The sale at a gain of any property not described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and
(iv) Commission transactions as and to the extent described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Nongross receipts items.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, gross receipts do not include amounts received or accrued by a person from—
(1) The proceeds of a loan or of the repayment of a loan, or
(2) A receipt of property in a transaction to which section 118 (relating to contribution to capital) or 1032 (relating to exchange of stock for property) applies.
(c)
Nonreduction of total amounts.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the total amounts received or accrued by a person are not reduced by returns and allowances, costs of goods sold, expenses, losses, a deduction for dividends received under section 243, or any other deductible amounts.
(d)
Method of accounting.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the total amounts received or accrued by a person shall be determined under the method of accounting used in computing its taxable income. If, for example, a DISC receives advance or installment payments for the sale or lease of property described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for the furnishing of services, or which represent recognized gain from the sale of property not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any amount of such advance payments is considered to be gross receipts of the DISC for the taxable year for which such amount is included in the gross income of the DISC.
(e)
Commission transactions.
(1) In the case of transactions which give rise to a commission on the sale or lease of property or the furnishing of services by a principal, the amount recognized by the commission agent as gross income from all such transactions shall be the gross receipts derived by the principal from the sale or lease of the property, or the gross income derived by the principal from the furnishing of services, with respect to which the commissions are derived. In the case of a commission agent for a related supplier (as defined in § 1.994-1(a)(3)(ii)), the gross receipts or gross income of such agent shall be determined as if it used the same method of accounting as its related supplier. In the case of a commission agent for a principal other than a related supplier, the gross receipts or gross income of such principal shall be determined as if such principal used the same method of accounting as its agent.
(2) If the commission arrangement provides that the commission agent will receive a commission only with respect to sales or leases of export property, or the furnishing of services, which result in qualified export receipts, the commission agent will not take into account the gross receipts or gross income, as the case may be, derived by the principal from any transaction for which the commission agent would not be entitled to a commission under the commission arrangement.
(f)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
During 1973, M, a related supplier (as defined in § 1.994-1(a)(3)(ii)) of N, is engaged in the manufacture of machines in the United States. N, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in the sale and lease of such machines in foreign countries. N furnishes services which are related and subsidiary to its sale and lease of such machines. N also acts as a commission agent in foreign countries for Z, an unrelated supplier, with respect to Z's sale of products. N receives dividends on stock owned by it in a related foreign export corporation (as defined in § 1.993-5), interest on producer's loans made to M, and proceeds from sales of business assets located outside the United States resulting in a recognized gains and losses. N's gross receipts for 1973 are $3,550, computed on the basis of the additional facts assumed in the table below:
(1) N's sales receipts for machines manufactured by M (without reduction for cost of goods sold and selling expenses)
$1,500
(2) N's lease receipts for machines manufactured by M (without reduction for depreciation and leasing expenses)
500
(3) N's gross income from services for machines manufactured by M (without reduction for service expenses)
400
(4) Z's sale receipts for products manufactured by Z (without reduction for Z's cost of goods sold, commissions on sales, and commission sales expenses)
550
(5) Dividends received by N
150
(6) Interest received by N on producer's loans
200
(7) Proceeds received by N representing recognized gain (but not losses) from sales of business assets located outside the United States
250
(8) N's gross receipts
3,550
[T.D. 7514, 42 FR 55468, Oct. 17, 1977]
§ 1.993-7
Definition of United States.
Under section 993(g), the term “United States” includes the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and possessions of the United States. For the requirement that a DISC must be incorporated and existing under the laws of a State or the District of Columbia, see § 1.992-1(a)(1).
[T.D. 7514, 42 FR 55468, Oct. 17, 1977]
§ 1.994-1
Inter-company pricing rules for DISC's.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section, section 994 permits a person related to a DISC to determine the allowable transfer price charged the DISC (or commission paid the DISC) by its choice of three methods described in paragraph (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this section: The “4 percent” gross receipts method, the “50-50” combined taxable income method, and the section 482 method. Under the first two methods, the DISC is entitled to 10 percent of its export promotion expenses as additional taxable income. When the gross receipts method or combined taxable income method is applied to a transaction, the Commissioner may not make distributions, apportionments, or allocations as provided by section 482 and the regulations thereunder. For rules as to certain “incomplete transactions” and for computing combined taxable income, see paragraph (c)(5) and (6) of this section. Grouping of transactions for purposes of applying the method chosen is provided by paragraph (c)(7) of this section. The rules in paragraph (c) of this section are directly applicable only in the case of sales or exchanges of export property to a DISC for resale, and are applicable by analogy to leases, commissions, and services as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. For rules limiting the application of the gross receipts method and combined taxable income method so that the supplier related to the DISC will not incur a loss on transactions, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Paragraph (e)(2) of this section provides for the applicability of section 482 to resales by the DISC to related persons. Paragraph (e)(3) of this section provides for the time by which a reasonable estimate of the transfer price (including commissions and other payments) should be paid. The subsequent determination and further adjustments to transfer prices are set forth in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Export promotion expenses are defined in paragraph (f) of this section. Paragraph (g) of this section has several examples illustrating the provisions of this section. Section 1.994-2 prescribes the marginal costing rules authorized by section 994(b)(2).
(2)
Performance of substantial economic functions.
The application of section 994(a)(1) or (2) does not depend on the extent to which the DISC performs substantial economic functions (except with respect to export promotion expenses). See paragraph (l) of § 1.993-1.
(3)
Related party and related supplier.
For the purposes of this section—
(i) The term “related party” means a person which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests as the DISC within the meaning of section 482 and § 1.482-1(a).
(ii) The term “related supplier” means a related party which singly engages in a transaction directly with the DISC which is subject to the rules of section 994 and this section. However, a DISC may have different related suppliers with respect to different transactions. If, for example, X owns all the stock of Y, a corporation, and of Z, a DISC, and sells a product to Y which is resold to Z, only Y is the related supplier of Z, and, thus, only the resale from Y to Z is subject to section 994 and this section. If, however, X sells directly to Z and Y also sells directly
to Z, then, as to the transactions involving direct sales to Z, each of X and Y is a related supplier of Z.
(b)
Transactions to which section 994 applies.
Section 994(a)(3) may be applied, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, to any transaction between a related supplier and a DISC. Section 994(a)(1) or (2) may be applied, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, to a transaction between a related supplier and a DISC only in the following cases:
(1) Where the related supplier sells export property to the DISC for resale or where the DISC is commission agent for the related supplier on sales by the related supplier of export property to third parties whether or not related parties. For purposes of this section, references to sales include exchanges.
(2) Where the related supplier leases export property to the DISC for sublease for a comparable period with comparable terms of payment or where the DISC is commission agent for the related supplier on leases by the related supplier of export property to third parties whether or not related parties.
(3) Where services are furnished by a related supplier which are related and subsidiary to any sale or lease by the DISC, acting as principal or commission agent, of export property under subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph.
(4) Where engineering or architectural services for construction projects located (or proposed for location) outside of the United States are furnished by a related supplier where the DISC is acting as principal or commission agent with respect to the furnishing of such services to a third party whether or not a related party.
(5) Where the related supplier furnishes managerial services in furtherance of the production of qualified export receipts of an unrelated DISC where the related DISC is acting as principal or commission agent with respect to the furnishing of such services to an unrelated DISC.
Transactions are included, for purposes of this paragraph, only if they give rise to qualified export receipts (within the meaning of section 993(a)) in the hands of the related DISC. If a transaction is not included in subparagraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this paragraph, the rules of section 994(a)(1) or (2) do not apply. Thus, for example, the rules of section 994(a)(1) or (2) would not apply if a DISC purchased export property from its related supplier and leased such property to a third party.
(c)
Transfer price for sales of export property
—(1)
In general.
Under this paragraph, rules are prescribed for computing the allowable price for a transfer from a related supplier to a DISC in the case of a sale of export property described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(2)
The “4-percent” gross receipts method.
Under the gross receipts method of pricing, the transfer price for a sale by the related supplier to the DISC is the price as a result of which the taxable income derived by the DISC from the sale will not exceed the sum of (i) 4 percent of the qualified export receipts of the DISC derived from the sale of the export property (as defined in section 993 (c)) and (ii) 10 percent of the export promotion expenses (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) of the DISC attributable to such qualified export receipts.
(3)
The “50-50” combined taxable income method.
Under the combined taxable income method of pricing, the transfer price for a sale by the related supplier to the DISC is the price as a result of which the taxable income derived by the DISC from the sale will not exceed the sum of (i) 50 percent of the combined taxable income (as defined in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph) of the DISC and its related supplier attributable to the qualified export receipts from such sale and (ii) 10 percent of the export promotion expenses (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) of the DISC attributable to such qualified export receipts.
(4)
Section 482 method.
If the rules of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph are inapplicable to a sale or a taxpayer does not choose to use them, the transfer price for a sale by the related supplier to the DISC is to be determined on the basis of the sale price actually charged but subject to the rules provided by section 482 and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Incomplete transactions.
(i) For purposes of the gross receipts and combined taxable income methods, where property (encompassed within a transaction or group chosen under subparagraph (7) of this paragraph) is transferred by a related supplier to a DISC during a taxable year of either the DISC or related supplier, but some or all of such property is not sold by the DISC during such year—
(
a
) The transfer price of such property sold by the DISC during such year shall be computed separately from the transfer price of the property not sold by the DISC during such year,
(
b
) With respect to such property not sold by the DISC during such year, the transfer price paid by the DISC for such year shall be the related supplier's cost of goods sold (see subparagraph (6)(ii) of this paragraph) with respect to the property, except that, with respect to such taxable years ending on or before August 15, 1975, the transfer price paid by the DISC shall be at least (but need not exceed) the related supplier's cost of goods sold with respect to the property.
(
c
) For the subsequent taxable year during which such property is resold by the DISC, an additional amount shall be paid by the DISC (to be treated as income for such year by the related supplier) equal to the excess of the amount which would have been the transfer price under this section had the transfer to the DISC by the related supplier and the resale by the DISC taken place during the taxable year of the DISC during which it resold the property over the amount already paid under (
b
) of this subdivision.
(
d
) The time and manner of payment of transfer prices required by (
b
) and (
c
) of this subdivision shall be determined under paragraphs (e)(3), (4), and (5) of this section.
(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, a DISC may determine the year in which it receives property from a related supplier and the year in which it sells property in accordance with the method of identifying goods in its inventory properly used under section 471 or 472 (relating respectively to general rule for inventories and to LIFO inventories). Transportation expense of the related supplier in connection with a transaction to which this subparagraph applies shall be treated as an item of cost of goods sold with respect to the property if the related supplier includes the cost of intracompany transportation between its branches, divisions, plants, or other units in its cost of goods sold (see subparagraph (6)(ii) of this paragraph).
(6)
Combined taxable income.
For purposes of this section, the combined taxable income of a DISC and its related supplier from a sale of export property is the excess of the gross receipts (as defined in section 993(f)) of the DISC from such sale over the total costs of the DISC and related supplier which relate to such gross receipts. Gross receipts from a sale do not include interest with respect to the sale. Combined taxable income under this paragraph shall be determined after taking into account under paragraph (e)(2) of this section all adjustments required by section 482 with respect to transactions to which such section is applicable. In determining the gross receipts of the DISC and the total costs of the DISC and related supplier which relate to such gross receipts, the following rules shall be applied:
(i) Subject to subdivisions (ii) through (v) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer's method of accounting used in computing taxable income will be accepted for purposes of determining amounts and the taxable year for which items of income and expense (including depreciation) are taken into account. See § 1.991-1(b)(2) with respect to the method of accounting which may be used by a DISC.
(ii) Cost of goods sold shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of § 1.61-3. See sections 471 and 472 and the regulations thereunder with respect to inventories. With respect to property to which an election under section 631 applies (relating to cutting of timber considered as a sale or exchange), cost of goods sold shall be determined by applying § 1.631-1(d)(3) and (e) (relating to fair market value as of the beginning of the taxable year of the standing timber cut during the year considered as its cost).
(iii) Costs (other than cost of goods sold) which shall be treated as relating to gross receipts from sales of export
property are (
a
) the expenses, losses, and other deductions definitely related, and therefore allocated and apportioned, thereto, and (
b
) a ratable part of any other expenses, losses, or other deductions which are not definitely related to a class of gross income, determined in a manner consistent with the rules set forth in § 1.861-8.
(iv) The taxpayer's choice in accordance with subparagraph (7) of this paragraph as to the grouping of transactions shall be controlling, and costs deductible in a taxable year shall be allocated and apportioned to the items or classes of gross income of such taxable year resulting from such grouping.
(v) If an account receivable arising with respect to a sale of export property is transferred by the related supplier to a DISC which is a member of the same controlled group within the meaning of § 1.993-1(k) for an amount reflecting a discount from the selling price taken into account in computing (without regard to this subdivision) combined taxable income of the DISC and its related supplier, then the combined taxable income from such sale shall be reduced by the amount of the discount.
(7)
Grouping transactions.
(i) Generally, the determinations under this section are to be made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. However, at the annual choice of the taxpayer some or all of these determinations may be made on the basis of groups consisting of products or product lines.
(ii) A determination by a taxpayer as to a product or a product line will be accepted by a district director if such determination conforms to any one of the following standards: (
a
) A recognized industry or trade usage, or (
b
) the 2-digit major groups (or any inferior classifications or combinations thereof, within a major group) of the Standard Industrial Classification as prepared by the Statistical Policy Division of the Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President.
(iii) A choice by the taxpayer to group transactions for a taxable year on a product or product line basis shall apply to all transactions with respect to that product or product line consummated during the taxable year. However, the choice of a product or product line grouping applies only to transactions covered by the grouping and, as to transactions not encompassed by the grouping, the determinations are made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. For example, the taxpayer may choose a product grouping with respect to one product and use the transaction-by-transaction method for another product within the same taxable year.
(iv) For rules as to grouping certain related and subsidiary services, see paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.
(d)
Rules under section 994(a)(1) and (2) for transactions other than sales.
The following rules are prescribed for purposes of applying the gross receipts method or combined taxable income method to transactions other than sales:
(1)
Leases.
In the case of a lease of export property by a related supplier to a DISC for sublease by the DISC to produce gross receipts, for any taxable year the amount of rent the DISC must pay to the related supplier shall be determined under the DISC's lease with its related supplier but must be computed in a manner consistent with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section for computing the transfer price in the case of sales and resales of export property under the gross receipts method or combined taxable income method. For purposes of applying this subparagraph, transactions may not be so grouped on a product or product line basis under the rules of paragraph (c)(7) of this section as to combine in any one group of transactions both lease transactions and sale transactions involving the same product or product line.
(2)
Commissions.
If any transaction to which section 994 applies is handled on a commission basis for a related supplier by a DISC and such commissions give rise to qualified export receipts under section 993(a)—
(i) The amount of the income that may be earned by the DISC in any year is the amount, computed in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of this section, which the DISC would have been permitted to earn under the gross receipts method, the combined taxable income method, or section 482 method
if the related supplier had sold (or leased) the property or service to the DISC and the DISC in turn sold (or subleased) to a third party, whether or not a related party, and
(ii) The maximum commission the DISC may charge the related supplier is the sum of the amount of income determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph plus the DISC's total costs for the transaction as determined under paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
(3)
Receipts from services
—(i)
Related and subsidiary services attributable to the year of the export transaction.
The gross receipts for related and subsidiary services described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be treated as part of the receipts from the export transaction to which such services are related and subsidiary, but only if, under the arrangement between the DISC and its related supplier and the accounting method otherwise employed by the DISC, the income from such services is includible for the same taxable year as income from such export transaction.
(ii)
Other services.
In the case of related and subsidiary services to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply and other services described in paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section performed by a related supplier (relating respectively to engineering and architectural services and certain managerial services), the amount of taxable income which the DISC may derive for any taxable year shall be determined under the arrangement between the DISC and its related supplier and shall be computed in a manner consistent with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section for computing the transfer price in the case of sales for resale of export property under the gross receipts method or combined taxable income method. Related and subsidiary services to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply may be grouped, under the rules for grouping of transactions in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, with the products or product lines to which they are related and subsidiary, so long as the grouping of services chosen is consistent with the grouping of products or product lines chosen for the taxable year in which either the product or product lines were sold or in which payment for such services is received or accrued. The rules for grouping of transactions in paragraph (c)(7) of this section shall not apply with respect to the determination of taxable income which the DISC may derive from other services described in paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section performed by a related supplier or commissions on such services, and such determination shall be made only on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
(e)
Methods of applying paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section
—(1)
Limitation on DISC income (“no loss” rule)
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, neither the gross receipts method nor the combined taxable income method may be applied to cause in any taxable year a loss to the related supplier, but either method may be applied to the extent it does not cause a loss. A loss to a related supplier would result if the taxable income of the DISC would exceed the combined taxable income of the related supplier and the DISC. If, however, there is no combined taxable income of the DISC and the related supplier (because, for example, a combined loss is incurred), a transfer price (or commission) will not be deemed to cause a loss to the related supplier if it allows the DISC to recover an amount not in excess of its costs (if any).
(ii)
Special rule for applying “4 percent” gross receipts method to sales.
A transfer price or commission, determined under the “4 percent” gross receipts method (determined without regard to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph), for a sale of export property referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, will not be considered to cause a loss for the related supplier if for the DISC's taxable year, the ratio that (a) the taxable income of the DISC derived from such sale by using such price or commission bears to (
b
) the DISC's gross receipts from such sale is not greater than the ratio that (
c
) all of the taxable income of the related supplier and the DISC from all sales of the same product or product line (domestic and foreign) to third parties whether or not related parties bears to (
d
) the total gross receipts of the related supplier and the DISC from such sales. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
sales between the DISC and its related suppliers shall not be taken into account under (
c
) or (
d
) of this subdivision. For example, assume that for a taxable year of a DISC the total costs of the related supplier and the DISC with respect to all sales ($150 for domestic and $44 for foreign) of a product line are $194 and the total gross receipts of the related supplier and the DISC with respect to such sales are $200 so that the total taxable income of the related supplier and the DISC with respect to such sales is $6. The parties would thus be entitled to compute a transfer price determined under the gross receipts method on any given sale of product A of such product line by the related supplier to the DISC which would allocate to the DISC taxable income equal to not more than 3 percent (
i.e.,
$6/$200) of its gross receipts derived from its resale of such product. If the DISC were to resell an item of product A for $10, the transfer price paid by the DISC to the related supplier determined under the gross receipts method could be as low as $9.70.
(iii)
Grouping transactions.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the basis for grouping transactions chosen by the taxpayer under paragraph (c)(7) of this section for the taxable year shall be applied. For purposes of making the computations of subdivision (ii) (
c
) and (
d
) of this subparagraph, however, the taxpayer may choose any basis for grouping transactions permissible under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, even though it may not be the same basis as that already chosen under paragraph (c)(7) of this section for computing transfer prices or commissions to a DISC. If, for example, the taxpayer has chosen to group transactions on a product basis for computing transfer prices or commissions to a DISC for a taxable year, the taxpayer may still group transactions on a product line basis for purposes of computing taxable income and total gross receipts under subdivision (ii) (
c
) and (
d
) of this subparagraph. For a further example, if the taxpayer computes taxable income for one group of transactions under the gross receipts method and computes taxable income for a second group of transactions under the combined taxable income method, the taxpayer may aggregate these transactions for purposes of computing taxable income and total gross receipts under subdivision (ii) (
c
) and (
d
) of this subparagraph.
(2)
Relationship to section 482.
In applying the rules under section 994, it may be necessary to first take into account the price of a transfer (or other transaction) between the DISC (or related supplier) and a related party which is subject to the arm's length standard of section 482. Thus, for example, where a related supplier sells export property to a DISC which the related supplier purchased from related parties, the costs taken into account in computing the combined taxable income of the DISC and the related supplier are determined after any necessary adjustment under section 482 of the price paid by the related supplier to the related parties. In applying section 482 to a transfer by a DISC, however, the DISC and its related supplier are treated as if they were a single entity carrying on all the functions performed by the DISC and the related supplier with respect to the transaction and the DISC shall be allowed to receive under the section 482 standard the amount the related supplier would have received had there been no DISC.
(3)
Initial payment of transfer price or commission.
(i) The amount of a transfer price (or reasonable estimate thereof) actually charged by a related supplier to a DISC, or a sales commission (or reasonable estimate thereof) actually charged by a DISC to a related supplier, in a transaction to which section 994 applies must be paid no later than 60 days following the close of the taxable year of the DISC during which the transaction occurred.
(ii) Payment must be in the form of money, property (including accounts receivable from sales by or through the DISC), a written obligation which qualifies as debt under the safe harbor rule of § 1.992-1(d)(2)(ii), or an accounting entry offsetting the account receivable against an existing debt owed by the person in whose favor the account receivable was established to the person with whom it engaged in the transaction. The form of the payment to a DISC need not be a qualified export asset under § 1.993-2. However, for the
requirement that the adjusted basis of the qualified export assets of the DISC at the close of its taxable year must equal or exceed 95 percent of the sum of the adjusted bases of all assets of the DISC at the close of its taxable year, see section 992(a)(1)(B).
(iii) If the district director can demonstrate, based upon the data available as of the 60th day after the close of such taxable year, that the amount actually paid did not represent a reasonable estimate of the transfer price or commission (as the case may be) to be determined under section 994 and this section, an indebtedness will be deemed to arise, from the person required to make the payment in favor of the person to whom the payment is required to be made, in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the transfer price or commission determined under section 994 and this section and the amount (if any) actually paid and received. Such indebtedness will be deemed to arise as of the date the transaction occurred which gave rise to the indebtedness, except that, if such transaction occurred in a taxable year of the DISC ending on or before August 15, 1975, at the taxpayer's option, the indebtedness will be deemed to arise as of the date by which payment was required under subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(3). Such indebtedness owed to a DISC shall be treated as an asset but shall not be treated as a trade receivable or other qualified export asset (see § 1.993-2(d)(3)) as of the end of the taxable year of the DISC in which the indebtedness is deemed to arise.
(iv)(
a
) Except with respect to incomplete transactions to which paragraph (c)(5)(i)(
b
) of this section applies, if the amount actually paid results in the DISC realizing at least 50 percent of the DISC's taxable income from the transaction as reported in its tax return for the taxable year the transaction is completed, then the amount actually paid shall be deemed to be a reasonable estimate of such transfer price or commission.
(
b
) With respect to incomplete transactions to which paragraph (c)(5)(i)(
b
) of this section applies and which were initiated during a taxable year ending after August 15, 1975, the amount actually paid shall be deemed to be a reasonable estimate of such transfer price if any one of the following three tests is met:
(
1
) The amount actually paid by the DISC to the related supplier in respect of the property does not exceed the related supplier's cost of goods sold (see paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section) with respect to the property.
(
2
) If the transaction is completed by the date on which the DISC's return is required to be filed for the year in which the transaction was initiated, the amount actually paid by the DISC to the related supplier in respect of the property results in the DISC realizing at least 50 percent of the DISC's taxable income from the transaction when completed.
(
3
) The percentage that (
i
) an amount equal to (
a
) the amount actually paid by the DISC to the related supplier in respect of the property minus (
b
) the related supplier's cost of goods sold with respect to the property, bears to (
ii
) the related supplier's cost of goods sold in respect of the property, is not greater than 50 percent of the percentage that (
iii
) the combined taxable income for completed transactions of the same group as the property during the DISC's taxable year in which the incomplete transaction was initiated, bears to (
iv
) the cost of goods sold of the related supplier and DISC with respect to such transactions.
(
c
) For purposes of this subdivision (iv), whether the transfer price or commission actually paid is deemed a reasonable estimate may be determined on the basis for grouping transactions chosen by the taxpayer under paragraph (c)(5) and (7) of this section.
(v) An indebtedness arising under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph shall bear interest at an arm's length rate, computed in the manner provided by § 1.482-2(a)(2) from the 61st day after the close of the DISC's taxable year in which the transaction occurred which gave rise to the indebtedness to the date of payment. The interest so computed shall be accrued and included in the taxable income of the person to whom the indebtedness is owed for each taxable year during which the indebtedness is unpaid.
(4)
Subsequent determination of transfer price or commission.
The DISC and its related supplier would ordinarily determine under section 994 and this section the transfer price payable by the DISC (or the commission payable to the DISC) for a transaction before the DISC files its return for the taxable year of the transaction. After the DISC has filed its return, a redetermination of the transfer price (or commission) may only be made if permitted by the Code and the regulations thereunder. Such a redetermination would include a redetermination by reason of an adjustment under section 482 and the regulations thereunder or section 861 and § 1.861-8 which affects the amounts which entered into the determination of the transfer price or commission.
(5)
Procedure for adjustments to transfer price or commission
—(i)(
a
) If the transfer price (or commission) for a transaction determined under section 994 is different from the price (or commission) actually charged, the person who received too small a transfer price (or commission) or paid too large a transfer price (or commission) shall establish (or be deemed to have established), at the date of the determination or redetermination under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph of the transfer price (or commission) under section 994, an account receivable due the DISC from the person with whom it engaged in the transaction equal to the difference in amount between the transfer price (or commission) so determined and the transfer price (or commission) previously paid and received. If the account receivable is paid within 90 days after the date it is established (or deemed established), then as of the end of the taxable year of the DISC in which the transaction occurred which gave rise to the indebtedness, the account receivable shall be treated as an asset and, under § 1.993-2(d)(3) as a trade receivable, and thus as a qualified export asset.
(
b
) If, for example, during 1972, a DISC which uses the calendar year as its taxable year sold a product which it purchased that year from its related supplier and paid a price of $10,000 which price is a reasonable estimate under subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph but is later determined under section 994 to be $8,000 immediately before the DISC filed its return for 1972, the DISC must be paid $2,000 (i.e., $10,000−$8,000) by its related supplier or establish an account receivable from its related supplier of $2,000. The account receivable may be paid without tax consequences, provided that such account receivable is paid within 90 days after the date it is established (or deemed established). Such account receivable paid within such 90 days will be considered to relate to the taxable year in which the transaction occurred which gave rise thereto rather than the taxable year during which it is established or paid.
(ii) Payment must be in a form specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(iii) If an account receivable of a DISC described in subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(5) is not paid within 90 days of the date it is established (or deemed established), then, as of the end of the taxable year of the DISC in which the transaction occurred which gives rise to the indebtedness, the account receivable shall be treated as an asset except that, if the account receivable is established (or deemed established) in a taxable year of the DISC ending on or before August 15, 1975, at the taxpayer's option, the account receivable shall be treated as an asset as of the end of such taxable year. However, under § 1.993-2(d)(3), an account receivable referred to in the preceding sentence shall not be treated as a trade receivable or other qualified export asset.
(iv) An account receivable established in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall bear interest at an arm's length rate, computed in the manner provided by § 1.482-2(a)(2) from the day after the date the account receivable is deemed established to the date of payment. The interest so computed shall be accrued and included in the taxpayer's taxable income for each taxable year during which the account receivable is outstanding.
(v)(
a
) In lieu of establishing an account receivable in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph for all or part of an amount due a related supplier, the related supplier and DISC
are permitted to treat all or part of any distribution which was made by the DISC out of its previously taxed income with respect to the year to which the determination or redetermination relates as an additional payment of transfer price or repayment of commission (and not as a distribution) made as of the date the distribution was made. Any additional amount arising on the determination or redetermination due the related supplier after this treatment shall be represented by an account receivable established under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. To the extent that a distribution is so treated under this subdivision (v), it shall cease to qualify as distribution for any Federal income tax purpose, and the DISC's account for previously taxed income shall be adjusted accordingly. If all or part of any distribution made to a shareholder other than the related supplier is recharacterized under this subdivision (v), the related supplier shall establish an account receivable from that shareholder for the amount so recharacterized. Such account receivable shall be paid in the time and manner set forth in this paragraph (e)(5). In order to obtain the relief provided by this subdivision (v), the conditions and procedures prescribed by Revenue Procedure 84-3 must be met. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(5)(v) shall apply to all open taxable years ending after December 31, 1971.
(
b
) If, for example, during 1982, a DISC commission from a related supplier with respect to a transaction completed in 1980 was redetermined to be $1,000 less than the commission actually charged by, and paid to, the DISC, the amount of any distribution previously made by the DISC from its 1980 previously taxed income to the related supplies as a shareholder may, to the extent of $1,000, be treated not as a distribution but as a repayment of the commission.
(vi) The procedure for adjustments to transfer price provided by this subparagraph does not apply to incomplete transactions described in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(
b
) of this section. Such procedure will, however, be applied to any such transaction with respect to the taxable year in which the transaction is completed.
(6)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) During 1975, a DISC which uses the calendar year as its taxable year purchased a product from its related supplier and made an initial payment of $8,500. If $8,500 were determined to be the transfer price under section 994, the DISC's taxable income from the transaction would be $1,000. Immediately before the DISC filed its return for 1975, under section 994 it is determined that the transfer price is $8,000 and the DISC's taxable income is $1,500. Thus, the requirement of a reasonable estimate under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph was met because the amount ($8,500) actually paid resulted in the DISC realizing taxable income of $1,000 which is not less than 50 percent of the DISC's taxable income ($1,500) from the transaction as determined under section 994.
(ii) Pursuant to subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, an account receivable due the DISC for $500, i.e., $8,500−$8,000, is established on September 15, 1976, the date the DISC files its return for 1975, and is paid on December 1, 1976. The account receivable for $500 will be considered to relate to the taxable year (1975) in which the transaction occurred which gave rise thereto and will be a qualified export asset under § 1.993-2(d)(3) for the last day of such year.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the account receivable for $500 is paid on January 1, 1977. The account receivable for $500 will still be considered to relate to the taxable year (1975) in which the transaction occurred which gave rise thereto. However, such account receivable will be treated as an asset which is not a qualified export asset under § 1.993-2(d)(3) for the last day of such year.
(f)
Export promotion expenses
—(1)
Purpose of expense.
(i) In order for an expense or cost of a type described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to be an export promotion expense, the expense or cost must be incurred or treated as incurred by the DISC (under subparagraph (7) of this paragraph) to advance the sale, lease, or other distribution of export property for use, consumption, or distribution outside the United States. Costs of services in performing installation (but not assembly) on the site and for meeting warranty commitments if such services are related and subsidiary (within the meaning of § 1.993-1(d)) to any qualified sale, lease, or other distribution of export property by the DISC (or with respect to which
the DISC received a commission) will be considered to advance the sale, lease, or other distribution of export property. General and administrative expenses attributable to billing customers, other clerical functions of the DISC, or generally operating the DISC, will also be considered to advance the sale, lease, or other distribution of export property.
(ii) Where an expense or cost incurred or treated as incurred by the DISC qualifies only in part as an export promotion expense, such expense or cost must be allocated between the qualified portion and such other portion on a reasonable basis. See § 1.994-2(b)(2) for the option of the related supplier not to claim expenses as export promotion expenses.
(2)
Types of expenses.
The only expenses or costs which may be export promotion expenses are those expenses or costs meeting the test of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph which constitute—
(i) Ordinary and necessary expenses of the DISC paid or incurred during the DISC's taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, allowable as deductions under section 162, such as expenses for market studies, advertising, salaries and wages (including contributions or compensations deductible under section 404) of sales, clerical, and other personnel, rentals on property, sales commissions, warehousing, and other selling expenses,
(ii) A reasonable allowance under section 167 for exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence of the property of the DISC,
(iii) Costs of freight (subject to the limitations of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph),
(iv) Costs of packaging for export (as defined in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph), or
(v) Costs of designing and labeling packages exclusively for export markets (under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph).
(3)
Ineligible expenses.
Items ineligible to be export promotion expenses include, for example, interest expenses, bad debt expenses, freight insurance, State and local income and franchise taxes, the cost of manufacture or assembly operations, and items of cost of goods sold (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph in the case of certain freight, packaging, and designing and labeling expenses). Income or similar taxes eligible for a foreign tax credit under sections 901 and 903 are also not eligible to be export promotion expenses.
(4)
Freight expenses
—(i)
In general.
Export promotion expenses include one-half of the freight expense (not including insurance) for shipping export property aboard a U.S.-flag carrier in those cases where law or regulation of the United States or of any State or political subdivision thereof or of any agency or instrumentality of any of these does not require that the export property be shipped aboard a U.S.-flag carrier. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “freight expense” includes charges paid for c.o.d. service, miscellaneous ground charges, such as charges incurred for services normally performed by U.S.-flag carriers, charges for services of loading aboard U.S.-flag carriers normally performed by such carriers, freight forwarders, or independent contractors engaged in loading property, and charges attributable to a freight consolidation function normally performed by freight forwarders. In order for one-half of freight expenses paid to the owner (or the agent of the owner) of a U.S.-flag carrier to be claimed as an export promotion expense, the DISC must obtain a written statement (such as, for example, a bill of lading) from the owner (or the agent) disclosing that the export property was shipped aboard the owner's U.S.-flag carrier or another U.S.-flag carrier, and the DISC must have no reasonable basis for disbelieving such statement of the owner (or the agent). For the requirement of a written statement from a freight forwarder, see subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.
(ii)
U.S.-flag carrier defined.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “U.S.-flag carrier” is an airplane owned and operated by a U.S. person or persons (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) or a ship documented under the laws of the United States. Shipment initiated by delivery to the U.S. Postal Service shall be considered shipment aboard a U.S.-flag carrier, but
not if shipped to a place to which mail shipments from the United States are ordinarily accomplished by land transportation, such as to Canada or Mexico, unless airmail is specified.
(iii)
Shipment pursuant to law or regulation.
Shipment pursuant to law or regulation includes instances where a U.S.-flag carrier must be used in order to obtain permission from the Government to make the export. If the law or regulation requires a fixed portion of the export property to be shipped aboard a U.S.-flag carrier, the freight expense on that portion of such export property that was so shipped in order to satisfy such requirement cannot qualify as an export promotion expense.
(iv)
Freight forwarders.
A payment to a freight forwarder shall be considered freight expense within the meaning of this paragraph to the extent the forwarder utilizes a U.S.-flag carrier. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “freight forwarder” includes air freight consolidators and carriers owned and operated by U.S. persons utilizing U.S.- flag carriers such as non-vessel-owning common carriers. In order for one-half of freight expenses paid to a freight forwarder to be claimed as export promotion expenses, the DISC must obtain a written statement (such as, for example, a bill of lading) from the freight forwarder disclosing that the export property was shipped aboard a U.S.-flag carrier, and the DISC must have no reasonable basis for disbelieving such statement of the freight forwarder.
(v)
Freight within the United States.
A DISC may not claim as export promotion expense any amount that is attributable to carriage of export property between points within the United States. If, however, export property is carried from the United States to a foreign country on a through shipment pursuant to a single bill of lading or similar document aboard one or more U.S.-flag carriers, the freight expense of such carriage shall not be apportioned between the domestic and foreign portions of such carriage, even though a carrier may stop en route within the United States or the export property may be shifted from one carrier to another, and one-half of such freight expense may be claimed as an export promotion expense. Freight expense does not include the cost of transporting the export property to the depot of the U.S.-flag carrier or freight forwarder for shipment abroad. The expense of shipment of export property initiated by delivery to the U.S. Postal Service for ultimate delivery outside the United States shall be considered as attributable entirely to carriage of such property outside the United States.
(5)
Packaging for export.
(i) Export promotion expenses include the direct and indirect cost of packaging export property (including the cost of the package) for export whether or not the packaging is the same as domestic packaging. Such packaging costs do not include costs of manufacturing (as defined in the regulations under section 993) and assembly. Thus, if a DISC buys and packages export property for resale, its costs of packaging the export property are export promotion expenses. If, however, the process of such packaging by the DISC is physically integrated with the process of manufacturing the export property by the related supplier, the costs of such packaging are not export promotion expenses.
(ii) The cost of containers leased from a shipping company to which the DISC also pays freight for the property packaged is not a cost of packaging. However, in such circumstances, one-half of the rental charge may be allowable as a freight expense if permitted under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(6)
Designing and labeling packages.
Export promotion expenses include the direct and indirect costs of designing and labeling packages, including bottles, cans, jars, boxes, cartons, or containers, to the extent incurred for export markets. Thus, for example, to the extent incurred for supplying export markets, the cost of designing labels in a foreign language and the cost of printing such labels are export promotion expenses.
(7)
DISC must incur export promotion expenses
—(i)
In general.
In order for an expense to be an export promotion expense it must be incurred or treated as incurred under this subparagraph by the DISC. For example, an expense is
incurred by a DISC if the expense results from (
a
) the DISC incurring an obligation to pay compensation to its employees, (
b
) depreciation of property owned by the DISC and used by its employees, (
c
) the DISC incurring an obligation to pay for office supplies used by its employees, (
d
) the DISC incurring an obligation to pay space costs for use by its employees, or (
e
) the DISC incurring an obligation to pay other costs supporting efforts by its employees.
(ii)
Payments to independent contractors.
A payment to an independent contractor, directly or indirectly, is treated as incurred by the DISC if the cost of performing the function performed by the independent contractor would be considered an export promotion expense described in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph if performed by the DISC, and if, in a case where the services of the independent contractor were engaged by a party related to the DISC, such related party and such DISC agreed in writing before the contract was entered into that a specified portion or all of the contract was for the benefit of the DISC and that all of the expenses of the contract (eligible to be considered as export promotion expenses) with respect to such portion would be borne by the DISC.
(iii)
Expenses incurred by related parties.
Reimbursements or other payments by a DISC to a related party are export promotion expenses only if the expenses of the related party for which reimbursement is made are for space in a building actually used by employees of the DISC or for export property owned by the DISC. Except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence, expenses incurred by a foreign international sales corporation (FISC) or a real property holding company (as defined in section 993(e)(1) and (2), respectively) shall not be treated as export promotion expenses of its DISC.
(iv)
Selling commissions paid by a DISC.
A commission paid by a DISC to a person other than a related person, with respect to a transaction which gives rise to qualified export receipts of the DISC, is an export promotion expense of the DISC. A commission paid by a DISC to a related person is not an export promotion expense.
(v)
Sales of promotional material.
If a DISC sells promotional material to a buyer of export property from the DISC at a price which is greater than the costs of the DISC for such material, such costs are not export promotion expenses. If, however, the DISC sells promotional material at a price which is less than its costs for such material, the excess of such costs over such price is an export promotion expense. For rules relating to the status of promotional material as qualified export assets and export property, see §§ 1.993-2 and 1.993-3, respectively.
(vi) An expense may be incurred by the DISC under subdivisions (i) through (v) of this subparagraph even if the accounting for and payment of such expense is handled by a related party and the DISC reimburses the related party for such expenses.
(8)
Incomplete transactions.
Expenses eligible to be treated as export promotion expenses which are attributable to the sale, lease, or other distribution of export property and which are incurred prior to the taxable year of sale, lease, or other distribution by the DISC are not treated as export promotion expenses until the taxable year of sale, lease, or other distribution or until the taxable year in which it is first determined that no transaction is reasonably expected to result from the expense incurred (whether or not a transaction subsequently results). Thus, for example, if a DISC incurs a packaging cost which is otherwise eligible to be treated as an export promotion expense, the DISC may not include such charge as an export promotion expense until the year in which the export property with respect to which the packaging cost was incurred is actually sold by the DISC. If no transaction is reasonably expected to result from the packaging cost, such cost should be allocated as an export promotion expense to the group of transactions to which such cost is most closely related.
(g)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
J and K are calendar year taxpayers. J, a domestic manufacturing company, owns all the stock of K, a DISC for the taxable year. During 1972, J manufactures
only 100 units of a product (which is eligible to be export property as defined in section 993(c)). J enters into a written agreement with K whereby K is granted a sales franchise with respect to exporting such property and K will receive commissions with respect to such exports equal to the maximum amount permitted to be received under the intercompany pricing rules of section 994. Thereafter, the 100 units are sold for $1,000. J's cost of goods sold attributable to the 100 units is $650. J's direct selling expenses so attributable are $100. Although J has other deductible expenses, for purposes of this example assume that J has no other deductible expenses. K pays $230 to independent contractors which qualify as export promotion expenses under paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section. K does not perform functions substantial enough to entitle it to an allocation of income which meets the arm's length standard of section 482. The income which K may earn under section 994 under the franchise is $20, computed as follows:
(1) Combined taxable income:
(a) K's sales price
$1,000
(b) Less deductions:
J's cost of goods sold
$650
J's direct selling expenses
100
K's export promotion expenses
230
Total deductions
980
(c) Combined taxable income
20
(2) K's profit under combined taxable income method (before application of loss limitation):
(a) 50 percent of combined taxable income
10
(b) Plus: 10 percent of K's export promotion expenses (10% of $230)
23
(c) K's profit
33
(3) K's profit under gross receipts method (before application of loss limitation):
(a) 4 percent of K's sales price (4% of $1,000)
40
(b) Plus: 10 percent of K's export promotion expenses (10% of $230)
23
(c) K's profit
63
Since combined taxable income ($20) is lower than both K's profit under the combined taxable income method ($33) and under the gross receipts method ($63), the maximum income K may earn is $20. Accordingly, the commissions K may receive from J are $250,
i.e.,
K's expenses ($230) plus K's profit ($20).

# Example 2.
M and N are calendar year taxpayers. M, a domestic manufacturing company, owns all the stock of N, a DISC for the taxable year. During 1972, M produces and sells a particular product line of export property to N for $75, a price which can be justified as satisfying the standard of arm's length price of section 482. N performs substantial functions with respect to the transaction and resells the export property for $100. M's cost of goods sold attributable to the export property is $60. M's direct selling expenses so attributable (relating to advertising of the product line in foreign markets) are $12. Although M has other deductible expenses, for purposes of this example, assume that M has no other deductible expenses. N's expenses attributable to resale of the export property are $22 of which $20 are export promotion expenses. The maximum profit which N may earn with respect to the product line is $6, computed as follows:
(1) Combined taxable income:
(a) N's sales price
$100
(b) Less deductions:
M's cost of goods sold
$60
M's direct selling expenses

(2) N's profit under combined taxable income method (before application of loss limitation):
(a) 50 percent of combined taxable income

(b) Plus: 10 percent of N's export promotion expenses (10% of $20)
2
(c) N's profit
5
(3) N's profit under gross receipts method (before application of loss limitation):
(a) 4 percent of N's sales price (4% of $100)
4
(b) Plus: 10 percent of N's export promotion expenses (10% of $20)
2
(c) N's profit

(4) N's profit under section 482 method:
(a) N's sales price

(b) Less deductions:
N's cost of goods sold (price paid by N to M)
75
N's expenses
22
Total deductions
97
(c) N's profit
3
Since the gross receipts method results in greater profit to N ($6) than does the combined taxable income method ($5) or section 482 method ($3), and does not exceed combined taxable income ($6), N may earn a maximum profit of $6. Accordingly, the transfer price from M to N may be readjusted as long as the transfer price is not readjusted below $72, computed as follows:
(5) Transfer price from M to N:
(a) N's sales price

# Example 3.
Q and R are calendar year taxpayers. Q, a domestic manufacturing company, owns all the stock of R, a DISC for the taxable year. During 1972, Q produces and sells a product line of export property to R
for $170, a price which can be justified as satisfying the standards of arm's length price of section 482, and R resells the export property for $200. Q's cost of goods sold attributable to the export property is $115 so that the combined gross income from the sale of the export property is $85 (
i.e.,
$200 minus $115). Q's expenses incurred in connection with the property sold are $35. Q's deductible overhead and other supportive expenses allocable to all gross income are $6. Apportionment of these supportive expenses on the basis of gross income does not result in a material distortion of income and is a reasonable method of apportionment. Q's gross income from sources other than the transaction is $170 making total gross income of Q and R (excluding the transfer price paid by R) $255 (i.e., $85 plus $170). R's expenses attributable to resale of the export property are $20, all of which are export promotion expenses. The maximum profit which R may earn with respect to the product line is $16, computed as follows:
(1) Combined taxable income:
(a) R's sales price
$200
(b) Less deductions:
(i) Q's cost of goods sold
115
(ii) Q's expenses incurred in connection with the property sold

Since the combined taxable income method results in greater profit to R ($16) than does the gross receipts method ($10) or section 482 method ($10), and does not exceed combined taxable income ($28), R may earn a maximum profit of $16. Accordingly, the transfer price from Q to R may be readjusted as long as the transfer price is not readjusted below $164 computed as follows:

# Example 4.
S and T are calendar year taxpayers. S, a domestic manufacturing company, owns all the stock of T, a DISC for the taxable year. During 1972, S produces and sells 100 units of a particular product to T under a written agreement which provides that the transfer price between S and T shall be that price which allocates to T the maximum permitted to be received under the intercompany pricing rules of section 994. Thereafter, the 100 units are sold by T for $950. S's cost of goods sold attributable to the 100 units is $650. S's other deductible expenses so attributable are $300. Although S has other deductible expenses, for purposes of this example, assume that S has no deductible expenses not definitely allocable to any item of gross income. T's expenses attributable to the resale of the 100 units are $50. S chooses not to apply the section 482 method. T may not earn any income under the gross receipts or combined taxable income method with respect to resale of the 100 units because combined taxable income is a negative figure, computed as follows:
(1) Combined taxable income:
(a) T's sales price
$950
(b) Less deductions:
S's cost of goods sold
$650
S's expenses
300
T's expenses
50
Total deductions
1,000
(c) Combined taxable income (loss)
($50)
Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, T is permitted to recover its expenses attributable to the 100 units ($50) even though such recovery results in a loss or increased loss to the related supplier. Accordingly, the transfer price from S to T may be readjusted as long as the transfer price is not readjusted below $900, computed as follows:
(2) Transfer price from S to T:
(a) T's sales price
$950
(b) Less: T's expenses

(c) Transfer price

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in example 4 except that S chooses to apply the section 482 method and that under arm's length dealings T would have derived $10 of income. Accordingly, the transfer price from S to T may be set at an amount not less than $890, computed as follows:

# Example 6.
X and Y are calendar year taxpayers. X, a domestic manufacturing company, owns all the stock of Y, a DISC for the taxable year. During March 1972, X manufactures a particular product of export property which it leases on April 1, 1972, to Y for a term of 1 year at a monthly rental of $1,000, a rent which satisfies the standard of arm's length rental under section 482. Y subleases the product on April 1, 1972, for a term of 1 year at a monthly rental of $1,200. X's cost for the product leased is $40,000. X's other deductible expenses attributable to the product are $900, all of which are incurred in 1972. Although X has other deductible expenses, for purposes of this example, assume that X has no other deductible expenses. Y's expenses attributable to sublease of the export property are $450, all of which are incurred in 1972 and are export promotion expenses. X depreciates the property on a straight line basis without the use of an averaging convention, assuming a useful life of 8 years and no salvage value. The profit which Y may earn with respect to the transaction is $2,895 for 1972 and $1,175 for 1973, computed as follows:
computation for 1972
(1) Combined taxable income:
(a) Y's sublease rental receipts for year ($1,200 × 9 months)

Since the combined taxable income method results in greater profit to Y ($2,895) than does the gross receipts method ($477) or section 482 method ($1,350), Y may earn a profit of $2,895 for 1972. Accordingly, the monthly rental payable by Y to X for 1972 may be readjusted as long as the monthly rental payable is not readjusted below $828.33, computed as follows:

§ 1.994-2
Marginal costing rules.
(a)
In general.
This section prescribes the marginal costing rules authorized by section 994(b)(2). If under paragraph (c)(1) of this section a DISC is treated for its taxable year as seeking to establish or maintain a foreign market for sales of an item, product, or product line of export property (as defined in § 1.993-3) from which qualified export receipts are derived, the marginal costing rules prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section may be applied to allocate costs between gross receipts derived from such sales and other gross receipts for purposes of computing, under the “50-50” combined taxable income method of § 1.994-1(c)(3), the combined taxable income of the DISC and related supplier derived from such sales. Such marginal costing rules may be applied whether or not the related supplier manufactures, produces, grows, or extracts (within the meaning of § 1.993-3(c)) the export property sold. Such marginal costing rules do not apply to sales of export property which in the hands of a purchaser related under section 954(d)(3) to the seller give rise to foreign base company sales income as described in section 954(d) unless, for the purchaser's year in which it resells the export property, section 954(b)(3)(A) is applicable or such income is under the exceptions in section 954(b)(4). Such marginal costing rules do not apply to leases of property or the performance of any services whether or not related and subsidiary services (as defined in § 1.994-1(b)(3).
(b)
Marginal costing rules for allocations of costs
—(1)
In general.
Marginal costing is a method under which only marginal or variable costs of producing and selling a particular item, product, or product line are taken into account for purposes of section 994. Where this section is applicable, costs attributable to deriving qualified export receipts for the DISC's taxable year from sales of an item, product, or product line may be determined in any manner the related supplier (as defined in § 1.994-1(a)(3)(ii)) chooses, provided that the requirements of both subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph are met.
(2)
Variable costs taken into account.
There are taken into account in computing the combined taxable income of the DISC and its related supplier from sales of an item, product, or product line the following costs:
(i) Direct production costs (as defined in § 1.471-11(b)(2)(i)) and
(ii) Costs which are export promotion expenses, but only if they are claimed as export promotion expenses in determining taxable income derived by the DISC under the combined taxable income method of § 1.994-1(c)(3).
At the taxpayer's option, all, a part, or none of the costs which qualify as export promotion expenses may be so claimed as export promotion expenses.
(3)
Overall profit percentage limitation.
As a result of such determination of costs attributable to such qualified export receipts for the DISC's taxable year, the combined taxable income of the DISC and its related supplier from sales of such item, product, or product line for the DISC's taxable year does not exceed gross receipts (determined under § 1.993-6) of the DISC derived from such sales, multiplied by the overall profit percentage (determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section).
(c)
Definitions
—(1)
Establishing or maintaining a foreign market.
A DISC shall be treated for its taxable year as seeking to establish or maintain a foreign market with respect to sales of an item, product, or product line of export property from which qualified export receipts are derived if the combined taxable income computed under paragraph (b) of this section is greater than the combined taxable income computed under § 1.994-1(c)(6).
(2)
Overall profit percentage.
(i) For purposes of this section, the overall
profit percentage for a taxable year of the DISC for a product or product line is the percentage which—
(
a
) The combined taxable income of the DISC and its related supplier plus all other taxable income of its related supplier from all sales (domestic and foreign) of such product or product line during the DISC's taxable year, computed under the full costing method, is of
(
b
) The total gross receipts (determined under § 1.993-6) from all such sales.
(ii) At the annual option of the related supplier, the overall profit percentage for the DISC's taxable year for all products and product lines may be determined by aggregating the amounts described in subdivision (i) (
a
) and (
b
) of this subparagraph of the DISC, and all domestic members of the controlled group (as defined in § 1.993-1(k)) of which the DISC is a member, for the DISC's taxable year and for taxable years of such members ending with or within the DISC's taxable year.
(iii) For purposes of determining the amounts in subdivisions (i) (
b
) and (ii) of this subparagraph, a sale of property between a DISC and its related supplier or between domestic members of the controlled group shall be taken into account only during the DISC's taxable year (or taxable year of the member ending within the DISC's taxable year) during which the property is ultimately sold to a person which is neither the DISC nor such a domestic member.
(3)
Grouping of transactions.
(i) In general, for purposes of this section, an item, product, or product line is the item or group consisting of the product or product line pursuant to § 1.994-1(c)(7) used by the taxpayer for purposes of applying the intercompany pricing rules of § 1.994-1.
(ii) However, for purposes of determining the overall profit percentage under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, any product or product line grouping permissible under § 1.994-1(c)(7) may be used at the annual choice of the taxpayer, even though it may not be the same item or grouping referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, as long as the grouping chosen for determining the overall profit percentage is at least as broad as the grouping referred to in such subdivision (i).
(4)
Full costing method.
For purposes of this section, the term “full costing method” is the method for determining combined taxable income set forth in § 1.994-1(c)(6).
(d)
Application of limitation on DISC income (“no loss” rule).
If the marginal costing rules of this section are applied, the combined taxable income method of § 1.994-1(c)(3) may not be applied to cause in any taxable year a loss to the related supplier, but such method may be applied to the extent it does not cause a loss. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a loss to a related supplier would result if the taxable income of the DISC would exceed the combined taxable income of the related supplier and the DISC determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. If, however, there is no combined taxable income (so determined), see the last sentence of § 1.994-1(e)(1)(i).
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X and Y are calendar year taxpayers. X, a domestic manufacturing company, owns all the stock of Y, a DISC for the taxable year. During 1973, X manufactures a product line which is eligible to be export property (as defined in § 1.993-3). X enters into a written agreement with Y whereby Y is granted a sales franchise with respect to exporting such product line from which qualified export receipts will be derived and Y will receive commissions with respect to such exports equal to the maximum amount permitted to be received under the intercompany pricing rules of section 994. Commissions are computed using the combined taxable income method under § 1.994-1(c)(3). For purposes of applying the combined taxable income method, X and Y compute their combined taxable income attributable to the product line of export property under the marginal costing rules in accordance with the additional facts assumed in the table below:
(1) Maximum combined taxable income (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section):
(a) Y's gross receipts from export sales
$95.00
(b) Less:
(i) Direct materials
40.00
(ii) Direct labor
20.00
(iii) Y's export promotion expenses claimed in determining Y's DISC taxable income
5.00
(iv) Total deductions
65.00
(c) Maximum combined taxable income
30.00
(2) Overall profit percentage limitation (determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section):
(a) Gross receipts of X and Y from all domestic and foreign sales
400.00
(b) Less deductions:
(i) Direct materials
160.00
(ii) Direct labor
80.00
(iii) Other costs (of which $8 are costs of the DISC including $5 of export promotion expenses claimed in determining Y's taxable income)
40.00
(c) Total deductions
280.00
(d) Total taxable income from all sales computed on a full costing method
120.00
(e) Overall profit percentage (line (d) ($120) divided by line (a) ($400)) (percent)
30%
(f) Multiply by gross receipts from Y's export sales (line (1)(a))
$95.00
(g) Overall profit percentage limitations
28.50
Since the overall profit percentage limitation under line (2)(g) ($28.50) is less than maximum combined taxable income under line (1)(c) ($30), combined taxable income under marginal costing is limited to $28.50. Since under the franchise agreement Y is to earn the maximum commission permitted under the intercompany pricing rules of section 994, combined taxable income on the transactions is $28.50. Accordingly, the costs attributable to export sales (other than for direct material, direct labor, and export promotion expenses) are $1.50,
i.e.,
line (1)(c) ($30) minus line (2)(g) ($28.50). Under the combined taxable income method of § 1.994-1 (c)(3), Y will have taxable income attributable to the sales of $14.75, i.e., the sum of
1/2
of combined taxable income (1/2 of $28.50) and 10 percent of Y's export promotion expenses claimed in determining Y's taxable income (10 percent of $5). Accordingly, the commissions Y receives from X are $22.75, i.e., Y's costs ($8, see line (2)(b)(iii)) plus Y's profit ($14.75).

# Example 2.
(1) Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that gross receipts from export sales are only $85 and gross receipts from all sales remain at $400. For purposes of applying the combined taxable income method, X and Y may compute their combined taxable income attributable to the product line of export property under the marginal costing rules as follows:
(1) Maximum combined taxable income (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section):
(a) Y's gross receipts from export sales
$85.00
(b) Less:
(i) Direct materials
40.00
(ii) Direct labor
20.00
(iii) Y's export promotion expenses claimed in determining Y's taxable income
5.00
(iv) Total deductions
65.00
(c) Maximum combined taxable income
20.00
(2) Overall profit percentage limitation (determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section):
(a) Gross receipts from Y's export sales (line (1)(a))
85.00
(b) Multiply by overall profit percentage (as determined in example 1) (percent)
30%
(c) Overall profit percentage limitation
25.50
Since maximum combined taxable income under line (1)(c) ($20) is less than the overall profit percentage limitation under line (2)(c) ($25.50), combined taxable income under marginal costing is limited to $20. Since under the franchise agreement Y is to earn the maximum commission permitted under the intercompany pricing rules of section 994, combined taxable income on the transactions is $20. Accordingly, no costs (other than for direct material, direct labor, and export promotion expenses) will be attributed to export sales. Under the combined taxable income method of § 1.994-1(c)(3), Y will have taxable income attributable to the sales of $10.50, i.e., the sum of
1/2
of combined taxable income (1/2 of $20) and 10 percent of Y's export promotion expenses claimed in determining Y's taxable income (10 percent of $5). Accordingly, the Commissions Y receives from X are $18.50,
i.e.,
Y's costs ($8, see line (2)(b)(iii) of example 1) plus Y's profit ($10.50).
(2) If export promotion expenses are not claimed in determining taxable income of Y under the combined taxable income method, the taxable income of Y would be increased to $12.50 and commissions payable to Y would be increased to $20.50, computed as follows:
(3) Maximum combined taxable income (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section):
(a) Y's gross receipts from export sales
$85.00
(b) Less:
(i) Direct materials
40.00
(ii) Direct labor
20.00
(iii) Total deductions
60.00
(c) Maximum combined taxable income
25.00
(4) Overall profit percentage limitation (line (2)(c))
25.50
Since maximum combined taxable income under line (3)(c) ($25) is less than the overall profit percentage under line (4) ($25.50), combined taxable income under marginal costing is limited to $25. Since under the franchise agreement Y is to earn the maximum commission permitted under the intercompany pricing rules of section 994, combined taxable income on the transactions is $25. Accordingly, no costs (other than for direct material and direct labor) will be attributed to
export sales. Under the combined taxable income method of § 1.994-1(c)(3), Y will have taxable income attributable to the sales of $12.50, i.e.,
1/2
of combined taxable income (
1/2
of $25). Accordingly, the commissions Y receives from X are $20.50,
i.e.,
Y's costs ($8, see line (2)(b)(iii) of example 1) plus Y's profit ($12.50).

# Example 3.
(1) Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that gross receipts from export sales are only $85, gross receipts from all sales remain at $400, and Y has costs of $40 consisting of Y's export promotion expenses of $35 and costs of $5 other than for direct material, direct labor, or export promotion expenses. For purposes of applying the combined taxable income method, X and Y may compute their combined taxable income attributable to the product line of export property under the marginal costing rules as follows:
(1) Maximum combined taxable income (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section):
(a) Y's gross receipts from export sales
$85.00
(b) Less:
(i) Direct materials
40.00
(ii) Direct labor
20.00
(iii) Y's export promotion expenses claimed in determining Y's taxable income
35.00
(iv) Total deductions
95.00
(c) Maximum combined taxable income (loss)
(10.00)
(2) Overall profit percentage limitation (as determined in example 2)
25.50
Since maximum combined taxable income under line (1)(c) (which is a loss of $10) is less than the overall profit percentage limitation under line (2)(c) ($25.50), combined taxable income under marginal costing is a loss of $10 and, under the combined taxable income method of § 1.994-1(c)(3), Y will have no taxable income or loss attributable to the sales. Accordingly, the commissions Y receives from X are $40,
i.e.,
Y's costs ($40).
(2) If export promotion expenses are not claimed in determining Y's taxable income under the combined taxable income method, the taxable income of Y would be increased to $12.50 and commissions payable to Y would be increased to $52.50 computed as follows:
(3) Maximum combined taxable income (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) (line (3)(c) of example 2)
$25.00
(4) Overall profit percentage limitation (as determined in example 2)
25.50
The results would be the same as in part (2) of example 2, except that the commissions Y receives from X are $52.50,
i.e.,
Y's costs ($40) plus Y's profit ($12.50).

§ 1.995-1
Taxation of DISC income to shareholders.
(a)
In general.
(1) Under § 1.991-1(a), a corporation which is a DISC for a taxable year is not subject to any tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code (sections 1 through 1564) for the taxable year, except for the tax imposed by chapter 5 thereof (sections 1491 through 1494) on certain transfers to avoid tax.
(2) Under section 995(a), the shareholders of a DISC, or a former DISC, are subject to taxation on the earnings and profits of the DISC in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Code generally applicable to shareholders, but subject to the modifications provided in sections 995, 996, and 997.
(3) Under § 1.996-3, three divisions of earnings and profits of a DISC, or former DISC, are defined: “accumulated DISC income”, “previously taxed income”, and “other earnings and profits”. Under § 1.995-2, certain amounts of the DISC's earnings and profits are deemed to be distributed as dividends to shareholders of the DISC at the close of the DISC's taxable year in which such earnings were derived. Such deemed distributions do not cause a reduction in the DISC's earnings and profits, but are taken into account in § 1.996-3(c) as an increase in previously taxed income. To the extent the DISC's earnings and profits are paid out in a subsequent distribution which is, under § 1.996-1, treated as made out of such “previously taxed income,” they will not be taxable to the shareholders a second time.
(4) In general, “accumulated DISC income” is the earnings and profits of the DISC which have not been deemed distributed and which may be deferred from taxation so long as they are not actually distributed with respect to its stock. However, deferral of taxation on “accumulated DISC income” may be terminated, in whole or in part, in the event of: (i) Certain foreign investment attributable to producer's loans (see § 1.995-2(a)(5) and § 1.995-5); (ii) revocation of the election to be treated as a DISC or other disqualification (see § 1.995-3); and (iii) certain dispositions of DISC stock in which gain is realized (see § 1.995-4).
(5) Since a DISC is not taxed on its taxable income, section 246(d) and § 1.246-4 provide that the deduction otherwise allowed under section 243 shall not be allowed with respect to a dividend from a DISC, or former DISC, paid or treated as paid out of accumulated DISC income or previously taxed income or with respect to a deemed distribution in a qualified year under § 1.995-2(a).
(b)
Amounts and character of amounts includible in shareholder's gross income.
Each shareholder of a corporation which is a DISC, or former DISC, shall include in his gross income—
(1) Amounts actually distributed to him that are includible in his gross income in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) Amounts which, pursuant to § 1.995-2, he is deemed to receive as a distribution taxable as a dividend on the last day of each of the corporation's taxable years for which it qualifies as a DISC,
(3) Amounts which, pursuant to § 1.995-3, he is deemed to receive as a distribution taxable as a dividend in the event the corporation revokes its election to be treated as a DISC or otherwise is disqualified as a DISC, and
(4) Gain realized on certain dispositions of stock in the corporation which, under § 1.995-4, is includible in his gross income as a dividend.
(c)
Treatment of actual distributions.
(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, amounts actually distributed to a shareholder of a DISC, or former DISC, with respect to his stock are includible in his gross income in accordance with section 301.
(2) Since a deemed distribution does not reduce the earnings and profits of a DISC, it does not affect the determination as to whether a subsequent actual distribution is a “dividend” under section 316(a). Since, however, the amount of a deemed distribution increases “previously taxed income”, it does affect the determination as to whether a subsequent actual distribution is excluded (as described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) from gross income.
(3) Under § 1.996-1(c), the amount of any actual distribution (including a deficiency distribution made pursuant to § 1.992-3), with respect to stock in a DISC, or former DISC, which is treated under § 1.996-1 as made out of previously taxed income, is excluded by the distributee from gross income, but only to the extent that such amount does not exceed the adjusted basis of the distributee's stock. Under § 1.996-5(b), that portion of any actual distribution which is treated as made out of previously taxed income shall be applied against and reduce the adjusted basis of the stock and, to the extent that it exceeds the adjusted basis of the stock, it shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property.
(4) A deficiency distribution pursuant to § 1.992-3 may be made after the close of the DISC's taxable year with respect to which it is made. The determinations as to whether such deficiency distribution is a dividend under section 301 and as to which division of earnings and profits is the source thereof depend upon the status of the DISC's earnings and profits account and divisions thereof at the time the distribution is actually made. See § 1.996-1(d) for the priority of such deficiency distribution over other actual distributions made during the same taxable year.
(d)
Personal holding company income.
(1) Any amount includible in a shareholder's gross income as a dividend with respect to the stock of a DISC, or former DISC, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be treated as a dividend for all purposes of the Code, except that for purposes of determining whether such shareholder is a personal holding company within the meaning of section 542 any amount deemed distributed for qualified years under § 1.995-2 or upon disqualification under § 1.995-3, any amount of gain on certain dispositions of DISC stock to which § 1.995-4 applies, and any amount treated under § 1.996-1 as distributed out of accumulated DISC income or previously taxed income shall not be treated as a dividend or any other kind of income described in section 543(a).
(2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the shareholder may treat as an item of income described under section 543 (for example, rents) any amount to which the exception in
such subparagraph (1) applies, if it establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that such amount is attributable to earnings and profits derived from such item of income.
[T.D. 7324, 39 FR 35109, Sept. 30, 1974]
§ 1.995-2
Deemed distributions in qualified years.
(a)
General rule.
Under section 995 (b)(1), each shareholder of a DISC shall be treated as having received a distribution taxable as a dividend with respect to his stock on the last day of each taxable year of the DISC, in an amount which is equal to his pro rata share of the sum (as limited by paragraph (b) of this section), of the following seven items:
(1) An amount equal to the gross interest derived by the DISC during such year from producer's loans (as defined in § 1.993-4).
(2) An amount equal to the lower of—
(i) Any gain recognized by the DISC during such year on the sale or exchange of property (other than property which in the hands of the DISC is a qualified export asset) which was previously transferred to it in a transaction in which the transferor realized gain which was not recognized in whole or in part, or
(ii) The amount of the transferor's gain which was not recognized on the previous transfer of the property to the DISC.
For purposes of this subparagraph, each item of property shall be considered separately. See paragraph (d) of this section for special rules with respect to certain tax-free acquisitions of property by the DISC.
(3) An amount equal to the lower of—
(i) Any gain recognized by the DISC during such year on the sale or exchange of property which in the hands of the DISC is a qualified export asset (other than stock in trade or property described in section 1221(1)) and which was previously transferred to the DISC in a transaction in which the transferor realized gain which was not recognized in whole or in part, or
(ii) The amount of the transferor's gain which was not recognized on the previous transfer of the property to the DISC and which would have been includible in the transferor's gross income as ordinary income if its entire realized gain had been recognized upon the transfer.
For purposes of this subparagraph, each item of property shall be considered separately. See paragraph (d) of this section for special rules with respect to certain tax-free acquisitions of property by the DISC.
(4) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, an amount equal to 50 percent of the taxable income of the DISC for the taxable years attributable to military property (as defined in § 1.995-6).
(5) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, the taxable income for the taxable year attributable to base period export gross receipts (as defined in § 1.995-7).
(6) The sum of—
(i)(A) In the case of a corporate share holder, an amount equal to 57.5 percent of the excess (if any) (one-half for DISCs' taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983) of the taxable income of the DISC for such year (computed as provided in § 1.991-1(b)(1)) over the sum of the amounts deemed distributed for the taxable year in accordance with subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this paragraph, or
(B) In the case of a non-corporate share holder, an amount equal to one-half of the excess (if any) of the taxable income of the DISC for such year (computed as provided in § 1.991-1(b)(1)) over the sum of the amounts deemed distributed for the taxable year in accordance with subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this paragraph.
(ii)(A) An amount equal to the amount under subdivision (i) of paragraph (a)(6) of this section multiplied by the international boycott factor as determined under section 999 (c)(1) , or
(B) In lieu of the amount determined under subdivision (ii)(A) of paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the amount described under section 999 (c)(2) of such international boycott income, and
(iii) An amount equal to the sum of any illegal bribes, kickbacks, or other payments paid by or on behalf of the DISC directly or indirectly to an official, employee, or agent in fact of a government. An amount is paid by a
DISC where it is paid by any officer, director, employee, shareholder, or agent of the DISC for the benefit of such DISC. For purposes of this section, the principles of section 162 (c) and the regulations thereunder shall apply. The fair market value of an illegal payment made in the form of property or services shall be considered the amount of such illegal payment.
(7) The amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans of the DISC, as of the close of the “group taxable year” ending with such taxable year of the DISC, determined in accordance with § 1.995-5. The amount of such foreign investment attributable to producer's loans so determined for any taxable year of a former DISC shall be deemed distributed as a dividend to the shareholders of such former DISC on the last day of such taxable year. See § 1.995-3(e) for the effect that such deemed distribution has on scheduled installments of deemed distributions of accumulated DISC income under § 1.995-3(a) upon disqualification.
(b)
Limitation on amount of deemed distributions under section 995(b)(1).
(1) The sum of the amounts described in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section which is deemed distributed pro rata to the DISC's shareholders a dividend for any taxable year of the corporation shall not exceed the DISC's earnings and profits for such year.
(2) The amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans of the DISC (as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section) which is deemed to be distributed pro rata to the DISC's shareholders as dividends for any taxable year of the corporation shall not exceed the lower of the corporation's accumulated DISC income at the beginning of such year or the corporation's accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of such year (but not less than zero)—
(i) Increased by any DISC income of the corporation for such year as defined in § 1.996-3(b)(2) (
i.e.,
any excess of the DISC's earnings and profits for such year over the sum of the amounts described in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section), or
(ii) Decreased by any deficit in the corporation's earnings and profits for such year.
Thus, for example, if a DISC has a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of a taxable year of $10,000, current earnings and profits of $12,000, no amounts described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section for the year, and foreign investment attributable to producer's loans for the taxable year of $5,000, the DISC would have a deemed distribution described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section of $5,000 for the taxable year. On the other hand, suppose the DISC had accumulated earnings and profits of $13,000 at the beginning of the taxable year, accumulated DISC income of $10,000 at the beginning of the taxable year, a deficit in earnings and profits for the taxable year of $12,000, no amounts described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section for the taxable year, and foreign investment attributable to producer's loans for the taxable year of $5,000. Under these facts the DISC would have no deemed distribution described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section because the corporation had no DISC income for the taxable year and the current year's deficit in earnings and profits subtracted from the DISC's accumulated DISC income at the beginning of the year produces a negative amount. For rules relating to the carryover to a subsequent year of the $5,000 of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans, see § 1.995-5(a)(6).
(3) If, by reason of the limitation in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, less than the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section is deemed distributed, then the portion of such sum which is deemed distributed shall be attributed first to the amount described in subparagraph (1) of such paragraph, to the extent thereof; second to the amount described in subparagraph (2) of such paragraph, to the extent thereof; third to the amount described in subparagraph (3) of such paragraph, to the extent thereof; and so forth, and finally to the amount described in paragraph (b)(6) of this paragraph.
(c)
Examples.
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Y is a corporation which uses the calendar year as its taxable year and
which elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. X is its sole shareholder. In 1972, X transfers certain property to Y in exchange for Y's stock in a transaction in which X does not recognize gain or loss by reason of the application of section 351(a). Included in the property transferred to Y is depreciable property described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section on which X realizes, but does not recognize by reason of the application of section 1245(b)(3), a gain of $20,000. If X had sold such property for cash, the $20,000 gain would have been recognized as ordinary income under section 1245. Also included in the transfer to Y is 100 shares of stock in a third corporation (which is not a related foreign export corporation) on which X realizes, but does not recognize, a gain of $5,000. In 1973, Y sells such property and recognizes a gain of $25,000 on the depreciable property and $8,000 on the 100 shares of stock. Y has accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of 1973 of $5,000, earnings and profits for 1973 of $72,000, and taxable income for 1973 of $100,000. At the beginning of 1973, Y has $6,000 of accumulated DISC income, no previously taxed income, and a deficit of $1,000 of other earnings and profits. Under these facts and the additional facts assumed in the table below, X is treated as having received a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend of $76,000 on December 31, 1973, determined as follows:
(1) Gross interest derived by Y in 1973 from producer's loans
$7,000
(2) Amount of gain on depreciable property (lower of Y's recognized gain ($25,000) or X's gain not recognized on section 1245 property ($20,000))
20,000
(3) Amount of gain on stock (lower of X's gain not recognized or Y's recognized gain ($8,000) ($5,000))
5,000
(4) One-half excess of taxable income for 1973 over the sum of lines (1), (2), and (3) (1/2 of ($100,000 minus $32,000))
34,000
(5) Limitation on lines (1) through (4):
(a) Sum of lines (1) through (4)
66,000
(b) Earnings and profits for 1973
72,000
(c) Lower of lines (a) and (b)
66,000
(6) Amount under paragraph (a)(5) of this section:
(a) Foreign investment attributable to producer's loans under § 1.995-5
10,000
(b) Sum of the lower of accumulated earnings and profits at beginning of 1973 ($5,000) or accumulated DISC income at beginning of 1973 ($6,000) and excess of earnings and profits for 1973 over line (5)(c) ($72,000 minus $66,000)
11,000
(c) Lower of lines (a) and (b)
10,000
(7) Total deemed distribution (sum of lines (5)(c) and (6)(c))
76,000

# Example 2.
Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except that earnings and profits for 1973 amount to only $60,000. Under these facts, X is treated as receiving a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend of $65,000 on December 31, 1973, determined as follows:
(5) Limitation on lines (1) through (4):
(a) Line (5)(a) of example 1
$66,000
(b) Earnings and profits for 1973
60,000
(c) Lower of lines (a) and (b)
60,000
(6) Amount under paragraph (a)(5) of this section:
(a) Line (6)(a) of example 1
10,000
(b) Sum of the lower of accumulated earnings and profits at beginning of 1973 ($5,000) or accumulated DISC income at beginning of 1973 ($6,000) plus excess of earnings and profits for 1973 over line (5)(c) ($60,000 minus $60,000)
5,000
(c) Lower of lines (a) and (b)
5,000
(7) Total deemed distribution (sum of lines (5)(c) and (6)(c))
65,000

# Example 3.
Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except that Y has a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of 1973 of $4,000. Such deficit is comprised of accumulated DISC income of $1,000, no previously taxed income, and a deficit in other earnings and profits of $5,000. Under these facts, X is treated as receiving a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend in the amount of $72,000 on December 31, 1973, determined as follows:
(5) Limitation on lines (1) through (4):
(a) Line (5)(a) of example 1
$66,000
(b) Earnings and profits for 1973
72,000
(c) Lower of lines (a) and (b)
66,000
(6) Amount under paragraph (a)(5) of this section:
(a) Line (6)(a) of example 1
10,000
(b) Sum of accumulated earnings and profits at beginning of 1973 (not less than $0), and excess of earnings and profits for 1973 over amount in line (5)(c) ($72,000 minus $66,000)
6,000

Special rules for certain tax-free acquisitions of property by the DISC.
(1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (3)(i) of this section, if—
(i) A DISC acquires property in a first transaction and in a second transaction it disposes of such property in exchange for other property, and
(ii) By reason of the application of section 1031 (relating to like-kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions), the basis in the
DISC's hands of the other property acquired in such second transaction is determined in whole or in part with reference to the basis of the property acquired in the first transaction,
then upon a disposition of such other property in a third transaction by the DISC such other property shall be treated as though it had been transferred to the DISC in the first transaction. Thus, if the first transaction is a purchase of the property for cash, then paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section will not apply to a sale by the DISC of the other property acquired in the second transaction.
(2) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (3)(i) of this section, if a DISC acquires property in a first transaction and it transfers such property to a transferee DISC in a second transaction in which the transferor DISC's gain is not recognized in whole or in part, then such property shall be treated as though it had been transferred to the transferee DISC in the same manner in which it was acquired in the first transaction by the transferor DISC. For example, if X and Y both qualify as DISC's and X transfers property to Y in a second transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized, paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section does not apply to a sale of such property by Y in a third transaction if X had acquired the property in a first transaction by a purchase for cash. If, however, X acquired the property from a transferor other than a DISC in the first transaction in which the transferor's realized gain was not recognized, then paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section may apply to the sale by Y if the other conditions of such paragraph (a)(2) or (3) are met.
(3) If a DISC acquires property in a second transaction described in subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph in which it (or, in the case of a second transaction described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the transferor DISC) recognizes a portion (but not all) of the realized gain, then the amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (a)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to a disposition by the DISC of such acquired property in a third transaction shall not exceed the transferor's gain which was not recognized on the first transaction minus the amount of gain recognized by the DISC (or transferor DISC) on the second transaction.
(4) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X and Y are corporations each of which qualifies as a DISC and uses the calendar year as its taxable year. In 1972, X acquires section 1245 property in a first transaction in which the transferor's entire realized gain of $17 is not recognized. In 1973, X transfers such property to Y in a second transaction in which X realizes a gain of $20 of which only $4 is recognized. (On December 31, 1973, X's shareholders are treated as having received a deemed distribution of a dividend which includes such $4 under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, provided the limitation in paragraph (b) of this section is met.) In a third transaction in 1974, Y sells such property and recognizes a gain of $25. With respect to Y's shareholders on December 31, 1974, the amount described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section would be limited to $13, which is the amount of the transferor's gain which was not recognized on the first transaction ($17) minus the amount of gain recognized by X on the second transaction ($4).

# Example 2.
Z is a DISC using the calendar year as its taxable year. In a first transaction in 1972, in exchange for its stock, Z acquires section 1245 property from A, an individual who is its sole shareholder, in a transaction in which A's realized gain of $30 is not recognized by reason of the application of section 351(a). In a second transaction in 1973, Z exchanges such property for other property in a like-kind exchange to which section 1031(b) applies and recognizes $10 of a realized gain of $35. (On December 31, 1973, A is treated as having received a deemed distribution of a dividend which includes such $10 under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, provided the limitation in paragraph (b) of this section is met.) In a third transaction in 1974, Z sells the property acquired in the like-kind exchange and recognizes a gain of $25. With respect to A on December 31, 1974, the amount described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section is limited to $20, which is the amount of A's gain which was not recognized on the first transaction ($30) minus the amount of gain recognized by Z on the second transaction ($10).
(e)
Carry back of net operating loss and capital loss to prior DISC taxable year.
For purposes of sections 991, 995, and 996, the amount of the deduction for the taxable year under section 172 for a net operating loss carryback or carryover or under section 1212 for a capital
loss carryback or carryover shall be determined in the same manner as if the DISC were a domestic corporation which had not elected to be treated as a DISC. Thus, the amount of the deduction will be the same whether or not the corporation was a DISC in the year of the loss or in the year to which the loss is carried. For provisions setting forth adjustments to the DISC's, or former DISC's, deemed distributions, adjustments to its divisions of earnings and profits, and other tax consequences arising from such carrybacks, see § 1.996-8.

§ 1.995-3
Distributions upon disqualification.
(a)
General rule.
Under section 995 (b)(2), a shareholder of a corporation which is disqualified from being a DISC, either because pursuant to § 1.992-2(e)(2) it revoked its election to be treated as a DISC or because it has failed to satisfy the requirements as set forth in § 1.992-1 to be a DISC for a taxable year, shall be deemed to have received (at the times specified in paragraph (b) of this section) distributions taxable as dividends aggregating an amount equal to his pro rata share of the accumulated DISC income (as defined in § 1.996-3(b)) of such corporation which was accumulated during the immediately preceding consecutive taxable years for which the corporation was a DISC. The pro rata share referred to in the preceding sentence shall be determined as of the close of the last of such consecutive taxable years for which the corporation was a DISC. See § 1.996-7(c) for rules relating to the carryover of, and maintaining a separate account for, such accumulated DISC income in certain reorganizations.
(b)
Time of receipt of deemed distributions.
Distributions described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be deemed to be received in equal installments on the last day of each of the 10 taxable years of the corporation following the year of the disqualification described in paragraph (a) of this section, except that in no case may the number of equal installments exceed the number of the immediately preceding consecutive taxable years for which the corporation was a DISC.
(c)
Transfer of shares.
Deemed distributions are includible under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in a shareholder's gross income as a dividend only so long as he continues to hold the shares with respect to which the distribution is deemed made. Thus, the transferee of such shareholder will include in his gross income under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section the remaining installments of the deemed distribution which the transferor would have included in his gross income as a dividend had he not transferred the shares. However, if the transferee acquires the shares in a transaction in which the transferor's gain is treated under § 1.995-4 in whole or in part as a dividend, then under § 1.996-4(a) such transferee does not include subsequent installments in his gross income to the extent that the transferee treats such subsequent installments as made out of previously taxed income.
(d)
Effect of requalification.
Deemed distributions under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section continue and are includible in gross income as dividends by the shareholders whether or not the corporation subsequently requalifies and is treated as a DISC.
(e)
Effect of actual distributions and deemed distributions under section 995(b)(1)(G).
If, during the period a shareholder of a DISC, or former DISC, is taking into account deemed distributions under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an actual distribution is made to him out of accumulated DISC income or a deemed distribution because of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans is made under § 1.995-2(a)(5) out of accumulated DISC income, such actual or deemed distribution shall first reduce the last installment of the deemed distributions scheduled to be included in the shareholder's gross income as a dividend, and then the preceding scheduled installments in reverse order. If deemed distributions are scheduled to
be included in gross income for two or more disqualifications, an actual distribution or a deemed distribution under § 1.995-2 (a)(5) which is treated as made out of accumulated DISC income reduces the deemed distributions resulting from the earlier disqualification first.
(f)
Examples.
This section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. X qualifies as a DISC for taxable years 1972 through 1975, but, pursuant to § 1.992-2(e)(2), revokes its election as of January 1, 1976, and is disqualified as a DISC. On that date, X has $24,000 of accumulated DISC income. X's shareholders will be deemed to receive $6,000 in distributions taxable as a dividend on the last day of each of X's four succeeding taxable years (1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that in 1978 X makes an actual distribution of $22,000 to its shareholders of which $10,000 is treated under § 1.996-1 as made out of accumulated DISC income. (The remaining $12,000 of such distribution is treated as made out of previously taxed income.) The actual distribution would first reduce the $6,000 deemed distribution scheduled for 1980 to zero and then reduce the $6,000 deemed distribution scheduled for 1979 to $2,000. Thus, X's shareholders include in 1978 $16,000 is gross income as dividends ($10,000 of actual distributions and the $6,000 deemed distribution scheduled for that year) and $2,000 as a dividend in 1979.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 2, except that X requalifies as a DISC for taxable year 1977 during which it derives $7,000 of DISC income (computed after taking into account a deemed distribution under § 1.995-2(a)(4) of $7,000), but is again disqualified in 1978. In addition X makes an actual distribution in 1977 equal to the deemed distribution of $7,000. Such actual distribution is excluded from gross income under § 1.996-1(c). In 1977. X's shareholders include in gross income as dividends the $6,000 deemed distribution upon disqualification (in addition to the deemed distributions of $7,000 under § 1.995-2 for 1977 when it was treated as a DISC). The actual distribution in 1978 still reduces the installments resulting from the earlier disqualification. Thus, in 1978, X's shareholders include $16,000 in gross income as dividends. In 1979, X's shareholders include $9,000 in gross income as dividends (the final installment of $2,000 from the earlier disqualification plus the single deemed distribution of $7,000 resulting from the later disqualification).
[T.D. 7324, 39 FR 35112, Sept. 30, 1974, as amended by T.D. 7854, 47 FR 51741, Nov. 17, 1982]
§ 1.995-4
Gain on disposition of stock in a DISC.
(a)
Disposition in which gain is recognized
—(1)
In general.
If a shareholder disposes, or is treated as disposing, of stock in a DISC, or former DISC, then any gain recognized on such disposition shall be included in the shareholder's gross income as a dividend, notwithstanding any other provision of the Code, to the extent of the accumulated DISC income amount (described in paragraph (d) of this section). To the extent the recognized gain exceeds the accumulated DISC income amount, it is taxable as gain from the sale or exchange of the stock.
(2)
Nonapplication of subparagraph (1).
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph do not apply (i) to the extent gain is not recognized (such as, for example, in the case of a gift or an exchange of stock to which section 354 applies) and (ii) to the amount of any recognized gain which is taxable as a dividend (such as, for example, under section 301 or 356(a)(2)) or as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is not a capital asset. The amount taxable as a dividend under section 301 or 356(a)(2) is subject to the rules provided in § 1.995-1(c) for the treatment of actual distributions by a DISC.
(b)
Disposition in which separate corporate existence of DISC is terminated
—(1)
General.
If stock in a corporation that is a DISC, or former DISC, is disposed of in a transaction in which its separate corporate existence as a DISC, or former DISC, is terminated, then, notwithstanding any other provision of the Code, an amount of realized gain shall be recognized and included in the transferor's gross income as a dividend. The realized gain shall be recognized to the extent that such gain—
(i) Would not have been recognized but for the provisions of this paragraph, and
(ii) Does not exceed the accumulated DISC income amount (described in paragraph (d) of this section).
(2)
Cessation of separate corporate existence as a DISC, or former DISC.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, separate corporate existence as a DISC, or former DISC, will be treated as having ceased if, as a result of the transaction, there is no separate entity which is a DISC and to which is carried over the accumulated DISC income and other tax attributes of the DISC, or former DISC, the stock of which is disposed of. Thus, for example, if stock in a DISC, or former DISC, is exchanged in a transaction described in section 381(a) (relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions), the gain realized on the transfer of such stock will not be recognized under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph if the assets of such DISC, or former DISC, are acquired by a corporation which immediately after the acquisition qualifies as a DISC. For a further example, if a DISC, or former DISC, is liquidated in a transaction to which section 332 (relating to complete liquidations of subsidiaries) applies, the transaction will be subject to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph if the basis to the transferee corporation of the assets acquired on the liquidation is determined under section 334(b)(2) (as in effect prior to amendment by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) or if immediately after such liquidation the transferee of such assets does not qualify as a DISC. However, separate corporate existence as a DISC, or former DISC, will not be treated as having ceased in the case of a mere change in place of organization, however effected. See § 1.996-7 for rules for the carryover of the divisions of a DISC's earnings and profits to one or more DISC's.
(c)
Disposition to which section 311, 336, or 337 applies
—(1)
In general.
If, after December 31, 1976, a shareholder distributes, sells, or exchanges stock in a DISC, or former DISC, in a transaction to which section 311, 336, or 337 applies, then an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such stock over its adjusted basis in the hands of the shareholder shall, notwithstanding any other provision of the Code, be included in gross income of the shareholder as a dividend to the extent of the accumulated DISC income amount (described in paragraph (d) of this section).
(2)
Nonapplication of subparagraph (1).
Subparagraph (1) shall not apply if the person receiving the stock in the disposition has a holding period for the stock which includes the period for which the stock was held by the shareholder disposing of such stock.
(d)
Accumulated DISC income amount
—(1)
General.
For purposes of this section, the accumulated DISC income amount is the accumulated DISC income of the DISC or former DISC which is attributable to the stock disposed of and which was accumulated in taxable years of such DISC or former DISC during the period or periods such stock was held by the shareholder who disposed of such stock.
(2)
Period during which a shareholder has held stock.
For purposes of this section, the period during which a shareholder has held stock includes the period he is considered to have held it by reason of the application of section 1223 and, if his basis is determined in whole or in part under the provisions of section 1014(d) (relating to special rule for DISC stock acquired from decedent) or section 1022 (relating to property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010), the holding period of the decedent. Such holding period is to exclude the day of acquisition but include the day of disposition. Thus, for example, if A purchases stock in a DISC on December 31, 1972, and makes a gift of such stock to B on June 30, 1973, then on December 31, 1974, B will be treated as having held the stock for 2 full years. If the basis of the stock in C's hands is determined under section 1014(d) upon a transfer from B's estate on December 31, 1976, by reason of B's death on June 30, 1974, then on December 31, 1976, C will be treated as having held the stock for 4 full years.
(e)
Accumulated DISC income allocable to shareholder under section 995(c)(2)
—(1)
In general.
Under this paragraph, rules are prescribed for purposes of paragraph (d) of this section as to the manner of determining, with respect to the stock of a DISC, or former DISC, disposed of, the amount of accumulated DISC income which is attributable to such stock and which was accumulated
in taxable years of the corporation during the period or periods the stock disposed of was held or treated under paragraph (d)(2) of this section as held by the transferor. Subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph set forth a method of computation which may be employed to determine such amount. Any other method may be employed so long as the result obtained would be the same as the result obtained under such method.
(2)
Step 1.
Determine the increase (or decrease) in accumulated DISC income for each taxable year of the DISC, or former DISC, by subtracting from the amount of accumulated DISC income (as defined in § 1.996-3(b)) at the close of each taxable year the amount thereof as of the close of the immediately preceding taxable year.
(3)
Step 2.
(i) Determine for each taxable year of the DISC, or former DISC, the increase (or decrease) in accumulated DISC income per share by dividing such increase (or decrease) for the year by the number of shares outstanding or deemed outstanding on each day of such year.
(ii) If the number of shares of stock in the corporation outstanding on each day of a taxable year of the DISC, or former DISC, is not constant, then the number of such shares deemed outstanding on each day of such year shall be the sum of the fractional amounts in respect of each share which was outstanding on any day of the taxable year. The fractional amount in respect of a share shall be determined by dividing the number of days in the taxable year on which such share was outstanding (excluding the day the share became outstanding, but including the day the share ceased to be outstanding), by the total number of days in such taxable year.
(iii) If for any taxable year of a DISC, or former DISC, the share disposed of was not held (or treated under paragraph (d)(2) of this section as held) by the disposing shareholder for the entire year, then the amount of increase (or decrease) in accumulated DISC income attributable to such share for such year is the amount determined as if he held the share until the end of such year multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable year on which the shareholder held (or under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is treated as having held) such share and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the taxable year.
(4)
Step 3.
Add the amounts computed in step 2 for each taxable year of the DISC, or former DISC, in which the shareholder held such share of stock.
(5)
Examples.
This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year and elects to be a DISC for the first time for 1973. On January 1, 1973, X has 20 shares issued and outstanding. A and B each own 10 shares. On July 1, 1976, X issues 10 shares to C. On December 31, 1977, A sells his 10 shares to D and recognizes a gain of $120. Under these facts and other facts assumed in the table below, A includes in his gross income for 1977 a dividend under paragraph (b) of this section of $61.30 and long-term capital gain of $58.70.

Under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph, the aggregate fractional amounts of the 10 shares issued on July 1, 1976, is 5 shares, i.e., 10 shares, multiplied by (183 days/366 days). Thus, the number of shares deemed outstanding for 1976 is 25 shares, i.e., 20 shares plus 5 shares.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that A sells his 10 shares to D on July 1, 1977. Under subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph, the amount of increase in accumulated DISC income for 1977 which is attributable to each share disposed of is limited to $.67,
i.e.,
$1.33 multiplied by 182 days/365 days. Therefore, the sum of the yearly increases (and decreases) in accumulated DISC income for each share is reduced by $.66 (
i.e.,
$1.33 minus $.67). The total increase in accumulated DISC income for each share disposed of is $5.47 (i.e., $6.13 minus $.66). Under these facts, A would include in his gross income for 1977 a dividend of $54.70 and long-term capital gain of $65.30 determined as follows:

$5.47

Effective/applicability date.
This section applies on and after January 19, 2017. For rules before January 19, 2017, see § 1.995-4 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016.
[T.D. 7324, 39 FR 35112, Sept. 30, 1974, as amended by T.D. 7854, 47 FR 51741, Nov. 17, 1982; T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6240, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.995-5
Foreign investment attributable to producer's loans.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Limitation.
Under section 995(d), the amount as of the close of a “group taxable year” (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans of a DISC for purposes of section 995(b)(1)(G) shall be the excess (as of the close of such year) of—
(i) The smallest of—
(
a
) The amount of the net increase in foreign assets (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) by domestic and foreign members of the controlled group which includes the DISC,
(
b
) The amount of the actual foreign investment by the domestic members of such group (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section), or
(
c
) The amount of outstanding producer's loans (as determined under § 1.993-4) by such DISC to members of such controlled group, over
(ii) The amount (determined under § 1.995-2 (a)(5) and (b)(2)) of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans treated under section 995(b)(1)(G) as deemed distributions by the particular DISC taxable as dividends for prior taxable years of that particular DISC.
Thus, for example, if the shareholders of a DISC which uses the calendar year as its taxable year (and which is a member of a controlled group in which all of the members use the calendar year as their taxable year) are treated under section 995(b)(1)(G) as receiving foreign investment attributable to producer's loans of a DISC of $0 in 1972, $10 in 1973, and $30 in 1974, or a total of $40, and if the smallest of the amounts described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph at the end of 1975 is $90, then the amount of the foreign investment attributable to producer's loans of a DISC at the end of 1975 is $50,
i.e.,
the excess (as of the close of 1975) of the smallest of the amounts described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph ($90) over the sum of the amounts of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans treated under section 995(b)(1)(G) as deemed distributions by the DISC taxable as dividends for prior taxable years of the DISC ($40). If the separate corporate existence of the DISC as to which the amount described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph relates ceases to exist within the meaning of § 1.995-4(c)(2), then such
amount shall no longer be taken into account by the group for any purpose. For inclusion of amounts because of certain corporate acquisitions, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Controlled group; domestic and foreign member.
For purposes of this section—
(i) The term “controlled group” has the meaning assigned to such term by § 1.993-1(k).
(ii) The term
domestic member
means a domestic corporation which is a member of a controlled group, and the term
foreign member
means a foreign corporation which is a member of a controlled group.
(3)
Group taxable year.
(i) The term
group taxable year
refers collectively to the taxable year of the DISC and to the taxable year of each corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending with or within the taxable year of the DISC. Thus, for example, if a corporation has a subsidiary which uses the calendar year as its taxable year and which elects to be treated as a DISC, and if the parent has a taxable year ending on October 31, the “group taxable year” for 1973 would refer to calendar year 1973 for the DISC and to the parent's taxable year ending October 31, 1973.
(ii) In cases in which the DISC makes a return for a short taxable year, that is, for a taxable year consisting of a period of less than 12 months, pursuant to section 443 and the regulations thereunder, or § 1.991-1(b)(3), the following rules shall apply—
(
a
) In the case of a change in the annual accounting period of the DISC resulting in a short taxable year, the
group taxable year
refers collectively to the short taxable year and to the taxable year of each corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending with or within the short taxable year.
(
b
) In the case of a DISC which is in existence during only part of what would otherwise be its taxable year, the
group taxable year
refers collectively to the short period during which the DISC was in existence and to the taxable year of each corporation in the controlled group which includes the DISC ending with or within the 12-month period ending on the last day of the short period.
(iii) With respect to periods prior to the first taxable year for which a member of the group qualified (or is treated) as a DISC, each group taxable year shall be determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as if such member was in existence, it qualified as a DISC, and its taxable year ended on that date corresponding to the date such member's first taxable year ended after it qualified (or is treated) as a DISC whether or not the corporation which qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC used the same taxable year before it so qualified (or is so treated). Thus, for example, if a corporation which is organized on March 3, 1975, uses the calendar year as its taxable year, and is a member of a controlled group which does not include a DISC, first qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC for calendar year 1975, then the term “group taxable year” with respect to years prior to 1975 refers collectively to such prior calendar years and to the taxable year of each corporation in the group ending with or within such prior calendar years.
(iv) For special rules in the case of a group which includes more than one DISC, see paragraph (g) of this section.
(4)
Amounts determined for prior years.
Unless the 3-year limitation is properly elected under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, the amounts described in paragraphs (b) (relating to net increase in foreign assets) and (c) (relating to actual foreign investments by domestic members) of this section reflect, as of the close of a group taxable year, amounts for all taxable years of members of the group beginning after December 31, 1971 (and amounts arising after December 31, 1971, or such other date prescribed in paragraph (b)(7) of this section), provided that such amounts relate to such group taxable year and preceding group taxable years. Thus, for example, if all members of a controlled group use the calendar year as the taxable year, and 1980 is the first taxable year for which any member of the group qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC, then, unless the 3-year limitation is elected under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, the amounts described in paragraphs (b)
and (c) of this section will be taken into account beginning with the dates specified in the preceding sentence. For rules as to carryovers on certain corporate acquisitions and reorganizations, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(5)
Three-year elective limitation.
(i) A DISC may elect to take into account only amounts described in paragraphs (b) (relating to net increase in foreign assets) and (c) (relating to actual foreign investment by domestic members) of this section for the 3 taxable years of each member immediately preceding its taxable year included in that first group taxable year which includes a member's first taxable year during which it qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC. For purposes of the preceding sentence, determinations shall be made by reference to the taxable year of the issuer or transferor (as the case may be). If an election is made under this subdivision, the offset for uncommitted transitional funds under paragraph (b)(7) of this section is not allowed. If an election is made under this subdivision, the 3-year limitation applies to amounts described in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(ii) An election under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply with respect to amounts which must be carried over under paragraph (d) of this section in the case of certain corporate acquisitions and reorganizations.
(iii) An election under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be made by the DISC attaching to its first return, filed under section 6011(e)(2), a statement to the effect that the 3-year limitation is being elected under § 1.995-5(a)(5)(i).
(6)
Cumulative basis.
Pursuant to section 995(d)(5), all determinations of amounts specified in this section are to be made on a cumulative basis from the 1st year (or date) provided for in this section. Thus, each such determination shall take into account a net increase or a net decrease during the year, as the case may be. However, if the 3-year limitation is elected under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, then only amounts with respect to periods specified in such subparagraph (5) are amounts taken into account for years before a member of the group qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC. The computations described in this section may be made in any way chosen by the DISC (including a corporation being tested as to whether it qualifies as a DISC), provided such method results in the amount prescribed by this section.
(7)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, is a member of a controlled group (within the meaning of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph). X elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. The amount of foreign investment attributable to X's producer's loans treated under section 995(b)(1)(G) as a distribution taxable as a dividend as of the close of each group taxable year with respect to each taxable year of X from 1972 through 1975 are set forth in the table below, computed on the basis of the facts assumed (the amounts on lines (1), (2), (3), and (5) being running balances):

(b)
Net increase in foreign assets
—(1)
In general.
(i) The term
net increase in foreign assets
when used in this section means the excess for the controlled group (as of the close of the group taxable year) of (
a
) the investment in foreign assets to be taken into account
under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph over (
b
) the aggregate of the five offsets allowed by subparagraphs (3) through (7) of this paragraph.
(ii) No amount described in this paragraph (other than amounts described in subparagraphs (4) and (7) of this paragraph) with respect to a member of the group (or foreign branch of a member) shall be taken into account unless it is attributable to a taxable year of such member beginning after December 31, 1971. For a 3-year elective limitation with respect to the first taxable year for which a member qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC, see paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For manner of determining amounts on a cumulative basis, see paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
(2)
Investments made in foreign assets.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, there shall be taken into account as investment in foreign assets the aggregate of the amounts expended (within the meaning of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) during the period described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph by all members of the controlled group which includes the DISC to acquire assets described in section 1231(b) (determined without regard to any holding period therein provided) which are located outside the United States (as defined in § 1.993-7) reduced by the aggregate of the amounts received by all such members of the controlled group from the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of such assets described in section 1231(b) which are located outside the United States. For purposes of this section, amounts expended for assets which are qualified export assets (as defined in § 1.993-2) of a DISC (or which would be qualified export assets if owned by a DISC) shall not be taken into account. Thus, for example, if a DISC acquires a qualified export asset located outside the United States, the asset is not to be taken into account for purposes of determining the net increase in foreign assets.
(ii) As used in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the term
amounts expended
(or amounts received) means the amount of any money or the fair market value (on the date of acquisition, sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion) of any property (other than money) used to acquire (or received for) the assets described in such subdivision (i).
(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, an asset (other than an aircraft or vessel) is considered as located outside the United States if it was used predominantly outside the United States during the group taxable year. The determination as to whether such an asset is used predominantly outside the United States during the group taxable year in which it was acquired or sold, exchanged, or involuntarily converted shall be made by applying the rules of § 1.993-3(d) except that an aircraft described in section 48(a)(2)(B)(i) or a vessel described in section 48(a)(2)(B)(iii) shall be considered located in the United States and all other aircraft or vessels shall be considered located outside the United States. Thus, for example, if a member of a controlled group which includes a DISC acquires a vessel which is documented under the laws of a foreign country, the amount expended to acquire that vessel is an amount described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(iv)
Examples.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, is a domestic member of a controlled group (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section). During 1972, in a transaction to which section 1031 applies, X acquires a warehouse located outside the United States and having a fair market value of $100. As consideration, X transfers $20 in cash and a warehouse located within the United States and having a fair market value of $80. Under these facts, $100 will be taken into account as investment in foreign assets.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the warehouse transferred by X as consideration is located outside the United States. Under these facts, only $20 will be taken into account as investment in foreign assets because the amount expended for such assets (
i.e.,
$100) is reduced by the fair market value of any property located outside the United States received in exchange for such assets (
i.e.,
$80).
(3)
Depreciation with respect to all foreign assets of a controlled group.
(i) An offset allowed by this subparagraph is the depreciation (determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) or
depletion (determined under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) attributable to taxable years of the member beginning after December 31, 1971, with respect to all of the group's foreign assets described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph including such assets acquired prior to the date provided in such subparagraph (2), and without regard to whether the 3-year election in paragraph (a)(5) of this section is made. Thus, for example, depreciation for a taxable year of a member beginning after December 31, 1971, with respect to an asset described in section 1231(b) which is located outside of the United States and which was acquired during a taxable year of the member beginning before January 1, 1972, is an offset allowed by this subparagraph. For a further example, depreciation with respect to a qualified export asset is not such an offset.
(ii) The depreciation taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be—
(
a
) In the case of an asset owned by a domestic member, only the amount allowed under section 167(b)(1) (relating to the allowance of the straight-line method of depreciation) and § 1.162-11 (b) (relating to amortization in lieu of depreciation), but not the amount allowed under section 179 (relating to the additional first-year depreciation allowance).
(
b
) In the case of an asset owned by a foreign member, the depreciation and amortization (referred to in (
a
) of this subdivision) allowable for purposes of computing earnings and profits under subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph.
(iii) The depletion taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be limited to cost depletion computed under sections 611 and 612 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, percentage depletion is not to be taken into account in computing the offset under this subparagraph.
(4)
Amount of outstanding stock or debt.
(i) An offset allowed by this subparagraph is the outstanding amount of stock (including treasury stock) or debt obligations of any member of the group issued, sold, or exchanged after December 31, 1971, by any member (whether or not the same member) to persons who (on the date of such issuance, sale, or exchange) were neither United States persons (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30)) nor members of the group:
Provided,
That, in the case of a debt obligation, such obligation is not repaid within 12 months after such issuance, sale, or exchange. Thus, for example, if stock is issued to a member of the group before January 1, 1972, and after December 31, 1971, it is sold to a person who is neither a United States person nor a member of the group, an offset allowed by this subparagraph includes the outstanding amount of such stock. For purposes of this subparagraph, foreign branches of United States banks are not considered to be United States persons.
(ii) The outstanding amount of stock or debt obligations shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions:
(
a
) The outstanding amount of stock or debt obligations described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is equal to the net amount described in (
b
) of this subdivision reduced (but not below zero) by the amount described in (
c
) of this subdivision.
(
b
) The net amount described in this subdivision (
b
) is the excess of (
1
) the aggregate of the amount of money and the fair market value of property (other than money) transferred by persons who are not members of the group and who are not U.S. persons as consideration for such stock and debt obligations over (
2
) fees and commission expenses borne by the issuer or transferror with respect to their issuance, sale, or exchange.
(
c
) The amount described in this subdivision (
c
) is the aggregate amount of money and fair market value of property (other than money) distributed to such persons on distributions in respect of such stock from other than earnings and profits or on distributions in redemption of such stock and the amount of principal paid pursuant to such debt obligations.
(
d
) For purposes of this subdivision (ii), in the case of a redemption, the stock or debt redeemed shall be charged against the earliest of such stock or debt issued, sold, or exchanged in order to determine the amount by which the balance of outstanding stock
or debt is to be reduced. For purposes of this subparagraph, the fair market value of property received as consideration shall be determined as of the date the transaction occurs, and a contribution to capital within the meaning of section 118 shall be treated as the issuance of stock.
(iii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph apply regardless of the treatment under the Code of the transaction in which the stock or debt was issued, sold, or exchanged. Thus, for example, if X Corporation, a member of a controlled group which includes a DISC, acquires from a nonresident alien individual in exchange solely for X's voting stock all of the stock of Y Corporation pursuant to a reorganization as defined in section 368(a)(1)(B), the fair market value of the Y stock on the date of the exchange would be an offset allowed by this subparagraph.
(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation is a member of a controlled group (within a meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section) every member of which uses the calendar year as its taxable year. On January 1, 1972, X issues in a public offering its stock to persons described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph who, in the aggregate, pay $1,000 as consideration. X pays $100 in underwriting fees. On the same date, X receives $425 upon issuing a $500 debt obligation to such persons at a discount of $75 and pays $25 in underwriting fees. On December 31, 1972, the offset allowed under this subparagraph is $1,300, i.e., ($1,000 minus $100) plus ($425 minus $25). If, during 1973, X makes a distribution of $150 (not in redemption) from other than earnings and profits with respect to such stock, then the offset is reduced to $1,150.
(5)
Earnings and profits.
(i) An offset allowed by this subparagraph is one-half the aggregate of the earnings and profits accumulated for all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, computed (without regard to any distributions from earnings and profits by a foreign corporation to a domestic corporation in accordance with § 1.964-1 (relating to a controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits), of each foreign member of the group which is controlled directly or indirectly (as determined under the principles of section 958 and the regulations thereunder) by a domestic member of the group and each foreign branch of a domestic member of the group (computed as if the branch were a foreign corporation). The DISC is bound by any action on behalf of a foreign member that was taken pursuant to § 1.964-1(c)(3) or by any failure to take action by or on behalf of a foreign member within the time specified in § 1.964-1(c)(6). With respect to a foreign member for which action was not previously required under § 1.964-1(c)(6) to be taken, the DISC may take action on behalf of such member by attaching a statement to that effect to the return of the DISC under section 6011(e)(2) for the first taxable year during which it qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC and there is outstanding a producer's loan made by such DISC to a member of the controlled group which includes the DISC.
(ii) If the aggregate of the accumulated earnings and profits described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is a deficit, the amount allowable as an offset under this subparagraph is zero.
(6)
Royalties and fees.
An offset allowed by this subparagraph is one-half the royalties and fees paid by foreign members of the group to domestic members of the group and by foreign branches of domestic members of the group to domestic members of the group during the taxable years of such members beginning after December 31, 1971.
(7)
Uncommitted transitional funds.
(i) An offset allowed by this subparagraph for the uncommitted transitional funds of the group is the sum described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph of the amount of certain capital raised under the foreign direct investment program and the amounts described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph of certain foreign excess working capital held on October 31, 1971.
(ii) The amount described in this subdivision of certain capital raised under the foreign direct investment program is the excess (if any) of—
(
a
) The amount of the offset allowed by subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, determined, however, with respect to
the stock and debt obligations of domestic members of the group outstanding on December 31, 1971 (including amounts treated as stock outstanding by reason of a contribution to capital), whether or not outstanding after such date, which were issued, sold, or exchanged on or after January 1, 1968, by any member (whether or not the same member) to persons who (on the date of such issuance, sale, or exchange) were neither United States persons (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30)) nor members of the group, but only to the extent the taxpayer establishes that such amount constitutes a long-term borrowing (see 15 CFR 1000.324
1
) for purposes of the foreign direct investment program (see 15 CFR part 1000
1
), over
1
Editorial Note:
15 CFR part 1000 was removed at 39 FR 30481, Aug. 23, 1974.
(
b
) The amount (determined under paragraph (c) of this section) of actual foreign investment by the domestic members of the group during the portion of the period such stock or debt obligations have been outstanding prior to January 1, 1972, such determination to be made by substituting January 1, 1968, for the December 31, 1971, date specified in such paragraph (c) and by not taking into account the earnings and profits described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
For purposes of this subparagraph, foreign branches of United States banks are not considered to be United States persons.
(iii)(
a
) A taxpayer may establish that an amount under subdivision (ii) (
a
) of this subparagraph constitutes a long-term borrowing for purposes of the foreign direct investment program by keeping records sufficient to demonstrate that appropriate reports were filed with the Office of Foreign Direct Investment of the Department of Commerce with respect to the foreign borrowing or by any other method satisfactory to the district director.
(
b
) The amounts described in subdivision (ii) (
a
) of this subparagraph include amounts with respect to which an election under section 4912(c), to subject certain obligations of a United States person to the interest equalization tax, has been made:
Provided,
That the obligations to which such amounts relate were issued by an “overseas financing subsidiary” described in 15 CFR part 1000
1
and were assumed by a United States person from such overseas financing subsidiary. Thus, for example, if an overseas financing subsidiary issues its notes to a foreign person in 1968, and such notes are assumed by its United States parent in 1973, which parent elects under section 4912(c) to have the notes subject to the interest equalization tax, then the amount of money received by the subsidiary is an amount described in subdivision (ii)(
a
) of this subparagraph.
(iv) The amount described in this subdivision of foreign excess working capital is the amount of liquid assets held by the foreign members of such group and foreign branches of domestic members of such group on October 31, 1971 (whether or not so held after such date) in excess of their reasonable working capital needs (as defined in § 1.993-2 (e)) on that date, but only to the extent not included in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subdivision, the term
liquid assets
means money, bank deposits (not including time deposits), and indebtedness of any kind (including time deposits) which on the day acquired had a maturity of 2 years or less.

Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year is a member of a controlled group (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section). X elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. The amount of net increase in foreign assets of the group at the close of each group taxable year with respect to each taxable year of X from 1972 through 1975 are set forth in the table below, computed on the basis of the facts assumed (the amounts on each line being running balances):

(c)
Actual foreign investment by domestic members.
For purposes of determining the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of the actual foreign investment by domestic members of a controlled group is the sum (as of the close of the group taxable year) determined on a cumulative basis (see paragraph (a)(6) of this section) of—
(1)
Outstanding stock or debt (including contributions to capital).
The outstanding amount (determined in accordance with the principles of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, applied with respect to stock or debt obligations described in this subparagraph) of stock (including treasury stock) or debt obligations (other than normal trade indebtedness) of foreign members of the group issued, sold, or exchanged after December 31, 1971, by any person (whether or not a member) which is not a domestic member to domestic members of the group:
Provided,
That the outstanding amount of debt obligations of any foreign member shall be the greater of such amount outstanding at the close of the taxable year of such member or the highest such amount outstanding at any time during the immediately preceding 90 days,
(2)
Transfers to foreign branches.
The amount of money or the fair market value of property (other than money) transferred by domestic members of the group after December 31, 1971, to foreign branches of such members in transactions which would, if the branch were a corporation, be in consideration for the sale of stock or debt obligations of (or a contribution of capital to) such foreign branches (as determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph), and
(3)
Earnings and profits of foreign members.
One-half of the earnings and profits (computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section for purposes of computing net increase in foreign assets) of foreign members of the group which are controlled directly or indirectly (as determined under the principles of section 958 and the regulations thereunder) by a domestic member of the group and foreign branches (treated for this purpose as a corporation) of domestic members of the group accumulated during the taxable years of such foreign members (or branches) beginning after December 31, 1971, or, if later, the taxable year referred to in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section if the 3-year election provided for in such paragraph (a)(5)(i) is made.
(d)
Carryovers on certain corporate acquisitions and reorganizations
—(1)
Certain corporate acquisitions.
(i) If—
(
a
) A member of a controlled group (“first controlled group”) acquires in a transaction to which section 381 applies the assets of a corporation which is a member of a second controlled group or acquires stock in such a corporation pursuant to a reorganization as defined in section 368(a)(1)(B) to which section 361 applies, or
(
b
) A member or combination of members of the first controlled group acquire in a transaction not described in (
a
) of this subdivision a majority interest (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) in the stock of a corporation which is a member of a second controlled group which includes a DISC so that such DISC after the acquisition is a member of the new controlled group,
then, for purposes of computing foreign investment attributable to producer's loans with respect to the new controlled group as constituted after such acquisition, all amounts described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, including the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to amounts treated under section 995(b)(1)(G) as deemed distributions by the DISC taxable as dividends for prior taxable years of the DISC), with respect to members of the second
controlled group which become members of the new controlled group shall carry over to such new controlled group. For purposes of this subdivision (i), a controlled group may consist of only one member. With respect to certain transactions involving foreign corporations, see section 367.
(ii) If a member or combination of members of a controlled group, immediately after an acquisition of stock to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies, do not control the total combined voting power (determined under § 1.957-1(b)) of the corporation whose stock was acquired, proper apportionment consistent with the principles of paragraph (e)(5) of this section shall be made with respect to amounts to which paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section apply.
(iii)(
a
) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies, then for purposes of determining the application of the 3-year elective limitation provided for in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the rules in (
b
), (
c
), and (
d
) of this subdivision (iii) apply.
(
b
) If both the “first controlled group” and the “second controlled group” (as those terms are defined in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) include a DISC, and a DISC in either group has elected the 3-year limitation provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, then only those amounts taken into account under such paragraph (a)(5) by the electing DISC or DISC's shall be taken into account.
(
c
) If one of the groups includes a DISC and the other does not, and if the DISC has elected the 3-year limitation provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, then, for purposes of computing foreign investment attributable to producer's loans with respect to the new controlled group as constituted after the acquisition, all amounts described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section with respect to members of the controlled group which did not include the DISC shall carry over to such new controlled group, but only to the extent provided in such paragraph (a)(5), computed as if the group taxable year in which the acquisition occurred was the first group taxable year which includes a member's first taxable year during which it qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC.
(
d
) If (
c
) of this subdivision (iii) applies, except that the DISC has not elected the 3-year limitation provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, then the DISC in the new controlled group as constituted after the acquisition may, with respect to members of the controlled group which did not include the DISC, make the election provided in such paragraph (a)(5), and treat the year in which the acquisition occurred as if it were the first group taxable year which includes a member's first taxable year during which it qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC.
(iv) If a majority interest, or an interest in addition to a majority interest, is acquired in a transaction other than a transaction described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, then the rules in paragraph (e) of this section (relating to the acquisition of the foreign assets of a corporation) apply.
(2)
Corporation ceasing to be a member.
As of the date a corporation which is a member of a controlled group ceases to be a member of such group, the amounts of such group described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section will be reduced by such amounts which are attributable to the corporation which is no longer a member of the group.
(e)
Acquisition of a majority interest in a corporation
—(1)
In general.
If paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (relating to certain corporate acquisitions in which all amounts described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section carry over) does not apply, then, for purposes of determining under paragraph (b)(2) of this section the investments made in foreign assets by a controlled group, the acquisition of a majority interest (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) or an interest in addition to a majority interest in a corporation by any member or combination of members of the controlled group is considered an acquisition of the assets (to the extent provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph) of the acquired corporation by the group, including the assets of any
foreign corporation in which the acquired corporation owns a majority interest (to the extent provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph). For the rules concerning the date upon which an acquisition of a majority interest is considered to have occurred, see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(2)
Majority interest.
For purposes of this section, a majority interest is more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of a corporation's stock entitled to vote, as determined under § 1.957-1(b).
(3)
Acquisition date.
For purposes of this paragraph, an acquisition of a majority interest shall be considered to have occurred on the day on which the combined voting power of the group first reached the percentage required in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(4)
Valuation of assets.
For purposes of this section, the amount of a corporation's assets deemed acquired is the fair market value of the assets on the date a majority interest, or an interest in addition to a previously held majority interest, is acquired.
(5)
Apportionment in the case of the acquisition of less than all of the voting stock.
(i) If the acquisition described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph of a majority interest is of less than 100 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the acquired corporation entitled to vote, then for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the amount of the foreign assets of the corporation deemed acquired as of the day the majority interest is considered acquired shall be an amount equal to the fair market value of all of the corporation's foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section as of such day multiplied by the percentage of the total combined voting power (determined under § 1.957-1(b)) held by members of the group on the day the majority interest is considered acquired.
(ii) If any member or combination of members of the controlled group hold a majority interest in a corporation, then for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the acquisition of additional combined voting power by members of the controlled group shall be considered an acquisition of its foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in an amount equal to the fair market value of all such assets held by the foreign corporation on the date of the acquisition, multiplied by the increase (expressed in percentage points) in total combined voting power (as determined under § 1.957-1(b)) which occurred.
(6)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
M Corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year. On November 18, 1973, M acquires from A, an individual United States person, for $1 million cash all 10,000 shares of the voting stock of N, a foreign corporation. N's only asset is a warehouse located in France with a fair market value on the date of acquisition of $1 million. Under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the controlled group of which M is a member is considered to have expended $1 million for the acquisition of foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that on November 18, 1973, M acquires only 80 percent of N's voting stock. M is considered to have expended $800,000 for the acquisition of assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, computed as follows:
(1) Fair market value of N's foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section
$1,000,000
(2) Multiply by percentage of total combined voting power of all classes of N stock entitled to vote acquired by M
.8
(3) Amount considered expended
$800,000

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 2, except that individual A is not a United States person, and M acquires the 80 percent of N voting stock in exchange for cash of $100,000 and M stock having a fair market value on the date of the acquisition of $700,000. M is considered to have acquired assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the amount of $800,000 (see computations in example 2) and to have an offset under paragraph (b)(4) of this section (relating to outstanding stock or debt) of $700,000 (the fair market value of the M stock transferred to A who is not a United States person). However, the controlled group of which M is a member is not considered to have acquired any other amounts described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section with respect to N for taxable years prior to the taxable year of N during which the acquisition occurred.

# Example 4.
P Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, is a member of a controlled group which includes a DISC. During 1973, P acquires from B, an individual United States person, for cash, 30
percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of Q, a foreign corporation. All of Q's assets are assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. No additional interest in Q is acquired by members of the group during 1973. The controlled group of which Q is a member is not considered to have made any investments in foreign assets described in such paragraph (b)(2) as of the close of 1973.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in example 4. Assume further that during 1974, R Corporation, a member of the controlled group which includes P, acquires for cash 40 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of Q entitled to vote as follows: 20 percent on July 31, and 20 percent on December 31. Thus, on December 31, 1974, members of the controlled group own 70 percent of Q's voting power (30 + 20 + 20) and on that date are considered to have acquired a majority interest in Q. The fair market value of Q's assets on December 31, 1974, is $5 million. The group is considered to have expended $3,500,000 for the acquisition of assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section computed as follows:
(1) Fair market value of Q's foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section as of the date the acquisition is deemed to have occurred under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (December 31, 1974)
$5,000,000
(2) Multiply by percentage of total combined voting power of all classes of Q stock entitled to vote held by members of the group on such date
.7
$3,500,000

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in example 5. Assume further that on July 15, 1975, P acquires the remaining 30 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Q stock entitled to vote, and on such date the fair market value of Q's assets is $5,500,000. The group is considered to have expended $5,150,000 for the acquisition of assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section as of the close of 1975, computed as follows:
(1) Amount of prior years' investment
$3,500,000
(2) Investment during 1975:
(a) Fair market value of Q's foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section on July 15, 1975
$5,500,000
(b) Multiply by additional percentage acquired of total combined voting power of all classes of Q stock entitled to vote
.3
(c) Investment during 1975
$1,650,000
(3) Amount considered expended for foreign assets described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by reason of the acquisition of Q stock
$5,150,000
(f)
Records.
A DISC shall keep or be readily able to produce such permanent books of account or records as are sufficient to establish the transactions and amounts described in this section. Where applicable, such books of account or records shall be cumulative and shall show transactions and amounts of the members of the controlled group which includes the DISC which occurred prior to the date the DISC qualified (or is treated) as a DISC.
(g)
Multiple DISC's
—(1)
Allocation among DISC's.
In the case of a controlled group which includes more than one DISC, the amounts described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be allocated among the DISC's in order to determine the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section. Each DISC's allocable portion of these amounts shall be equal to the total of such amounts multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the individual DISC's outstanding producer's loans to members of the group, and the denominator of which is the aggregate amounts of outstanding producer's loans to members of the group by all DISC's which are members of the group.
(2)
Different taxable years.
If all of the DISC's which are members of the controlled group do not have the same taxable year, then one such DISC shall on behalf of all such DISC's elect to make all computations under section 995(d) as if all DISC's that are members of the group use the same taxable year as the actual taxable year of any one of the DISC's. The election as to which DISC's taxable year is to be used shall be made by the electing DISC attaching to its first return, filed under section 6011(e)(2), a statement indicating which such taxable year will be used. Once such an election is made it may not be revoked until such time as all of the DISC's which are members of the group use the same taxable year. If this subparagraph applies, books and records must be kept by the group which are adequate to show the necessary computations under section 995(d).
(3) This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation X and corporation Y are members of the same controlled group and each has elected to be treated as a DISC. X uses a taxable year ending March 31, and Y
uses a taxable year ending November 30. Notwithstanding the fact that all other members of the group use the calendar year as their taxable year, all computations for purposes of determining the amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans under section 995(d) must be made as if both DISC's use a taxable year ending either March 31 (X's taxable year) or November 30 (Y's taxable year).

§ 1.995-6
Taxable income attributable to military property.
(a)
Gross income attributable to military property.
For purposes of section 995(b)(3)(A)(i), the term “gross income which is attributable to military property” includes income from the sale, exchange, lease, or rental of military property (as described in paragraph (c) of this section). The term also includes gross income from the performance of services which are related and subsidiary (as defined in § 1.993-1(d)) to any qualified sale, exchange, lease, or rental of military property. Where gross income cannot be determined on an item by item basis, the gross income with respect to those items not so determinable shall be apportioned. Such apportionment shall be accomplished using appropriate facts and circumstances, so that the gross income apportioned to sale of military property bears a reasonably close factual relationship to the actual gross income earned on such sales. The apportionment shall be based on methods which include the fair market value of property sold or exchanged, the fair rental value of any leaseholds granted, the fair market value of any related or subsidiary services performed in connection with such sale or leases or methods based on gross receipts or costs of goods sold, where appropriate.
(b)
Deductions.
For purposes of section 995(b)(3)(A)(ii), deductions shall be properly allocated and apportioned to gross income, described in paragraph (a) of this section, in accordance with the rules of § 1.861-8. These deductions include all applicable deductions from gross income provided under part VI of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code.
(c)
Military property.
For purposes of this section, the term
military property
means any property which is an arm, ammunition, or implement of war designated in the munitions list published pursuant to section 38 of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (22 U.S.C. 2778 which superseded 22 U.S.C. 1934) and the regulations thereunder (22 CFR 121.01).
(d)
Illustration.
The principles of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation elects to be a DISC for the first time in 1976. X has taxable income of $50,000, of which $30,000 is attributable to military property and $10,000 to interest on producer's loans. The total deemed distributions with respect to X are as follows:
(1) Gross interest from Producer's loans in 1976
$10,000
(2) 50 percent of the taxable income of the DISC attributable to military property in 1976
15,000
(3) One-half of the excess of taxable income for 1976 over the sum of lines (1) and (2) (
1/2
of ($50,000 minus $25,000))
12,500
(4) Total deemed distributions (sum of total lines (1), (2), and (3))
37,500
(Secs. 995(e)(7), (8) and (10), 995(g) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (90 Stat. 1655, 26 U.S.C. 995 (e)(7), (8) and (10); 90 Stat. 1659, 26 U.S.C. 995(g); and 68A Stat 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805))
[T.D. 7984, 49 FR 40019, Oct. 12, 1984]
§ 1.996-1
Rules for actual distributions and certain deemed distributions.
(a)
General rule.
Under section 996(a)(1), any actual distribution (other than a distribution described in paragraph (b) of this section or to which § 1.995-4 applies) to a shareholder by a DISC, or former DISC, which is made out of earnings and profits shall be treated as made—
(1) First, out of “previously taxed income” (as defined in § 1.996-3(c)) to the extent thereof,
(2) Second, out of “accumulated DISC income” (as defined in § 1.996-3(b)) to the extent thereof, and
(3) Third, out of “other earnings and profits” (as defined in § 1.996-3(d)) to the extent thereof.
(b)
Rules for qualifying distributions and deemed distributions under section 995(b)(1)(G)
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraph (2), any actual distribution to meet qualification requirements made pursuant to § 1.992-3 and any deemed distribution pursuant to § 1.995-2(a)(5) (relating to foreign
investment attributable to producer's loans) which is made out of earnings and profits shall be treated as made—
(i) First, out of “accumulated DISC income” (as defined in § 1.996-3(b)) to the extent thereof.
(ii) Second, out of “other earnings and profits” (as defined in § 1.996-3(d)) to the extent thereof, and
(iii) Third, out of “previously taxed income” (as defined in § 1.996-3(c)) to the extent thereof.
(2)
Special rule.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply to one-half of the amount of an actual distribution made pursuant to § 1.992-3 to satisfy the condition of § 1.992-1(b) (the gross receipts test) and paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to the remaining one-half of such amount.
(c)
Exclusion from gross income.
Under section 996(a)(3), amounts distributed out of previously taxed income shall be excluded by the distributee from gross income. However, see § 1.996-5(b) for treatment as gain from the sale or exchange of property of the portion of an actual distribution out of previously taxed income to the extent it exceeds the adjusted basis of the stock with respect to which the distribution is made.
(d)
Priority of distributions.
Under section 996(c), for purposes of determining their treatment under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, distributions made during a taxable year shall be treated as being made in the following order—
(1) Deemed distributions under §§ 1.995-2 and 1.995-3.
(2) Actual distributions to meet qualification requirements made pursuant to § 1.992-3 in the order in which they are made, and
(3) Other actual distributions in the order in which they are made.
Thus, the treatment of any distribution shall be determined after the divisions of earnings and profits have been properly adjusted by taking into account distributions of higher priority which are made or deemed made during the same taxable year.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Y Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. During 1973, Y makes a cash distribution of $100 to X Corporation, Y's sole shareholder. For 1973, Y has no earnings and profits. As of the beginning of 1973, Y has $300 of accumulated earnings and profits, which consist of $70 of accumulated DISC income, $40 of previously taxed income, and $190 of other earnings and profits. The entire $100 distribution is a dividend under section 316. However, $40 thereof is treated as made out of previously taxed income and is thus excluded from gross income. Accordingly, only $60 is treated as distributed out of accumulated DISC income and includible in gross income. See § 1.246-4 for the inapplicability of the dividend received deduction with respect to the entire distribution of $100.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the cash distribution is designated as a distribution to meet qualification requirements made pursuant to § 1.992-3. Under these facts, X includes the entire distribution in its gross income as a dividend. Of the $100 distributed, $70 is treated as made out of accumulated DISC income and the remaining $30 is treated as made out of other earnings and profits. The dividend received deduction under section 243 is available only with respect to such $30.

# Example 3.
Y Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. As of the end of 1975, Y had failed to meet the gross receipts test for that year. In 1975 Y had $100 of taxable income, $80 of which was attributable to qualified export receipts and $20 of which was attributable to receipts that did not qualify as qualified export receipts. As of the beginning of 1976, Y had $300 of accumulated earnings and profits, which consisted of $70 of accumulated DISC income, $40 of previously taxed income, and $190 of other earnings and profits. In 1976 Y makes a cash distribution of $20 pursuant to § 1.992-3 in order to satisfy the gross receipts test for 1975. For 1976 Y has no earnings and profits and no deemed distributions. The entire $20 distribution is a dividend under section 316. Under § 1.996-1(b)(2), half of the $20 cash distribution is treated pursuant to § 1.996-1(b)(1) and half is treated pursuant to § 1.996-1(a). Thus, $10 is treated as distributed out of accumulated DISC income and is includible in gross income. The other $10 is treated as made out of previously taxed income and is thus excluded from gross income. As of the beginning of 1977, Y has $280 of accumulated earnings and profits, which consists of $60 of accumulated DISC income, $30 of previously
taxed income, and $190 of other earnings and profits.
[T.D. 7324, 39 FR 35120, Sept. 30, 1974, as amended by T.D. 7854, 47 FR 51742, Nov. 17, 1982]
§ 1.996-2
Ordering rules for losses.
(a)
In general.
Under section 996(b), if for any taxable year a DISC, or a former DISC, incurs a deficit in earnings and profits, such deficit shall be charged—
(1) First, to other earnings and profits (as defined in § 1.996-3(d)) to the extent thereof,
(2) Second, to accumulated DISC income (as defined in § 1.996-3(b)) to the extent thereof, subject to the special rule in paragraph (b) of this section,
(3) Third, to previously taxed income (as defined in § 1.996-3(c)) to the extent thereof, and
(4) To the extent that the amount of such deficit exceeds the sum of the amounts charged in accordance with subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph, to other earnings and profits (as defined in § 1.996-3(d)).
Thus, the excess deficit charged to other earnings and profits under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph will create a deficit therein in the amount of such excess. To determine the amount of any division of earnings and profits for the purpose of determining under § 1.996-1 the treatment of any actual and certain deemed distributions, the portion of a deficit in earnings and profits chargeable under this paragraph to such division prior to such distribution shall be determined in a manner consistent with the rules in § 1.316-2(b) for determining the amount of earnings and profits available on the date of any distribution.
(b)
Deficits subsequent to a disqualification.
A deficit in earnings and profits of a DISC, or former DISC, shall not be charged to accumulated DISC income which has been determined is to be deemed distributed to the shareholders pursuant to § 1.995-3 as a result of a revocation of election or other disqualification. Thus, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section as modified by this paragraph, a deficit incurred by a former DISC following such a revocation or disqualification shall be charged first to other earnings and profits and then to previously taxed income with any balance being charged to other earnings and profits and creating a deficit therein. The preceding sentence shall also apply in the case of a deficit incurred by a DISC which has no accumulated DISC income accumulated during its current taxable year and all immediately preceding consecutive taxable years for which it was a DISC. If as a result of the application of this paragraph the amount of a deficit in other earnings and profits exceeds the amount of a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits, then upon any subsequent actual distribution the deficit in other earnings and profits shall be reduced by the lower of (1) the amount of such actual distribution chargeable to accumulated DISC income or previously taxed income or (2) the amount of such excess.
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, becomes a DISC beginning with 1976. In addition to other facts assumed in the table below, X incurs a deficit in earnings and profits for 1979 of $70. Such deficit is charged to the divisions of X's earnings and profits pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in the manner set forth in such table.

Under § 1.995-3, X has $30 of accumulated DISC income which is to be deemed distributed $10 per year in 1980, 1981, and 1982. The deficit in earnings and profits for 1979 is charged to the divisions of X's earnings and profits pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section in the manner set forth in the table below:

§ 1.996-3
Divisions of earnings and profits.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of sections 991 through 997, the earnings and profits of a DISC, or former DISC, shall be treated as composed of the following three divisions:
(1) Accumulated DISC income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section),
(2) Previously taxed income (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), and
(3) Other earnings and profits (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section),
(b)
Accumulated DISC income defined.
(1) Accumulated DISC income is that portion of a corporation's earnings and profits which were derived during taxable years for which it qualified as a DISC and which were deferred from taxation. Accumulated DISC income as of the close of each taxable year of the corporation is—
(i) The amount of accumulated DISC income as of the close of the immediately preceding taxable year increased by,
(ii) The amount of DISC income for the year (as determined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) and reduced (but not below zero) by,
(iii) The items enumerated in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(2) Under section 996(f)(1), DISC income is (i) the earnings and profits derived by the corporation during a taxable year for which such corporation is a DISC minus (ii) amounts deemed distributed under § 1.995-2 other than the amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans described in § 1.995-2(a)(5). For example, the earnings and profits of a DISC for a taxable year include any amounts includible in such DISC's gross income pursuant to section 951(a) (relating to controlled foreign corporations). Deemed distributions under § 1.995-2(a)(5) are taken into account under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as a reduction in computing accumulated DISC income.
(3) The accumulated DISC income (as increased by DISC income for the year determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) is reduced by each of the following items in the following order:
(i) Any amount deemed distributed for such year under § 1.995-3 (relating to deemed distributions upon disqualification),
(ii) Any amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans deemed distributed for such year under § 1.995-2(a)(5) to the extent it is charged to accumulated DISC income under § 1.996-1(b)(1)(i),
(iii) The amount of any adjustment to accumulated DISC income for such year under § 1.966-4(b)(1), and
(iv) To the extent they are treated, under § 1.996-1 (a) or (b) (relating to ordering rules for distributions), as made out of accumulated DISC income, the amounts of any actual qualifying distributions pursuant to § 1.992-3 in the order in which they are made, and thereafter by the amounts of any other actual distributions in the order in which they are made, except that, prior to each actual distribution, accumulated DISC income shall be reduced by the portion of any deficit in earnings and profits for the taxable year chargeable at that time under § 1.996-2(a)(2) to accumulated DISC income.
(4) Every distribution or other reduction in accumulated DISC income pursuant to subparagraph (3) of this paragraph shall be charged to the most recently accumulated DISC income.
(c)
Previously taxed income.
Under section 996(f)(2), previously taxed income as of the close of each taxable year of the corporation is an amount equal to—
(1) The sum of—
(i) The amount of previously taxed income as of the close of the immediately preceding taxable year,
(ii) Amounts deemed distributed for the current year under § 1.995-2 (relating to deemed distributions in qualified years),
(iii) Amounts deemed distributed for the current year under § 1.995-3 (relating to deemed distributions upon disqualification),
(iv) With respect to a distribution in redemption to which § 1.996-4(b)(1) applies, an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (
a
) the amount of the reduction under § 1.996-4(b)(1) in accumulated DISC income over (
b
) the reduction in the corporation's earnings and profits (see section 312(e)), and
(v) Any amount by which accumulated DISC income is reduced under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section by reason of a deemed distribution as a dividend, under § 1.995-2(a)(5), of an amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans,
(2) Decreased (but not below zero), to the extent they are treated, under § 1.996-1 (a) or (b) (relating to ordering rules for distributions), as made out of previously taxed income, by the amounts of any actual qualifying distributions pursuant to § 1.992-3 in the order in which they are made, and thereafter by the amounts of any other actual distributions in the order in which they are made, except that, prior to any actual distribution, previously taxed income shall be reduced by the portion of any deficit in earnings and profits for the taxable year chargeable at that time under § 1.996-2(a)(3) to previously taxed income.
(d)
Other earnings and profits.
Under section 996(f)(3), other earnings and profits consist of earnings and profits other than accumulated DISC income and previously taxed income described respectively in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Other earnings and profits as of the close of each taxable year of the corporation is (subject to paragraph (e) of this section) an amount equal to the amount of other earnings and profits as of the close of the immediately preceding taxable year decreased (if necessary, below zero) in the following order by—
(1) To the extent they are treated, under § 1.996-1 (a) or (b) (relating to ordering rules for distributions), as made out of other earnings and profits, the amounts of any actual qualifying distributions pursuant to § 1.992-3 in the order in which they are made, and thereafter the amounts of any other actual distributions in the order in which they are made, except that, prior to any actual distribution, other earnings and profits shall be reduced by the portion of any deficit in earnings and profits for the taxable year chargeable at that time under § 1.996-2(a)(1) to other earnings and profits, and
(2) With respect to a distribution in redemption to which § 1.996-4(b)(1) applies, an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (
a
) the reduction in the corporation's earnings and profits (see section 312(e)) over (
b
) the amount of the reduction under § 1.996-4(b)(1) in accumulated DISC income.
(e)
Distributions in kind.
(1) For purposes of determining, under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the amount by which any division of earnings and profits is reduced by reason of a distribution of property (other than
money or the DISC's, or former DISC's, own obligations), the amount of such distribution is the fair market value of such property at the time of the distribution.
(2) For any taxable year in which the DISC makes a distribution of such property, the amount of other earnings and profits determined under paragraph (d) of this section (without regard to this subparagraph) shall be—
(i) Increased by the excess (if any) of the amount of such distribution treated as a dividend under section 316(a) over the adjusted basis of such property, and
(ii) Decreased by the excess (if any) of the adjusted basis of such property over the amount of such distribution treated as a dividend under section 316 (a).
Each item of property shall be considered separately for purposes of making the adjustment under this subparagraph.

# Example 5.
(1)
Facts.
R Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. X Corporation is its sole shareholder. At the beginning of 1974, R has a deficit in earnings and profits of $60 all of which is composed of “other earnings and profits”. For 1974, R has earnings and profits of $80 before reduction for any distributions and taxable income of $70. On June 15, 1974, R makes a cash distribution to X of $60, with respect to its stock, to which section 301 applies. On August 15, 1974, R makes a cash distribution to X of $30 designated as a distribution to meet qualification requirements pursuant to § 1.992-3. Under § 1.995-2(a), X is deemed to receive, on December 31, 1974, a distribution of a dividend of $35, i.e., one-half of R's taxable income of $70. The tax consequences of these facts to X and their effect on R's earnings and profits are set forth in the subsequent subparagraphs of this example.
(2)
Dividend treatment of actual distributions.
Since R had $80 of earnings and profits for 1974 and a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of 1974, only $80 of the actual distributions ($90) are treated as dividends under sections 301(c)(1) and 316(a)(2). ($10 of the actual distribution, which is not treated as a dividend is treated in the manner specified in section 301(c) (2) and (3).) Thus, under § 1.316-2(b), $26.67 of the actual qualifying distribution made on August 15, 1974 ($30 × $80/$90), and $53.33 of the actual distribution made on June 15, 1974 ($60 × $80/$90), are considered made out of earnings and profits.
(3)
Priority of distributions.
Under § 1.996-1(d), for purposes of adjusting the divisions of R's earnings and profits and determining the treatment of subsequent distributions, the sequence in which each distribution is treated as having been made is—
(i) First, the deemed distribution of $35,
(ii) Second, the actual qualifying distribution of $30 made on August 15, 1974, pursuant to § 1.992-3, and
(iii) Finally, the actual distribution of $60 made on June 15, 1974.
(4)
Treatment and effect of deemed distribution.
Under § 1.995-2(a), on December 31, 1974, X includes the deemed distribution of $35 in its gross income as a dividend. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, R's previously taxed income is increased by $35 as shown on line (3) of the table in subparagraph (7) of this example. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and (2) of this section, accumulated DISC income is increased by $45 of DISC income, i.e., R's earnings and profits for 1974, $80, minus the deemed distribution of $35, as shown on line (4) of the table.
(5)
Treatment and effect of actual qualifying distribution of $30.
As indicated in subparagraph (2) of this example, $26.67 of the $30 qualifying distribution on August 15, 1974, is treated as made out of earnings and profits for 1974. Under § 1.996-1(b)(1)(i), the entire $26.67 is treated as distributed out of accumulated DISC income. Thus, on August 15, 1974, X includes $26.67 in its gross income as a dividend. No deduction is allowable under section 243. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, R's accumulated DISC income is reduced by $26.67 as shown on line (6) of the table in subparagraph (7) of this example.
(6)
Treatment and effect of actual distribution of $60.
As indicated in subparagraph (2) of this example, $53.33 of the $60 distribution on June 15, 1974, is treated as made out of earnings and profits for 1974. Under § 1.996-1(a), the $53.33 is treated as distributed out of previously taxed income to the extent thereof, $35, and then out of accumulated DISC income, $18.33. Thus, on June 15, 1974, X includes $18.33 in its gross income as a dividend. Under § 1.996-1(c), the distribution of $35 out of previously taxed income is excluded from gross income. No deduction is allowable under section 243 with respect to the actual distribution of $53.33. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, accumulated DISC income is reduced by $18.33 and, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, previously taxed income is reduced by $35, as shown on line (7) of the table in subparagraph (7) of this example.

# Example 6.
Assume the facts are the same as in example 5, except that at the beginning of 1974 R's accumulated earnings and profits amount to $60 consisting of accumulated DISC income of $20, previously taxed income of $10, and other earnings and profits of $30. In addition, on August 1, 1974, X transfers all R's stock to Y Corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) in which under section 354 X recognizes no gain or loss. Under these facts, X includes in its gross income for 1974 a dividend of $15 which is attributable to the actual distribution of $60 paid out of earnings and profits on June 15, 1974. X excludes from gross income the balance of the $60 distribution ($45) paid out of earnings and profits because, under § 1.996-1(a), it is treated as paid out of previously taxed income. Y includes in its gross income for 1974 a dividend of $65 of which $35 is attributable to the deemed distribution of a dividend to Y on December 31, 1974, under § 1.995-2(a) and $30 is attributable to the qualifying distribution paid out of earnings and profits to Y on August 15, 1974. The adjustments to R's earnings and profits are summarized in the following table:

DISCs having corporate and noncorporate shareholders.
In the case of a DISC having one or more corporate shareholders but less than all of its shareholders subject to the special rules of section 291(a)(4), relating to certain deferred DISC income as a corporate preference item, accumulated DISC income and previously taxed income of the DISC are divided between the corporate shareholders, as a class, and the other shareholders, as a class, in proportion to amounts of DISC income not deemed distributed and amounts deemed distributed to each class. Subsequent taxation of actual and qualifying distributions shall be based upon this division. Thus, if a DISC is owned 50 percent by corporate shareholders and 50 percent by individual shareholders and has undistributed taxable income of $2,000 for its year, the division is made as follows:
Corporate shareholders:
Previously taxed income (57.5% of $2,000 ÷ 2)
$575
Accumulated DISC income (42.5% of $2,000 ÷ 2)
425
Individual shareholders:
Previously taxed income (50% of $2,000 ÷ 2)
500
Accumulated DISC income (50% of $2,000 ÷ 2)

§ 1.996-4
Subsequent effect of previous disposition of DISC stock.
(a)
Shareholder adjustment for previously taxed income.
(1) Under section 996(d)(1), except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if—
(i) Gain with respect to a share of stock of a DISC, or former DISC, is treated under § 1.995-4 as a dividend, and
(ii) With respect to such share, any person subsequently receives an actual distribution made out of accumulated DISC income, or a deemed distribution made, pursuant to § 1.995-3, by reason of disqualification, out of accumulated DISC income,
then such person shall treat such distribution in the same manner as a distribution from previously taxed income (and thus excludable from gross income under § 1.996-1(c)) to the extent that the gain referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph exceeds the aggregate amount of any other distributions with respect to such share which were treated under this subparagraph as made from previously taxed income.
(2) In applying subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to a share of stock in a DISC, or former DISC, the gain referred to in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph does not include any gain to a shareholder on a redemption of such share which qualifies as an exchange under section 302(a) or any gain on a disposition of such share prior to such redemption. Distributions described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph do not include a distribution in a redemption which qualifies as an
exchange under section 302(a). For adjustments to accumulated DISC income by reason of dividend treatment under § 1.995-4 with respect to gain upon a redemption of DISC stock to which section 302(a) applies and upon a prior disposition of such stock, see paragraph (b) of this section.
(3)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In 1974, under § 1.995-4, A, a shareholder of a DISC, on the sale of his DISC stock to B, is required to treat $20 of his gain as a dividend. The DISC has no previously taxed income and $40 of accumulated DISC income. Subsequently in the same year, B, the purchaser of the stock, receives an actual dividend distribution of $15 with respect to such stock which, under § 1.996-1(a), is treated as made out of accumulated DISC income. The amounts of the DISC's previously taxed income and accumulated DISC income were not adjusted by reason of the $20 treated as a dividend on the prior sale. However, even though the DISC had no previously taxed income, the purchaser would treat the $15 as though it had been paid out of previously taxed income and, therefore would not include the $15 in gross income. If in 1975, B receives another actual distribution of $9 with respect to such stock, $5 (
i.e.,
$20 dividend on A's sale less the $15 distribution to B in 1974 which was treated under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph as made from previously taxed income) is treated as made from previously taxed income and excluded from gross income. The result would be the same if, on January 1, 1975, B had transferred such stock to C by gift and the $9 distribution had been made to C.
(b)
Corporate adjustment upon redemption.
(1) Under section 996(d)(2), if by reason of § 1.995-4 gain on a redemption of stock in a DISC, or former DISC, is included in the shareholder's gross income as a dividend, then the accumulated DISC income shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of—
(i) The amount of gain on such redemption which, under § 1.995-4, is treated as a dividend, and
(ii) The amount of any gain with respect to such redeemed stock which, under § 1.995-4, was treated as a dividend on a disposition prior to such redemption minus the amount of distributions with respect to such stock which have been treated as made out of previously taxed income by reason of the application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(2) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The entire stock of a DISC, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, has been owned equally by A, B, C, and D since it was organized. At the close of 1976, when the DISC has $100 of accumulated DISC income, it redeems all of A's shares in a transaction qualifying as an exchange under section 302(a) and A, under § 1.995-4, includes $25 in his gross income as a dividend. The redemption has the effect of reducing accumulated DISC income by $25 to $75.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the stock of the DISC has not been held equally by A, B, C, and D since its organization. A purchased his shares from X in 1974 in a transaction in which X, under § 1.995-4, included in his gross income $30 as a dividend. In 1975, A receives a distribution of $10 out of accumulated DISC income which, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is treated as made out of previously taxed income. Under these facts, the redemption of A's stock in 1976 has the effect of reducing accumulated DISC income by $45 to $55 determined as follows:
(a) Accumulated DISC income
$100
(b) Minus sum of:
(1) Dividend on redemption of A's stock
$25
(2) Excess of dividend on X's sale ($30) over distribution to A treated as made out of previously taxed income ($10)
$20
Total

(c) Accumulated DISC income on 12/31/76

§ 1.996-5
Adjustment to basis.
(a)
Addition to basis.
Under section 996(e)(1) amounts representing deemed distributions as provided in section 995(b) shall increase the basis of the stock with respect to which the distribution is made.
(b)
Reductions of basis.
Under section 996(e)(2), the portion of an actual distribution treated as made out of previously taxed income shall reduce the basis of the stock with respect to which it is made and, to the extent that it exceeds the adjusted basis of such stock, shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property. In the case of stock includible in the gross estate of a decedent for which an election is made under section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation), this paragraph shall not apply to any distribution made after the date of the
decendent's death and before the alternate valuation date provided by section 2032. See section 1014(d) for a special rule for determining the basis of stock in a DISC, or former DISC, acquired from a decedent.
[T.D. 7324, 39 FR 35124, Sept. 30, 1974]
§ 1.996-6
Effectively connected income.
In the case of a shareholder who is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, trust, or estate, amounts taxable as dividends by reason of the application of § 1.995-4 (relating to gain on disposition of stock in a DISC), amounts treated under § 1.996-1 as distributed out of accumulated DISC income, and amounts deemed distributed under § 1.995-2(a) (1) through (4) shall be treated as gains and distributions which are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business conducted through a permanent establishment of such shareholder within the United States, and shall be subject to tax in accordance with the provisions of section 871(b) and the regulations thereunder in the case of nonresident alien individuals, trusts, or estates, or section 882 and the regulations thereunder in the case of foreign corporations. In no case, however shall other income of such shareholder be taxable as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business through a permanent establishment in the United States solely because of the application of this section.
[T.D. 7324, 39 FR 35124, Sept. 30, 1974]
§ 1.996-7
Carryover of DISC tax attributes.
(a)
In general.
Carryover of a DISC's divisions of earnings and profits to acquiring corporations in nontaxable transactions shall be subject to rules generally applicable to other corporate tax attributes. For example, a DISC which acquires the assets of another DISC in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies shall succeed to, and take into account, the divisions of the earnings and profits of the transferor DISC in accordance with section 381(c)(2).
(b)
Allocation of divisions of earnings and profits in corporate separations.
(1) If one DISC transfers part of its assets to a controlled DISC in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(D) applies and immediately thereafter the stock of the controlled DISC is distributed in a distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, then—
(i) The earnings and profits of the distributing DISC immediately before the transaction shall be allocated between the distributing DISC and the controlled DISC in accordance with the provisions of § 1.312-10.
(ii) Each of the divisions of such earnings and profits, namely previously taxed income, accumulated DISC income, and other earnings and profits, shall be allocated between the distributing DISC and the controlled DISC on the same basis as the earnings and profits are allocated.
(iii) Any assets of the distributing DISC whose status as qualified export assets is limited by its accumulated DISC income (e.g., producer's loans described in § 1.993-4, Export-Import Bank and other obligations described in § 1.993-2(h), and financing obligations described in § 1.993-2(i)) shall be treated as having been allocated, for the purpose of determining the classification of such assets in the hands of the distributing DISC or the controlled DISC, on the same basis as the earnings and profits are allocated regardless of how such assets are actually allocated.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On January 1, 1974, P Corporation transfers part of its assets to S Corporation, a newly organized subsidiary of P, in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(D) and distributes all the S stock in a transaction which qualifies under section 355. Immediately before such transfer, P had earnings and profits of $120,000 of which $100,000 constitutes accumulated DISC income. The unpaid balance of P's producer's loans is $80,000 all of which is retained by P. Pursuant to § 1.312-10, 25 percent of P's accumulated DISC income is allocated to S (

$25,000). P's producer's loans will be treated as allocated to S in the same proportion. Accordingly, for purposes of determining, under § 1.993-4(a)(3), the amount of producer's loans which S is entitled to make, S is treated as having an unpaid balance of producer's loans of $20,000 (
i.e.,
25% × $80,000) and P is treated as having an unpaid balance of $60,000 (
i.e.,
75% × $80,000).
(c)
Accumulated DISC income accounts of separate DISC's maintained after corporate combination.
If two or more DISC's combine to form a new DISC, or if the assets of one DISC are acquired by another DISC, in a transaction described in section 381(a), accumulated DISC income of the acquired DISC or DISC's shall carry over and be taken into account by the acquiring or new DISC, except that a separate account shall be maintained for the accumulated DISC income of any DISC scheduled to be received as a deemed distribution by its shareholders under § 1.995-3 (relating to deemed distributions upon disqualification). If, as a part of such transaction, the stock of the DISC which has accumulated DISC income scheduled to be deemed distributed is exchanged for stock of the acquiring or new DISC to which such accumulated DISC income is carried over and which maintains a separate account, then such accumulated DISC income shall be deemed distributed pro rata to shareholders of the acquiring or new DISC on the basis of stock ownership immediately after the exchange.

§ 1.996-8
Effect of carryback of capital loss or net operating loss to prior DISC taxable year.
(a) Under § 1.995-2(e), the deduction under section 172 for a net operating loss carryback or under section 1212 for a capital loss carryback is determined as if the DISC were a domestic corporation which had not elected to be treated as a DISC. A carryback of a net operating loss or of a capital loss of any corporation which reduces its taxable income for a preceding taxable year for which it qualified as a DISC will have the consequences enumerated in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
(b) For such preceding taxable year, the amount of a deemed distribution of one-half of certain taxable income described in § 1.995-2(a)(4) will ordinarily be reduced in effect (but not below zero) by one-half of the sum of the amount of the deduction under section 172 for such year for net operating loss carrybacks and the amount of the deduction under section 1212 for such year for capital loss carrybacks.
(c) The amount of reduction in the deemed distribution under paragraph (b) of this section will have the effect of increasing the limitation, provided in § 1.995-2(b)(2), on the amount of foreign investment attributable to producer's loans which is deemed distributed under § 1.995-2(a)(5).
(d) If the amount of a deemed distribution for a preceding taxable year is reduced as described in paragraph (b) of this section, then for such preceding taxable year the previously taxed income (as defined in § 1.996-3(c)) shall be decreased by the amount of such reduction and the accumulated DISC income (as defined in § 1.996-3(b)) shall be increased by the amount of such reduction. Such adjustments shall be made as of the time the deemed distribution for such preceding taxable year is treated as having occurred. See § 1.996-1(d) for the priority of such deemed distribution in relation to other distributions made in that preceding taxable year.
(e) The amount and treatment of any actual distribution made in such preceding taxable year or a year subsequent to such preceding year, and the treatment of gain on a disposition (in any such year) of the DISC's stock to which § 1.995-4 applies, shall be properly adjusted to reflect the adjustments to previously taxed income and accumulated DISC income described in paragraph (d) of this section.
[T.D. 7324, 39 FR 35125, Sept. 30, 1974]
§ 1.997-1
Special rules for subchapter C of the Code.
(a) For purposes of applying the provisions of sections 301 through 395 of the Code, any distribution in property to a corporation by a DISC, or former DISC, which is made out of previously taxed income or accumulated DISC income shall be treated as a distribution in the same amount as if such distribution of property were made to an individual, and have a basis, in the hands of the recipient corporation, equal to such amount treated as having been distributed.
(b) This section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation is the sole shareholder of Y Corporation which is a DISC. Y makes an actual distribution of property to
X with respect to X's stock in Y. The property has a basis of $50 and a fair market value of $100. The distribution is treated as made out of accumulated DISC income under section 996(a) and is taxable as a dividend under section 301(c)(1). Even though X is a corporation, the amount of the distribution is $100 notwithstanding the provisions of section 301(b)(1)(B) and the basis the property in X's hands is $100 notwithstanding the provisions of section 301(d)(2).
