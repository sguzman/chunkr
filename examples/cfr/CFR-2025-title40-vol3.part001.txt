emissions entering each control device used to control emissions from the converters, and venting from the converters to the atmosphere after passing through a control device or an uncontrolled bypass stack. The CEMS shall be used by the owner/operator to determine compliance with the emission limitation in paragraph (m)(4)(i) of this section. The owner/operator must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times that an affected unit is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments).
(ii)
Compliance determination for SO
2
. The 365-day rolling SO
2
emission control efficiency for the converters shall be calculated for each calendar day in accordance with the following procedure: Step one, sum the hourly pounds of SO
2
vented to each uncontrolled bypass stack and to each control device used to control emissions from the converters for the current calendar day and the preceding three-hundred-sixty-four (364) calendar days, to calculate the total pounds of pre-control SO
2
emissions over the most recent three-hundred-sixty-five (365) calendar day period; Step two, sum the hourly pounds of SO
2
vented to each uncontrolled bypass stack and emitted from the release point of each control device used to control emissions from the converters for the current calendar day and the preceding three-hundred-sixty-four (364) calendar days, to calculate the total pounds of post-control SO
2
emissions over the most recent three-hundred-sixty-five (365) calendar day period; Step three, divide the total amount of post-control SO
2
emissions calculated from Step two by the total amount of pre-control SO
2
emissions calculated from Step one, subtract the resulting ratio from one, and multiply the difference by 100 percent to calculate the 365-day rolling SO
2
emission control efficiency as a percentage.
(iii)
Compliance determination for nonsulfuric acid particulate matter.
Compliance with the emission limit for nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in paragraph (m)(4)(ii) of this section shall be demonstrated by the procedures in 40 CFR 63.1451(b) and 63.1453(a)(2). The owner/operator shall conduct an initial compliance test within 180 days after the compliance date specified in paragraph (m)(5) of
this section unless a test performed according to the procedures in 40 CFR 63.1450 in the past year shows compliance with the limit.
(iv)
Compliance determination for NO
X
. Compliance with the emission limit for NO
X
in paragraph (m)(4)(iii) of this section shall be demonstrated by monitoring natural gas consumption in each of the units identified in paragraph (m)(1) of this section for each calendar day. At the end of each calendar month, the owner/operator shall calculate monthly and 12-consecutive month NO
X
emissions by multiplying the daily natural gas consumption rates for each unit by an approved emission factor and adding the sums for all units over the previous 12-consecutive month period.
(7)
Alternatives to requirements to install CEMS.
The requirement in paragraph (m)(6)(i) of this section to install CEMS to measure the mass of SO
2
entering a control device or venting to the atmosphere through uncontrolled bypass stacks will be waived if the owner/operator complies with one of the options in this paragraph (m)(7).
(i)
Acid plants.
The owner/operator may calculate the pounds of SO
2
entering an acid plant during a calendar day by adding the pounds of SO
2
emitted through the acid plant tail stack and 0.653 times the daily production of anhydrous sulfuric acid from the acid plant.
(ii)
Alkali scrubber.
The owner/operator may calculate the pounds of SO
2
entering an alkali scrubber during a calendar day by using the following equation:
M
in,SO2
= M
out,SO2
+ SF*M
alk
Where:
M
in,SO2
is the calculated mass of SO
2
entering the scrubber during a calendar day;
M
out,SO2
is the mass of SO
2
emitted through the scrubber stack measured by the CEMS for the calendar day;
SF is a stoichiometric factor; and
M
alk
is the mass of alkali added to the scrubber liquor during the calendar day.
SF shall equal:
1.14 if the alkali species is calcium oxide (CaO);
1.59 if the alkali species is magnesium oxide (MgO);
0.801 if the alkali species is sodium hydroxide (NaOH); or
Another value if the owner/operator has received approval from the Regional Administrator in advance.
(iii)
Uncontrolled bypass stack.
The owner/operator may calculate the pounds of SO
2
venting to the atmosphere through an uncontrolled bypass stack based on test data provided the facility operates according to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan consistent with 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3) and EPA has approved a calculation methodology for planned and unplanned bypass events.
(8)
Capture system monitoring.
For each operating limit established under the capture system operation and maintenance plan required by paragraph (m)(3) of this section, the owner/operator must install, operate, and maintain an appropriate monitoring device according to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.1452(a)(1) though (6) to measure and record the operating limit value or setting at all times the required capture system is operating. Dampers that are manually set and remain in the same position at all times the capture system is operating are exempted from these monitoring requirements.
(9)
Recordkeeping.
The owner/operator shall maintain the following records for at least five years:
(i) All CEMS data, including the date, place, and time of sampling or measurement; parameters sampled or measured; and results.
(ii) Records of quality assurance and quality control activities for emissions measuring systems including, but not limited to, any records required by 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1.
(iii) Records of all major maintenance activities conducted on emission units, air pollution control equipment, and CEMS.
(iv) Any other records required by 40 CFR part 60, subpart F, or 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1.
(v) Records of all monitoring required by paragraph (m)(8) of this section.
(vi) Records of daily sulfuric acid production in tons per day of pure, anhydrous sulfuric acid if the owner/operator chooses to use the alternative compliance determination method in paragraph (m)(7)(i) of this section.
(vii) Records of daily alkali consumption in tons per day of pure, anhydrous alkali if the owner/operator chooses to use the alternative compliance determination method in paragraph (m)(7)(ii) of this section.
(viii) Records of planned and unplanned bypass events and calculations used to determine emissions from bypass events if the owner/operator chooses to use the alternative compliance determination method in paragraph (m)(7)(iii) of this section.
(ix) Records of daily natural gas consumption in each units identified in paragraph (m)(1) of this section and all calculations performed to demonstrate compliance with the limit in paragraph (m)(4)(iv) of this section.
(10)
Reporting.
All reports required under this section shall be submitted by the owner/operator to the Director, Enforcement Division (Mail Code ENF-2-1), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California 94105-3901. All reports required under this section shall be submitted within 30 days after the applicable compliance date in paragraph (m)(5) of this section and at least semiannually thereafter, within 30 days after the end of a semiannual period. The owner/operator may submit reports more frequently than semiannually for the purposes of synchronizing reports required under this section with other reporting requirements, such as the title V monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), but at no point shall the duration of a semiannual period exceed six months.
(i) The owner/operator shall promptly submit excess emissions reports for the SO
2
limit. Excess emissions means emissions that exceed the emissions limit specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The reports shall include the magnitude, date(s), and duration of each period of excess emissions, specific identification of each period of excess emissions that occurs during startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the unit, the nature and cause of any malfunction (if known), and the corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted. For the purpose of this paragraph (m)(10)(i), promptly shall mean within 30 days after the end of the month in which the excess emissions were discovered.
(ii) The owner/operator shall submit CEMS performance reports, to include dates and duration of each period during which the CEMS was inoperative (except for zero and span adjustments and calibration checks), reason(s) why the CEMS was inoperative and steps taken to prevent recurrence, and any CEMS repairs or adjustments. The owner/operator shall submit reports semiannually.
(iii) The owner/operator shall also submit results of any CEMS performance tests required by 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1 (Relative Accuracy Test Audits, Relative Accuracy Audits, and Cylinder Gas Audits).
(iv) When no excess emissions have occurred or the CEMS has not been inoperative, repaired, or adjusted during the reporting period, the owner/operator shall state such information in the semiannual report.
(v) When performance testing is required to determine compliance with an emission limit in paragraph (m)(4) of this section, the owner/operator shall submit test reports as specified in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.
(11)
Notifications.
(i) The owner/operator shall notify EPA of commencement of construction of any equipment which is being constructed to comply with the capture or emission limits in paragraph (m)(3) or (4) of this section.
(ii) The owner/operator shall submit semiannual progress reports on construction of any such equipment.
(iii) The owner/operator shall submit notification of initial startup of any such equipment.
(12)
Equipment operations.
At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate the unit including associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Pollution control equipment shall be designed and capable of operating properly to minimize emissions during all expected operating conditions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are
being used will be based on information available to the Regional Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the unit.
(13)
Enforcement.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this implementation plan, any credible evidence or information relevant as to whether the unit would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not the owner or operator has violated or is in violation of any standard or applicable emission limit in the plan.
