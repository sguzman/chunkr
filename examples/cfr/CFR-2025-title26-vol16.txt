# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 2.1
Statutory provisions; sections 511 and 905, Merchant Marine Act, 1936, and related statutes.
Sec. 511.
[Merchant Marine Act, 1936] (a) When used in this section the term
new vessel
means any vessel (1) documented or agreed with the Commission to be documented under the laws of the United States; (2) constructed in the United States after December 31, 1939, or the construction of which has been financed under titles V or VII of this Act, as amended, or the construction of which has been aided by a mortgage insured under title XI of this Act as amended; and (3) either (A) of such type, size, and speed as the Commission shall determine to be suitable for use on the high seas or Great Lakes in carrying out the purposes of this Act, but not of less than 2,000 gross tons or of less speed than twelve knots, unless the Commission shall determine and certify in each case that a vessel of a specified lesser tonnage or speed is desirable for use by the United States in case of war or national emergency, or (B) constructed to replace a vessel or vessels requisitioned or purchased by the United States.
(b) For the purpose of promoting the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of vessels, or for other purposes authorized in this section, necessary to carrying out the policy set forth in title I of this Act, any citizen of the United States who is operating a vessel or vessels in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries or owns in whole or in part a vessel or vessels being so operated, or who, at the time of purchase or requisition of the vessel by the Government, was operating a vessel or vessels so engaged or owned in whole or in part a vessel or vessels being so operated or had acquired or was having constructed a vessel or vessels for the purpose of operation in such commerce or in the fisheries, may establish a construction reserve fund, for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for other purposes authorized in this section, to be composed of deposits of proceeds from sales of vessels, indemnities on account of losses of vessels, earnings from the operation of vessels documented under the laws of the United States and from services incident thereto, and receipts, in the form of interest or otherwise, with respect to amounts previously deposited. Such construction reserve fund shall be established, maintained, expended, and used in accordance with the provisions of this section and rules or regulations to be prescribed jointly by the Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury.
(c) In the case of the sale or actual or constructive total loss of a vessel, if the taxpayer deposits an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale or to the net indemnity with respect to the loss in a construction reserve fund established under subsection (b), then—
(1) If the taxpayer so elects in his income-tax return for the taxable year in which the gain was realized, or
(2) In case a vessel is purchased or requisitioned by the United States, or is lost, in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939, and the taxpayer receives payment for the vessel so purchased or requisitioned, or receives from the United States indemnity on account of such loss, subsequent to the end of such taxable year, if the taxpayer so elects prior to the expiration of sixty days after the receipt of the payment or indemnity, and in accordance with a form of election to be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury,
no gain shall be recognized to the taxpayer in respect of such sale or indemnification in the computation of net income for the purposes of Federal income or excess-profits taxes. If an election is made under subdivision (2) and if computation or recomputation in accordance with this subsection is otherwise allowable but is prevented, on the date of making such election or within six months thereafter, by any statute of limitation, such computation or recomputation nevertheless shall be made notwithstanding such statute if a claim therefor is filed within six months after the date of making such election.
For the purposes of this subsection no amount shall be considered as deposited in a construction reserve fund unless it is deposited within sixty days after it is received by the taxpayer.
As used in this subsection the term
net proceeds
and the term
net indemnity
mean the sum of (1) the adjusted basis of the vessel and (2) the amount of gain which would be recognized to the taxpayer without regard to this subsection.
(d) The basis for determining gain or loss and for depreciation, for the purposes of Federal income or excess profits taxes, of any new vessel constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by the taxpayer, or with respect to which purchase-money indebtedness is liquidated as provided in subsection (g), in whole or in part out of the construction reserve fund shall be reduced by that portion of the deposits in the fund expended in the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, acquisition, or liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness of the new vessel which represents gain not recognized for tax purposes under subsection (c).
(e) For the purposes of this section, (1) if the net proceeds of a sale or the net indemnity in respect of a loss are deposited in more than one deposit, the amount consisting of the gain shall be considered as first deposited; (2) amounts expended, obligated, or otherwise withdrawn shall be applied against the amounts deposited in the fund in the order of deposit; and (3) if any deposit consists in part of gain not recognized under subsection (c), any expenditure, obligation, or withdrawal applied against such deposit shall be considered to consist of gain in the proportion that the part of the deposit consisting of gain bears to the total amount of the deposit.
(f) With respect to any taxable year, amounts on deposit on the last day of such year in a construction reserve fund in accordance with this section and with respect to which all the requirements of subsection (g) have been satisfied, to the extent that such requirements are applicable as of the last day of said taxable year, shall not constitute an accumulation of earnings or profits within the meaning of section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code [Part I (section 531 and following), Subchapter A, Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954].
(g) The provisions of subsections (c) and (f) shall apply to any deposit in the construction reserve fund only to the extent that such deposit is expended or obligated for expenditure, in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed jointly by the Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury—
(1) Under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels (or in the discretion of the Commission, for a part interest therein), or, with the approval of the Commission, for the reconstruction or reconditioning of a new vessel or vessels, entered into within (i) two years from the date of deposit or the date of any extension thereof which may be granted by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 511(h), in the case of deposits made prior to the date [July 17, 1952] on which these amendatory provisions become effective, or (ii) three years from the date of such deposit in the case of a deposit made after such effective date, only if under such rules and regulations—
(A) Within such period not less than 12
1/2
per centum of the construction or contract price of the vessel or vessels is paid or irrevocably committed on account thereof and the plans and specifications therefor are approved by the Commission to the extent by it deemed necessary; and
(B) In case of a vessel or vessels not constructed under the provisions of this title or not purchased from the Commission, (i) said construction is completed, within six months from the date of the construction contract, to the extent of not less than 5 per centum thereof (or in case the contract covers more than one vessel, the construction of the first vessel so contracted for is so completed to the extent of not less than 5 per centum) as estimated by the Commission and certified by it to the Secretary of the Treasury, and (ii) all construction under such contract is completed with reasonable dispatch thereafter;
(2) For the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness to persons other than a parent company of, or a company affiliated or associated
with, the mortgagor on a new vessel or vessels within (i) two years from the date of deposit or the date of any extension thereof which may be granted by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 511(h), in the case of deposits made prior to the date [July 17, 1952] on which these amendatory provisions become effective, or (ii) three years from the date of such deposit in the case of a deposit made after such effective date.
(h) The Commission is authorized under rules and regulations to be prescribed jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commission to grant extensions of the period within which the deposits shall be expended or obligated or within which construction shall have progressed to the extent of 5 per centum of completion as provided herein, but such extension shall not be for an aggregate additional period in excess of two years with respect to the expenditure or obligation of such deposits or more than one year with respect to the progress of such construction:
Provided,
That until January 1, 1965, in addition to the extensions hereinbefore permitted, further extensions may be granted ending not later than December 31, 1965.
(i) Any such deposited gain or portion thereof which is not so expended or obligated within the period provided, or which is otherwise withdrawn before the expiration of such period, or with respect to which the construction has not progressed to the extent of 5 per centum of completion within the period provided, or with respect to which the Commission finds and certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury that, for causes within the control of the taxpayer, the entire construction is not completed with reasonable dispatch, if otherwise taxable income under the law applicable to the taxable year in which such gain was realized, shall be included in the gross income for such taxable year, except for the purpose of the declared value excess-profits tax and the capital stock tax. If any such deposited gain or portion thereof with respect to a deposit made in any taxable year ending on or before June 30, 1945, is so included in gross income for such taxable year, there shall (in addition to any other deficiency) be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as if it were a deficiency, an amount equal to 1.1 per centum of the amount of gain so included, such amount being in lieu of any adjustment with respect to the declared value excess-profits tax for such taxable year.
(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any deficiency in tax for any taxable year resulting from the inclusion of any amount in gross income as provided by subsection (i), and the amount to be treated as a deficiency under such subsection in lieu of any adjustment with respect to the declared value excess-profits tax, may be assessed or a proceeding in court for the collection thereof may be begun without assessment, at any time:
Provided, however,
That interest on any such deficiency or amount to be treated as a deficiency shall not begin until the date the deposited gain or portion thereof in question is required under subsection (i) to be included in gross income.
(k) This section shall be applicable to a taxpayer only in respect of sales or indemnifications for losses occurring within a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939, and only in respect of earnings derived during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939.
(l) For the purposes of this section a vessel shall be considered as constructed or acquired by the taxpayer if constructed or acquired by a corporation at a time when the taxpayer owns at least 95 per centum of the total number of shares of each class of stock of the corporation.
(m) The terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(n) The terms
contract for the construction
and
construction contract,
as used in this section, shall include, in the case of a taxpayer who constructs a new vessel in a shipyard owned by such taxpayer, an agreement between such taxpayer and the Commission with respect to such construction and containing provisions deemed necessary or advisable by the Commission to carry out the purposes and policy of this section.
(o) The terms
reconstruction and reconditioning,
as used in this section, shall include the reconstruction, reconditioning, or modernization of a vessel for exclusive use on the Great Lakes, including the St. Lawrence River and Gulf, if the Commission determines that the objectives of this Act will be promoted by such reconstruction, reconditioning, or modernization, and, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, such vessel shall be deemed to be a “new vessel” within the meaning of this section for such reconstruction, reconditioning, or modernization.

Scope of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part.
(a)
Applicability of regulations.
(1) The regulations prescribed in this part—
(i) Apply to gain realized from the sale or loss of vessels, earnings from the operation of vessels, and interest (or otherwise) with respect to amounts previously deposited in the construction reserve fund, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1964, and

(b)
Nonrecognition and accumulation.
Section 511 of the Act provides, under conditions specified, for the nonrecognition, for income and excess-profits tax purposes, of the gain realized from the sale or indemnification for loss of certain vessels including certain vessels in the course of construction, or shares therein. It also permits
the accumulation of the proceeds of such sales or indemnification and of certain earnings without liability under Part I (section 531 and following), Subchapter G, Chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and the regulations thereunder (§§ 1.531-1 through 1.537-3 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations)).
(c)
Availability of benefits.
The benefits of section 511 of the Act are available to any citizen as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of § 2.1-1, who, during any taxable year owns, in whole or in part, a vessel or vessels within the scope of § 2.1-3. A citizen operating such a vessel or vessels owned by any other person or persons can derive no benefit from the provisions relating to the nonrecognition of gain from the sale or loss of such vessel or vessels so owned, but may establish a construction reserve fund in which he may deposit earnings from the operation of such vessel or vessels.
(d)
Applicability of section 511.
Section 511 of the Act applies only with respect to sales or losses of vessels within the scope of § 2.1-3 or in respect of earnings derived from the operation of such vessels. A loss to be within section 511 of the Act must be an actual or constructive total loss. Whether there is a total loss, actual or constructive, will be determined by the Administration.
§ 2.1-3
Requirements as to vessel operations.
Section 511 of the Act applies with respect to vessels operated in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries of the United States and vessels acquired or being constructed for the purpose of such operation. The foreign commerce of the United States includes commerce or trade between the United States (including the District of Columbia), the territories and possessions which are embraced within the coastwise laws, and a foreign country or other territories and possessions of the United States. The domestic commerce of the United States includes commerce or trade between ports of the United States and its territories and possessions, embraced within the coastwise laws and on inland rivers. The fisheries include the fisheries of the United States and its territories and possessions. Section 511 of the Act does not apply to vessels operated in the foreign commerce or fisheries of any country other than the United States.
§ 2.1-4
Application to establish fund.
Any person claiming to be entitled to the benefits of section 511 of the Act may make application, in writing, to the Administration for permission to establish a construction reserve fund. The application shall be in such form and substance as the Administration may prescribe and shall designate, among other things, the depository or depositories with which the taxpayer proposes to establish the said fund. The original application shall be executed and verified by the taxpayer, or if the taxpayer is a corporation, by one of its principal officers, in triplicate, and shall be accompanied by eight conformed copies when filed with the Administration.
§ 2.1-5
Tentative authorization to establish fund.
Where the time between the receipt by the Administration of the application for permission to establish a construction reserve fund and the date prior to which an amount received from the sale or loss of a vessel must be deposited to come within the scope of section 511 of the Act is insufficient to permit a determination of the eligibility of the applicant, the Administration may tentatively authorize the establishment of a construction reserve fund and the deposit of such amount therein. Such tentative authorization shall be subject to rescission by the Administration if subsequently it is determined that the applicant is not entitled to the benefits of section 511 of the Act, or has not complied with the statutory requirements. For example, a tentative authorization will be rescinded if the Administration ascertains that the applicant is not a citizen. Upon such determination, the fund shall be closed and all amounts on deposit therein shall be withdrawn.
§ 2.1-6
Establishment of fund.
(a)
Authorization by the Administration.
If the application is approved by
the Administration, the Administration will adopt Orders authorizing the establishment of a construction reserve fund with the depository or depositories designated by the taxpayer and approved by the Administration. The Orders will provide for joint control by the Administration and the taxpayer over such fund, will set forth the conditions governing the establishment and maintenance of the fund and the making of deposits therein and withdrawals therefrom, and will designate the representatives authorized to execute instruments of withdrawal on behalf of the Administration.
(b)
Resolution or agreement of the taxpayer.
A certified copy of the Orders of the Administration will be furnished the taxpayer. If the taxpayer is a corporation, it shall promptly adopt, through its board of directors, a resolution satisfactory in form and substance to the Administration, authorizing the establishment and maintenance of the fund in conformity with the action of the Administration. If the taxpayer is not a corporation, it shall promptly execute an agreement with the depository satisfactory in form and substance to the Administration to conform to the action of the Administration as set forth in the Orders. Certified copies of the Orders of the Administration and of the resolution of the taxpayer (if it is a corporation) will be furnished to the depository by the Administration and the taxpayer, respectively, for its guidance in maintaining the fund and honoring instruments of withdrawal. The taxpayer, if a corporation, shall also furnish the Administration with a certified copy of its resolution, or if not a corporation, a duplicate original of its agreement with the depository.
(c)
Constructive action not recognized.
Constructive deposits, substitutions or withdrawals will not be recognized by the Administration in the establishment and maintenance of the fund.
(d)
Failure to make deposits as basis for termination of fund.
In the event no deposit is made into the fund for more than five years, any amounts remaining in the fund shall be removed from the fund at the discretion of the Administration and, if so removed, the fund shall be terminated. In the event of such termination, see § 2.1-23 for recognition of gain.
§ 2.1-7
Circumstances permitting reimbursement from a construction reserve fund.
(a)
Payments prior to establishment of fund.
If, prior to the establishment of a construction reserve fund under the regulations in this part, a taxpayer has made necessary payments under a contract which satisfies the provisions of the regulations in this part and section 511 of the Act for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel, such taxpayer may, if subsequently authorized to establish a construction reserve fund under the regulations in this part, draw against such fund as reimbursement for the amount, if any, of other funds which, with the approval or ratification of the Administration, the taxpayer used for making such necessary payments prior to the establishment of the fund.
(b)
Payments subsequent to establishment of fund.
If, subsequent to the establishment of a construction reserve fund under the regulations in this part, the taxpayer has made necessary payments under a contract which satisfies the provisions of the regulations in this part and section 511 of the Act for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel, such taxpayer may draw against such fund as reimbursement for the amount, if any, of other funds which, with the approval or ratification of the Administration, the taxpayer had used for the purpose of making such necessary payments.
§ 2.1-8
Investment of funds in securities.
(a)
Obligations of or guaranteed by the United States.
Interest-bearing direct obligations of the United States, or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, may be deposited in the construction reserve fund in lieu of cash, may be purchased with cash on deposit in the fund, or may be substituted for securities or commitment to finance in the fund, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Other securities.
In cases where the taxpayer desires to deposit any securities in the fund in lieu of cash other
than those of or guarantees by the United States or to purchase such other securities with cash on deposit in the fund, or to substitute such other securities for securities or commitment to finance in the fund, the taxpayer shall make written application to the Administration and shall not consummate the transaction until the written consent of the Administration shall have been received. The application shall describe the securities fully. Every approval by the Administration of such application shall be conditioned upon agreement by the taxpayer forthwith to dispose of such securities upon subsequent request by the Administration. Immediately upon the purchase of any securities for deposit in the fund, the taxpayer shall advise the Administration, giving the date of purchase, a description of the securities, and the price paid therefor (net, brokerage and other charges, and gross). Ordinarily, the Administration will not approve the deposit in the fund in lieu of cash, or the purchase with cash on deposit in the fund or the substitution for securities in the fund of securities not actively traded in on exchanges registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. ch. 2B), or securities which are not legal for investment of trust funds. Whenever the Administration approves the substitution of other securities for securities in the fund, such substitution shall be effected only upon or after the deposit of the substituted securities into the fund.
(c)
Cash.
Cash may be substituted for amounts which are on deposit in the fund in any other form.
(d)
Devalued securities.
In the event the Administration determines that the market value at any date of any securities in the fund has decreased to a figure which is less than 90 percent of the market value at the time of deposit into the fund, then within 60 days after the taxpayer receives notice of such determination the taxpayer shall (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph) deposit into the fund cash or securities in an amount equal to the difference between the current market value of the devalued securities and the market value of such securities at the time of their original deposit. However if any securities in the fund are valued at the time of their deposit at less than the market value of such securities at the time of their deposit the taxpayer shall be required to deposit only an amount equal to that portion of the difference between the current market value of the devalued securities and the market value of such securities at the time of their original deposit which bears the same ratio to such total difference as the amount at which the securities were valued at the time of their deposit bears to the market value at the time of such deposit.
§ 2.1-9
Valuation of securities in fund.
(a)
Equivalent values.
In cases where securities are deposited in the fund in lieu of cash, or are purchased with cash on deposit in the fund, or are substituted for securities in the fund, the value of such securities must not be less than the amount of cash in lieu of which they are so deposited or with which they are so purchased, or the value at the time of deposit of the securities for which they were so substituted. If the securities on deposit in the fund are replaced by cash from the general funds of the taxpayer, the amount of cash to be deposited in the fund in lieu thereof shall be not less than the amount at which such securities were valued at the time of their deposit in the fund.
(b)
Determination of value.
(1) For the purpose of determining the amount in the fund, the value of securities shall be their “market value” (which shall be the basis for determining value, unless otherwise agreed to by the administration) and shall be determined in the following manner:
(i) In instances where no actual purchase is involved, such as the initial deposit of securities in the fund in lieu of cash, the last sales price thereof on the principal exchange on the day the deposit was made shall be deemed to be the “market value” thereof, or, if no such sales were made, the “market value” thereof will be determined by the Administration on such basis as it may deem to be fair and reasonable in each case.
(ii) In instances where the purchase of securities with cash on deposit in the fund is involved, “market value”
shall be the gross price paid (adjusted for accrued interest):
Provided,
That if such securities are purchased otherwise than upon a registered exchange the price shall be within the range of transactions on the exchange on the date of such purchase, or, if there were no such transactions, then the “market value” thereof will be determined by the Administration on such basis as it may deem to be fair and reasonable in each case.
(2) Purchase-money obligations secured by mortgages on vessels sold or irrevocable commitments to finance the construction or acquisition of new vessels which are deposited in the construction reserve fund as provided in § 2.1-13 ordinarily will be considered as equivalent to their face value.
§ 2.1-10
Withdrawals from fund.
(a)
Withdrawals for obligations or liquidation.
(1) Checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal to meet obligations under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, after having been executed by the taxpayer, shall be forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, with appropriate explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal, including properly certified invoices or other supporting papers. Such instruments of withdrawal, if payable to the Administration, will be deposited by the Administration for collection, and the proceeds thereof, upon collection, will be credited to the appropriate contract with the Administration; but if drawn to the order of payees other than the Administration, after countersignature on behalf of the Administration, will ordinarily be forwarded to the payees.
(2) An amount obligated under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, whether the obligor has the entire or a partial interest therein within the scope of section 511 of the Act, may not, so long as the contract or indebtedness continues in full force and effect, be withdrawn except to meet payments due or to become due under such contract or for such liquidation.
(b)
Other withdrawals.
Checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal executed by the taxpayer for purposes other than to meet obligations under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, whether the taxpayer has the entire or a partial interest therein, shall be drawn by the taxpayer to its own order and forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, with appropriate explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal. Such withdrawals may occur by reason of a determination by the Administration that the taxpayer is not entitled to the benefits of section 511 of the Act (see § 2.1-5), or that a particular deposit has been improperly made (see § 2.1-13), or by reason of the election of the taxpayer to make such withdrawals. Upon receipt of such checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal, the Administration will give notice thereof to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Commissioner will advise the Administration of the receipt of the notice and the date it was received. The Administration shall not countersign such checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal or transmit them to the taxpayer until the expiration of 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice by the Commissioner, unless the Commissioner or such official of the Internal Revenue Service as he may designate for the purpose consents in writing to earlier countersignature by the Administration and transmittal to the taxpayer. Upon the expiration of such 30-day period, or prior thereto if the aforesaid consent of the Commissioner has been obtained, the Administration will countersign the check, draft, or other instrument of withdrawal and forward it to the taxpayer.
(c)
Inapplicability to certain transactions.
The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to transactions deemed to be withdrawals by reason of the sale of securities held in the fund for an amount less than the market
value thereof at the time of their deposit (see § 2.1-23), nor to the cancellation of an irrevocable commitment deposited in the fund, upon proof satisfactory to the Administration that the terms of such commitment have been fully satisfied.
§ 2.1-11
Time deposits.
Deposits in the construction reserve fund not invested in securities may be placed in time deposits when, in the judgment of the taxpayer, it is desirable and feasible so to do. The taxpayer shall promptly advise the Administration of any time deposit arrangements made with the depository. The Administration reserves the right at any time to require the termination or modification of any such arrangements. With prior approval of the Administration a time deposit may be made in a depository other than the one with which the construction reserve fund is established.
§ 2.1-12
Election as to nonrecognition of gain.
(a)
Election requirements.
As a prerequisite to the nonrecognition of gain on the sale or loss of a vessel (or of a part interest therein) for Federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer, after establishing a construction reserve fund, must make an election with respect to such vessel or interest in the manner set forth in this paragraph.
(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the election must be made in the taxpayer's Federal income tax return (or, in the case of a partnership, in the partnership return of income) for the taxable year in which the gain with respect to the sale or loss of the vessel is realized. The election as to the nonrecognition of gain shall be shown by a statement to that effect, submitted as a part of, and attached to, the return. The statement, which need not be on any prescribed form, shall set forth a computation of the amount of the realized gain, the identity of the vessel, the nature and extent of the taxpayer's interest therein, whether such vessel was sold or lost and the date of sale or loss, the full sale price or full amount of indemnity, and the amount and date of each payment thereof, the basis for tax purposes and any other data affecting the determination of the realized gain.
(2)
Certain Government payments.
In case a vessel is purchased or requisitioned by the United States, or is lost, in any taxable year and the taxpayer receives payment for the vessel so purchased or requisitioned, or receives from the United States indemnity on account of such loss, subsequent to the end of such taxable year, the taxpayer shall make his election by filing notice thereof with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC, 20224, prior to the expiration of 60 days after receipt of the payment or indemnity. The taxpayer shall file a copy of the notice with the Secretary, Federal Maritime Board, Washington, DC, 20573. The form of the notice of election shall be prepared by the taxpayer and shall be substantially as follows:

# Election Relative to Nonrecognition of Gain Under Section 511(

(b) [Reserved]
§ 2.1-13
Deposit of proceeds of sales or indemnities.
(a)
Manner of deposit.
The deposit required by section 511 of the Act must be made in a construction reserve fund established with a depository or depositories approved by the Administration and subject to the joint control of the Administration and the taxpayer. It is not necessary to establish a separate fund with respect to each vessel or share in a vessel sold or lost.
(b)
Amount of deposit.
With respect to any vessel sold or lost, or a share therein, the deposit must be in an amount equal to the “net proceeds” of the sale, or the “net indemnity” for the loss. By “net proceeds” and “net indemnity” is meant (1) the depositor's interest in the adjusted basis of the vessel plus (2) the amount of gain which would be recognized for tax purposes in the absence of section 511 of the Act. In determining “net proceeds”, the amount necessarily paid or incurred for brokers' commissions is to be deducted from the gross amount of the sales price. In the event the taxpayer is an affiliate or associate of the buyer, the amount of the sales price shall not exceed the fair market value of the vessel or vessels sold as determined by the Administration. In such case the taxpayer shall furnish evidence sufficient, in the opinion of the Administration, to establish that the sales price is not in excess of the fair market value. In determining “net indemnity”, the amount necessarily paid or incurred purely for collection, or rate of exchange discounts on the payment, of the indemnity is to be deducted from the gross amount of collectible indemnity. In case of the sale or loss of several vessels or share therein, a deposit of the “net proceeds” or “net indemnity” with respect to one or more of the vessels or shares is permissible. Where several vessels or shares are sold for a lump sum, the “net proceeds” allocated to each vessel or share shall be determined in accordance with any reasonable rule satisfactory to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The taxpayer must deposit the full amount of each payment (including cash, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness) as a single deposit in the construction reserve fund. A payment divided between two or more depositories will be regarded as a single deposit. Amounts received by the taxpayer prior to the date of consummation of the sale of the vessel shall be considered as having been received by the taxpayer at the time the sale is consummated.
(c)
Purchase-money obligations.
Where the proceeds from the sale of a vessel include purchase-money obligations, such obligations together with the entire collateral therefor, or, in the case of deposit of the proceeds of a share in the vessel, a proportionate part of the obligations and collateral as determined by the Administration, shall be deposited, with the remainder of the proceeds, in the construction reserve fund as a part of the “net proceeds”. The depository shall receive payment of all amounts due on such purchase-money obligations and such amounts shall be placed in the fund in substitution for the portion of the obligations paid. All installments of purchase-money obligations shall be paid directly into the fund by the obligor. In the event any such installment is not so deposited, the Administration, at any time after the due date, may require the taxpayer to deposit an amount equal to such installment. If the taxpayer so desires, he may deposit in the construction reserve fund cash or approved securities in an amount equal to the face value of any purchase-money obligations in lieu of depositing such obligations.
(d)
Vessel subject to mortgage at time of sale or loss.
Where a vessel is subject to a mortgage or other encumbrance at the time of its sale or loss and the taxpayer actually receives only an amount representing the equity therein or a share in such equity corresponding to his share in the vessel, he shall deposit in the construction reserve fund such amount and concurrently therewith other funds in an amount equal to the difference between the amount received and the “net proceeds” or “net indemnity”. Such other funds may be in the form of cash, or, subject to the approval of the Administration, (1) interest-bearing securities, or (2) an irrevocable and unconditional commitment to finance the construction or acquisition of a new vessel in whole or in
part by an obligor approved by the Administration in an amount equal to the amount by which the “net proceeds” exceed the cash or securities deposited in the fund.
(e)
Unauthorized deposits.
A deposit which is not provided for by section 511 of the Act shall, without unreasonable delay, be withdrawn from the fund and tax liability will be determined as though such deposit had not been made. (See §§ 2.1-10 and 2.1-24.)
§ 2.1-14
Deposit of earnings and receipts.
(a)
Earnings.
A citizen may deposit all or any part of earnings derived from the operation, within the scope of § 2.1-3, of a vessel or vessels owned either by himself or any other person, if such earnings are intended for construction or acquisition of new vessels. Such earnings may include payments received by an owner, as compensation for use of his vessel, from other persons by whom it is so operated. Earnings from other sources may not be deposited. The earnings from operation of vessels which are eligible for deposit are the net earnings determined without regard to any deduction for depreciation, obsolescence, or amortization with respect to such vessels.
(b)
Receipts.
Receipts from deposited funds, in the form of interest or otherwise, may be deposited.
§ 2.1-15
Time for making deposits.
(a)
Proceeds of sale or indemnification.
Deposits of amounts representing proceeds of the sale or indemnification for loss of a vessel or share therein must be made within 60 days after receipt by the taxpayer.
(b)
Earnings and receipts.
Earnings and receipts for the taxable year may be deposited at any time. (See § 2.1-14.)
§ 2.1-16
Tax liability as to earnings deposited.
Deposit in the construction reserve fund of earnings from the operation of a vessel or vessels, or receipts, in the form of interest or otherwise, with respect to amounts previously deposited does not exempt the taxpayer from tax liability with respect thereto nor postpone the time such earnings or receipts are includible in gross income. Earnings and receipts deposited in a construction reserve fund established in accordance with the provisions of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part will be deemed to have been accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business within the meaning of part 1 (section 531 and following), Subchapter G, Chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, so long as the requirements of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part are satisfied relative to the use of the fund in the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels. For incurrence of tax liability due to noncompliance with the requirements of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part with respect to deposits in the construction reserve fund, see the provisions of § 2.1-23.
§ 2.1-17
Basis of new vessel.
The basis for determining gain or loss and for depreciation for the purpose of the Federal income tax with respect to a new vessel constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by the taxpayer, or with respect to which purchase-money indebtedness is liquidated as provided in section 511(g) of the Act, with funds deposited in the construction reserve fund, is reduced by the amount of the unrecognized gain represented in the funds allocated under the provisions of the regulations in this part to the cost of such vessel. (See § 2.1-18.)
§ 2.1-18
Allocation of gain for tax purposes.
(a)
General rules of allocation.
As provided in § 2.1-17, if amounts on deposit in a construction reserve fund are expended, obligated, or withdrawn for construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness of such vessels, the portion thereof which represents gain shall be applied in reduction of the basis of such new vessels. The rules set forth below in this paragraph shall apply in allocating the unrecognized gain to the amounts so expended, obligated, or withdrawn:
(1) If the “net proceeds” of a sale or “net indemnity” in respect of a loss are deposited in more than one deposit, the portion thereof representing unrecognized gain shall be considered as having been deposited first.
(2) Amounts expended, obligated, or withdrawn from the construction reserve fund shall be applied against amounts deposited in the order of deposit.
(3) If any deposit consists in part of gain not recognized under section 511(c) of the Act, then any expenditure, obligation, or withdrawal applied against such deposit shall be considered to consist of gain in the same proportion that the part of the deposit which constitutes gain bears to the total amount of the deposit.
(b)
Date of obligation.
The date funds are obligated under a contract for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, rather than the date of payment from the fund, will determine the order of application against the deposits in the fund. When a contract for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels is entered into, amounts on deposit in the construction reserve fund will be deemed to be obligated to the extent of the amount of the taxpayer's liability under the contract. Deposits will be deemed to be so obligated in the order of deposit, each new contract obligating the earliest deposit not previously expended, obligated, or withdrawn. If the liability under the contract exceeds the amount in the construction reserve fund, the contract will be deemed to obligate, to the extent of that part of such excess not otherwise satisfied, the earliest deposit or deposits thereafter made.
(c)
Illustration.
The foregoing rules are illustrated in the following example:

# Example.
(1) A taxpayer who makes his returns on the calendar year basis sells a vessel in 1963 for $1,000,000, realizing a gain of $400,000. Payment of $100,000 is received in March 1963 when the contract is signed, and the balance of $900,000 is received in June 1963 on delivery of the vessel. The $1,000,000 is deposited in a construction reserve fund in July 1963. In December 1963, the taxpayer also deposits $150,000, representing earnings of that year. In 1964, he sells another vessel for $1,000,000, realizing a gain of $250,000. The sale price of $1,000,000 is received on delivery of the vessel in February 1964, and deposited in the construction reserve fund in March 1964. In September 1964, the taxpayer purchases for cash out of the construction reserve fund a new vessel for $1,750,000. To the cost of this vessel must be allocated the 1963 deposits of $1,150,000 and $600,000 of the March 1964 deposit. This leaves in the fund $400,000 of the March 1964 deposit. The amount of the unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of the new vessel is $550,000, computed as follows: Gain of $400,000 represented in the 1963 deposits, plus the same proportion of the $250,000 gain represented in the March 1964 deposit ($1,000,000) which the amount ($600,000) allocated to the vessel is of the amount of the deposit, i.e., $400,000 plus 600,000/1,000,000 of $250,000 or $150,000, a total of $550,000. This reduces the basis of the new vessel to $1,200,000 ($l,750,000 less $550,000).
(2) In 1965, the taxpayer sells a third vessel for $3,000,000, realizing a gain of $900,000. The $3,000,000 is received and deposited in the construction reserve fund in June 1965, making a total in the fund of $3,400,000. In December 1965, the taxpayer contracts for the construction of a second new vessel to cost a maximum of $3,200,000, thereby obligating that amount of the fund, and in June 1966, receives permission to withdraw the unobligated balance amounting to $200,000. To the cost of the second new vessel must be allocated the $400,000 balance of the March 1964 deposit and $2,800,000 of the June 1965 deposit. The unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of such new vessel is that proportion of the gain represented in each deposit which the portion of the deposit allocated to the vessel bears to the amount of such deposit, i.e., 400,000/1,000,000 of $250,000, or $100,000 plus 2,800,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $840,000 making a total of $940,000. The $200,000 withdrawal is applied against the June 1965 deposit and the portion thereof which represents gain will be recognized as income for 1965, the year in which realized. The computation of the recognized gain is as follows: 200,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $60,000.
§ 2.1-19
Requirements as to new vessels.
(a)
Requirements.
For the purposes of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part, the new vessel must be—
(1) Documented under the laws of the United States when it is acquired by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer must
agree that when acquired it will be documented under the laws of the United States;
(2)(i) Constructed in the United States after December 31, 1939, or (ii) its construction has been financed under title V or title VII of the Act, or (iii) its construction has been aided by a mortgage insured under title XI of the Act; and
(3) Either (i) of such type, size, and speed as the Administration determines to be suitable for use on the high seas or Great Lakes in carrying out the purposes of the Act, but of not less than 2,000 gross tons or of less speed than 12 knots, except that a particular vessel may be of lesser tonnage or speed if the Administration determines and certifies that the particular vessel is desirable for use by the United States in case of war or national emergency, or (ii) constructed to replace a vessel or vessels requisitioned or purchased by the United States, in which event it must be of such type, size, and speed as to constitute a suitable replacement for the vessel requisitioned or purchased, but if a vessel already built is acquired to replace a vessel or vessels requisitioned or purchased by the United States, such vessel must meet the requirements set forth in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Ordinarily, under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a vessel constructed more than five years before the date on which deposits in a construction reserve fund are to be expended or obligated for acquisition of such vessel will not be considered suitable for use in carrying out the purpose of the Act, except that the five-year age limitation provided above in this sentence shall not apply to a vessel to be reconstructed before being placed in operation by the taxpayer.
(b)
Time of construction.
A vessel will be deemed to be constructed after December 31, 1939, only if construction was commenced after that date. Subject to the provisions of this section, a new vessel may be newly built for the taxpayer, or may be acquired after it is built.
(c)
Replacement of vessels.
It is not necessary that vessels shall be replaced vessel for vessel. The new vessels may be more or less in number than the replaced vessels, provided the other requirements of this section are met.
§ 2.1-20
Obligation of deposits.
(a)
Time for obligation.
Within three years from the date of any deposit in a construction reserve fund, unless extension is granted as provided in § 2.1-22, such deposit must be obligated under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels (or in the discretion of the Administration for a share therein), with not less than 12
1/2
percent of the construction or contract price of the entire vessel or vessels actually paid or irrevocably committed on account thereof or must be expended or obligated for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness to persons other than a parent company of, or a company affiliated or associated with, the mortgagor on a new vessel or vessels. Amounts on deposit in a construction reserve fund will be deemed to be obligated for expenditure when a binding contract of construction or acquisition has been entered into or when purchase-money indebtedness has been incurred and, if obligated under a contract of construction or acquisition, will be deemed to be irrevocably committed when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the contract of construction or acquisition.
(b)
Requirements for obligations.
Unless otherwise authorized by the Administration, contracts for the construction of new vessels must be for a fixed price, or provide for a base price that may be adjusted for changes in labor and material costs not exceeding 15 percent of the base price. The fixed or base price, as the case may be, shall be fair and reasonable as determined by the Maritime Administration. Any financial or other interests between the taxpayer and the contractor shall be disclosed to the Administration by the taxpayer. Plans and specifications for the new vessel or vessels must be approved by the Administration to the extent it deems necessary. A deposit in a construction reserve fund may be expended or obligated for expenditure for procurement under an acquisition or construction contract of a part interest in
a new vessel or vessels only after obtaining the written consent of the Administration. The granting of such consent shall be entirely in the discretion of the Administration and it may impose such conditions with respect thereto as it may deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of section 511 of the Act. Applications for such consent shall be executed in triplicate, and, together with eight conformed copies thereof, filed with the Administration.
§ 2.1-21
Period for construction of certain vessels.
A new vessel constructed otherwise than under the provisions of title V of the Act, and not purchased from the Administration must, within six months from the date of the construction contract, or within the period of any extension, be completed to the extent of not less than 5 percent as estimated by the Administration and certified by it to the Secretary of the Treasury. In case of a contract covering more than one vessel it will be sufficient if one of the vessels is 5 percent completed within the six months' period from the date of the contract or within the period of any extension, and so certified. All construction must be completed with reasonable dispatch as determined by the Administration. If, for causes within the control of the taxpayer, the entire construction is not completed with reasonable dispatch, the Administration will so certify to the Secretary of the Treasury. For the effect of such certification, see § 2.1-23.
§ 2.1-22
Time extensions for expenditure or obligation.
(a)
Extensions.
The Administration, upon application and a showing of proper circumstances, (1) may allow an extension of time within which deposits shall be expended or obligated, not to exceed one year, and upon a second application received before the expiration of the first extension, may allow an additional extension not to exceed one year, and (2) may allow an extension or extensions of time within which five percent of the construction shall have been completed as provided in § 2.1-21 not to exceed one year in the aggregate, and (3) may allow any other extensions that may be provided by amendment to the Act.
(b)
Application required.
A taxpayer seeking an extension of time shall make application therefor, and transmit it with an appropriate statement of the circumstances, including the reasons justifying the requested extension or extensions, and appropriate documents in substantiation of the statement, to the Administration. The Administration will notify the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of any extension granted. In case an application for extension is denied, the taxpayer will be liable for delay as though no application had been made.
§ 2.1-23
Noncompliance with requirements.
(a)
Noncompliance.
The amount of the gain which is that portion of the construction reserve fund otherwise constituting taxable income under the law applicable to the taxable year in which such gain was realized shall be included in the taxpayer's gross income for such taxable year for income or excess-profits tax purposes, if—
(1) A portion of such fund is withdrawn for purposes other than—
(i) The construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of a new vessel; or
(ii) The liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness to persons other than a parent company of, or a company affiliated or associated with, the mortgagor on a new vessel or vessels; or
(2) The taxpayer fails to comply with the requirements of section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part relating to the utilization of construction reserve funds in the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of a new vessel, or the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such a vessel.
If securities on deposit in a construction reserve fund are sold and the amount placed in the fund in lieu thereof is less than the value of the securities at the time of their deposit, the difference between such value and the amount placed in the fund in lieu of the securities will be deemed to have been withdrawn. With respect to the
substitution of new financing in the case of an irrevocable commitment, see paragraph (d) of § 2.1-13.
(b)
Amount recognized.
In the event of noncompliance with the prescribed conditions relative to any contract for construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, recognition will extend to the entire amount of the gain represented in that portion of the construction reserve fund obligated under such contract. Thus, if the Administration determines and certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury that for causes within the control of the taxpayer construction under a contract is not completed with reasonable dispatch, the entire amount of the gain represented in the portion of the construction reserve fund obligated under the contract will be recognized even though all other conditions have been satisfied. In case of noncompliance with the requirements of section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part, see the provisions of § 2.1-18 as to the allocation of gain.
(c)
Unreasonable accumulation.
Noncompliance with the provisions of section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part relative to the utilization of the deposited amounts may also, inasmuch as the provision of section 511(f) of the Act is then inapplicable, warrant an examination to ascertain whether such amounts constitute an unreasonable accumulation of earnings and profits within the meaning of Part I (section 531 and following), Subchapter G, Chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or corresponding provisions of prior law. If amounts are deposited and the fund maintained in good faith for the purpose of construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, and acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, such amounts will be deemed to have been accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business.
§ 2.1-24
Extent of tax liability.
(a)
Declared value excess-profits tax.
Gain which is includible in gross income under § 2.1-23 shall be included in gross income for all income and excess-profits tax purposes, but not for the purposes of the declared value excess-profits tax and the capital stock tax as provided in section 511(i) of the Act. In lieu of any adjustment with respect to such declared value excess-profits tax, there is imposed for any taxable year ending on or before June 30, 1945, in which the gain is realized an additional tax of 1.1 percent of the amount of the gain. No additional capital stock tax liability is incurred.
(b)
Improper deposits.
In the case of deposits in the construction reserve fund of amounts derived from sources other than those specified in section 511 of the Act, or in the case of failure to deposit an amount equal to the “net proceeds” or “net indemnity” within the period prescribed in section 511(c) of the Act and § 2.1-15, the taxpayer obtains no suspension or postponement of any tax liability and the tax is collectible without regard to the provisions of section 511(c) of the Act.
(c)
Time for filing claim subsequent to election under section 511(c)(2).
If an election is made under section 511(c)(2) of the Act and paragraph (a)(2) of § 2.1-12, and if computation or recomputation in accordance therewith is otherwise allowable but is prevented, on the date of filing of notice of such election, or within six months thereafter, by any statute of limitation; such computation or recomputation nevertheless shall be made notwithstanding such statute if a claim therefor is filed within six months after the date of making such election. If as the result of such computation or recomputation an overpayment is disclosed a claim for refund should be made in accordance with § 301.6402-3 within such six months' period. For other rules applicable to the filing of claims for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax, see § 301.6402-2 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration), relating to claims for credit or refund.
[T.D. 6820, 30 FR 6030, Apr. 29, 1965, as amended by T.D. 7410, 41 FR 11020, Mar. 16, 1976]
§ 2.1-25
Assessment and collection of deficiencies.
Any additional tax, including the 1.1 percent amount imposed by section 511(i) of the Act, due on account of withdrawal from a construction reserve
fund, or failure to comply with section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part, is collectible as a deficiency. Interest upon such deficiency will run from the date the withdrawal or noncompliance occurs. The amount of any deficiency, including interest and additions to the tax, determined as a result of such withdrawal or noncompliance, may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection thereof may be begun without assessment, at any time and without regard to any period of limitations or any other provisions of law or rule of law, including the doctrine of res judicata.
§ 2.1-26
Reports by taxpayers.
(a)
Information required.
With each income tax return filed for a taxable year during any part of which a construction reserve fund is in existence the taxpayer shall submit a statement setting forth a detailed analysis of such fund. The statement, which need not be on any prescribed form, shall include the following information with respect to the construction reserve fund:
(1) The actual balance in the fund at the beginning and end of the taxable year;
(2) The date, amount, and source of each deposit during the taxable year;
(3) If any deposit referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph consists of proceeds from the sale, or indemnification of loss, of a vessel or share thereof, the amounts of the unrecognized gain;
(4) The date, amount, and purpose of each expenditure or withdrawal from the fund; and
(5) The date and amount of each contract, under which deposited funds are deemed to be obligated during the taxable year, for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, and the identification of such vessels.
(b)
Records required.
Taxpayers shall keep such records and make such additional reports as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Administration may require.
§ 2.1-27
Controlled corporation.
For the purpose of section 511 of the Act and the regulations in this part a new vessel is considered as constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by the taxpayer if constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by a corporation at a time when the taxpayer owns not less than 95 percent of the total number of shares of each class of stock of the corporation.
§ 2.1-28
Administrative jurisdiction.
Sections 2.1-3 to 2.1-11, inclusive, §§ 2.1-13 to 2.1-15, inclusive, and §§ 2.1-19 to 2.1-22, inclusive, deal primarily with matters under the jurisdiction of the Administration. Sections 2.1-12, 2.1-16 to 2.1-18, inclusive, and §§ 2.1-23 to 2.1-27, inclusive, deal primarily with matters under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Generally, matters relating to the establishment, maintenance, expenditure, and use of construction reserve funds and the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels are under the jurisdiction of the Administration; and matters relating to the determination, assessment, and collection of taxes are under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Correspondence should be addressed to the particular authority having jurisdiction in the matter.

Statutory provisions; section 607, Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended.
Sec. 607.
(a) Agreement Rules.
Any citizen of the United States owning or leasing one or more eligible vessels (as defined in subsection (k)(1)) may enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Commerce under, and as provided in, this section to establish a capital construction fund (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “fund”) with respect to any or all of such vessels. Any agreement entered into under this section shall be for the purpose of providing replacement vessels, additional vessels, or reconstructed vessels, built in the United States and documented under the laws of the United States for operation in the United States, foreign, Great Lakes, or noncontiguous domestic trade or in the fisheries of the United States and shall provide for the deposit in the fund of the amounts agreed upon as necessary or appropriate to provide for qualified withdrawals under subsection (f). The deposits in the fund, and all withdrawals from the fund, whether qualified or nonqualified, shall be subject to such conditions and requirements as the Secretary of Commerce may by regulations prescribe or are set forth in such agreement; except that the Secretary of Commerce may not require any person to deposit in the fund for any taxable year more than 50 percent of that portion of such person's taxable income for such year (computed in the manner provided in subsection (b)(1)(A)) which is attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels.
(b) Ceiling on Deposits.
(1) The amount deposited under subsection (a) in the fund for any taxable year shall not exceed the sum of:
(A) That portion of the taxable income of the owner or lessee for such year (computed as provided in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 but without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss or net capital loss and without regard to this section) which is attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries of the United States,
(B) The amount allowable as a deduction under section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for such year with respect to the agreement vessels,
(C) If the transaction is not taken into account for purposes of subparagraph (A), the net proceeds (as defined in joint regulations) from (i) the sale or other disposition of any agreement vessel, or (ii) insurance or indemnity attributable to any agreement vessel, and
(D) The receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in such fund.
(2) In the case of a lessee, the maximum amount which may be deposited with respect to an agreement vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B) for any period shall be reduced by any amount which, under an agreement entered into under this section, the owner is required or permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B).
(3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “agreement vessel” includes barges and containers which are part of the complement of such vessel and which are provided for in the agreement.
(c) Requirements as to Investments.
Amounts in any fund established under this section shall be kept in the depository or depositories specified in the agreement and shall be subject to such trustee and other fiduciary requirements as may be specified by the Secretary of Commerce. They may be invested only in interest-bearing securities approved by the Secretary of Commerce; except that, if the Secretary of Commerce consents thereto, an agreed percentage (not in excess of 60 percent) of the assets of the fund may be invested in the stock of domestic corporations. Such stock must be currently fully listed and registered on an exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange, and must be stock which would be acquired by prudent men of discretion and intelligence in such matters who are seeking a reasonable income and the preservation of their capital. If at any time the fair market value of the stock in the fund is more than the agreed percentage of the assets in the fund, any subsequent investment of amounts deposited in the fund, and any subsequent withdrawal from the fund, shall be made in such a way as to tend to restore the fund to a situation in which the fair market value of the stock does not exceed such agreed percentage. For purposes of this subsection, if the common stock of a corporation meets the requirements of this subsection and if the preferred stock of such corporation would meet such requirements but for the fact that it cannot be listed and registered as required because it is nonvoting stock, such preferred stock shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this subsection.
(d) Nontaxability for Deposits.
(1) For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954—
(A) Taxable income (determined without regard to this section) for the taxable year shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount deposited for the taxable year out of amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(A),
(B) Gain from a transaction referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) shall not be taken into account if an amount equal to the net proceeds (as defined in joint regulations) from such transaction is deposited in the fund,
(C) The earnings (including gains and losses) from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in the fund shall not be taken into account,
(D) The earnings and profits of any corporation (within the meaning of section 316 of such Code) shall be determined without regard to this section, and
(E) In applying the tax imposed by section 531 of such Code (relating to the accumulated earnings tax), amounts while held in the fund shall not be taken into account.
(2) Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any amount only if such amount is deposited in the fund pursuant to the agreement and not later than the time provided in joint regulations.
(e) Establishment of Accounts.
For purposes of this section—
(1) Within the fund established pursuant to this section three accounts shall be maintained:
(A) The capital account,
(B) The capital gain account, and
(C) The ordinary income account.
(2) The capital account shall consist of—
(A) Amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(B),
(B) Amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) other than that portion thereof which represents gain not taken into account by reason of subsection (d)(1)(B),
(C) 85 percent of any dividend received by the fund with respect to which the person maintaining the fund would (but for subsection (d)(1)(C)) be allowed a deduction under section 243 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and
(D) Interest income exempt from taxation under section 103 of such Code.
(3) The capital gain account shall consist of—
(A) Amounts representing capital gains on assets held for more than 6 months and referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) or (b)(1)(D), reduced by—
(B) Amounts representing capital losses on assets held in the fund for more than 6 months.
(4) The ordinary income account shall consist of—
(A) Amounts referred to in subsection (b)(1)(A),
(B)(i) Amounts representing capital gains on assets held for 6 months or less and referred to in subsection (b)(1)(C) or (b)(1)(D), reduced by—
(ii) Amounts representing capital losses on assets held in the fund for 6 months or less,
(C) Interest (not including any tax-exempt interest referred to in paragraph (2)(D)) and other ordinary income (not including any dividend referred to in subparagraph (E)) received on assets held in the fund,
(D) Ordinary income from a transaction described in subsection (b)(1)(C), and
(E) 15 percent of any dividend referred to in paragraph (2)(C).
(5) Except on termination of a fund, capital losses referred to in paragraph (3)(B) or in paragraph (4)(B)(ii) shall be allowed only as an offset to gains referred to in paragraph (3)(A) or (4)(B)(i), respectively.
(f) Purposes of Qualified Withdrawals.
(1) A qualified withdrawal from the fund is one made in accordance with the terms of the agreement but only if it is for:
(A) The acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel,
(B) The acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel, or
(C) The payment of the principal on indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel or a barge or container which is part of the complement of a qualified vessel.
Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce, subparagraph (B), and so much of subparagraph (C) as relates only to barges and containers, shall apply only with respect to barges and containers constructed in the United States.
(2) Under joint regulations, if the Secretary of Commerce determines that any substantial obligation under any agreement is not being fulfilled, he may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the person maintaining the fund, treat the entire fund or any portion thereof as an amount withdrawn from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal.
(g) Tax Treatment of Qualified Withdrawals.
(1) Any qualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated—
(A) First as made out of the capital account,
(B) Second as made out of the capital gain account, and
(C) Third as made out of the ordinary income account.
(2) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or container is made out of the ordinary income account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.
(3) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or container is made out of the capital gain account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container shall be reduced by an amount equal to—
(A) Five-eighths of such portion, in the case of a corporation (other than an electing
small business corporation, as defined in section 1371 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), or
(B) One-half of such portion, in the case of any other person.
(4) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal to pay the principal on any indebtedness is made out of the ordinary income account or the capital gain account, then an amount equal to the aggregate reduction which would be required by paragraphs (2) and (3) if this were a qualified withdrawal for a purpose described in such paragraphs shall be applied, in the order provided in joint regulations, to reduce the basis of vessels, barges, and containers owned by the person maintaining the fund. Any amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of the preceding sentence shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.
(5) If any property the basis of which was reduced under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) is disposed of, any gain realized on such disposition, to the extent it does not exceed the aggregate reduction in the basis of such property under such paragraphs, shall be treated as an amount referred to in subsection (h)(3)(A) which was withdrawn on the date of such disposition. Subject to such conditions and requirements as may be provided in joint regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to a disposition where there is a redeposit in an amount determined under joint regulations which will, insofar as practicable, restore the fund to the position it was in before the withdrawal.
(h) Tax Treatment of Nonqualified Withdrawals.
(1) Except as provided in subsection (i), any withdrawal from a fund which is not a qualified withdrawal shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.
(2) Any nonqualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated—
(A) First as made out of the ordinary income account,
(B) Second as made out of the capital gain account, and
(C) Third as made out of the capital account.
For purposes of this section, items withdrawn from any account shall be treated as withdrawn on a first-in-first-out basis; except that (i) any nonqualified withdrawal for research, development, and design expenses incident to new and advanced ship design, machinery and equipment, and (ii) any amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under the second sentence of subsection (g)(4), shall be treated as withdrawn on a last-in-first-out basis.
(3) For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954—
(A) Any amount referred to in paragraph (2)(A) shall be included in income as an item of ordinary income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made.
(B) Any amount referred to in paragraph (2)(B) shall be included in income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made as an item of gain realized during such year from the disposition of an asset held for more than 6 months, and
(C) For the period on or before the last date prescribed for payment of tax for the taxable year in which this withdrawal is made—
(i) No interest shall be payable under section 6601 of such Code and no addition to the tax shall be payable under section 6651 of such Code,
(ii) Interest on the amount of the additional tax attributable to any item referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be paid at the applicable rate (as defined in paragraph (4)) from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax for the taxable year for which such item was deposited in the fund, and
(iii) No interest shall be payable on amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2) or in the case of any nonqualified withdrawal arising from the application of the recapture provision of section 606(5) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 as in effect on December 31, 1969.
(4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(C)(ii), the applicable rate of interest for any nonqualified withdrawal—
(A) Made in a taxable year beginning in 1970 or 1971 is 8 percent, or
(B) Made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, shall be determined and published jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce and shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the Secretaries determine under joint regulations to be comparable to the relationship which the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year bear to the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year 1970.
(i) Certain Corporate Reorganizations and Changes in Partnerships.
Under joint regulations—
(1) A transfer of a fund from one person to another person in a transaction to which section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies may be treated as if such transaction did not constitute a nonqualified withdrawal, and
(2) A similar rule shall be applied in the case of a continuation of a partnership (within the meaning of subchapter K of such Code).
(j) Treatment of Existing Funds.
(1) Any person who was maintaining a fund or funds (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as “old fund”) under this section (as in effect before the enactment of this subsection) may elect to continue such old fund but—
(A) May not hold moneys in the old fund beyond the expiration date provided in the
agreement under which such old fund is maintained (determined without regard to any extension or renewal entered into after April 14, 1970),
(B) May not simultaneously maintain such old fund and a new fund established under this section, and
(C) If he enters into an agreement under this section to establish a new fund, may agree to the extension of such agreement to some or all of the amounts in the old fund.
(2) In the case of any extension of an agreement pursuant to paragraph (1)(C), each item in the old fund to be transferred shall be transferred in a nontaxable transaction to the appropriate account in the new fund established under this section. For purposes of subsection (h)(3)(C), the date of the deposit of any item so transferred shall be July 1, 1971, or the date of the deposit in the old fund, whichever is the later.

§ 3.2
Ceiling on deposits.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Total ceiling.
Section 607(b) of the Act provides a ceiling on the amount which may be deposited by a party for a taxable year pursuant to an agreement. The amount which a party may deposit into a fund may not exceed the sum of the following subceilings:
(i) The lower of (
a
) the taxable income (if any) of the party for such year (computed as provided in Chapter I of the Code but without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss or net capital loss and without regard to section 607 of the Act) or (
b
) taxable income (if any) of such party for such year attributable under paragraph (b) of this section to the operation of agreement vessels (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries of the United States (see section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act).
(ii) Amounts allowable as a deduction under section 167 of the Code for such year with respect to the agreement vessels (see section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act),
(iii) The net proceeds (if not included in subdivision (i) of this paragraph) from (
a
) the sale or other disposition of any agreement vessels or (
b
) insurance or indemnity attributable to any agreement vessels (see section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and paragraph (c) of this section), and
(iv) Earnings and gains from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in such fund (see section 607(b)(1)(D) of the Act and paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section).
(2)
Overdeposits.
(i) If for any taxable year an amount is deposited into the fund under a subceiling computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph which is in excess of the amount of such subceiling for such year, then at the party's option such excess (or any portion thereof) may—
(
a
) Be treated as a deposit into the fund for that taxable year under another available subceiling, or
(
b
) Be treated as not having been deposited for the taxable year and thus, at the party's option, may be disposed of either by it being—
(
1
) Treated as a deposit into the fund under any subceiling available in the first subsequent taxable year in which a subceiling is available, in which case such amount shall be deemed to have been deposited on the first day of such subsequent taxable year, or
(
2
) Repaid to the party from the fund.
(ii)(
a
) When a correction is made for an overdeposit, proper adjustment shall be made with respect to all items for all taxable years affected by the overdeposit, such as, for example, amounts in each account described in § 3.4, treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, the consequences of qualified withdrawals and the treatment of losses realized or treated as realized by the fund. Thus, for example, if the party chooses to have the fund repay to him the amount of an overdeposit, amounts in each account, basis of assets, and any affected item will be determined as though no deposit and repayment had been made. Accordingly, in such a case, if there are insufficient amounts in an account to cover a repayment of an overdeposit (as determined before correcting the overdeposit), and the party had applied the proceeds of a qualified withdrawal from such account towards the purchase of a qualified vessel (within the meaning of § 3.11(a)(2)), then such account and the basis of the vessel shall be adjusted as of the time such withdrawal was made and proceeds were applied, and repayment shall be made from such account as adjusted. If a party chooses to treat
the amount of an overdeposit as a deposit under a subceiling for a subsequent year, similar adjustments to affected items shall be made. If the amount of a withdrawal would have exceeded the amount in the fund (determined after adjusting all affected amounts by reason of correcting the overdeposit), the withdrawal to the extent of such excess shall be treated as a repayment made at the time the withdrawal was made.
(
b
) If the accounts (as defined in § 3.4) that were increased by reason of excessive deposits contain sufficient amounts at the time the overdeposit is discovered to repay the party, the party may, at his option, demand repayment of such excessive deposits from such accounts in lieu of making the adjustments required by (
a
) of this subdivision (ii).
(iii) During the period beginning with the day after the date an overdeposit was actually made and ending with the date it was disposed of in accordance with subdivision (i)(
b
) of this subparagraph, there shall be included in the party's gross income for each taxable year the earnings attributed to any amount of overdeposit on hand during such a year. The earnings attributable to any amount of overdeposit on hand during a taxable year shall be an amount equal to the product of—
(
a
) The average daily earnings for each one dollar in the fund (as determined in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph),
(
b
) The amount of overdeposit (as determined in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph), and
(
c
) The number of days during the taxable year the overdeposit existed.
(iv) For purposes of subdivision (iii)(
a
) of this subparagraph, the average daily earnings for each dollar in the fund shall be determined by dividing the total earnings of the fund for the taxable year by the sum of the products of—
(
a
) Any amount on hand during the taxable year (determined under subdivision (v) of this subparagraph), and
(
b
) The number of days during the taxable year such amount was on hand in the fund.
(v) For purposes of this subparagraph—
(
a
) An amount on hand in the fund or an overdeposit shall not be treated as on hand on the day deposited but shall be treated as on hand on the day withdrawn, and
(
b
) The fair market value of such amounts on hand for purposes of this subparagraph shall be determined as provided in § 20.2031-2 of the Estate Tax Regulations of this chapter but without applying the blockage and other special rules contained in paragraph (e) thereof.
(vi) For purposes of subdivision (iii)(
b
) of this subparagraph, the amount of overdeposit on hand at any time is an amount equal to—
(
a
) The amount deposited into the fund under a subceiling computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph which is in excess of the amount of such subceiling, less
(
b
) The sum of—
(
1
) Amounts described in (
a
) of this subdivision (vi) treated as a deposit under another subceiling for the taxable year pursuant to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph,
(
2
) Amounts described in (
a
) of this subdivision (vi) disposed of (or treated as disposed of) in accordance with subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph prior to such time.
(vii) To the extent earnings attributed under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph represent a deposit for any taxable year in excess of the subceiling described in subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph for receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund, such attributed earnings shall be subject to the rules of this subparagraph for overdeposits.
(3)
Underdeposit caused by audit adjustment.

(b)
Taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel means the amount, if any, by which the gross income of a party for the taxable year from the operation of an agreement vessel (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) exceeds the allowable deductions allocable to such operation (as determined under subparagraph (3)
of this paragraph). The term “taxable income attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels” means the sum of the amounts described in the preceding sentence separately computed with respect to each agreement vessel (or share therein) or, at the party's option, computed in the aggregate.
(2)
Gross income.
(i) Gross income from the operation of agreement vessels means the sum of the revenues which are derived during the taxable year from the following:
(
a
) Revenues derived from the transportation of passengers, freight, or mail in such vessels, including amounts from contracts for the charter of such vessels to others, from operating differential subsidies, from collections in accordance with pooling agreements and from insurance or indemnity net proceeds relating to the loss of income attributable to such agreement vessels.
(
b
) Revenues derived from the operation of agreement vessels relating to commercial fishing activities, including the transportation of fish, support activities for fishing vessels, charters for commercial fishing, and insurance or indemnity net proceeds relating to the loss of income attributable to such agreement vessels.
(
c
) Revenues from the rental, lease, or use by others of terminal facilities, revenues from cargo handling operations and tug and lighter operations, and revenues from other services or operations which are incidental and directly related to the operation of an agreement vessel. Thus, for example, agency fees, commissions, and brokerage fees derived by the party at his place of business for effecting transactions for services incidental and directly related to shipping for the accounts of other persons are includible in gross income from the operation of agreement vessels where the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated by the party for his own account at such place of business.
(
d
) Dividends, interest, and gains derived from assets set aside and reasonably retained to meet regularly occurring obligations relating to the shipping or fishing business directly connected with the agreement vessel which obligations cannot at all times be met from the current revenues of the business because of layups or repairs, special surveys, fluctuations in the business, and reasonably foreseeable strikes (whether or not a strike actually occurs), and security amounts retained by reason of participation in conferences, pooling agreements, or similar agreements.
(ii) The items of gross income described in subdivision (i) (
c
) and (
d
) of this subparagraph shall be considered to be derived from the operations of a particular agreement vessel in the same proportion that the sum of the items of gross income described in subdivision (i) (
a
) and (
b
) of this subparagraph which are derived from the operations of such agreement vessel bears to the party's total gross income for the taxable year from operations described in subdivision (i) (
a
) and (
b
) of this subparagraph.
(iii) In the case of a party who uses his own or leased agreement vessels to transport his own products, the gross income attributable to such vessel operations is an amount determined to be an arm's length charge for such transportation. The arm's length charge shall be determined by applying the principles of section 482 of the Code and the regulations thereunder as if the party transporting the product and the owner of the product were not the same person but were controlled taxpayers within the meaning of § 1.482-1(a)(4) of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter. Gross income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels does not include amounts for which the party is allowed a deduction for percentage depletion under sections 611 and 613 of the Code.
(3)
Deductions.
From the gross income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel or vessels as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, there shall be deducted, in accordance with the principles of § 1.861-8 of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter, the expenses, losses, and other deductions definitely related and therefore allocated and apportioned thereto and a ratable part of any expenses, losses, or other deductions which are not definitely related to any gross income of the party. Thus,
for example, if a party has gross income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel and other gross income and has a particular deduction definitely related to both types of gross income, such deduction must be apportioned between the two types of gross income on a reasonable basis in determining the taxable income attributable to the operation of the agreement vessel.
(4)
Net operating and capital loss deductions.
The taxable income of a party attributable to the operation of agreement vessels shall be computed without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss deduction allowed by section 172 of the Code, the carryback of any net capital loss deduction allowed by sections 165(f) of the Code, or any reduction in taxable income allowed by section 607 of the Act.
(5)
Method of accounting.
Taxable income must be computed under the method of accounting which the party uses for Federal income tax purposes. Such method may include a method of reporting whereby items of revenue and expense properly allocable to voyages in progress at the end of any accounting period are eliminated from the computation of taxable income for such accounting period and taken into account in the accounting period in which the voyage is completed.
(c)
Net proceeds from transactions with respect to agreement vessels.
[Reserved]
(d)
Earnings and gains from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in a fund
—(1)
In general.
(i) Earnings and gains received or accrued by a party from the investment or reinvestment of assets in a fund is the total amount of any interest or dividends received or accrued, and gains realized, by the party with respect to assets deposited in, or purchased with amounts deposited in, such fund. Such earnings and gains are therefore required to be included in the gross income of the party unless such amount, or a portion thereof, is not taken into account under section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and § 3.3(b)(2)(ii) by reason of a deposit or deemed deposit into the fund. For rules relating to receipts from the sale or other disposition of nonmoney deposits into the fund, see paragraph (g) of this section.
(ii) Earnings received or accrued by a party from investment or reinvestment of assets in a fund include the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount included in gross income pursuant to section 1232(a)(3) of the Code. Such ratable monthly portion shall be deemed to be deposited into the ordinary income account of the fund, but an actual deposit representing such ratable monthly portion shall not be made. For basis of bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued at a discount, see § 3.3(b)(2)(ii)(
b
).
(2)
Gain realized.
(i) The gain realized with respect to assets in the fund is the excess of the amount realized (as defined in section 1001(b) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) by the fund on the sale or other disposition of a fund asset over its adjusted basis (as defined in section 1011 of the Code) to the fund. For the adjusted basis of nonmoney deposits, see paragraph (g) of this section.
(ii) Property purchased by the fund (including property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section as purchased by the fund) which is withdrawn from the fund in a qualified withdrawal (as defined in § 3.5) is treated as a disposition to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies. For purposes of determining the amount by which the balance within a particular account will be reduced in the manner provided in § 3.6(b) (relating to order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts) and for purposes of determining the reduction in basis of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) pursuant to § 3.6(c), the value of the property is its fair market value on the day of the qualified withdrawal.
(3)
Holding period.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the holding period of fund assets shall be determined under section 1223 of the Code.
(e)
Leased vessels.
In the case of a party who is a lessee of an agreement vessel, the maximum amount which such lessee may deposit with respect to any agreement vessel by reason of section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to depreciation allowable) for any period shall be reduced by the amount (if
any) which, under an agreement entered into under section 607 of the Act, the owner is required or permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such vessel by reason of section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The amount of depreciation depositable by the lessee under this paragraph is the amount of depreciation deductible by the lessor on its income tax return, reduced by the amount described in the preceding sentence or the amount set forth in the agreement, whichever is lower.
(f)
Definition of agreement vessel.
For purposes of this section, the term “agreement vessel” (as defined in § 3.11(a)(3) and 46 CFR 390.6) includes barges and containers which are the complement of an agreement vessel and which are provided for in the agreement, agreement vessels which have been contracted for or are in the process of construction, and any shares in an agreement vessel. Solely for purposes of this section, a party is considered to have a “share” in an agreement vessel if he has a right to use the vessel to generate income from its use whether or not the party would be considered as having a proprietary interest in the vessel for purposes of State or Federal law. Thus, a partner may enter into an agreement with respect to his share of the vessel owned by the partnership and he may make deposits of his distributive share of the sum of the four subceilings described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of subchapter K of the Code (relating to the taxation of partners and partnerships), the Internal Revenue Service will recognize, solely for the purposes of applying this part, an agreement by an owner of a share in an agreement vessel even though the “share” arrangement is a partnership for purposes of the Code.
(g)
Special rules for nonmoney deposits and withdrawals
—(1)
In general.
(i) Deposits may be made in the form of money or property of the type permitted to be deposited under the agreement. (For rules relating to the types of property which may be deposited into the fund, see 46 CFR § 390.7(d), and 50 CFR part 259.) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “property” does not include money.
(ii) Whether or not the election provided for in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is made—
(
a
) The amount of any property deposit, and the fund's basis for property deposited in the fund, is the fair market value of the property at the time deposited, and
(
b
) The fund's holding period for the property begins on the day after the deposit is made.
(iii) Unless such an election is made, deposits of property into a fund are considered to be a sale at fair market value of the property, a deposit of cash equal to such fair market value, and a purchase by the fund of such property for cash. Thus, in the absence of the election, the difference between the fair market value of such property deposited and its adjusted basis shall be taken into account as gain or loss for purposes of computing the party's income tax liability for the year of deposit.
(iv) For fund's basis and holding period of assets purchased by the fund, see paragraph (d) (2) and (3) of this section.
(2)
Election not to treat deposits of property other than money as a sale or exchange at the time of deposit.
A party may elect to treat a deposit of property as if no sale or other taxable event had occurred on the date of deposit. If such election is made, in the taxable year the fund disposes of the property, the party shall recognize as gain or loss the amount he would have recognized on the day the property was deposited into the fund had the election not been made. The party's holding period with respect to such property shall not include the period of time such property was held by the fund. The election shall be made by a statement to that effect, attached to the party's Federal income tax return for the taxable year to which the deposit relates, or, if such return is filed before such deposit is made, attached to the party's return for the taxable year during which the deposit is actually made.
(3)
Effect of qualified withdrawal of property deposited pursuant to election.
If property deposited into a fund, with respect to which an election under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is made, is withdrawn from the fund in a
qualified withdrawal (as defined in § 3.5) such withdrawal is treated as a disposition of such property resulting in recognition by the party of gain or loss (if any) as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph with respect to nonfund property. In addition, such withdrawal is treated as a disposition of such property by the fund resulting in recognition of gain or loss by the party with respect to fund property to the extent the fair market value of the property on the date of withdrawal is greater or less (as the case may be) than the adjusted basis of the property to the fund on such date. For purposes of determining the amount by which the balance within a particular account will be reduced in the manner provided in § 3.6(b) (relating to order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts) and for purposes of determining the reduction in basis of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) pursuant to § 3.6(c), the value of the property is its fair market value on the day of the qualified withdrawal. For rules relating to the effect of a qualified withdrawal of property purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph as purchased by the fund), see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Effect of nonqualified withdrawal of property deposited pursuant to election.
If property deposited into a fund with respect to which an election under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is made, is withdrawn from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal (as defined in § 3.7(b)), no gain or loss is to be recognized by the party with respect to fund property or nonfund property but an amount equal to the adjusted basis of the property to the fund is to be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal. Thus, such amount is to be applied against the various accounts in the manner provided in § 3.7(c), such amount is to be taken into account in computing the party's taxable income as provided in § 3.7(d), and such amount is to be subject to interest to the extent provided for in § 3.7(e). In the case of withdrawals to which this subparagraph applies, the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the party is the adjusted basis on the date of deposit, increased or decreased by the adjustments made to such property while held in the fund, and in determining the period for which the party has held the property there shall be included, in addition to the period the fund held the property, the period for which the party held the property before the date of deposit of the property into the fund. For rules relating to the basis and holding period of property purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph as purchased by the fund) and withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal see § 3.7(f).
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, maintains a fund described in § 3.1. X's taxable income (determined without regard to section 607 of the Act) is $100,000, of which $80,000 is taxable income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels (as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section). Under the agreement, X is required to deposit into the fund all earnings and gains received from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund, an amount equal to the net proceeds from transactions referred to in § 3.2(c), and an amount equal to 50 percent of its earnings attributable to the operation of agreement vessels provided that such 50 percent does not exceed X's taxable income from all sources for the year of deposit. The agreement permits X to make voluntary deposits of amounts equal to 100 percent of its earnings attributable to the operation of agreement vessels, subject to the limitation with respect to taxable income from all sources. The agreement also provides that deposits attributable to such earnings may be in the form of cash or other property. On March 15, 1973, X deposits, with respect to its 1972 earnings attributable to the operation of agreement vessels, stock with a fair market value at the time of deposit of $80,000 and an adjusted basis to X of $10,000. Such deposit represents agreement vessel income of $80,000. At the time of deposit, such stock had been held by X for a period exceeding 6 months. X does not elect under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to defer recognition of the gain. Accordingly, under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, the deposit is treated as a deposit of $80,000 and X realizes a long-term capital gain of $70,000 on March 15, 1973.

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that X elects in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph
not to treat the deposit as a sale or exchange. On July 1, 1974, the fund sells the stock for $85,000. The basis to the fund of the stock is $80,000 (see subparagraph (1)(ii)(
a
) of this paragraph). With respect to nonfund property, X recognizes $70,000 of long-term capital gain on the sale includible in its gross income for 1974. With respect to fund property, X realizes $5,000 of long-term capital gain (the difference between the amount received by the fund on the sale of the stock, $85,000, and the basis to the fund of the stock, $80,000), an amount equal to which is required to be deposited into the fund with respect to 1974, as a gain from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in the fund. Since the fund held the stock for a period exceeding 6 months, the $5,000 is allocated to the fund's capital gain account under § 3.4(c).

# Example (3).
The facts are the same as in example (2), except that the fund sells the stock on July 1, 1974, for $75,000. As the basis to the fund of the stock is $80,000, with respect to fund property, X realizes a long-term capital loss on the sale (the difference between the amount received by the fund on the sale of the stock, $75,000, and the basis to the fund of the stock, $80,000), of $5,000, an amount equal to which is required to be charged against the fund's capital gain account under § 3.4(e). Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, X recognizes $70,000 of long-term capital gain with respect to nonfund property on the sale which is includible in its gross income for 1974.

# Example (4).
The facts are the same as in example (2), except that on July 1, 1974, X makes a qualified withdrawal (as defined in § 3.5(a)) of the stock and uses it to pay indebtedness pursuant to § 3.5(b). On the disposition by X considered to occur under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph on the qualified withdrawal, X recognizes $70,000 of long-term capital gain with respect to nonfund property, which is includible in its gross income for 1974, and a long-term capital gain of $5,000 with respect to fund property, an amount equal to which is allocated to the fund's capital gain account under § 3.4(c). The fund is treated as having a qualified withdrawal of an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock on the day of withdrawal, $85,000 (see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph). In addition, $85,000 is applied against the various accounts in the order provided in § 3.6(b). The basis of the vessel with respect to which the indebtedness was incurred is to be reduced as provided in § 3.6(c).

# Example (5).
The facts are the same as in example (2), except that X withdraws the stock from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal (as defined in § 3.7(b)). Under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, X recognizes no gain or loss with respect to fund or nonfund property on such withdrawal. An amount equal to the basis of the stock to the fund ($80,000) is applied against the various accounts in the order provided in § 3.7(c), and is taken into account in computing X's taxable income for 1974 as provided in § 3.7(d). In addition, X must pay interest on the withdrawal as provided in § 3.7(e). The basis to X of the stock is $10,000 notwithstanding the fact that the fair market value of such stock was $85,000 on the day of withdrawal (see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph).
§ 3.3
Nontaxability of deposits.
(a)
In general.
Section 607(d) of the Act sets forth the rules concerning the income tax effects of deposits made with respect to ceilings described in section 607(b) and § 3.2. The specific treatment of deposits with respect to each of the subceilings is set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Treatment of deposits
—(1)
Earnings of agreement vessels.
Section 607(d)(1)(A) of the Act provides that taxable income of the party (determined without regard to section 607 of the Act) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount deposited for the taxable year out of amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1)(i). For computation of the foreign tax credit, see paragraph (i) of this section.
(2)
Net proceeds from agreement vessels and fund earnings.
(i)(
a
) Section 607(d)(1)(B) provides that gain from a transaction referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1)(iii) (relating to ceilings on deposits of net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of agreement vessels) is not to be taken into account for purposes of the Code if an amount equal to the net proceeds from transactions referred to in such sections is deposited in the fund. Such gain is to be excluded from gross income of the party for the taxable year to which such deposit relates. Thus, the gain will not be taken into account in applying section 1231 of the Code for the year to which the deposit relates.
(
b
) [Reserved]
(ii)(
a
) Section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act provides that the earnings (including gains and losses) from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in the fund and referred to in section 607(b)(1)(D) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1)(iv) shall not be taken into account for purposes of the Code if an amount equal to
such earnings is deposited into the fund. Such earnings are to be excluded from the gross income of the party for the taxable year to which such deposit relates.
(
b
) However, for purposes of the basis adjustment under section 1232(a)(3)(E) of the Code, the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount included in gross income shall be determined without regard to section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act.
(iii) In determining the tax liability of a party to whom subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies, taxable income, determined after application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, is in effect reduced by the portion of deposits which represent gain or earnings respectively referred to in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph. The excess, if any, of such portion over taxable income determined after application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is taken into account in computing the net operating loss (under section 172 of the Code) for the taxable year to which such deposits relate.
(3)
Time for making deposits.
(i) This section applies with respect to an amount only if such amount is deposited in the fund pursuant to the agreement and not later than the time provided in subdivision (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this subparagraph for the making of such deposit or the date the Secretary of Commerce provides, whichever is earlier.
(ii) Except as provided in subdivision (iii) or (iv) of this subparagraph, a deposit may be made not later than the last day prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the party's Federal income tax return for the taxable year to which such deposit relates.
(iii) If the party is a subsidized operator under an operating-differential subsidy contract, and does not receive on or before the 59th day preceding such last day, payment of all or part of the accrued operating-differential subsidy payable for the taxable year, the party may deposit an amount equivalent to the unpaid accrued operating-differential subsidy on or before the 60th day after receipt of payment of the accrued operating-differential subsidy.
(iv) A deposit pursuant to § 3.2(a)(3)(i) (relating to underdeposits caused by audit adjustments) must be made on or before the date prescribed for such a deposit in § 3.2(a)(4).
(4)
Date of deposits.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph (with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and prior to January 1, 1972), in § 3.2(a)(2)(i), or in § 3.10(b), deposits made in a fund within the time specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph are deemed to have been made on the date of actual deposit.
(ii)(
a
) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and prior to January 1, 1971, where an application for a fund is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1972, and an agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer prior to March l, 1972,
(
b
) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and prior to January 1, 1972, where an application for a fund is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1973, and an agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer prior to March l, 1973, and
(
c
) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, and prior to January 1, 1975, where an agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year,
deposits in a fund which are made within 60 days after the date of execution of the agreement, or on or before the due date, with extensions thereof, for the filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years, whichever date shall be later, shall be deemed to have been made on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the last regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which such deposits relate, whichever day is earlier.
(iii) Notwithstanding subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and ending prior to January 1, 1972, deposits made later than the last date permitted under subdivision (ii) but on or before January 9, 1973, in a fund pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of Commerce, acting by and
through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall be deemed to have been made on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the last regular business day of such taxable year, whichever is earlier.
(c)
Determination of earnings and profits.
[Reserved]
(d)
Accumulated earnings tax.
As provided in section 607(d)(1)(E) of the Act amounts, while held in the fund, are not to be taken into account in computing the “accumulated taxable income” of the party within the meaning of section 531 of the Code. Amounts while held in the fund are considered held for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a qualified vessel or barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel or the payment of the principal on indebtedness incurred in connection with any such acquisition, construction, or reconstruction. Thus, for example, if the reasonable needs of the business (within the meaning of section 537 of the Code) justify a greater amount of accumulation for providing replacement vessels than can be satisfied out of the fund, such greater amount accumulated outside of the fund shall be considered to be accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business. For a further example, although amounts in the fund are not taken into account in applying the tax imposed by section 531 of the Code, to the extent there are amounts in a fund to provide for replacing a vessel, amounts accumulated outside of the fund to replace the same vessel are not considered to be accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business.
(e)
Nonapplicability of section 1231.
If an amount equivalent to gain from a transaction referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and § 3.2(c) (1) and (5) is deposited into the fund and, therefore, such gain is not taken into account in computing gross income under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then such gain will not be taken into account for purposes of the computations under section 1231 of the Code.
(f)
Deposits of capital gains.
In respect of capital gains which are not included in the gross income of the party by virtue of a deposit to which section 607(d) of the Act and this section apply, the following provisions of the Code do not apply: the minimum tax for tax preferences imposed by section 56 of the Code; the alternative tax imposed by section 1201 of the Code on the excess of the party's net long-term capital gain over his net short-term capital loss; and, in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, the deduction provided by section 1202 of the Code of 50% of the amount of such excess. However, section 56 may apply upon a nonqualified withdrawal with respect to amounts treated under § 3.7(d)(2) as being made out of the capital gain account.
(g)
Deposits of dividends.
The deductions provided by section 243 of the Code (relating to the deductions for dividends from a domestic corporation received by a corporation) shall not apply in respect of dividends (earned on assets held in the fund) which are deposited into a fund, and which, by virtue of such deposits and the provisions of section 607(d) of the Act and this section, are not included in the gross income of the party.
(h)
Presumption of validity of deposit.
All amounts deposited in the fund shall be presumed to have been deposited pursuant to an agreement unless, after an examination of the facts upon the request of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate, the Secretary of Commerce determines otherwise. The Commissioner or his delegate will request such a determination where there is a substantial question as to whether a deposit is made in accordance with an agreement.
(i)
Special rules for application of the foreign tax credit
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of computing the limitation under section 904 of the Code on the amount of the credit provided by section 901 of the Code (relating to the foreign tax credit), the party's taxable income from any source without the United States and the party's entire taxable income are to be determined after application of section 607(d) of the Act. Thus, amounts deposited for the taxable year with respect to amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1)(i)
(relating to taxable income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels) shall be treated as a deduction in arriving at the party's taxable income from sources without the United States (subject to the apportionment rules and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) and the party's entire taxable income for the taxable year. Amounts deposited with respect to gain described in section 607(d)(1)(B) of the Act and § 3.2(c) (relating to net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of an agreement vessel and net proceeds from insurance or indemnity) and amounts deposited with respect to earnings described in section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and paragraph (b)(2)(ii) (relating to earnings from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in a fund) of this section are not taken into account for purposes of the Code and hence are not included in the party's taxable income from sources without the United States or in the party's entire taxable income for purposes of this paragraph.
(2)
Apportionment of taxable income attributable to agreement vessels.
For purposes of computing the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) of the Code the amount of the deposit made with respect to taxable income attributable to agreement vessels pursuant to § 3.2(a)(1)(i) which is allocable to sources without the United States is the total amount of such deposit multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the gross income from sources without the United States from the operation of agreement vessels and the denominator of which is the total gross income from the operation of agreement vessels computed as provided in § 3.2(b)(2). For purposes of this paragraph, gross income from sources without the United States attributable to the operation of agreement vessels is to be determined under sections 861 through 863 of the Code and under the taxpayer's usual method of accounting provided such method is reasonable and in keeping with sound accounting practice. Any computation under the per-country limitation of section 904(a)(1) shall be made in the manner consistent with the provisions of the preceding sentences of this subparagraph.
§ 3.4
Establishment of accounts.
(a)
In general.
Section 607(e)(1) of the Act requires that three bookkeeping or memorandum accounts are to be established and maintained within the fund: the capital account, the capital gain account, and the ordinary income account. Deposits of the amounts under the subceilings in section 607(b) of the Act and § 3.2 are allocated among the accounts under section 607(e) of the Act and this section.
(b)
Capital account.
The capital account shall consist of:
(1) Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1)(ii) (relating to deposits for depreciation),
(2) Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1)(iii) (relating to deposits of net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of agreement vessels) other than that portion thereof which represents gain not taken into account for purposes of computing gross income by reason of section 607(d)(1)(B) of the Act and § 3.3(b)(2) (relating to nontaxability of gain from the sale or other disposition of an agreement vessel),
(3) Amounts representing 85 percent of any dividend received by the fund with respect to which the party would, but for section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and § 3.3(b)(2)(ii) (relating to nontaxability of deposits of earnings from investment and reinvestment of amounts held in a fund), be allowed a deduction under section 243 of the Code, and
(4) Amounts received by the fund representing interest income which is exempt from taxation under section 103 of the Code.
(c)
Capital gain account.
The capital gain account shall consist of amounts which represent the excess of (1) deposits of long-term capital gains on property referred to in section 607(b)(1) (C) and (D) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1) (iii) and (iv) (relating respectively to certain agreement vessels and fund assets), over (2) amounts representing losses from the sale or exchange of assets held in the fund for more than 6 months (for purposes of this section referred to as “long-term capital losses”). For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an agreement vessel disposed of at a gain shall be treated as a capital
asset to the extent that gain thereon is not treated as ordinary income, including gain which is ordinary income under section 607(g)(5) of the Act (relating to treatment of gain on disposition of a vessel with a reduced basis) and § 3.6(e) or under section 1245 of the Code (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property). For provisions relating to the treatment of short-term capital gains on certain transactions involving agreement vessels or realized by the fund, see paragraph (d) of this section. For rules relating to the treatment of capital losses on assets held in the fund, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(d)
Ordinary income account.
The ordinary income account shall consist of:
(1) Amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1)(i) (relating to taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel),
(2) Amounts representing (i) deposits of gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for 6 months or less (for purposes of this section referred to as “short-term capital gains”) referred to in section 607(b)(1) (C) or (D) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1) (iii) and (iv) (relating respectively to certain agreement vessels and fund assets), reduced by (ii) amounts representing losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets held in the fund for 6 months or less (for purposes of this section referred to as “short-term capital losses”). For rules relating to the treatment of certain agreement vessels as capital assets, see paragraph (c) of this section,
(3) Amounts representing interest (not including any tax-exempt interest referred to in section 607(e)(2)(D) of the Act and paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and other ordinary income received on assets held in the fund (not including any dividend referred to in section 607(e)(2)(C) of the Act and subparagraph (5) of this paragraph),
(4) Amounts representing ordinary income from a transaction (involving certain net proceeds with respect to an agreement vessel) described in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and § 3.2(a)(1)(iii), including gain which is ordinary income under section 607(g)(5) of the Act and § 3.6(e) (relating to treatment of gain on the disposition of a vessel with a reduced basis) or under section 1245 of the Code (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property), and
(5) Fifteen percent of any dividend referred to in section 607(e)(2)(C) of the Act and paragraph (b)(3) of this section received on any assets held in the fund.
(e)
Limitation on deduction for capital losses on assets held in a fund.
Except on termination of a fund, long-term (and short-term) capital losses on assets held in the fund shall be allowed only as an offset to long-term (and short-term) capital gains on assets held in the fund, but only if such gains are deposited into the fund, and shall not be allowed as an offset to any capital gains on assets not held in the fund. The net long-term capital loss of the fund for the taxable year shall reduce the earliest long-term capital gains in the capital gain account at the beginning of the taxable year and the net short-term capital loss for the taxable year shall reduce the earliest short-term capital gains remaining in the ordinary income account at the beginning of the taxable year. Any such losses that are in excess of the capital gains in the respective accounts shall reduce capital gains deposited into the respective accounts in subsequent years (without regard to section 1212, relating to capital loss carrybacks and carryovers). On termination of a fund, any net long-term capital loss in the capital gain account and any net short-term capital loss remaining in the ordinary income account is to be taken into account for purposes of computing the party's taxable income for the year of termination as a long-term or short-term (as the case may be) capital loss recognized in the year the fund is terminated. With respect to the determination of the basis to a fund of assets held in such fund, see § 3.2(g).
[T.D. 7398, 41 FR 5812, Feb. 10, 1976, as amended by T.D. 7831, 47 FR 39675, Sept. 9, 1982]
§ 3.5
Qualified withdrawals.
(a)
In general.
(1) A qualified withdrawal is one made from the fund during the taxable year which is in accordance with section 607(f)(1) of the Act, the agreement, and with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce and which is for the acquisition,
construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel (as defined in § 3.11(a)(2)) or barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel (or shares in such vessels, barges, and containers), or for the payment of the principal of indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of such qualified vessel (or a barge or container which is part of the complement of a qualified vessel).
(2) For purposes of this section the term
share
is used to reflect an interest in a vessel and means a proprietary interest in a vessel such as, for example, that which results from joint ownership. Accordingly, a share within the meaning of § 3.2(f) (relating to the definition of “agreement vessel” for the purpose of making deposits) will not necessarily be sufficient to be treated as a share within the meaning of this section.
(3) For purposes of this section, the term
acquisition
means any of the following:
(i) Any acquisition, but only to the extent the basis of the property acquired in the hands of the transferee is its cost. Thus, for example, if a party transfers a vessel and $1 million in an exchange for another vessel which qualifies for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031 (a) of the Code (relating to like-kind exchange), there is an acquisition to the extent of $1 million.
(ii) With respect to a lessee's interest in a vessel, expenditures which result in increasing the amounts with respect to which a deduction for depreciation (or amortization in lieu thereof) is allowable.
(b)
Payments on indebtedness.
Payments on indebtedness may constitute qualified withdrawals only if the party shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Commerce a direct connection between incurring the indebtedness and the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel or its complement of barges and containers whether or not the indebtedness is secured by the vessel or its complement of barges and containers. The fact that an indebtedness is secured by an interest in a qualified vessel, barge, or container is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the necessary connection.
(c)
Payments to related persons.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, payments from a fund to a person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests as the party within the meaning of section 482 of the Code and the regulations thereunder are not to be treated as qualified withdrawals unless the party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Commerce that no part of such payment constitutes a dividend, a return of capital, or a contribution to capital under the Code.
(d)
Treatment of fund upon failure to fulfill obligations.
Section 607(f)(2) of the Act provides that if the Secretary of Commerce determines that any substantial obligation under the agreement is not being fulfilled, he may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the party, treat the entire fund, or any portion thereof, as having been withdrawn as a nonqualified withdrawal. In determining whether a party has breached a substantial obligation under the agreement, the Secretary will consider among other things, (1) the effect of the party's action or omission upon his ability to carry out the purposes of the fund and for which qualified withdrawals are permitted under section 607(f)(1) of the Act, and (2) whether the party has made material misrepresentations in connection with the agreement or has failed to disclose material information. For the income tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, see § 3.7.
§ 3.6
Tax treatment of qualified withdrawals.
(a)
In general.
Section 607(g) of the Act and this section provide rules for the income tax treatment of qualified withdrawals including the income tax treatment on the disposition of assets acquired with fund amounts.
(b)
Order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts.
A qualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated as being made: First, out of the capital account; second, out of the capital gain account; and third, out of the ordinary income account. Such withdrawals will reduce the balance within a particular account on a first-in-first-
out basis, the earliest qualified withdrawals reducing the items within an account in the order in which they were actually deposited or deemed deposited in accordance with this part. The date funds are actually withdrawn from the fund determines the time at which withdrawals are considered to be made.
(c)
Reduction of basis.
(1) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) is made out of the ordinary income account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) shall be reduced by an amount equal to such portion.
(2) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) is made out of the capital gain account, the basis of such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) shall be reduced by an amount equal to—
(i) Five-eighths of such portion, in the case of a corporation (other than an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371 of the Code), or
(ii) One-half of such portion, in the case of any other person.
(3) If any portion of a qualified withdrawal to pay the principal of an indebtedness is made out of the ordinary income account or the capital gain account, then the basis of the vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) with respect to which such indebtedness was incurred is reduced in the manner provided by subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph. If the aggregate amount of such withdrawal from the ordinary income account and capital gain account would cause a basis reduction in excess of the party's basis in such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein), the excess is applied against the basis of other vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) owned by the party at the time of withdrawal in the following order: (i) vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) which were the subject of qualified withdrawals in the order in which they were acquired, constructed, or reconstructed; (ii) agreement vessels (as defined in section 607(k)(3) of the Act and § 3.11(a)(3)) and barges and containers which are part of the complement of an agreement vessel (or shares therein) which were not the subject of qualified withdrawals, in the order in which such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) were acquired by the party; and (iii) other vessels, barges, and containers (or shares therein), in the order in which they were acquired by the party. Any amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of this subparagraph is to be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal. If the indebtedness was incurred to acquire two or more vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein), then the basis reduction in such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) is to be made pro rata in proportion to the adjusted basis of such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) computed, however, without regard to this section and adjustments under section 1016(a) (2) and (3) of the Code for depreciation or amortization.
(d)
Basis for depreciation.
For purposes of determining the allowance for depreciation under section 167 of the Code in respect of any property which has been acquired, constructed, or reconstructed from qualified withdrawals, the adjusted basis for determining gain on such property is determined after applying paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of reductions in the basis of any property resulting from the application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the party may adopt a method of accounting whereby (1) payments shall reduce the basis of the property on the day such payments are actually made, or (2) payments made at any time during the first half of the party's taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the taxable year, and payments made at any time during the second half of the party's taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the succeeding taxable year. For requirements respecting the change of methods of accounting, see § 1.446-1(e)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter.
(e)
Ordinary income treatment of gain from disposition of property acquired with qualified withdrawals.
[Reserved]
§ 3.7
Tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals.
(a)
In general.
Section 607(h) of the Act provides rules for the tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, including rules for adjustments to the various accounts of the fund, the inclusion of amounts in income, and the payment of interest with respect to such amounts.
(b)
Nonqualified withdrawals defined.
Except as provided in section 607 of the Act and § 3.8 (relating to certain corporate reorganizations, changes in partnerships, and transfers by reason of death), any withdrawal from a fund which is not a qualified withdrawal shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal which is subject to tax in accordance with section 607(h) of the Act and the provisions of this section. Examples of nonqualified withdrawals are amounts remaining in a fund upon termination of the fund, and withdrawals which are treated as nonqualified withdrawals under section 607(f)(2) of the Act and § 3.5(d) (relating to failure by a party to fulfill substantial obligation under agreement) or under the second sentence of section 607(g)(4) of the Act and § 3.6(c)(3) (relating to payments against indebtedness in excess of basis).
(c)
Order of application of nonqualified withdrawals against deposits.
A nonqualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated as being made: first, out of the ordinary income account; second, out of the capital gain account; and third, out of the capital account. Such withdrawals will reduce the balance within a particular account on a first-in-first-out basis, the earliest nonqualified withdrawals reducing the items within an account in the order in which they were actually deposited or deemed deposited in accordance with this part. Nonqualified withdrawals for research, development, and design expenses incident to new and advanced ship design, machinery, and equipment, and any amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under the second sentence of section 607(g)(4) of the Act and § 3.6(c)(3), shall be applied against the deposits within a particular account on a last-in-first-out basis. The date funds are actually withdrawn from the fund determines the time at which withdrawals are considered to be made. For special rules concerning the withdrawal of contingent deposits of net proceeds from the installment sale of an agreement vessel, see § 3.2(c)(6).
(d)
Inclusion in income.
(1) Any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal which, under paragraph (c) of this section, is treated as being made out of the ordinary income account is to be included in gross income as an item of ordinary income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made.
(2) Any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal which, under paragraph (c) of this section, is treated as being made out of the capital gain account is to be included in income as an item of long-term capital gain recognized during the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made.
(3) For effect upon a party's taxable income of capital losses remaining in a fund upon the termination of a fund (which, under paragraph (b) of this section, is treated as a nonqualified withdrawal of amounts remaining in the fund), see § 3.4(e).
(e)
Interest.
(1) For the period on or before the last date prescribed by law, including extensions thereof, for filing the party's Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which a nonqualified withdrawal is made, no interest shall be payable under section 6601 of the Code in respect of the tax on any item which is included in gross income under paragraph (d) of this section, and no addition to such tax for such period shall be payable under section 6651 of the Code. In lieu of the interest and additions to tax under such sections, simple interest on the amount of the tax attributable to any item included in gross income under paragraph (d) of this section is to be paid at the rate of interest determined for the year of withdrawal under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. Such interest is to be charged for the period from the last date prescribed for payment of tax for the taxable year for which such item was deposited in the fund to the last date for payment of tax for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made. Both dates are to be determined without regard to any extensions of time for payment. Interest determined under this paragraph
which is paid within the taxable year shall be allowed as a deduction for such year under section 163 of the Code. However, such interest is to be treated as part of the party's tax for the year of withdrawal for purposes of collection and in determining any interest or additions to tax for the year of withdrawal under section 6601 or 6651, respectively, of the Code.
(2) For purposes of section 607(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, and for purposes of certain dispositions of vessels constructed, reconstructed, or acquired with qualified withdrawals described in § 3.6(e), the applicable rate of interest for any nonqualified withdrawal—
(i) Made in a taxable year beginning in 1970 and 1971 is 8 percent.
(ii) Made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, the rate for such year as determined and published jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate and the Secretary of Commerce. Such rate shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the Secretaries determine to be comparable to the relationship which the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year bear to the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year 1970. The determination of the applicable rate for any such taxable year will be computed by multiplying 8 percent by the ratio which (
a
) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of such taxable year, bears to (
b
) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year 1970. The applicable rate so determined shall be computed to the nearest one-hundredth of 1 percent. If such a determination and publication is made, the latest published percentage shall apply for any taxable year beginning in the calendar year with respect to which publication is made.
(3) No interest shall be payable in respect of taxes on amounts referred to in section 607(h)(2) (i) and (ii) of the Act (relating to withdrawals for research and development and payments against indebtedness in excess of basis) or in the case of any nonqualified withdrawal arising from the application of the recapture provision of section 606(5) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as in effect on December 31, 1969.
(f)
Basis and holding period in the case of property purchased by the fund or considered purchased by the fund.
In the case of a nonqualified withdrawal of property other than money which was purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under § 3.2(g)(1)(ii) as purchased by the fund), the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the party is its adjusted basis to the fund on the day of the withdrawal. In determining the period for which the taxpayer has held the property withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal, there shall be included only the period beginning with the date on which the withdrawal occurred. For basis and holding period in the case of nonqualified withdrawals of property other than money deposited into the fund, see § 3.2(g)(4).
§ 3.8
Certain corporate reorganizations and changes in partnerships, and certain transfers on death. [Reserved]
§ 3.9
Consolidated returns. [Reserved]
§ 3.10
Transitional rules for existing funds.
(a)
In general.
Section 607(j) of the Act provides that any person who was maintaining a fund or funds under section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, prior to its amendment by the Merchant Marine Act of 1970 (for purposes of this part referred to as “old fund”) may continue to maintain such old fund in the same manner as under prior law subject to the limitations contained in section 607(j) of the Act. Thus, a party may not simultaneously maintain such old fund and a new fund established under the Act.
(b)
Extension of agreement to new fund.
If a person enters into an agreement under the Act to establish a new fund, he may agree to the extension of such agreement to some or all of the amounts in the old fund and transfer the amounts in the old fund to which the agreement is to apply from the old fund to the new fund. If an agreement to establish a new fund is extended to amounts from an old fund, each item in the old fund to which such agreement
applies shall be considered to be transferred to the appropriate account in the manner provided for in § 3.8(d) in the new fund in a nontaxable transaction which is in accordance with the provisions of the agreement under which such old fund was maintained. For purposes of determining the amount of interest under section 607(h)(3)(C) of the Act and § 3.7(e), the date of deposit of any item so transferred shall be deemed to be July 1, 1971, or the date of the deposit in the old fund, whichever is the later.

§ 4.954-1
Foreign base company income; taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Purpose and scope.
Section 954 (b) through (g) and §§ 1.954-1T and 1.954-2T provide rules for computing the foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation. Foreign base company income is included in the subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation under the rules of section 952 and the regulations thereunder. Subpart F income is included in the gross income of a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation under the rules of section 951 and the regulations thereunder, and thus is subject to current taxation under section 1 or 11 of the Code. The determination of whether a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation, the subpart F income of which is included currently in the gross income of its United States shareholders, is made under the rules of section 957 and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Gross foreign base company income.
For taxable years of a controlled foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, the gross foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation consists of the following categories of gross income:
(i) Its foreign personal holding company income, as defined in section 954(c) and § 1.954-2T,
(ii) Its foreign base company sales income, as defined in section 954(d) and the regulations thereunder,
(iii) Its foreign base company services income, as defined in section 954(e) and the regulations thereunder,
(iv) Its foreign base company shipping income, as defined in section 954(f) and the regulations thereunder, and
(v) Its foreign base company oil related income, as defined in section 954(g) and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Adjusted gross foreign base company income.
The term “adjusted gross foreign base company income” means the gross foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation as adjusted by the de minimis and full inclusion rules of paragraph (b) of this section.
(4)
Net foreign base company income.
The term “net foreign base company income” means the adjusted gross foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation reduced so as to take account of deductions properly allocable to such income under the rules of section 954(b)(5) and paragraph (c) of this section. In computing net foreign base company income, foreign personal holding company income is reduced (but not below zero) by related person interest expense before allocating and apportioning other expenses in accordance with the rules of paragraph (c) of this section and § 1.904(d)-5(c)(2).
(5)
Adjusted net foreign base company income.
The term “adjusted net foreign base company income” means the net foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation reduced by any items of net foreign base company income for which the high tax exception of paragraph (d) of this section is elected. The term “foreign base company income” as used in the Code and elsewhere in the regulations generally means adjusted net foreign base company income.
(6)
Insurance income definitions.
The term “gross insurance income” includes any item of gross income taken into account in determining insurance income under section 953 and the regulations thereunder. The term “adjusted gross insurance income” means gross insurance income as adjusted by the de minimis and full inclusion rules of paragraph (b) of this section. The term “net insurance income” means adjusted gross insurance income reduced under section 953 and the regulations thereunder so as to take into account deductions properly allocable or apportionable to such income. The term “adjusted net insurance income” means net insurance income reduced by any items of net insurance income for which the high tax exception of paragraph (d) of this section is elected.
(7)
Additional items of adjusted net foreign base company income or adjusted net insurance income by reason of section 952(c).
Earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation that are recharacterized as foreign base company income or insurance income under section 952(c) are items of adjusted net foreign base company income or adjusted net insurance income. Thus, they are not included in the gross foreign base company income or gross insurance income of the controlled foreign corporation in computing adjusted gross foreign base company income or adjusted gross insurance income (for purposes of applying the de minimis and full inclusion tests of paragraph (b) of this section).
(8)
Illustration.
The order of computation is illustrated by the following example. Computations in this paragraph (a)(8) and in paragraph (b)(5) of this section involving the operation of section 952(c) are included for purposes of illustration only and do not provide substantive rules concerning the operation of that section.

# Example.
(i)
Gross income. CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, has gross income of $1000 for the current taxable year. Of that $1000 of income, $100 is interest income that is included in the definition of foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(A) and § 1.954-2T(b)(1)(ii), is not income from a trade or service receivable described in section 864(d)(1) or (6), and is not
excluded from foreign personal holding company income under any provision of section 954(c) and § 1.954-2T. Another $50 is foreign base company sales income under section 954(d) and the regulations thereunder. The remaining $850 of gross income is not included in the definition of foreign base company income or insurance income under sections 954(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or 953 and the regulations thereunder, and is foreign source general limitation income described in section 904(d)(1)(I) and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
Expenses. CFC
has expenses for the current taxable year of $500. Of that $500, $8 is from interest paid to a related person and is allocable to foreign personal holding company income along with $2 of other expense. Another $20 of expense is allocable to foreign base company sales. The remaining $470 of expense is allocable to income other than foreign base company income or insurance income.
(iii)
Earnings and deficits. CFC
has earnings and profits for the current taxable year of $500. In the prior taxable year,
CFC
had losses with respect to income other than gross foreign base company income or gross insurance income. By reason of the limitation provided under section 952(c)(1)(A) and the regulations thereunder, those losses reduced the subpart F income (consisting entirely of foreign source general limitation income) of
CFC
by $600 for the prior taxable year.
(iv)
Taxes.
Foreign tax of $30 is considered imposed on the interest income under the rules of section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section. Foreign tax of $14 is considered imposed on the foreign base company sales income under the rules of section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section. Foreign tax of $177 is considered imposed on the remaining foreign source general limitation income under the rules of section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section. For the taxable year of the foreign corporation, the maximum U.S. rate of taxation under section 11 is 34 percent.
(v)
Conclusion.
Based on these facts, if
CFC
elects to exclude all items of income subject to a high foreign tax under section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d), it will have $500 of subpart F income as defined in section 952(a) (consisting entirely of foreign source general limitation income) determined as follows. The following steps do not illustrate the computation of the subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation that has income from a trade or service receivable treated as interest under section 864(d)(1) or interest described in section 864(d)(6).

The de minimis rule of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) applies if the sum of the gross foreign base company income and the gross insurance income of a controlled foreign corporation is less than the lesser of—
(
1
) 5 percent of gross income, or
(
2
) $1,000,000.
Controlled foreign corporations having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar shall translate the $1,000,000 threshold using the exchange rate provided under section 989(b)(3) and the regulations thereunder for amounts included in income under section 951(a).
(B)
Coordination with section 864(d).
Gross foreign base company income or gross insurance income of a controlled foreign corporation always includes items of income from trade or service receivables described in section 864(d)(1) or (6), even if the de minimis rule of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) is otherwise applicable. In that case, adjusted gross foreign base company income consists only of the items of income from trade or service receivables described in section 864(d)(1) or (6) that
are included in gross foreign base company income, and adjusted gross insurance income consists only of the items of income from trade or service receivables described in section 864(d)(1) or (6) that are included in gross insurance income.
(iii)
Seventy percent full inclusion test.
The full inclusion rule of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) applies if the sum of the foreign base company income and the gross insurance income for the taxable year exceeds 70 percent of gross income.
(2)
Character of items of gross income included in adjusted gross foreign base company income.
The items of gross income included in the adjusted gross foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation retain their character as foreign personal holding company income, foreign base company sales income, foreign base company services income, foreign base company shipping income, or foreign base company oil related income. Items of gross income included in adjusted gross income because the full inclusion test of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is met are termed “full inclusion foreign base company income,” and constitute a separate category of adjusted gross foreign base company income for purposes of allocating and apportioning deductions under paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Coordination with section 952(c).
Items of gross foreign base company income or gross insurance income that are excluded from adjusted foreign base company income or adjusted gross insurance income because the de minimis test of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is met are potentially subject to recharacterization as adjusted net foreign base company income or adjusted net insurance income (or other categories of income included in the computation of subpart F income under section 952 and the regulations thereunder) for the taxable year under the rules of section 952(c). Items of full inclusion foreign base company income that are included in adjusted gross foreign base company income because the full inclusion test of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is met, and are included in subpart F income under section 952 and the regulations thereunder, do not reduce amounts that, under section 952(c), are subject to recharacterization in later years on account of deficits in prior years.
(4)
Anti-abuse rule
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of applying the de minimis and full inclusion tests of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the income of two or more controlled foreign corporations shall be aggregated and treated as the income of a single corporation if one principal purpose for separately organizing, acquiring, or maintaining such multiple corporations is to avoid the application of the de minimis or full inclusion requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a principal purpose need not be the purpose of first importance.
(ii)
Presumption.
Two or more controlled foreign corporations are presumed to have been organized, acquired or maintained to avoid the effect of the de minimis and full inclusion requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the corporations are related persons as defined in subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (b)(4) and the corporations are described in subdivision (A), (B), or (C). This presumption may be rebutted by proof to the contrary.
(A) The activities now carried on by the controlled foreign corporations, or the assets used in those activities, are substantially the same activities that were carried on, or assets that were previously held by a single controlled foreign corporation, and the United States shareholders of the controlled foreign corporations or related persons (as determined under subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (b)(4)) are substantially the same as the United States shareholders of the one controlled foreign corporation in that prior taxable year. A presumption made in connection with the requirements of this subdivision (A) of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) may be rebutted by proof that the activities carried on by each controlled foreign corporation would constitute a separate branch under the principles of § 1.367(a)-6T(g) if carried on directly by a United States person.
(B) The controlled foreign corporations carry on a business, financial operation, or venture as partners directly
or indirectly in a partnership (as defined in section 7701(a)(2) and § 301.7701-3) that is a related person (as defined in subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (b)(4)) with respect to each such controlled foreign corporation.
(C) The activities carried on by the controlled foreign corporations would constitute a single branch operation under § 1.367(a)-6T(g)(2) if carried on directly by the United States person.
(iii)
Related persons.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), two or more persons are related persons if they are in a relationship described in section 267(b). In determining for purposes of this paragraph (b) whether two or more corporations are members of the same controlled group under section 267(b)(3), a person is considered to own stock owned directly by such person, stock owned with the application of section 1563(e)(1), and stock owned with the application of section 267(c). In determining for purposes of this paragraph (b) whether a corporation is related to a partnership under section 267(b)(10), a person is considered to own the partnership interest owned directly by such person and the partnership interest owned with the application of section 267(e)(3).
(iv)
Illustration.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (b)(4).

# Example.
USP is the sole United States shareholder of three controlled foreign corporations:
CFC1, CFC2
and
CFC3.
The three controlled foreign corporations all have the same taxable year. The three controlled foreign corporations are partners in
FP,
a foreign entity classified as a partnership under section 7701(a)(2) and § 301.7701-3 of the regulations. For their current taxable years, each of the controlled foreign corporations derives all of its income other than foreign base company income from activities conducted through
FP,
and its foreign base company income from activities conducted both jointly through
FP
and separately without
FP.
Based on the facts in the table below, for their current taxable years, the foreign base company income derived by each controlled foreign corporation, including income derived from
FP,
is less than five percent of the gross income of each controlled foreign corporation and is less than $1,000,000:
CFC1
CFC2
CFC3
Gross income
$4,000,000
$8,000,000
$12,000,000
Five percent of gross income
200,000
400,000
600,000
Foreign base company income
199,000
398,000
597,000
Thus, without the application of the anti-abuse rule of this subparagraph (5), each controlled foreign corporation would be treated as having no foreign base company income after the application of the de minimis rule of section 954(b)(3)(A) and § 1.954-1T(b)(1).
However, under these facts the requirements of subdivision (i) of this paragraph (b)(4) are presumed to be met. The sum of the foreign base company income of the controlled foreign corporations is $1,194,000. Thus, the amount of adjusted gross foreign base company income will not be less than the amount of gross foreign base company income by reason of the de minimis rule of section 954(b)(3)(A) and this paragraph (b).
(5)
Illustration.
The following example illustrates computations required by sections 952 and 954 and this § 1.954-1T if the full inclusion test of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) is met (see paragraph (a)(8) for an example illustrating computations required if the de minimis test of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) is met):

# Example.
(i)
Gross Income. CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, has gross income of $1,000 for the current taxable year. Of that $1,000 of income, $720 is interest income that is included in the definition of foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(A) and § 1.954-2T(b)(ii), is not income from trade or service receivables described in section 864(d) (1) or (6), and is not excluded from foreign personal holding company income under any provisions of section 954(c) and § 1.954-2T. The remaining $280 is services income that is not included in the definition of foreign base company income or insurance income under sections 954(c), (d), (e), (f), (g) or 953 and the regulations thereunder, and is foreign source general limitation income for purposes of section 904(d)(1)(I).
(ii)
Expenses. CFC
has expenses for the current taxable year of $650. Of that $650, $350 is from interest paid to related persons that is allocable to foreign personal holding company income along with $50 of other expense. The remaining $250 of expense is allocable to services income other than foreign base company income or insurance income.
(iii)
Earnings and deficits. CFC
has earnings and profits for the current taxable year of $350. In the prior taxable year,
CFC
had losses with respect to income other than foreign base company income or insurance income. By reason of the limitation provided under section 952(c)(1)(A) and the regulations thereunder, those losses reduced the subpart
F income of
CFC
(consisting entirely of foreign source general limitation income) by $600 for the prior taxable year.
(iv)
Taxes.
A foreign tax of $120 is considered imposed on the $720 of interest income under the rules of section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section, and a foreign tax of $2 is considered imposed on the services income under the rules of section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section. For the taxable year of the foreign corporation, the maximum U.S. rate of taxation under section 11 is 34 percent.
(v)
Conclusion.
Based on these facts, if
CFC
elects to exclude all items of income subject to a high foreign tax under section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d), it will have $350 of subpart F income as defined in section 952(a) determined as follows:

# Step 1—Determine gross income:

350
(25) Amount of prior years' deficit remaining to be recharacterized as subpart F income in later years under section 952(c) (excess of line (23) over line (22))
280
(c)
Computation of net foreign base company income.
The net foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation is computed by reducing (but not below zero) the amount of gross income in each of the categories of adjusted gross foreign base company income described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, so as to take into account deductions allocable and apportionable to such income. For purposes of section 954 and this section, expenses must be allocated and apportioned consistent with the allocation and apportionment of expenses for purposes of section 904(d). For purposes of this § 1.954-1T, an item of net foreign base company income must be categorized according to the category of adjusted gross foreign base company income from which it is derived. Thus, an item of net foreign base company income must be categorized as a net item of—
(1) Foreign personal holding company income,
(2) Foreign base company sales income,
(3) Foreign base company services income,
(4) Foreign base company shipping income,
(5) Foreign base company oil related income, or
(6) Full inclusion foreign base company income.
(d)
Computation of adjusted net foreign base company income or adjusted net insurance income
—(1)
Application of high tax exception.
Adjusted net foreign base company income (or adjusted net insurance income) equals the net foreign base company income (or net insurance income) of a controlled foreign corporation, reduced by any item of such income (other than foreign base company oil related income as defined in section 954(g)) subject to the high tax exception provided by section 954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d). An item of income is subject to the high tax exception only if—
(i) It is established that the income was subject to creditable income taxes imposed by a foreign country or countries at an effective rate that is greater than 90 percent of the maximum rate of tax specified in section 11 or 15 for the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation; and
(ii) An election is made under section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d)(5) of this section to exclude the income from the computation of subpart F income.
See paragraph (d)(4) of this section for the definition of the term “item of income.” For rules concerning the treatment for foreign tax credit purposes of amounts excluded from subpart F under section 954(b)(4), see § 904-1.4(c)(1).
(2)
Effective rate at which taxes are imposed.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), the effective rate at which taxes are imposed on an item of income is—
(i) The amount of income taxes paid or accrued (or deemed paid or accrued) with respect to the item of income, determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, divided by
(ii) The item of net foreign base company income or net insurance income, determined under paragraph (d)(4) of this section (including the appropriate amount of income taxes referred to in subdivision (i) of this paragraph (d)(2), immediately above).
(3)
Taxes paid or accrued with respect to an item of income
—(i)
Income other than passive foreign personal holding company income.
The amount of income taxes paid or accrued with respect to an item of income (other than an item of foreign personal holding company income that is passive income) for purposes of section 954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d) is the amount of foreign income taxes that would be deemed paid under section 960 with respect to that
item if that item were included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(A). For this purpose, the amounts that would be deemed paid under section 960 shall be determined separately with respect to each controlled foreign corporation and without regard to the limitation applicable under section 904(a).
(ii)
Passive foreign personal holding company income.
The amount of income taxes paid or accrued with respect to an item of foreign personal holding company income that is passive income for purposes of section 954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d) is the amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued or deemed paid by the foreign corporation that would be taken into account for purposes of applying the provisions of § 1.904-4(c) with respect to that item of income.
(4)
Item of income
—(i)
Income other than passive foreign personal holding company income.
The high tax exception applies (when elected) to all income that constitutes a single item under this paragraph (d)(4). A single item of net foreign base company income or net insurance income is an amount of net foreign base company income (other than foreign personal holding company income that is passive income) or net insurance income that:
(A) Falls within a single category of net foreign base company income, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, or net insurance income, and
(B) Also falls within a single separate limitation category for purposes of sections 904(d) and 960 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
Passive foreign personal holding company income
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (d) a single item of net foreign personal holding company income that is passive income is an amount of such income that falls within a single group of passive income under the grouping rules of § 1.904-4(c) (3), (4), and (5).
(B)
Consistency rule.
An election to exclude income from subpart F must be consistently made with respect to all items of passive foreign personal holding company income eligible to be excluded. Thus, high-taxed passive foreign personal holding company income of a controlled foreign corporation must be excluded in its entirety, or remain subject to subpart F.
(5)
Procedure.
The election provided by this paragraph (d) must be made—
(i) By controlling United States shareholders, as defined in § 1.964-1(c)(5), by attaching a statement to such effect with their original or amended income tax returns, and including any additional information required by subsequent administrative pronouncements, or
(ii) In such other manner as may be prescribed in subsequent administrative pronouncements.
An election made under the procedure provided by this paragraph (d)(5) is binding on all United States shareholders of the controlled foreign corporation.
(6)
Illustrations.
The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
(i)
Items of income.
During its 1987 taxable year, controlled foreign corporation CFC receives from outside its country of operation portfolio dividend income of $100 and interest income of $100 (consisting of a gross payment of $150 reduced by a third-country withholding tax of $50). For purposes of illustration, assume that the CFC incurs no expenses. None of the income is taxed in CFC's country of operation. The dividend income was not subject to their-country withholding taxes. The interest income was subject to withholding taxes equal to $50, and is therefore high withholding tax interest for purposes of section 960 (pursuant to the operation of section 904). The dividend income is passive income for purposes of section 960. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, CFC has two items of income: (1) $100 of FPHC/passive income (the dividends) and (2) $100 of FPHC/high withholding tax income (the interest). The election under paragraph (d)(5) of this section to exclude high-taxed income from the operation of subpart F is potentially applicable to each such item in its entirety.
(ii)
Effective rates of tax.
No foreign tax would be deemed paid under section 960 with respect to item (1). Therefore, the effective rate of foreign tax is 0, and the item may not be excluded from subpart F under the rules of this paragraph (d). Foreign tax of $50 would be deemed paid under section 960 with respect to item (2). Therefore, the effective rate of foreign tax is 33 percent ($50 of creditable taxes paid, divided by $150, consisting of the item of net foreign base company income ($100) plus creditable taxes paid thereon ($50). The highest rate of tax specified in
section 11 for the 1987 taxable year is 34 percent. Accordingly, item (2) may be excluded from subpart F pursuant to an election under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, since it is subject to foreign tax at an effective rate that is greater than 30.6 percent (90 percent of 34 percent). However, it remains high withholding tax interest when included.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that CFC's country of operation imposes a tax of $50 with respect to CFC's dividend income. The interest income is still high withholding tax interest. The dividend income is still passive income (without regard to the possible applicability of the high tax exception of section 904(d)(2)). Accordingly, CFC has two items of income for purposes of this paragraph (d): (1) $100 of FPHC/high withholding tax interest income, and (2) $50 of FPHC/passive income (net of the $50 foreign tax). Both items are taxed at an effective rate greater than 31.6 percent. Item 1: Foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($150) of income item ($100) plus creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 33 percent. Item 2: Foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($100) of income item ($50) plus creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 50 percent. Accordingly, an election may be made under paragraph (d)(5) of this section to exclude either, both, or neither of items 1 and 2 from subpart F.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the $100 of portfolio dividend income is subject to a third-country withholding tax of $50, and the $150 of interest income is from sources within CFC's country of operation, is subject to a $10 income tax therein, and is not subject to a withholding tax. Although the interest income and the dividend income are both passive income, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section they constitute separate items of income pursuant to the application of the grouping rules of § 1.904-4(c). Accordingly, CFC has two items of income for purposes of this paragraph (d): (1) $50 (net of tax) of FPHC/non-country of operation/greater than 15 percent withholding tax income; and (2) $140 (net of $10 tax) of FPHC/country of operation income. Item 1 is taxed at an effective rate greater than 30.6 percent, but Item 2 is not. Item 1: Foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($100) of income item ($50) plus creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 50 percent. Item 2: Foreign tax ($10) divided by sum ($150) of income item ($140) plus creditable tax thereon ($10) equals 6.67 percent. Therefore, an election may be made under paragraph (d)(5) of this section to exclude Item 1 but not Item 2 from subpart F.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the $150 of interest income is subject to an income tax of $50 in CFC's country of operation. Accordingly, CFC has two items of income, as in Example 4, but both items are taxed at an effective rate greater than 30.6 percent. Item 1: Foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($100) of income item ($50) plus creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 50 percent. Item 2: Foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($150) if income item ($100) plus creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 33 percent. Pursuant to the consistency rule of paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, CFC's shareholders must consistently elect or not elect to exclude from subpart F all items of FPHC income that are eligible to be excluded. Therefore, an election may be made to exclude both Item 1 and Item 2 from subpart F, or neither may be excluded.
(e)
Character of an item of income
—(1)
Substance of the transaction.
For purposes of section 954 and the regulations thereunder, items of income shall be characterized in accordance with the substance of the transaction, and not in accordance with the designation applied by the parties to the transaction. For example, an amount received as “rent” which actually constitutes income from the sale of property, royalties, or income from services shall not be characterized as “rent” but shall be characterized as income from the sale of property, royalties or income from services, respectively. Local law shall not be controlling in characterizing an item of income.
(2)
Separable character.
To the extent one of the definitional provisions of section 953 or 954 describes a portion of the income or gain derived from a transaction, that portion of income or gain is so characterized. Thus, a single transaction may give rise to income in more than one category of foreign base company income described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation, in its business of purchasing and selling personal property, receives interest (including imputed interest and market discount) on an account receivable arising from a sale, a portion of the income derived from the transaction by the controlled foreign corporation will be interest, and another portion will be gain (or loss) from the sale of personal property. If the sale is denominated in a currency other than a functional currency as defined in section 985 and the regulations thereunder, the controlled foreign corporation may have additional income in the form of foreign currency gain as defined in section 988.
(3)
Predominant character.
The portion of income derived from a transaction
that meets the definition of foreign personal holding company income is always separately determinable, and thus must always be segregated from other income and separately classified under paragraph (2) of this paragraph (e). However, the portion of income derived from a transaction that would meet a particular definitional provision under section 954 or 953 and the regulations thereunder (other than the definition of foreign personal holding company income) in unusual circumstances may be indeterminable. If such portion is indeterminable, it must be classified in accordance with the predominant character of the transaction. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation engineers, fabricates, and installs a fixed offshore drilling platform as part of an integrated transaction, and the portion of income that relates to services is not accounted for separately from the portion that relates to sales, and is otherwise indeterminable, then the classification of income from the transaction shall be made in accordance with the predominant character of the particular integrated arrangement.
(4)
Coordination of categories of gross foreign base company income or gross insurance income.
The definitions of gross foreign base company income and gross insurance income are limited by the following rules (to be applied in numerical order):
(i) If an item of income is included in subpart F income under section 952(a)(1) and the regulations thereunder as insurance income, it is by definition excluded from any other category of subpart F income.
(ii) If an item of income is included in the foreign base company oil related income of a controlled foreign corporation, it is by definition excluded from any other category of foreign base company income, other than as provided in subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(4).
(iii) If an item of income is included in the foreign base company shipping income of a controlled foreign corporation, it is by definition excluded from any other category of foreign base company income, other than as provided in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (e)(4).
(iv) If an item of income is included in foreign personal holding company income of a controlled foreign corporation, it is by definition not included in any other category of foreign base company income, other than as provided in subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of this paragraph (e)(4).
An item of income shall not be excluded from the definition of a category of gross foreign base company income or gross insurance income under this paragraph (e)(4) by reason of being included in the general definition of another category of gross foreign base company income or gross insurance income, if the item of income is excluded from that other category by a more specific provision of section 953 or 954 and the regulations thereunder. For example, income derived from a commodity transaction that is excluded from foreign personal holding company income under § 1.954-2T(f) as income from qualified active sales may be included in gross foreign base company income if it also meets the definition of foreign base company sales income. See § 1.954-2T(a)(2) for the coordination of overlapping categories within the definition of foreign personal holding company income.
[T.D. 8216, 53 FR 27492, July 21, 1988. Redesignated and amended by T.D. 8618, 60 FR 46530, Sept. 7, 1995]
§ 4.954-2
Foreign personal holding company income; taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
(a)
Computation of foreign personal holding company income
—(1)
In general.
Foreign personal holding company income consists of the following categories of income:
(i) Dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and annuities as defined in paragraph (b) of this section;
(ii) Gain from certain property transactions as defined in paragraph (e) of this section;
(iii) Gain from commodities transactions as defined in paragraph (f) of this section;
(iv) Foreign currency gain as defined in paragraph (g) of this section; and
(v) Income equivalent to interest as defined in paragraph (h) of this section.
Paragraph (a)(3) of this section provides rules for determining the use or purpose for which property is held, if a change in use or purpose would affect the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section provide rules for determining certain rents and royalties that are excluded from foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Coordination of overlapping definitions.
If a particular portion of income from a transaction in substance falls within more than one of the definitional rules of section 954(c) and this section, its character is determined under the rules of subdivision (i) through (iii) of this paragraph (a)(2). The character of loss from a transaction must be similarly determined under the rules of this paragraph (a)(2).
(i) If a portion of the income from a transaction falls within the definition of income equivalent to interest under paragraph (h) of this section and the definition of gain from certain property transactions under paragraph (e) of this section, gain from a commodities transaction under paragraph (f) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified hedging transaction or qualified active sales), or foreign currency gain under paragraph (g) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified business transaction or a qualified hedging transaction), that portion of income is treated as income equivalent to interest for purposes of section 954(c) and this section.
(ii) If a portion of the income from a transaction falls within the definition of foreign currency gain under paragraph (g) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified business transaction or a qualified hedging transaction) and the definition of gain from certain property transactions under paragraph (e) of this section, or gain from a commodities transaction under paragraph (f) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified hedging transaction or qualified active sales), that portion of income is treated as foreign currency gain for purposes of section 954(c) and this section.
(iii) If a portion of the income from a transaction falls within the definition of gain from a commodities transaction under paragraph (f) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified hedging transaction or qualified active sales) and the definition of gain from certain property transactions under paragraph (e) of this section, that portion of income is treated as gain from a commodities transaction for purposes of section 954(c) and this section.
(3)
Changes in the use or purpose with which property is held
—(i)
In general.
Under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, transactions in certain property give rise to gain or loss included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income if the controlled foreign corporation holds that property for a particular use or purpose. For purposes of this section, in determining the purpose or use for which property is held, the period shortly before disposition is the most significant period. However, if a controlled foreign corporation held property with a purpose that would have caused its disposition to give rise to gain or loss included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this section, and prior to disposition the controlled foreign corporation changed the purpose or use for which it held the property to one that would cause its disposition to give rise to gain or loss excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income, then the later purpose or use shall be ignored unless it was continuously present for a predominant portion of the period during which the controlled foreign corporation held the property. Under paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, a currency hedging transaction may be treated as two or more separate hedging transactions, such that each portion is separately considered in applying this paragraph (a)(3).
(ii)
Illustrations.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(3).

# Example 1.
At the beginning of taxable year 1,
CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, purchases a building for investment. During taxable years 1 and 2,
CFC
derives rents from
this building that are included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. At the beginning of taxable year 3,
CFC
changes the use of the building by terminating all leases, and using it in an active trade or business. At the beginning of taxable year 4,
CFC
sells the building at a gain. For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section (gains from the sale or exchange of certain property) the building is considered to be property that gives rise to rents, as described in paragraph (e)(2). Because there was a change of use at the beginning of year 3 that would cause the disposition of the building to give rise to gain or loss excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income, the characterization of the gain derived at the beginning of year 4 is determined according to the property's use during the predominant portion of the period from purchase to date of sale. Therefore, gain from the sale of that building is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (e) of this section.

# Example 2.
For taxable years 1, 2, and 3,
CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, is engaged in the active conduct of a commodity business as a handler of gold, as defined in paragraph (f)(3)(iii), and substantially all of its business is as an active handler of gold, as defined in paragraph (f)(3)(iv). At the beginning of taxable year 1,
CFC
purchases 1000 ounces of gold for investment. At the beginning of taxable year 3,
CFC
begins holding that gold in physical form for sale to customers. During taxable year 3,
CFC
sells the entire 1000 ounces of gold in transactions described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) at a gain. For purposes of paragraph (f),
CFC
is considered to hold the gold for investment, and not in its capacity as an active handler of gold. Thus, under paragraph (f)(3)(i), the gold is not considered to be sold in the active trade or business of the
CFC
as a handler of gold, and gain from the sale is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (f) of this section.

# Example 3. CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, is a regular dealer in unimproved land. The functional currency (as defined in section 985 and the regulations thereunder) of
CFC
is country X currency. On day 1 of its current taxable year,
CFC
enters into an agreement with A to pay $100 for certain real property to be held by
CFC
for investment. On day 10, under its method of accounting,
CFC
accrues the value of $100 in country X currency, but payment will not be made until the first day of the next taxable year (day 366). On day 190,
CFC
determines to hold the property for sale to customers in a transaction that would be a qualified business transaction under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. For purposes of this section, the land is considered to be held for investment, and the foreign currency gain attributable to that transaction is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g) of this section.

# Example 4. CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, is a regular dealer in widgets. The functional currency (as defined in section 985 and the regulations thereunder) of
CFC
is country X currency. On day 1 of its current taxable year,
CFC
sells widgets held in inventory to A for delivery on day 60. The sales price is denominated in U.S. dollars, and payment is to be made by A on the same day the widgets are to be delivered to A. The remaining facts and circumstances are such that this sale would meet the definition of a qualified business transaction under paragraph (g)(4), the foreign currency gain from which would be excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g). On day 1,
CFC
sells U.S. dollars forward for delivery in 60 days in a transaction that would be a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (g)(5). On day 25 the sale of widgets to A is cancelled in a transaction that does not result in
CFC
realizing any foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the sale of widgets. However,
CFC
holds the dollar forward contract to maturity. Because the forward contract does not hedge a qualified business transaction during the period shortly before its maturity, it is not to be considered a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (g), and any foreign currency gain or loss recognized therefrom is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g). However, if
CFC
identifies the portion of the foreign currency gain or loss derived from the forward contract that is attributable to days 1 through 25, and the portion that is attributable to days 25 through 60, the forward contract may be considered two separate transactions in accordance with the rules provided by paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section. Thus, the forward sale may be separately considered a qualified hedging transaction for day 1 through day 25, and the foreign currency gain or loss attributable to day 1 through day 25 may be excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g) of this section.

# Example 5. CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, has country X currency as its functional currency under section 985 and the regulations thereunder. On day 1 of the current taxable year,
CFC,
speculating on exchange rates, sells dollars forward for delivery in 120 days. On day 65,
CFC
sells widgets held in inventory at a price denominated in dollars to be paid on day 120 in a transaction that is a qualified business transaction.
CFC
had not made any other dollar sales between day 1 and day 65 and does not anticipate
making any other dollar sales during the taxable year. On day 65,
CFC
accrues the value of $100 in country X currency. On day 120,
CFC
receives $100 payment for the widgets and recognizes foreign currency loss pursuant to that transaction. On day 120
CFC
also delivers dollars in connection with the forward sale, and recognizes foreign currency gain pursuant to the delivery. Under this paragraph (a)(3) the currency transaction is considered to have been entered into for speculation, and any currency gain recognized by
CFC
on the forward sale of dollars must be included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g). However, if
CFC
identifies the portion of the forward sale, and the foreign currency gain or therefrom, that is attributable to day 1 through day 64, and the portion that is attributable to day 65 through day 120, the forward sale may be considered two separate transactions in accordance with the rules provided by paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section. Thus, the transaction for day 65 through day 120 may be considered a separate transaction that is a qualified hedging transaction, and the foreign currency gain attributable to day 65 through day 120 may be excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g) if all the other requirements for treatment as a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (g) are met.
(4)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of computing foreign personal holding company income under this section.
(i)
Interest.
The term “interest” includes amounts that are treated as ordinary income, original issue discount or interest income (including original issue discount and interest on a tax-exempt obligation) by reason of sections 482, 483, 864(d), 1273, 1274, 1276, 1281, 1286, 1288, 7872 and the regulations thereunder, or as interest or original issue discount income by reason of any other provision of law. For special rules concerning interest exempt from U.S. tax pursuant to section 103, see paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(ii)
Inventory and similar property.
The term “inventory and similar property” (or “inventory or similar property”) means property that is stock in trade of the controlled foreign corporation or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the controlled corporation if on hand at the close of the taxable year (were the controlled foreign corporation a domestic corporation), or property held by the controlled foreign corporation primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. Rights to property held in bona fide hedging transactions that reduce the risk of price changes in the cost of “inventory and similar property” are included in the definition of that term if they are an integral part of the system by which a controlled foreign corporation purchases such property, and they are so identified by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the hedging transaction is entered into.
(iii)
Regular dealer.
The term “regular dealer” means a merchant with an established place of business that—
(A) Regularly and actively engages as a merchant in purchasing property and selling it to customers in the ordinary course of business with a view to the gains and profits that may be derived therefrom, or
(B) Makes a market in derivative financial products of property (such as forward contracts to buy or sell property, option contracts to buy or sell property, interest rate and currency swap contracts or other national principal contracts) by regularly and actively offering to enter into positions in such products to the public in the ordinary course of business.
Purchasing and selling property through a regulated exchange or established off-exchange market (for example, engaging in futures transactions) is not actively engaging as a merchant for purposes of this section.
(iv)
Dealer property.
Property held by a controlled foreign corporation is “dealer property” if—
(A) The controlled foreign corporation is a regular dealer in property of such kind, and
(B) The property is held by the controlled foreign corporation in its capacity as a dealer.
Property which is held by the controlled foreign corporation for investment or speculation is not such property.
(v)
Debt instrument.
The term “debt instrument” includes bonds, debentures, notes, certificates, accounts receivable, and other evidences of indebtedness.
(b)
Dividends, etc.
—(1)
In general.
Foreign personal holding company includes:
(i) Dividends, except certain dividends from related persons as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and distributions of previously taxed income under section 959(b) and the regulations thereunder;
(ii) Interest, except export financing interest as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and certain interest received from related persons as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
(iii) Rents and royalties, except certain rents and royalties received from related persons as described in (b)(4) of this section and rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business as defined in paragraph (b)(5); and
(iv) Annuities.
(2)
Exclusion of certain export financing
—(i)
In general.
Pursuant to section 954(c)(2)(B), foreign personal holding company income computed under section 954(c)(1)(A) and this paragraph (b) does not include interest that is export financing interest. For purposes of section 954(c)(2)(B) and this section, the term “export financing interest” means interest that is derived in the conduct of a banking business and is export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and the regulations thereunder. Pursuant to section 864(d)(5)(A)(iii), it does not include income from related party factoring that is treated as interest under section 864(d)(1) or interest described in section 864(d)(6).
(ii)
Conduct of a banking business.
For purposes of this section, export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and the regulations thereunder is considered derived in the conduct of a banking business if, in connection with the financing from which the interest is derived, the corporation, through its own officers or staff of employees, engages in all the activities in which banks customarily engage in issuing and servicing a loan.
(iii)
Illustration.
The following example illustrates the application of this provision:

# Example. DS,
a domestic corporation, manufactures property in the United States. In addition to selling inventory (property described in section 1221(1)),
DS
occasionally sells depreciable equipment it manufactures for use in its trade or business, which is property described in section 1221(2). Less than 50 percent of the fair market value, determined in accordance with section 904(d)(2)(G) and the regulations thereunder, of each item of inventory or equipment sold by
DS
is attributable to products imported into the United States.
CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation related (as defined in section 954(d)) to
DS,
provides loans for the purchase of property from
DS,
if the property is purchased exclusively for use of consumption outside the United States.
If, in issuing and servicing loans made with respect to purchases from
DS
of depreciable equipment used in its trade or business, which is property described in section 1221(2) in the hands of
DS, CFC
engages in all the activities in which banks customarily engage in issuing and servicing loans, the interest accrued from these loans would be export financing interest meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which would not be included in foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. However, interest from the loans made with respect to purchases from
DS
of property which is inventory in the hands of
DS
cannot be export financing interest because it is treated as income from a trade or service receivable under section 864(d)(6) and the regulations thereunder, and thus is included in foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. See § 1.864-8T(d) for rules concerning certain income from trade and service receivables qualifying under the same country exception of section 864(d)(7).
(3)
Exclusion of dividends and interest from related persons
—(i)
Excluded dividends and interest.
Foreign personal holding company income does not include dividends and interest if—
(A) The payor is a corporation that is a related person as defined in section 954(a)(3),
(B) The payor is created or organized (“incorporated”) under the laws of the same foreign country as the controlled foreign corporation, and
(C) A substantial part of the payor's assets are used in a trade or business in the payor's country of incorporation as determined under subdivision (iv) of this paragraph (b)(3).
Except as otherwise provided under this paragraph (b)(3), the principles of section 367(a) and regulations thereunder shall apply in determining
whether the payor has a trade or business in its country of incorporation, and whether its assets are used in that trade or business.
(ii)
Interest paid out of adjusted foreign base company income or insurance income.
Interest may not be excluded from the foreign personal holding company income of the recipient under this paragraph (b)(3) to the extent that the deduction for the interest is allocated under § 1.954-1T(c) to the payor's adjusted gross foreign base company income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(3)), adjusted gross insurance income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(6)), or other categories of income included in the computation of subpart F income under section 952(a), for purposes of computing the payor's net foreign base company income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(4), net insurance income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(6)), or income described in sections 952(a) (3), (4), and (5).
(iii)
Dividends paid out of prior years' earnings.
Dividends are excluded from foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (b)(3) only to the extent they are paid out of earnings and profits which were earned or accumulated during a period in which the requirements of subdivision (i) of this paragraph (b)(3) were satisfied or, to the extent earned or accumulated during a taxable year of the related foreign corporation ending on or before December 31, 1962, during a period in which the payor was a related corporation as to be controlled foreign corporation and the other requirements of subdivision (i) of this paragraph (b)(3) are substantially satisfied.
(iv)
Fifty percent substantial assets test.
A substantial part of the assets of the payor will be considered used in a trade or business located in its country of incorporation only if, for each quarter during such taxable year, the average value (as of the beginning and end of the quarter) of its assets which are used in the trade or business and are located in such country constitutes over 50 percent of the average value (as of the beginning and end of the quarter) of all the assets of the payor (including assets not used in a trade or business). For such purposes the value of assets shall be determined under subdivision (v) of this paragraph (b)(3), and the location of assets used in a trade or business of the payor shall be determined under subdivisions (vi) through (xi) of this paragraph (b)(3).
(v)
Value of assets.
For purposes of determining whether a substantial part of the assets of the payor are used in a trade or business in its country of incorporation, the value of assets shall be their actual value (not reduced by liabilities), which, in the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary, shall be deemed to be their adjusted basis.
(vi)
Location of tangible property used in a trade or business
—(A)
In general.
Tangible property (other than inventory and similar property) used in a trade or business is considered located in the country in which it is physically located.
(B)
Exception.
If tangible personal property used in a trade or business is intended for use in the payor's country of incorporation, but is temporarily located elsewhere, it will be considered located within payor's country of incorporation if the reason for its location elsewhere is for inspection or repair, and it is not currently in service in a country other than the payor's country of incorporation and is not to be placed in service in a country other than the payor's country of incorporation following the inspection or repair.
(vii)
Location of intangible property used in a trade or business
—(A)
In general.
The location of intangible property (other than inventory or similar property and debt instruments) used in a trade or business is determined based on the site of the activities conducted by the payor during the current year in connection with using or exploiting that property. An item of intangible property is located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter of the current taxable year if the activities connected with its use or exploitation are conducted during the entire current taxable year by the payor in its country of incorporation. For this purpose, the determination of the country in which services are performed shall be made under the principles of section 954(e) and § 1.954-4(c).
(B)
Property located in part in the payor's country of incorporation and in
part in other countries.
If the activities connected with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property are conducted during the current taxable year by the payor in the payor's country of incorporation and in other countries, then a percentage of the intangible (measured by the average value of the item as of the beginning and end of the quarter) is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter. That percentage equals the ratio that the expenses of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of such activities that are conducted in the payor's country of incorporation bear to the expenses of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of all such activities worldwide. Expenses incurred in connection with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property are included in the computation provided by this paragraph (b)(3) if they are deductible under section 162 or includible in inventory costs or the costs of goods sold (were the payor a domestic corporation).
(viii)
Location of property held for sale to customers
—(A)
In general.
Inventory or similar property is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter of the taxable year if the activities of the payor in connection with the production and sale, or purchase and release, of such property and conducted in the payor's country of incorporation during the entire taxable year. If the payor conducts such activities through an independent contractor, then the location of such activities shall be the place in which they are conducted by the independent contractor.
(B)
Inventory located in part in the payor's country of incorporation and in part in other countries.
If the activities connected with the production and sales, or purchase and resale, of inventory or similar property are conducted by the payor in the payor's country of incorporation and other countries, then a percentage of the inventory or similar property (measured by the average value of the item as of the beginning and end of the quarter) is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation each quarter. That percentage equals the ratio that the costs of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of such activities that are conducted in the payor's country of incorporation bear to all such costs incurred by reason of such activities worldwide. A cost incurred in connection with the production and sale or purchase and resale of inventory or similar property is included in this computation if it—
(
1
) Must be included in inventory costs or otherwise capitalized with respect to inventory or similar property under section 61, 263A, 471, or 472 and the regulations thereunder (whichever would be applicable were the payor a domestic corporation), or
(
2
) Would be deductible under section 162 (were the payor a domestic corporation) and is definitely related to gross income derived from such property (but not to all classes of gross income derived by the payor) under the principles of § 1.861-8.
(ix)
Location of debt instruments.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), debt instruments are considered to be used in a trade or business only if they arise from the sale of inventory or similar property by the payor or from the rendition of services by the payor in the ordinary course of a trade or business of the payor, but only until such time as interest is required to be charged under section 482 and the regulations thereunder. Debt instruments that arise from the sale of inventory or similar property are treated as having the same location, proportionately, as inventory or similar property that is held during the same calendar quarter. Debt instruments arising from the rendition of services in the ordinary course of a trade or business are considered located on a proportionate basis in the countries in which the services to which they relate are performed.
(x)
Treatment of certain stock interests.
For the purpose of determining the value of assets used in a trade or business in the country of incorporation, stock directly or indirectly owned by the payor within the meaning of section 958(a) in a controlled foreign corporation (“lower-tier corporation”), which is incorporated in the same
country as the payor, shall be considered located in the country of incorporation and used in a trade or business of the payor in proportion to the value of the assets of the lower-tier corporation that are used in a trade or business in the country of incorporation. The location of assets used in a trade or business of the lower-tier corporation shall be determined under the rules of this paragraph (b)(3).
(xi)
Determination of period during which property is used in a trade or business.
Property purchased or produced for use in a trade or business shall not be considered used in a trade or business until it is placed in service, and shall cease to be considered used in a trade or business when it is retired from service. The dates during which depreciable property is determined to be in use must be consistent with the determination of depreciation under sections 167 and 168 and the regulations thereunder.
(xii)
Treatment of banks and insurance companies.
[Reserved]
(4)
Exclusion of rents and royalties derived from related persons
—(i)
In general.
Foreign personal holding company income does not include rents or royalties if—
(A) The payor is a corporation that is a related person as defined in section 954(d)(3), and
(B) The rents or royalties are for the use of, or the privilege of using, property within the country under the laws of which the recipient of the payments is created or organized.
If the property is used both within and without the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized, the part of the rent or royalty attributable to the use of, or the privilege of using, the property outside such country of incorporation is, unless otherwise provided, foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (b).
(ii)
Rents or royalties paid out of adjusted foreign base company income or insurance income.
Rents or royalties may not be excluded from the foreign personal holding company income of the recipient under this paragraph (b)(4) to the extent that deductions for the payments are allocated under section 954(b)(5) and § 1.954-1T(a)(4) to the payor's adjusted gross foreign base company income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(3)), adjusted gross insurance income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(6), or other categories of income included in the computation of subpart F income under section 952(a), for purposes of computing the payor's net foreign base company income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(4)), net insurance income (as defined in § 1.954-1T(a)(6)), or income described in section 952(a) (3), (4), or (5).
(5)
Exclusion of rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business.
Foreign personal holding company income shall not include rents or royalties which are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and which are received from a person other than a related person within the meaning of section 954(d)(3). Whether or not rents or royalties are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business is to be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case; but see paragraph (c) or (d) of this section for specific cases in which rents or royalties will be considered for purposes of this paragraph to be derived in the active conduct of a trade or business. The frequency with which a foreign corporation enters into transactions from which rents or royalties are derived will not of itself establish the fact that such rents or royalties are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business.
(6)
Treatment of tax exempt interest.
Foreign personal holding company income includes all interest income, including interest that is exempt from U.S. tax pursuant to section 103 (“tax-exempt interest”). However, that net foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation that is attributable to such tax-exempt interest shall be treated as tax-exempt interest in the hands of the U.S. shareholders of the foreign corporation. Accordingly, any net foreign base company income that is included in the subpart F income of a U.S. shareholder and that is attributable to such tax-exempt interest shall remain exempt from the regular income tax, but potentially subject to the alternative minimum tax, in the hands of the U.S. shareholder.
(c)
Excluded rents
—(1)
Trade or business cases.
Rents will be considered for
purposes of paragraph (b)(5) of this section to be derived in the active conduct of a trade or business if such rents are derived by the controlled foreign corporation (“lessor”) from leasing—
(i) Property which the lessor has manufactured or produced, or has acquired and added substantial value to, but only if the lessor is regularly engaged in the manufacture or production of, or in the acquisition and addition of substantial value to, property of such kind,
(ii) Real property with respect to which the lessor, through its own officers or staff of employees, regularly performs active and substantial management and operational functions while the property is leased,
(iii) Personal property ordinarily used by the lessor in the active conduct of a trade or business, leased during a temporary period when the property would, but for such leasing, be idle, or
(iv) Property which is leased as a result of the performance of marketing functions by such lessor if the lessor, through its own officers or staff of employees located in a foreign country, maintains and operates an organization in such country which is regularly engaged in the business of marketing, or of marketing and servicing, the leased property and which is substantial in relation to the amount of rents derived from the leasing of such property.
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
Adding substantial value.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the performance of marketing functions will not be considered to add substantial value to property.
(ii)
Substantiality of foreign organization.
An organization in a foreign country will be considered substantial in relation to the amount of rents, for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, if active leasing expenses, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii), equal or exceed 25 percent of the adjusted leasing profit, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(iii)
Active leasing expenses
The term “active leasing expenses” means the deductions incurred by an organization of the lessor in a foreign country which are properly allocable to rental income and which would be allowable under section 162 to the lessor (were the lessor a domestic corporation) other than—
(A) Deductions for compensation for personal services rendered by shareholders of, or related persons with respect to, the lessor,
(B) Deductions for rents paid or accrued,
(C) Deductions which, although generally allowable under section 162, would be specifically allowable to the lessor (were the lessor a domestic corporation) under sections other than section 162 (such as sections 167 and 168), and
(D) Deductions for payments made to independent contractors with respect to the leased property.
(iv)
Adjusted leasing profit.
The term “adjusted leasing profit” means the gross income of the lessor from rents, reduced by the sum of—
(A) The rents paid or incurred by the controlled foreign corporation with respect to such gross rental income,
(B) The amounts which would be allowable to such lessor (were the lessor a domestic corporation) as deductions under section 167 or 168 with respect to such rental income, and
(C) The amounts paid to independent contractors with respect to such rental income.
(3)

The application of this paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples.

is regularly engaged in the production of office machines which it sells or leases to others and services. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the rental income of
A
Corporation from the leases is derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).

# Example 2.
Controlled foreign corporation
D
purchases motor vehicles which it leases to others. In the conduct of its short-term leasing of such vehicles in foreign country X, Corporation
D
owns a large number of motor vehicles in country X which it services and repairs, leases motor vehicles to customers on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis, maintains offices and service facilities in country X from which to lease and service such vehicles, and maintains therein a sizable staff of its own administrative, sales, and service personnel. Corporation
D
also leases in country X on a long-term basis, generally for a term of one year, motor vehicles which it owns. Under the terms of the long-term leases, Corporation
D
is required to repair
and service, during the term of the lease, the leased motor vehicles without cost to the lessee. By the maintenance in country X of office, sales, and service facilities and its complete staff of administrative, sales, and service personnel, Corporation
D
maintains and operates an organization therein which is regularly engaged in the business of marketing and servicing the motor vehicles which are leased. The deductions incurred by such organization satisfy the 25-percent test of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section; thus, such organization is substantial in relation to the rents Corporation
D
receives from leasing the motor vehicles. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, such rents are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).

# Example 4.
Controlled foreign corporation
E
owns a complex of apartment buildings which it has acquired by purchase. Corporation
E
engages a real estate management firm to lease the apartments, manage the buildings and pay over the net rents to the owner. The rental income of
E
Corporation from such leases is not derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).

# Example 5.
Controlled foreign corporation
F
acquired by purchase a twenty-story office building in a foreign country, three floors of which it occupies and the rest of which it leases. Corporation
F
acts as rental agent for the leasing of offices in the building and employs a substantial staff to perform other management and maintenance functions. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the rents received by Corporation
F
from such leasing operations are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).

# Example 6.
Controlled foreign corporation
G
owns equipment which it ordinarily uses to perform contracts in foreign countries to drill oil wells. For occasional brief and irregular periods it is unable to obtain contracts requiring immediate performance sufficient to employ all such equipment. During such a period it sometimes leases such idle equipment temporarily. After the expiration of such temporary leasing of the property, Corporation
G
continues the use of such equipment in the performance of its own drilling contracts. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, rents
G
receives from such leasing of idle equipment are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).
(d)
Excluded royalties
—(1)
Trade or business cases.
Royalties will be considered for purposes of paragarph (b)(5) of this section to be derived in the active conduct of a trade or business if such royalties are derived by the controlled foreign corporation (“licensor”) from licensing—
(i) Property which the licensor has developed, created, or produced, or has acquired and added substantial value to, but only so long as the licensor is regularly engaged in the development, creation, or production of, or in the acquisition of and addition of substantial value to, property of such kind, or
(ii) Property which is licensed as a result of the performance of marketing functions by such licensor and the licensor, through its own staff of employees located in a foreign country, maintains and operates an organization in such country which is regularly engaged in the business of marketing, or of marketing and servicing, the licensed property and which is substantial in relation to the amount of royalties derived from the licensing of such property.
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
Adding substantial value.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(i), the performance of marketing functions will not be considered to add substantial value to property.
(ii)
Substantiality of foreign organization.
An organization in a foreign country will be considered substantial in relation to the amount of royalties, for purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if the active licensing expenses, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, equal or exceed 25 percent of the adjusted licensing profit, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
(iii)
Active licensing expenses.
The term “active licensing expenses” means the deductions incurred by an organization of the licensor which are properly allocable to royalty income and which would be allowable under section 162 to the licensor (were the licensor a domestic corporation) other than—
(A) Deductions for compensation for personal services rendered by shareholders of, or related persons with respect to, the licensor,
(B) Deductions for royalties paid or incurred,
(C) Deductions which, although generally allowable under section 162, would be specifically allowable to the licensor (were the controlled foreign corporation a domestic corporation)
under sections other than section 162 (such as section 167), and
(D) Deductions for payments made to independent contractors with respect to the licensed property.
(iv)
Adjusted licensing profit.
The term “adjusted licensing profit” means the gross income of the licensor from royalties, reduced by the sum of—
(A) The royalties paid or incurred by the controlled foreign corporation with respect to such gross royalty income,
(B) The amounts which would be allowable to such licensor as deductions under section 167 (were the licensor a domestic corporation) with respect to such royalty income, and
(C) The amounts paid to independent contractors with respect to such royalty income.
(3)
Illustrations.
The application of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
Controlled foreign corporation
A,
through its own staff of employees, owns and operates a research facility in foreign country X. At the research facility employees of Corporation A who are full time scientists, engineers, and technicians regularly perform experiments, tests, and other technical activities, which ultimately result in the issuance of patents that it sells or licenses. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, royalties received by Corporation
A
for the privilege of using patented rights which it develops as a result of such research activity are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).

# Example 2.
Assume that Corporation
A
in example 1, in addition to receiving royalties for the use of patents which it develops, receives royalties for the use of patents which it acquires by purchase and licenses to others without adding any value thereto. Corporation
A
generally consummates royalty agreements on such purchased patents as the result of inquiries received by it from prospective licensees when the fact becomes known in the business community, as a result of the filing of a patent, advertisements in trade journals, announcements, and contacts by employees of Corporation
A,
that Corporation
A
has acquired rights under a patent and is interested in licensing its rights. Corporation
A
does not, however, maintain and operate an organization in a foreign country which is regularly engaged in the business of marketing the purchased patents. The royalties received by Corporation
A
for the use of the purchased patents are not derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).

# Example 3.
Controlled foreign corporation
B
receives royalties for the use of patents which it acquires by purchase. The primary business of Corporation
B,
operated on a regular basis, consists of licensing patents which it has purchased “raw” from inventors and, through the efforts of a substantial staff of employees consisting of scientists, engineers, and technicians, made susceptible to commercial application. For example, Corporation
B,
after purchasing patent rights covering a chemical process, designs specialized production equipment required for the commercial adaptation of the process and, by so doing, substantially increases the value of the patent. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, royalties received by Corporation
B
from the use of such patent are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).

# Example 4.
Controlled foreign corporation
D
finances independent persons in the development of patented items in return for an ownership interest in such items from which it derives a percentage of royalty income, if any, subsequently derived from the use by others of the protected right. Corporation
D
also attempts to increase its royalty income from such patents by contacting prospective licensees and rendering to licensees advice which is intended to promote the use of the patented property. Corporation
D
does not, however, maintain and operate an organization in a foreign country which is regularly engaged in the business of marketing the patents. Royalties received by Corporation
D
for the use of such patents are not derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).
(e)
Certain property transactions
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Inclusion in FPHC income.
Foreign personal holding company income includes the excess of gains over losses from the sale or exchange of—
(A) Property which gives rise to dividends, interest, rents, royalties or annuities as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and
(B) Property which does not give rise to income, as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
If losses from the sale or exchange of such property exceed gains, the net loss is not within the definition of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e), and may not be allocated to, or otherwise reduce, other foreign personal holding company income under section 954(b)(5) and § 1.954-1T(c). Gain or loss from a transaction that is treated as capital gain or
loss under section 988(a)(1)(B) is not foreign currency gain or loss as defined in paragraph (g), but is gain or loss from the sale or exchange of property which is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(1). Paragraphs (e) (4) and (5) of this section provide specific rules for determining whether gain or loss from dispositions of debt instruments and dispositions of options or similar property must be included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(1). A loss that is deferred or that otherwise may not be taken into account under any provision of the Code may not be taken into account for purposes of determining foreign personal holding company income under any provision of this paragraph (e).
(ii)
Dual character property.
Property may only in part constitute property that gives rise to certain income as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section or property that does not give rise to any income as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. In such cases, the property must be treated as two separate properties for purposes of this paragraph (e). Accordingly, the sale or exchange of such dual character property will give rise to gain or loss that in part must be included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e), and in part is excluded from such computation. Gain or loss from the disposition of dual character property must be bifurcated for purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(i) pursuant to the method that most reasonably reflects the relative uses of the property. Reasonable methods may include comparisons in terms of gross income generated or the physical division of the property. In the case of real property, the physical division of the property will in most cases be the most reasonable method available. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation owns an office building, uses 60 percent of the building in its business, and rents out the other 40 percent, then 40 percent of the gain recognized on the disposition of the property would reasonably be treated as gain which is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(1). This paragraph (e)(1)(ii) addresses the contemporaneous use of property for dual purposes; for rules concerning changes in the use of property affecting its classification for purposes of this paragraph (e), see paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(2)
Property that gives rise to certain income
—(i)
In general.
Property the sale or exchange of which gives rise to foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(2) includes property that gives rise to dividends, interest, rents, royalties and annuities described in paragraph (b) of this section, except for rents and royalties derived from unrelated persons in the active conduct of a trade or business under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The property described by this paragraph (e)(2) includes property which gives rise to export financing interest described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and property which gives rise to income from related persons described in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Exception.
Property described in this paragraph (e)(2) does not include—
(A) Dealer property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section), and
(B) Inventory and similar property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section) other than securities.
(3)
Property that does not give rise to income.
The term “property that does not give rise to income” for purposes of this section includes all rights and interests in property (whether or not a capital asset) except—
(i) Property that gives rise to dividends, interest, rents, royalties and annuities described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and property that gives rise to rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business under paragraph (b)(5) of this section;
(ii) Dealer property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section);
(iii) Inventory and similar property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)) other than securities;
(iv) Property (other than real property) used in the controlled foreign corporation's trade or business that is of a character which would be subject to
the allowance for depreciation under section 167 or 168 and the regulations thereunder (including tangible property described in § 1.167(a)-2 and intangibles described in § 1.167(a)-3);
(v) Real property that does not give rise to rental or similar income, to the extent used in the controlled foreign corporation's trade or business; and
(vi) Intangible property as defined in section 936(h)(3)(B) and goodwill that is not subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167 and the regulations thereunder to the extent used in the controlled foreign corporation's trade or business and disposed of in connection with the sale of a trade or business of the controlled foreign corporation.
(4)
Classification of gain or loss from the disposition of a debt instrument or on a deferred payment sale
—(i)
Gain.
Gain from the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e) unless—
(A) It is treated as interest income (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section); or
(B) It is treated as income equivalent to interest under paragraph (h) of this section.
(ii)
Loss.
Loss from the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e) unless—
(A) It is directly allocated to interest income (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) or income equivalent to interest (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section) under any provision of the Code or regulations thereunder;
(B) It is required to be apportioned in the same manner as interest expense under section 864(e) or any other provision of the Code or regulations thereunder; or
(C) The debt instrument was taken in consideration for the sale or exchange of property (or the provision of services) by the controlled foreign corporation and gain or loss from that sale or exchange (or income from the provision of services) is not includible in foreign base company income under this section.
(5)
Classification of options and other rights to acquire or transfer property.
Subject to the exceptions provided in paragraphs (e)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section (relating to certain dealer property and inventory property), rights to acquire or transfer property, including property that gives rise to income, are classified as property that does not give rise to income under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. These rights include options, warrants, futures contracts, options on a futures contract, forward contracts, and options on an index relating to stocks, securities or interest rates.
(6)
Classification of certain interests in pass through entities.
[Reserved]
(f)
Commodities transactions
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f), foreign personal holding company income includes the excess of gains over losses from commodities transactions. If losses from commodities transactions exceed gains, the net loss is not within the definition of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (f), and may not be allocated to, or otherwise reduce, foreign personal holding company income under section 954(b)(5) and § 1.954-1T(a)(4). The terms “commodity” and “commodities transactions” are defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Gains and losses from qualified active sales and qualified hedging transactions are excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (f). The term “qualified active sales” is defined in paragraph (f)(3). The term “qualified hedging transaction” is defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. An election is provided under paragraph (g)(5) of this section to include all gains and losses from section 1256 foreign currency transactions, which would otherwise be commodities transactions, in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g) instead of this paragraph (f). A loss that is deferred or that otherwise may not be taken into account under any provision of the Code may not be taken into account for purposes of determining foreign personal holding company income under any provision of this paragraph (f).
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
Commodity.
For purposes of this section, the term “commodity” means:
(A) Tangible personal property of a kind which is actively traded or with respect to which contractual interests are actively traded, and
(B) Nonfunctional currency (as defined under section 988 and the regulations thereunder).
(ii)
Commodities transaction.
A commodities transaction means the purchase or sale of a commodity for immediate (spot) delivery, or deferred (forward) delivery, or the right to purchase, sell, receive, or transfer a commodity, or any other right or obligation with respect to a commodity, accomplished through a cash or off-exchange market, an interbank market, an organized exchange or board of trade, an over-the-counter market, or in a transaction effected between private parties outside of any market. Commodities transactions include, but are not limited to:
(A) A futures or forward contract in a commodity,
(B) A leverage contract in a commodity purchased from leverage transaction merchants,
(C) An exchange of futures for physical transaction,
(D) A transaction in which the income or loss to the parties is measured by reference to the price of a commodity, a pool of commodities, or an index of commodities,
(E) The purchase or sale of an option or other right to acquire or transfer a commodity, a futures contract in a commodity, or an index of commodities, and
(F) The delivery of one commodity in exchange for the delivery of another commodity, the same commodity at another time, cash, or nonfunctional currency.
(3)
Definition of the term “qualified active sales”
—(i)
In general.
The term “qualified active sales” means the sale of commodities in the active conduct of a commodity business as a producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities if substantially all of the controlled foreign corporation's business is as an active producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities of like kind. The sale of commodities held by a controlled foreign corporation other than in its capacity as an active producer, processor, merchant or handler of commodities of like kind is not a qualified active sale.
(ii)
Sale of commodities.
The term “sale of commodities” means any transaction in which the controlled foreign corporation intends to deliver to a purchaser a commodity held by the controlled foreign corporation in physical form.
(iii)
Active conduct of a commodities business.
For purposes of this paragraph, a controlled foreign corporation is engaged in the active conduct of a commodities business as a producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities only if—
(A) It holds commodities as inventory or similar property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)); and
(B) It incurs substantial expenses in the ordinary course of a commodities business from engaging in one of the following activities directly, and not through an independent contractor:
(
1
) Substantial activities in the production of commodities, including planting, tending or harvesting crops, raising or slaughtering livestock, or extracting minerals.
(
2
) Substantial processing activities prior to the sale of commodities including concentrating, refining, mixing, crushing, aerating, or milling; or
(
3
) Significant activities relating to the physical movement, handling and storage of commodities including preparation of contracts and invoices; arranging freight, insurance and credit; arranging for receipt, transfer or negotiation of shipping documents; arranging storage or warehousing, and dealing with quality claims; owning and operating facilities for storage or warehousing or owning or chartering vessels or vehicles for the transportation of commodities.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), a corporation is not engaged in a commodities business as a producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities if its business is primarily financial. In general, the business of a controlled foreign corporation is financial if it primarily engages in commodities transactions for investment or speculation, or if it primarily provides
products or services to customers for investment or speculation.
(iv)
Substantially all.
Substantially all of the controlled foreign corporation's business is as an active producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities if the activities described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) give rise to 85 percent of the taxable income of the controlled foreign corporation (computed as though the corporation were a domestic corporation). For this purpose, gains or losses from qualified hedging transactions, as defined in paragraph (f)(4), are considered derived from the qualified active sales to which they relate or are expected to relate.
(4)
Definition of the term “qualified hedging transaction.”
The term “qualified hedging transaction” means a bona fide hedging transaction that:
(i) Is reasonably necessary to the conduct of business as a producer, processor, merchant or handler of a commodity in the manner in which such business is customarily and usually conducted by others;
(ii) Is entered into primarily to reduce the risk of price change (but not the risk of currency fluctuations) with respect to commodities sold or to be sold in qualified active sales described in paragraph (f)(3) of this paragraph; and
(iii) Is clearly identified on the controlled foreign corporation's records before the close of the fifth day after the day during which the hedging transaction is entered into and at a time when there is a reasonable risk of loss; however, if the controlled foreign corporation does not at such time specifically and properly identify the qualified active sales (or category of such sales) to which a hedging transaction relates, the district director in his sole discretion may determine which hedging transactions (if any) are related to qualified active sales.
(g)
Foreign currency gain
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2), foreign personal holding company income includes the excess of foreign currency gains over losses (as defined in section 988(b)) attributable to any section 988 transactions. If foreign currency losses exceed gains, the net loss is not within the definition of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g), and may not be allocated to, or otherwise reduce, foreign personal holding company income under section 954(b)(5) and § 1.954-1T(a)(4). To the extent the gain or loss from a transaction is treated as interest income or expense under sections 988(a)(2) or 988(d) and the regulations thereunder, it is not included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g). (For other rules concerning income described in more than one category of foreign personal holding company income, see § 1.954-2(a)(2).) A loss that is deferred or that otherwise may not be taken into account under any provision of the Code may not be taken into account for purposes of determining foreign personal holding company income under any provision of this paragraph (g).
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Qualified business units using the dollar approximate separate transactions method.
Any DASTM gain or loss computed under § 1.985-3(d) must be allocated under the rules of § 1.985-3 (e)(2)(iv) or (e)(3).
(ii)
Tracing to exclude foreign currency gain or loss from qualified business and hedging transactions.
A foreign currency gain or loss is excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g) if it is clearly identified on the records of the controlled foreign corporation as being derived from a qualified business transaction or a qualified hedging transaction. The term “qualified business transaction” is defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The term “qualified hedging transaction” is defined paragraph (g)(4) of this section. However, currency gain or loss of a qualified business unit included in the computation of currency gain or loss under subdivision (i) of this paragraph (g)(2) may not be excluded from foreign personal holding company income under the tracing rule of this paragraph (g)(2)(ii). Furthermore, the tracing rule of this paragraph (g)(2)(ii) will not apply if a controlled foreign corporation makes the election provided by paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Election out of tracing.
A controlled foreign corporation may elect a method of accounting under which all
foreign currency gains or losses attributable to section 988 transactions are included in foreign personal holding company income. The scope and requirements for this election are provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. This election does not apply to foreign currency gains or losses of a qualified business unit included in the computation of gain or loss under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Definition of the term “qualified business transaction”
—(i)
In general.
The term “qualified business transaction” means a transaction (other than a “qualified hedging transaction” as described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) that:
(A) Does not have investment or speculation as a significant purpose;
(B) Is not attributable to property or an activity of the kind that gives rise to subpart F income (other than foreign currency gain under this paragraph (g)), or could reasonably be expected to give rise to subpart F income (including upon disposition); for example, the transaction may not be attributable to stock or debt of another corporation (including related corporations organized and operating in the same country), or property likely to give rise to foreign base company sales or services income; and
(C) Is attributable to business transactions described in subdivision (ii) of this paragraph (g)(3).
A qualified business transaction includes the disposition of a debt instrument that constitutes inventory property under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) or dealer property under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (g)(3) do not apply to the foreign currency gain or loss of a qualified business unit (as determined under § 1.985-3T(d)(2)) included in the computation of gain or loss under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (g)(3) do, however, apply to other currency transactions of a qualified business unit that elects (or is deemed to elect) the U.S. dollar as its functional currency under section 985(b)(3) and § 1.985-2T. Qualified business transactions and the amount of foreign currency gain or loss derived therefrom must be clearly identified on its records by the controlled foreign corporation. If the controlled foreign corporation is unable to specifically identify the qualified business transactions and the foreign currency gain or loss derived therefrom, the district director in his sole discretion may determine which transactions of the corporation giving rise to the foreign currency gains or losses are attributable to qualified business transactions.
(ii)
Specific business transactions.
A transaction of a controlled foreign corporation must meet the requirements of any of subdivisions (A) through (F) of this paragraph (g)(3)(ii) to be a qualified business transaction under this paragraph (g)(3).
(A)
Acquisition of debt instruments.
If the transaction is the acquisition of a debt instrument described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(i) and the regulations thereunder, the debt must be derived from—
(
1
) The sale of inventory and similar property to customers by the controlled foreign corporation in the ordinary course of regular business operations, or
(
2
) The rendition of services by the corporation in the ordinary course of regular business operations.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A), a debt instrument will not be considered derived in the ordinary course of regular business operations unless the instrument matures, and is reasonably expected to be satisfied, within the period for which interest need not be charged under section 482 and the regulations thereunder.
(B)
Becoming the obligor under debt instruments.
If the transaction is becoming the obligor under a debt instrument described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(i) and the regulations thereunder, the debt must be incurred for:
(
1
) Payment of expenses that are includible by the controlled foreign corporation in the cost of goods sold under § 1.61-3 for property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of regular business operations, are inventoriable costs under section 471 and the regulations thereunder, or are allocable or apportionable under the rules of § 1.861-8 to gross income derived from inventory and similar property,
(
2
) Payment of expenses that are allocable or apportionable under the rules of § 1.861-8 to gross income derived from services provided by the controlled foreign corporation in the ordinary course of regular business operations,
(
3
) Acquisition of an asset that does not give rise to subpart F income during the current taxable year (other than by application of section 952(c)) and is not reasonably expected to give rise to subpart F income in subsequent taxable years, or
(
4
) Acquisition of dealer property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section.
The identification requirements of subdivision (i) of this paragraph (g)(3) will not be met with respect to a borrowing if the controlled foreign corporation fails to clearly identify the debt and the expenses (or categories of expenses) to which it relates before the close of the fifth day after the day on which the expenses are incurred.
(C)
Accrual of any item of gross income.
If the transaction is the accrual (or otherwise taking into account) of any item of gross income or receipts as described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii) and the regulations thereunder, the item of gross income or receipts must be derived from:
(
1
) The sale of inventory and similar property in the ordinary course of regular business operations, or
(
2
) The provision of services by the controlled foreign corporation to customers in the ordinary course of regular business operations.
(D)
Accrual of any item of expense.
If the transaction is the accrual (or otherwise taking into account) of any item of expense as described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(ii) and the regulations thereunder, the item of expense must be:
(
1
) An expense that is includible by the controlled foreign corporation in the cost of goods sold under § 1.61-3 for property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of regular business operations, is an inventoriable cost under section 471 and the regulations thereunder, or is allocable or apportionable under the rules of § 1.861-8 to gross income derived from inventory and similar property, or
(
2
) An expense that is allocable or apportionable under the rules of § 1.861-8 to gross income derived from services provided by the controlled foreign corporation in the ordinary course of regular business operations.
(E)
Entering into forward contracts, futures contracts, options and similar instruments.
If the transaction is entering into any forward contract, futures contract, option or similar financial instrument and if such contract or instrument is not marked to market at the close of the taxable year under section 1256, as described in section 988(c)(1)(B)(iii) and the regulations thereunder, then the contract or instrument must be property held as dealer property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.
(F)
Disposition of nonfunctional currency.
If the transaction is the disposition of nonfunctional currency, as described in section 988(c)(1)(C) and the regulations thereunder, then the transaction must be for a purpose described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B), for the payment of taxes not attributable to subpart F income, or must be the disposition of property held as dealer property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section.
(G)
Transactions in business assets.
The acquisition or disposition of an asset that is used or held for use in the active conduct of a trade or business.
(4)
Definition of the term “qualified hedging transaction”
—(i)
In general.
The term “qualified hedging transaction” means a bona fide hedging transaction meeting all the requirements of subdivisions (A) through (D) of this paragraph (g)(4)(i):
(A) The transaction must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of regular business operations in the manner in which such business operations are customarily and usually conducted by others.
(B) The transaction must be entered into primarily to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to property or services sold or to be sold or expenses incurred or to be incurred in transactions that are qualified business transactions under paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(C) The hedging transaction and the property or expense (or category of property or expense) to which it relates must be clearly identified on the records of the controlled foreign corporation before the close of the fifth day after the day during which the hedging transaction is entered into and at a time during which there is a reasonable risk of currency loss.
(D) The amount of foreign currency gain or loss that is attributable to a specific hedging transaction must be clearly identifiable on the records of the controlled foreign corporation or its controlling shareholder (as defined in § 1.964-1(c)(5)).
The provisions of this paragraph (g)(4) do not apply to transactions of a qualified business unit included in the computation of gain or loss under paragraph (g)(2)(i). The provisions of this paragraph (g)(4) do apply, however, to other currency transactions of a qualified business unit that elects (or is deemed to elect) the U.S. dollar as its functional currency under section 985(b)(3) and § 1.985-3T. If the controlled foreign corporation does not specifically identify the qualified business transactions (or category of qualified business transactions) to which a hedging transaction relates or is unable to specifically identify the amount of foreign currency gain or loss derived from the hedging transactions, the district director in his sole discretion may make the identifications required of the controlled foreign corporation and determine which hedging transactions (if any) are related to qualified business transactions, and the amount of foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the qualified hedging transactions.
(ii)
Change in purpose of hedging transaction.
If a hedging transaction is entered into for one purpose, and the purpose for that transaction subsequently changes, the transaction may be treated as two separate hedging transactions for purposes of this paragraph (g)(4). In such a case, the portion of the transaction that relates to a qualified business transaction is considered a qualified hedging transaction if it separately meets all the other requirements of this paragraph (g)(4) for treatment as a qualified hedging transaction. For purposes of paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C), the foreign corporation must identify on its records the portion of the transaction that relates to a qualified business transaction by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the hedge becomes so related (
i.e.,
either the day on which the hedge is first entered into or on the day on which it first relates to a qualified business transaction due to a change in its purpose). The foreign corporation must identify on its records the portion of the transaction that does not relate to a qualified business transaction by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the purpose for the hedging transaction changes.
(5)
Election out of tracing
—(i)
In general.
A controlled foreign corporation may elect to account for currency gains and losses under section 988 and gains and losses from section 1256 currency contracts by including in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g) all foreign currency gains or losses attributable to section 988 transactions, and all gains or losses from section 1256 foreign currency contracts. Separate elections for section 1256 foreign currency contracts and section 988 transactions are not permitted. If a controlled foreign corporation makes the election described in this paragraph (g)(5)(i), the election is effective for all related persons as defined in section 954(d)(3) and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
Exception.
The election provided by this paragraph (g)(5) does not apply to foreign currency gain or loss of a qualified business unit determined under § 1.985-3T(d)(2). It does, however, apply to other foreign currency gains or losses of a qualified business unit that elects (or is deemed to elect) the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.
(iii)
Procedure
—(A)
In general.
The election provided by this paragraph (g)(5) shall be made in the manner prescribed in this paragraph and in subsequent administrative pronouncements.
(B)
Time and manner.
The controlled foreign corporation may make the election by filing a statement with its original or amended information return for the taxable year for which the election is made. The controlling
United States shareholders, as defined in § 1.964-1(c)(5), may make the election on behalf of the controlled foreign corporation and related corporations by filing a statement to such effect with their original or amended income tax returns for the taxable year during which the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation for which the election is made ends. The election is effective for the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation for which the election is made, for the taxable years of all related controlled foreign corporations ending within such taxable year, and for all subsequent years of such corporations. The statement shall include the following information:
(
1
) The name, address, taxpayer identification number, and taxable year of each United States shareholder;
(
2
) The name, address, and taxable year of each controlled foreign corporation for which the election is effective; and
(
3
) Any additional information to be required by the Secretary by administrative pronouncement.
Each United States shareholder or controlled foreign corporation filing the election must provide copies of the election to all controlled foreign corporations for which the election is effective, and all United States shareholders of such corporations. However, failure to provide such copies will not void (or cause to be voidable) an election under this paragraph (g)(5).
(C)
Termination.
The election provided by this paragraph (g)(5) may be terminated only with the consent of the Commissioner: Attn.: CC:INTL.
(h)
Income equivalent to interest
—(1)
In general.
Foreign personal holding company income includes income that is equivalent to interest. Income equivalent to interest includes, but is not limited to, income derived from the following categories of transactions:
(i) An investment, or series of integrated transactions which include an investment, in which the payments, net payments, cash flows, or return predominantly reflect the time value of money, and
(ii) Transactions in which the payments or a predominant portion thereof are in substance for the use or forebearance of money, but are not generally treated as interest.
However, amounts treated as interest under section 954(c)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section are not income equivalent to interest under this paragraph (h). Income from the sale of property will not be treated as income equivalent to interest for purposes of this paragraph (h), subject to the rule of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, unless the sale is part of an integrated transaction that gives rise to interest or income equivalent to interest. See sections 482, 483 and 1274 for the extent to which such income may be characterized as interest income subject to paragraph (b) of this section. Income equivalent to interest for purposes of this paragraph (h) includes all income attributable to a transfer of securities subject to section 1058. Income equivalent to interest also includes a portion of certain deferred payments received for the purpose of services, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (h)(5) of this section. Income equivalent to interest does not include income attributable to notional principal contracts such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, interest rate floor agreements, or similar contracts except to the extent that such contracts are part of an integrated transaction that gives rise to income equivalent to interest. Income derived from notional contracts by a person acting in its capacity as a regular dealer in such contracts will be presumed not to be integrated with an investment.
(2)
Illustrations.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h):

# Example 1. CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, promises that
A,
an unrelated person, may borrow up to $500 in principal for one year beginning at any time during the next three months at an interest rate of 10 percent. In exchange,
A
pays
CFC
a commitment fee of $2.00. Pursuant to this loan commitment,
CFC
lends $80 to
A.
As a result, the entire $2.00 fee is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (h)(1)(ii).

# Example 2.
(i) At the beginning of its current taxable year,
CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, purchases at face value a one-year debt instrument issued by
A
having a $100 principal amount and bearing a floating rate of interest set at the London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus one percentage point. Contemporaneously,
CFC
borrows $100 from
B
for one year at a fixed interest rate of 10 percent, using the debt instrument as security.
(ii) During its current taxable year,
CFC
accrues $11 of interest from
A
on the bond. That interest is foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1) and § 1.954-2T(b), and thus is not income equivalent to interest. During its current taxable year,
CFC
incurs $10 of interest expense with respect to the borrowing from
B.
That expense is allocated and apportioned to, and reduces, foreign base company income or insurance income to the extent provided in sections 954(b)(5), 863(e), and 864(e) and the regulations thereunder.

# Example 3.
(i) At the beginning of its 1988 taxable year,
CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, purchases at face value a one-year debt instrument issued by
A
having a $100 principal amount and bearing a floating rate of interest set at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus one percentage point payable on the last day of
CFC
's current taxable year.
CFC
subsequently determines that it would prefer receiving interest at a fixed rate, and, on January 1, 1989, enters into an agreement with
B,
an unrelated person, whereby
B
promises to pay
CFC
on the last day of
CFC
's 1989 taxable year an amount equal to 10 percent on a notional principal amount of $100. In exchange,
CFC
promises to pay
B
on the last day of
CFC
's 1989 taxable year an amount equal to LIBOR plus one percentage point on the notional principal amount.
(ii)
CFC
receives a total of $10 from
B,
and pays $9 to
B. CFC
also receives $9 from
A.
The $9 paid to
B
is directly allocated to, or is otherwise an adjustment to, the $10 received from
B.
The transactions are considered an intergrated transaction giving rise to $9 of interest income (paid by
A
) and, under paragraph (h)(1)(i), $1 of income equivalent to interest (paid by
B
).

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that
CFC
does not hold any debt obligations. Since the transaction with
B
is not integrated with an investment giving rise to interest or income equivalent to interest, the net $1 of income realized by
CFC
does not constitute income equivalent to interest.

# Example 5.
(i)
CFC,
a controlled foreign corporation, enters into an agreement with
A
whereby
CFC
purchases commodity X from
A
at a price of $100, and
A
contemporaneously repurchases commodity X from
CFC
for payment and delivery in 3 months at a price of $104 set by the forward market.
(ii) The transaction is in substance a loan from
CFC
to
A
secured by commodity X. Thus,
CFC
accrues $4 of gross income which is included in foreign personal holding company income as interest under section 954(c)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section.

# Example 6.
(i)
CFC
purchases commodity Y on the spot market for $100 and contemporaneously, sells commodity Y forward for delivery and payment in 3 months at a price of $104 set by the forward market.
(ii) The $100 paid on the spot purchase of commodity Y offsets any market risk on the forward sale so that the $4 of income to be derived predominantly reflects time value of money. Thus, under paragraph (h)(1)(i), the spot purchase of commodity Y and the offsetting forward sale will be treated as an integrated transaction giving rise to $4 of income equivalent to interest.
(3)
Income equivalent to interest from factoring
—(i)
General rule.
Income equivalent to interest includes factoring income. Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section, the term “factoring income” includes any income (including any discount income or service fee, but excluding any stated interest) derived from the acquisition and collection or disposition of a factored receivable. The rules of this paragraph (h)(3) apply only with respect to the tax treatment of factoring income derived from the acquisition and collection or disposition of a factored receivable and shall not affect the characterization of an expense or loss of either the person whose goods or services gave rise to a factored receivable or the obligor under a receivable. The amount of income equivalent to interest realized with respect to a factored receivable is the difference (if a positive number) between the amount paid for the receivable by the foreign corporation and the amount that it collects on the receivable (or realizes upon its sale of the receivable).
(ii)
Exceptions.
Factoring income shall not include—
(A) Income treated as interest under section 864(d)(1) or (6) and the regulations thereunder (relating to income derived from trade or service receivables of related persons), even if such income is not treated as described in section 864(d)(1) by reason of the same-country exception of section 864(d)(7);
(B) Income derived from a factored receivable if payment for the acquisition of the receivable is made on or after the date on which stated interest begins to accrue, but only if the rate of stated interest equals or exceeds 120 percent of the Federal short term rate
(as defined under section 1274) (or the equivalent rate for a currency other than the dollar) as of the date on which the receivable is acquired by the foreign corporation; or
(C) Income derived from a factored receivable if payment for the acquisition of the receivable by the foreign corporation is made only on or after the anticipated date of payment of all principal by the obligor (or the anticipated weighted average date of payment of a pool of purchased receivables).
(iii)
Factored receivable.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3), the term “factored receivable” includes any account receivable or other evidence of indebtedness, whether or not issued at a discount and whether or not bearing stated interest, arising out of the disposition of property or the performance of services by any person, if such account receivable or evidence of indebtedness is acquired by a person other than the person who disposed of the property or provided the services that gave rise to the account receivable or evidence of indebtedness. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3), it is immaterial whether the person providing the property or services agrees to transfer the receivable at the time of sale (as by accepting a third-party charge or credit card) or at a later time.
(iv)
Illustrations.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h)(3).

# Example 1.
DP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation. FS acquires accounts receivable arising from the sale of property by unrelated corporation X. The receivables have a face amount of $100, and after 30 days bear stated interest equal to at least 120 percent of the applicable short term Federal rate (determined as of the date the receivable is acquired). FS purchases the receivables from X for $95 on Day 1 and collects $100 from the obligor under the receivable on Day 40. Income (other than stated interest) derived by FS from the factored receivables is factoring income within the meaning or paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section and, therefore, is income equivalent to interest.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that FS does not pay X for the receivables until Day 30. Income derived by FS from the factored receivables is not factoring income by reason of paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 2, except that it is anticipated that all principal will be paid by the obligor of the receivables by Day 30. Income derived by FS from this “maturity factoring” of the receivables is not factoring income by reason of paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, and therefore does not give rise to income equivalent to interest.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that, rather than collecting $100 from the obligor under the factored receivable on Day 40, FS sells the receivable to controlled foreign corporation Y on Day 15 for $97. Both the income derived by FS on the factored receivable and the income derived by Y (other than stated interest) on the receivable are factoring income within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, and therefore, constitute income equivalent to interest.

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in example 4, except that FS sells the factored receivable to Y for $99 on Day 45, at which time interest is accruing on the unpaid balance of $100. FS has $4 of net factoring income that is income equivalent to interest. Because interest was accruing at the time Y acquired the receivable at a rate equal to at least 120 percent of the applicable short term Federal rate, income derived by Y from the factored receivable is not factoring income by reason of pargraph (h)(3)(ii)(B).

# Example 6.
DP, a domestic corporation engaged in an integrated credit card business, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation. On Day 1 individual A uses a credit card issued by DP to purchase shoes priced at $100 from X, a foreign corporation unrelated to DP, FS, or A. By prearrangement with DP, on Day 7, X transfers the receivable arising from A's purchase to FS in exchange for $95. FS collects $100 from A on Day 45. Income derived by FS on the factored receivable is factoring income within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section and, therefore, is income equivalent to interest.
(4)
Determination of sales income.
Income equivalent to interest for purposes of this paragraph (h) does not include income from the sale of property unless the sale is part of an integrated transaction that gives rise to interest or income equivalent to interest. Income derived by a controlled foreign corporation will be treated as arising from the sale of property only if the corporation in substance carries out sales activities. Accordingly, an arrangement that is designed to lend the
form of a sales transaction to a transaction that in substance constitutes and advance of funds will be disregarded. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation acquires property on 30-day payment terms from one person and sells that property to another person on 90 day payment terms and at prearranged prices and terms such that the foreign corporation bears no substantial economic risk with respect to the purchase and sale other than the risk of non-payment, the foreign corporation has not in substance derived income from the sale of property.
(5)
Receivables arising from performance of services.
If payment for services performed by a controlled foreign corporation is not made until more than 120 days after the date on which such services are performed, then the income derived by the foreign corporation constitutes income equivalent to interest to the extent that interest income would be imputed under the principles of section 483 or the original issue discount provisions (section 1271
et seq.
), if—
(A) Such provisions applied to contracts for the performance of services,
(B) The time period referred to in sections 483(c)(1) and 1274(c)(1)(B) were 120 days rather than six months, and
(C) The time period referred to in section 483(c)(1)(A) were 120 days rather than one year.

# PART 5—TEMPORARY INCOME TAX REGULATIONS UNDER THE REVENUE ACT OF 1978

# Authority:
26 U.S.C. 7805.
§ 5.6411-1
Tentative refund under claim of right adjustment.
(a)
Effective date.
This section applies to applications for tentative refunds filed after November 5, 1978, under section 6411(d).
(b)
In general.
Section 6411(d) allows taxpayers to apply for a tentative refund of amounts treated under section 1341(b)(1) as an overpayment of tax under a claim of right adjustment. This section contains rules for filing an application for this tentative refund. The computation of amounts treated as an overpayment must be made in accordance with section 1341 and the regulations under that section.
(c)
Method of applying for tentative refund
—(1)
In general.
For a corporation, the application is made by filing Form 1139. For taxpayers other than corporations, the application is made by filing Form 1045. The application must be made by filing those forms even if the taxpayer is not applying for a tentative carryback adjustment under section 6411(a). If the taxpayer files the form to apply for the section 6411(d) tentative refund only, it may disregard those lines on the form used to compute the section 6411(a) carryback adjustment. If the taxpayer has a carryback of a net operating loss, credit, or capital loss for the taxable year (determined without the deduction described in section 1341(a)(2)) and applies for both the section 6411(a) tenative carryback adjustment and the section 6411(d) tentative refund, an ordering rule applies. The taxpayer must take into account any adjustments made in applying for the tentative carryback adjustment under section 6411(a) before determining the amount of the overpayment for which an application under section 6411(d) is being made. The taxpayer must attach to the form a separate schedule containing the information required under paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Applications made before February 7, 1980.
Applications made before February 7, 1980 that are made under penalties of perjury will be considered meeting the requirements of this section if made by filing a separate statement whether or not it is attached to Form 1139 or 1045. This application, however, must contain the information required under paragraph (d) of this section (other than paragraph (d)(2)).
(d)
Information required
—(1)
In general.
The application must contain (i) the taxpayer's name, address, and identification number and (ii) the information set forth in paragraph (d) (2) and
(3) of this section, determined in accordance with section 1341 and the regulations under that section. For example, the decrease in tax under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section is determined under § 1.1341-1(d)(4).
(2)
Computation under section 1341(a)(4).
The application must contain the following information related to the computation under section 1341(a)(4):
(i) The amount of income restored by the taxpayer to another during the taxable year and the amount of the corresponding deduction described in section 1341(a)(2);
(ii) The tax for the taxable year computed with the deduction described in section 1341(a)(2); and
(iii) The tax for each prior taxable year (determined before adjustment under section 1341) to which any net operating loss described in section 1341(b)(4)(A) may be carried and the decrease in tax for each of those years that results from the carryback of that loss.
(3)
Computation under section 1341(a)(5).
The application must contain the following information related to the computation under section 1341(a)(5):
(i) The tax for the taxable year without the deduction described in section 1341(a)(2);
(ii) The tax for each prior taxable year (determined before adjustment under section 1341) for which a decrease in tax is computed under section 1341(a)(5)(B);
(iii) The decrease in tax for each prior taxable year computed under section 1341(a)(5)(B), including any decrease resulting from a net operating loss or capital loss described in section 1341(b)(4)(B); and
(iv) The amount treated as an overpayment of tax under section 1341(b)(1).
(e)
Time and place for filing.
The application must be filed no earlier than the date of filing the return for the taxable year of restoration and no later than the date 12 months from the last day of that taxable year. The application must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center (or other office) where the taxpayer filed its return for the taxable year of restoration.
(f)
Not a claim for credit or refund.
An application for tentative refund under section 6411(d) is not a claim for credit or refund. The principles of paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.6411-1 apply in determining the effect of an application for a tentative refund. For example, the filing of an application for tentative refund under section 6411(d) is not a claim for credit or refund in determining whether a claim for credit or refund was timely filed.

# PART 5c—TEMPORARY INCOME TAX REGULATIONS UNDER THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981
Sec.
5c.44F-1
Leases and qualified research expenses.
5c.1305-1
Special income averaging rules for taxpayers otherwise required to compute tax in accordance with § 5c.1256-3.

# Authority:
26 U.S.C. 168(f)(8)(G) and 7805.

# Source:
T.D. 7791, 46 FR 51907, Oct. 23, 1981, unless otherwise noted.
§ 5c.44F-1
Leases and qualified research expenses.
For purposes of section 44F(b)(2)(A)(iii), the determination of whether any amount is paid or incurred to another person for the right to use personal property in the conduct of qualified research shall be made without regard to the characterization of the transaction as a lease under section 168(f)(8). See § 5c.168(f)(8)-1(b).
§ 5c.1305-1
Special income averaging rules for taxpayers otherwise required to compute tax in accordance with § 5c.1256-3.
(a)
In general.
If an eligible individual (as defined in section 1303 and the regulations thereunder) is described in the first sentence of § 5c.1256-3(a), chooses the benefits of income averaging and otherwise complies with the special rules under section 1304 and the regulations thereunder, and has averagable income (as defined in section 1302 and the regulations thereunder) in excess of $3,000, then the individual shall compute the tax under section 1301 as provided in this section. The computation
under this section shall be in lieu of the computation under § 5c.1256-3.
(b)
Computation of tax.
The individual shall compute the tax under section 1301 as follows:
Step (1).
Compute tax under section 1301 and the regulations thereunder on all taxable income, including gains or losses on regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a) and the regulations thereunder, using rates applicable to the taxpayer for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981.
Step (2).
Compute tax under section 1301 and the regulations thereunder on all taxable income, including gains or losses on regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a) and the regulations thereunder, using rates applicable to the taxpayer for taxable years beginning in 1982.
Step (3).
Compute the percentage of adjusted gross income attributable to all sources except regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a) and the regulations thereunder.
Step (4).
Compute the percentage of adjusted gross income attributable to regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a) and the regulations thereunder. Both the percentage in Step (3) and the percentage in Step (4) are to be rounded to the nearest percent. The sum of both percentages must equal 100 percent.
Step (5).
Multiply the result of Step (1) with the result of Step (3).
Step (6).
Multiply the result of Step (2) with the result of Step (4).
Step (7).
Add the result of Step (5) and the result of Step (6). This is the tax for the individual under section 1301 for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981.
(c)
Option to defer tax.
If an individual computes the tax under section 1301 as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the individual may also opt to pay part or all of the deferrable tax under income averaging (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981, in 2 or more, but not more than 5, equal installments in accordance with this section. Such individual may not opt to pay part or all of the deferrable tax in installments under § 5c.1256-3. An individual opting to defer payment must attach a statement to Form 6781 indicating the computation of deferrable tax under income averaging, the number of installments in which the individual opts to pay the deferrable tax under income averaging, and the amount of each such payment.
(d)
Deferrable tax under income averaging.
The deferrable tax under income averaging is the excess of—
(1) The tax for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981, computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, over
(2) The tax for the taxable year which includes June 23, 1981, computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, except that pre-transitional year gain or loss (as described in § 5c.1256-2(g)) is omitted for purposes of recomputing the percentage in Step (4). As computed under this subparagraph (2), the sum of the percentage in Step (3) and Step (4) will not equal 100 percent.
(e)
Rules of application.
The provisions of § 5c.1256-3 (c), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) shall apply in computing the tax and in determining the deferrable tax under income averaging under this section.
(f)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
Individual A is a single, calendar year taxpayer with no dependents. A reported the following amounts for the following years on line 34 of Form 1040:
1977—$80,000
1978—$90,000
1979—$100,000
1980—$110,000
A reports the following amounts for the following lines on Form 1040 for 1981:
line 7—$120,000
line 12—$600,000
line 32b—$19,000
line 33—$1,000
The amount on line 12 is computed as follows: $937,500 of gain is attributable to regulated futures contracts subject to section 1256(a). Of that total, 40 percent is short term capital gain ($375,000) and 60 percent is long term capital gain ($562,500). Of the long term capital gain, 40 percent is taxable ($225,000). Therefore, A reports $600,000 on line 12 ($375,000 + $225,000).
The result of Step (1) is $464,013.41. The result of Step (2) is $337,051.52. The result of Step (3) is 17 percent. The result of Step (4) is 83 percent. The result of Step (5) is $78,882.28. The result of Step (6) is $279,752.76. The result of Step (7) is $358,635.04. This is A's tax for 1981 under section 1301.

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that $703,125 of the $937,500 gain attributable to regulated futures contracts is pre-transitional year gain or loss (as described in § 5c.1256-2(g)). A's tax for 1981 under section 1301 is $358,635.04. A
may opt to pay in installments a maximum of $221,004.68 of the tax due in 1981. If A opts to defer the maximum amount and pay in 5 equal installments, A must pay for 1981 a tax of $181,831.30. Each of the 4 succeeding installments is $44,200.94 plus interest computed in accordance with § 5c.1256-3(g)(3).

# PART 5e—TEMPORARY INCOME TAX REGULATIONS, TRAVEL EXPENSES OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

# Authority:
Secs. 280A(f)(4)(B) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (95 Stat. 1641, 26 U.S.C. 7805; 68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805).
§ 5e.274-8
Travel expenses of Members of Congress.
(a)
In general.
Members of Congress (including any Delegate and Resident Commissioner) who are away from home within the meaning of section 162 (a), in the Washington, DC area, may elect in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section to deduct an amount described in paragraph (c) of this section as living expenses, without substantiation. A Member who elects under this section may not deduct any amount for the living expenses described in paragraph (b). A Member who does not make an election under this section must substantiate his expenses for living in Washington, DC in accordance with section 274 and § 1.274-5.
(b)
Living expenses covered.
The amount allowed to be deducted without substantiation, pursuant to this section, for costs incurred for living in the Washington, DC area represents amounts expended for meals, lodging, and other incidental expenses. Meals include the actual cost of the food and expenses incident to the preparation and serving thereof. Lodging includes amounts paid for rent, care of premises, utilities, insurance and depreciation of household furnishings owned by the Member. In the case of a Member who lives in a residence owned by him in the Washington, DC area, the cost of lodging also includes depreciation on such residence. Other incidental expenses include laundry, cleaning, and local transportation. Local transportation includes travel within a 50 mile radius of Washington, DC, whether by private automobile, taxicab or other transportation for hire. Interest and taxes on personal property will not be considered expenses to be included within this paragraph.
(c)(1)
Amounts allowed without substantiation.
The amount that may be deducted pursuant to section 162 and these regulations is an amount equal to the product of the number of Congressional days in the taxable year, multiplied by the designated amount. The designated amount is—
(i) In the case of a Member who deducts interest and taxes attributable to the ownership of a personal residence in the Washington, DC area, two-thirds of the maximum amount of actual subsistence for Washington, DC payable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5702(c), or
(ii) In the case of a Member not described in paragraph (c)(1)(i), the maximum amount of actual subsistence for Washington, DC payable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5702(c).
A Member who incurs interest and taxes on his residence in the Washington, DC area may forego the deduction of such amounts and use the designated amount prescribed by paragraph (c)(1)(ii).
(2) If a Member, who lives in a residence owned by him in the Washington, DC area, chooses to deduct amounts prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Member must treat as an adjustment to the basis of such residence an amount equal to 20 percent of the maximum amount of actual subsistence multiplied by the number of Congressional days. Such adjustments will be considered a proper adjustment for exhaustion, wear, and tear under this subtitle.
(d)
Congressional days.
The number of Congressional days with respect to a Member is the number of days in the taxable year less the number of days in periods in which the Member's Congressional chamber was not in session for 5 consecutive days or more (including Saturday and Sunday). The number
of days with respect to a Member is determined without regard to whether or not the Member was in the Washington, DC area on such days.
EC16OC91.000
(e)
Other deductible amounts.
This section does not preclude the deduction of otherwise allowable expenses for travel fares (other than local travel in the Washington, DC), long distance telephone and telegraph, and travel expenses incurred other than in the Washington, DC area. However, such expenses are subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274.
(f)
Election.
To elect to deduct the amounts prescribed by this section, a Member must attach to his return for the taxable year a statement indicating, (1) that the deduction for travel expenses while living in the Washington, DC area are computed pursuant to § 5e.274-8, and (2) whether a separate deduction is being taken for interest and taxes paid or incurred with respect to the personal residence of the Member if in the Washington, DC area.
(g)
Effective date.
This section is effective for taxable year beginning after December 31, 1980.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples are based on a calendar from a Final Edition of the Calendar of the United States, House of Representatives and History of Legislation. The marked days indicate days the House of Representatives was in session.

# Example 1.
In determining the number of Congressional days for 198X for which the designated amount may be computed, the number of days in such year is reduced by 125 days determined as follows:
Days
Feb. 14-18
5
Apr. 3-14
12
May 23-27
5
July 3-20
18
Aug. 2-17
16
Aug. 29-Sept. 2
5
Oct. 3-Nov. 11
40
Nov. 22-Nov. 30
9
Dec. 17-Dec. 31
15
Total
125
Thus for 198X (a leap year) a typical Member of the House of Representatives will have 241 (366−125) Congressional days.

# Example 2.
On August 1, Z a calendar year taxpayer is elected to the Congress to fill the unexpired term of Member Y. In determining the number of Congressional days, Z may only consider the number of days during the year for which he was a Member of Congress. For Z the number of Congressional days is 68.

# Example 3.
Member X, a calendar year taxpayer, owns his own home in Washington, DC, where he lives with his family. While in Washington, DC, Member X is away from home within the meaning of section 162(a). X maintains no records attributable to his expenses in Washington, DC X has been a Member of Congress for the entire year. The maximum amount of subsistence for Washington, DC for 198X is $75. X may deduct for 198X $18,075 (241 days × $75) attributable to expenses while away from home in Washington, DC. Even if X maintained records as to living expenses in Washington, DC, X may choose to deduct $18,075 as the total amount attributable to living expenses in Washington, DC. If X deducts $18,075 X may not deduct any interest and taxes under section 163 or 164 attributable to the residence in Washington, DC.

# Example 4.
Member C, a calendar year taxpayer owns his own home in Washington, DC, where he lives with his family. While in Washington, DC. Member C is away from home within the meaning of section 162(a). C can establish that he paid $12,000 as interest on a mortgage and $3,000 in local real estate taxes. C has been a Member of Congress for the entire year. C may choose to deduct $12,050 (241 days × [
2/3
× $75]) attributable to expenses in Washington, DC. Further, C may deduct under sections 163 and 164 $12,000 of interest and $3,000 of taxes respectively.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in Example (4). In addition, on March 15, 16, and 17, Member C travels to New York City to deliver a speech for which he receives an honorarium which he includes in income. C receives no additional amounts for travel reimbursement. While in New York City C incurs $350 for 3 nights lodging at a hotel and $150 for meals. In addition to the amounts deductible pursuant to this section, C may deduct the $500 as a travel expenses. Such deduction is subject to the substantiation rules of section 274.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as example (5). Member C receives, in addition to the honorarium, $600 reimbursement for travel expenses. C must include the $600 in income and may deduct the travel expenses he incurred.

# PART 5f—TEMPORARY INCOME TAX REGULATIONS UNDER THE TAX EQUITY AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1982
Sec.
5f.103-1
Obligations issued after December 31, 1982, required to be in registered form.
5f.163-1
Denial of interest deduction on certain obligations issued after December 31, 1982, unless issued in registered form.

# Authority:
26 U.S.C. 7805. Secs. 5f.103-1 and 5f.163-1 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 103(j), 26 U.S.C. 163(f), and 96 Stat. 595.
§ 5f.103-1
Obligations issued after December 31, 1982, required to be in registered form.
(a)
Registration; general rule.
Interest on a registration-required obligation (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) shall not be exempt from tax notwithstanding section 103 (a) or any other provision of law, exclusive of any treaty obligation of the United States, unless the obligation is issued in registered form (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section).
(b)
Registration-required obligation.
For purposes of this section, the term “registration-required obligation” means any obligation except any one of the following:
(1) An obligation not of a type offered to the public. The determination as to whether an obligation is not of a type offered to the public shall be based on whether similar obligations are in fact publicly offered or traded.
(2) An obligation that has a maturity at the date of issue of not more than 1 year.
(3) An obligation issued before January 1, 1983. An obligation first issued before January 1, 1983, shall not be considered to have been issued on or after that date merely as a result of the existence of a right on the part of the holder of such obligation to convert the obligation from registered form into bearer form, or as a result of the exercise of such a right.
(4) An obligation described in § 5f.163-1 (c) (relating to certain obligations issued to foreign persons).
(c)
Registered form
—(1)
General rule.
An obligation issued after January 20, 1987, pursuant to a binding contract entered into after January 20, 1987, is in registered form if—
(i) The obligation is registered as to both principal and any stated interest with the issuer (or its agent) and transfer of the obligation may be effected only by surrender of the old instrument and either the reissuance by the issuer of the old instrument to the new holder or the issuance by the issuer of a new instrument to the new holder,
(ii) The right to the principal of, and stated interest on, the obligation may be transferred only through a book entry system maintained by the issuer (or its agent) (as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section), or
(iii) The obligation is registered as to both principal and any stated interest with the issuer (or its agent) and may be transferred through both of the methods described in subdivisions (i) and (ii).
(2)
Special rule for registration of a book entry obligation.
An obligation shall be considered transferable through a book entry system if the ownership of an interest in the obligation is required to be reflected in a book entry, whether or not physical securities are issued. A book entry is a record of ownership that identifies the owner of an interest in the obligation.
(d)
Effective date.
The provisions of this section shall apply to obligations issued after December 31, 1982, unless issued on an exercise of a warrant for the conversion of a convertible obligation if such warrant or obligation was offered or sold outside the United States without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and was issued before August 10, 1982.
(e)
Special rules.
The following special rules apply to obligations issued after January 20, 1987, pursuant to a binding contract entered into after January 20, 1987.
(1) An obligation that is not in registered form under paragraph (c) of this section is considered to be in bearer form.
(2) An obligation is not considered to be in registered form as of a particular time if it can be transferred at that time or at any time until its maturity by any means not described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(3) An obligation that as of a particular time is not considered to be in registered form by virtue of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (e) and that, during a period beginning with a later time and ending with the maturity of the obligation, can be transferred only by a means described in paragraph (c) of this section, is considered to be in
registered form at all times during such period.
(f)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
Municipality X publicly offers its general debt obligations to United States persons. The obligations have a maturity at issue exceeding 1 year. The obligations are registration-required obligations under § 5f.103-1(b). When individual A buys an obligation, X issues an obligation in A's name evidencing A's ownership of the principal and interest under the obligation. A can transfer the obligation only by surrendering the obligation to X and by X issuing a new instrument to the new holder. The obligation is issued in registered form.

# Example (2).
Municipality Y issues a single obligation on January 4, 1983 to Bank M provided that (i) Bank M will not at any time transfer any interest in the obligation to any person unless the transfer is recorded on Municipality Y's records (except by means of a transfer permitted in (ii) of this example) and (ii) interests in the obligation that are sold by Bank M (and any persons who acquire interests from M) will be reflected in book entries. C, an individual, buys an interest in Y's obligation from Bank M. Bank M receives the interest or principal payments with respect to C's interest in the obligation as agent for C. Bank M records interests in the Municipality Y obligation as agent of Municipality Y. Any transfer of C's interest must be reflected in a book entry in accordance with Bank M's agreement with Municipality Y. Since C's interest can only be transferred through a book entry system maintained by the issuer (or its agent), the obligation is considered issued in registered form. Interest received by C is excludable from gross income under section 103(a).

# Example (3).
Municipality Z wishes to sell its debt obligations having a maturity in excess of 1 year. The obligations are sold to Banks N, O, and P, all of which are located in Municipality Z. By their terms the obligations are freely transferable, although each of the banks has stated that it acquired the obligations for purposes of investment and not for resale. Obligations similar to the obligations sold by Municipality Z are traded in the market for municipal securities. The obligations issued by Municipality Z are of a type offered to the public and are therefore registration-required under § 5f.103-1 (b).

# Example (4).
Corporation A issues an obligation that is registered with the corporation as to both principal and any stated interest. Transfer may be effected by the surrender of the old instrument and either the reissuance by the issuer of the old instrument to the new holder or the issuance by the issuer of a new instrument to the new holder. The obligation can be converted into a form in which the right to the principal of, or stated interest on, the obligation may be effected by physical transfer of the obligation. Under § 5f.103-1 (c) and (e), the obligation is not considered to be in registered form and is considered to be in bearer form.

# Example (5).
Corporation B issues its obligations in a public offering in bearer definitive form. Beginning at X months after the issuance of the obligations, a purchaser (either the original purchaser or a purchaser in the secondary market) may deliver the definitive bond in bearer form to the issuer in exchange for a registration receipt evidencing a book entry record of the ownership of the obligation. The issuer maintains the book entry system. The purchaser identified in the book entry as the owner of record has the right to receive a definitive bearer obligation at any time. Under § 5f.103-1 (c) and (e), the obligation is not considered to be issued in registered form and is considered to be issued in bearer form. All purchasers of the obligation are considered to hold an obligation in bearer form.

# Example (6).
Corporation C issues obligations in bearer form. A foreign person purchases a definitive bearer obligation and then sells it to a United States person. At the time of the sale, the United States person delivers the bearer obligation to Corporation C and receives an obligation that is identical except that the obligation is registered as to both principal and any stated interest with the issuer or its agent and may be transferred at all times until its maturity only through a means described in § 5f.103-1(c). Under § 5f.103-1(e), the obligation is considered to be in registered form from the time it is delivered to Corporation C until its maturity.

(a)
Denial of deduction generally.
Interest paid or accrued on a registration-required obligation (as defined in

(b)
Registration-required obligation.
For purposes of this section, the term “registration-required obligation” means any obligation except any one of the following:
(1) An obligation issued by a natural person.
(2) An obligation not of a type offered to the public. The determination as to whether an obligation is not of a type offered to the public shall be based on whether similar obligations are in fact publicly offered or traded.
(3) An obligation that has a maturity at the date of issue of not more than 1 year.
(4) An obligation issued before January 1, 1983. An obligation first issued before January 1, 1983, shall not be considered to have been issued on or after such date merely as a result of the existence of a right on the part of the holder of such obligation to convert such obligation from registered form into bearer form, or as a result of the exercise of such a right.
(5) An obligation described in subparagraph (1) of paragraph (c) (relating to certain obligations issued to foreign persons).
(c) [Reserved]
(d)
Effective date.
The provisions of this section shall apply to obligations issued after December 31, 1982, unless issued on an exercise of a warrant for the conversion of a convertible obligation if such warrant or obligation was offered or sold outside the United States without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and was issued before August 10, 1982.
(e)
Obligations first issued after December 31, 1982, where the right exists for the holder to convert such obligation from registered form into bearer form.
[Reserved]
(f)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
All of the shares of Corporation X are owned by two individuals, A and B. X desires to sell all of its assets to Corporation Y, all of the shares of which are owned by individual C. Following the sale, Corporation X will be completely liquidated. As partial consideration for the Corporation X assets, Corporation Y delivers a promissory note to X, secured by a security interest and mortgage on the acquired assets. The note given by Y to X is not of a type offered to the public.

# Example (2).
Corporation Z has a credit agreement with Bank M pursuant to which Corporation Z may borrow amounts not exceeding $10X upon delivery of Z's note to Bank M. The note Z delivers to M is not of a type offered to the public.

# Example (3).
Individuals D and E operate a retail business through partnership DE. D wishes to loan partnership DE $5X. DE's note evidencing the loan from D is not of a type offered to the public.

# Example (4).
Individual F owns one-third of the shares of Corporation W. F makes a cash advance to W. W's note evidencing F's cash advance is not of a type offered to the public.

# Example (5).
Closely-held Corporation R places its convertible debentures with 30 individuals who are United States persons. The offering is not required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Similar debentures are publicly offered and traded. The obligations are not considered of a type not offered to the public.

# Example (6).
In 1980, Corporation V issued its bonds due in 1986 through an offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the bonds were initially issued in registered form, the terms of the bonds permit a holder, at his option, to convert a bond into bearer form at any time prior to maturity. Similarly, a person who holds a bond in bearer form may, at any time, have the bond converted into registered form.
(i) Assume G bought one of Corporation V's bonds upon the original issuance in 1980. In 1983, G requests that V convert the bond into bearer form. Except for the change from registered to bearer form, the terms of the bond are unchanged. The bond held by G is not considered issued after December 31, 1982, under § 5f.163-1(b)(4).
(ii) Assume H buys one of Corporation V's bonds in the secondary market in 1983. The bond H receives is in registered form, but H requests that V convert the obligation into bearer form. There is no other change in the terms of the instrument. The bond held by H is not considered issued after December 31, 1982, under § 5f.163-1(b)(4).
(iii) Assume the same facts as in (ii) except that in 1984 I purchases H's V Corporation bond, which is in bearer form. I requests V to convert the bond into registered form. There is no other change in the terms of the instrument. In 1985, I requests V to convert the bond back into bearer form. Again, there is
no other change in the terms of the instrument. The bond purchased by I is not considered issued after December 31, 1982, under § 5f.163-1(b)(4).

# Example (7).
Corporation U wishes to make a public offering of its debentures to United States persons. U issues a master note to Bank N. The terms of the note require that any person who acquires an interest in the note must have such interest reflected in a book entry. Bank N offers for sale interests in the Corporation U note. Ownership interests in the note are reflected on the books of Bank N. Corporation U's debenture is considered issued in registered form.

# Example (8).
Issuer S wishes to make a public offering of its debt obligations to United States persons. The obligations will have a maturity in excess of one year. On November 1, 1982, the closing on the debt offering occurs. At the closing, the net cash proceeds of the offering are delivered to S, and S delivers a master note to the underwriter of the offering. On January 2, 1983, S delivers the debt obligations to the purchasers in definitive form and the master note is cancelled. The obligations are not registration-required because they are considered issued before January 1, 1983.

# Example (9).
In July 1983, Corporation T sells an issue of debt obligations maturing in 1985 to the public in the United States. Three of the obligations of the issue are issued to J in bearer form. The balance of the obligations of the issue are issued in registered form. The terms of the registered and bearer obligations are identical. The obligations issued to J are of a type offered to the public and are registration-required obligations. Since the three obligations are issued in bearer form, T is subject to the tax imposed under section 4701 with respect to the three bearer obligations. In addition, interest paid or accrued on the three bearer obligations is not deductible by T. Moreover, since the issuance of the three bearer obligations is subject to tax under section 4701, J is not prohibited from deducting losses on the obligations under section 165(j) or from treating gain on the obligations as capital gain under section 1232(d). The balance of the obligations in the issue do not give rise to liability for the tax under section 4701, and the deductibility of interest on such obligations is not affected by section 163(f).

# Example (10).
Broker K acquires a bond issued in 1980 by the United States Treasury through the Bureau of Public Debt. Broker K sells interests in the bond to the public after December 31, 1982. A purchaser may acquire an interest in any interest payment falling due under the bond or an interest in the principal of the bond. The bond is held by Custodian L for the benefit of the persons acquiring these interests. On receipt of interest and principal payments under the bond, Custodian L transfers the amount received to the person whose ownership interest corresponds to the bond component giving rise to the payment. Under section 1232B, each bond component is treated as an obligation issued with original issue discount equal to the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity over the purchase price of the bond component. The interests sold by K are obligations of a type offered to the public. Further, the interests are, in accordance with section 1232B, considered issued after December 31, 1982. Accordingly, the interests are registration-required obligations under § 5f.163-1(b).

§ 6a.103A-1
Interest on mortgage subsidy bonds.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Mortgage subsidy bond.
A mortgage subsidy bond shall be treated as an obligation not described in section 103 (a)(1) or (a)(2). Thus, the interest on a mortgage subsidy bond is includable in gross income and subject to Federal income taxation.
(2)
Exceptions.
Any qualified mortgage bond and any qualified veterans' mortgage bond shall not be treated as a mortgage subsidy bond. See § 6a.103A-2 with respect to requirements of qualified mortgage bonds and § 6a.103A-3 with respect to requirements of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds.
(3)
Additional requirement.
In addition to the requirements of § 6a.103A-2, § 6a.103A-3, and this section, qualified mortgage bonds and qualified veterans' mortgage bonds shall be subject to the requirements of section 103(c) and the regulations thereunder.
(4)
Advance refunding.
On or after December 5, 1980, no tax-exempt obligation may be issued for the advance refunding of a mortgage subsidy bond (determined without regard to section 103A(b)(2) or § 6a.103A-1(a)(2)). An obligation issued for the refunding of a mortgage subsidy bond will be considered to be an advance refunding obligation if it is issued more than 180 days before the prior issue is discharged.
(5)
Registration.
Any obligation that is part of a qualified mortgage bond issue or qualified veterans' mortgage bond issue and which is issued after December 31, 1981, must be in registered form. The term “in registered form” has the same meaning as in § 1.6049-2(d). Thus, in general, an obligation is issued in registered form if it is registered as to both principal and interest and if its transfer must be effected by the surrender of the old instrument to the issuer and by either the reissuance of the old instrument to a new holder or the issuance of a new instrument to a new holder.

The term “proceeds” includes original proceeds and investment proceeds. The terms “original proceeds” and “investment proceeds” shall have the same meaning as in § 1.103-13(b)(2). Unless otherwise provided in § 6a.103A-2 or this section, however, amounts earned from the investment of proceeds which are derived from qualified mortgage bonds in nonmortgage investments may not be commingled for the purposes of accounting for expenditures with other non-bond amounts, and such proceeds are investment proceeds even though not treated as investment proceeds for purposes of section 103(c). Repayments of principal on mortgages shall be treated as proceeds of an issue. Amounts (such as State appropriations or surplus funds) which are provided by the issuer or a private lender in conjunction with a qualified mortgage bond or a qualified veterans' mortgage bond shall not be treated as proceeds of a mortgage subsidy bond under this section. However, fees which are paid by a participating financial institution pursuant to an agreement with the issuer whereby such institution receives the right to originate or service mortgages and which are retained by an issuer are treated as original proceeds of the issue. Amounts provided by the issuer or a private lender may be treated as proceeds of an issue for purposes of section 103(c).
(6)
Single-family and owner-occupied residences.
Except for purposes of § 6a.103A-2 (g) and (h)(2)(ii), the terms “single-family” and “owner-occupied,” when used with respect to residences, include two-, three-, and four-family residences—
(i) One unit of which is occupied by the owner of the units, and
(ii) Which were first occupied as a residence at least 5 years before the mortgage is executed.
[T.D. 7780, 46 FR 34314, July 1, 1981; 46 FR 37890, July 23, 1981, as amended by T.D. 7794, 46 FR 55514, Nov. 10, 1981]
§ 6a.103A-2
Qualified mortgage bond.

Qualified mortgage bond.
A qualified mortgage bond shall not be treated as a mortgage subsidy
bond, and the interest on a qualified mortgage bond will be exempt from Federal income taxation.
(2)
Termination date.
No obligation issued after December 31, 1987, shall be treated as part of a qualified mortgage bond issue.
(b)

(ii) An area of chronic economic distress.
(4)
Qualified census tract.
(i) The term “qualified census tract” means a census tract in which 70 percent or more of the families have an income which is 80 percent or less of the State-wide median family income.
(ii) The determination under subdivision (i) shall be made on the basis of the most recent decennial census for which data are available. With respect to any particular bond issue, such determination may be based upon the decennial census data available 3 months prior to the date of issuance and shall not be affected by official changes to such data during or after such 3-month period.
(iii) The term “census tract” means a census tract as defined by the Secretary of Commerce.
(5)
Areas of chronic economic distress.
(i) The term “area of chronic economic distress” means an area designated by a State as meeting the standards established by that State for purposes of this subparagraph and approved by the Secretary and by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in accordance with the criteria set forth in (iii) of this subparagraph. A State may withdraw such designation at any time, with reasonable cause. Such withdrawal shall be effective upon notification by the State to the Assistant Secretary for Housing/Federal Housing Commissioner of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Such withdrawal shall not affect the tax-exempt status of any outstanding issue of obligations.
(ii) For purposes of making a designation under this subparagraph, withdrawing a designation, or making any other submission, “State” means the governor of a State, or a State official commissioned by the governor or by State statute for such purposes.
(iii) The following criteria will be used in evaluating a proposed designation of an area of chronic economic distress:
(A) The condition of the housing stock, including the age of the housing and the number of abandoned and substandard residential units. Data pertinent to this criterion include the number and percentage of housing units that were constructed prior to 1940, the average age of the housing stock, the number and percentage of abandoned housing units, and the number and percentage of substandard residential units.
(B) The need of area residents for owner financing under a qualified mortgage bond issue as indicated by low per capita income, a high percentage of families in poverty, a high number of welfare recipients, and high unemployment rates.

Data pertinent to this criterion include the number and percentage of owner-occupied homes that are substandard, the number and percentage of families that are low- or moderate-income renters, and the number and percentage of substandard units in the area that will be improved through the use of owner financing provided by the proceeds of a qualified mortgage bond issue.
(D) The existence of a housing assistance plan which provides a displacement program and a public improvements and services program (similar to the Housing Assistance Plan (HAP) required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development under the Community Development Block Grant program (42 U.S.C. 5301
et seq.
)).
This determination shall be based upon the most recent data availabe. The certification described in subdivision (iv)(C) shall satisfy the criteria set forth in subdivisions (C) and (D). A certification described in (iv)(D) shall satisfy the criteria set forth in subdivisions (A) and (B):
Provided,
That the majority of the households in the proposed area have incomes less than 80 percent of the median income for the standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) in which the proposed area is located or, if the proposed area is not within a SMSA, less than 80 percent of the median income for the State.
(iv) A proposal by the State that an area be approved as an area of chronic economic distress shall contain the following information:
(A) A description of the proposed area by its geographical limits.
(B) Maps of the State and of areas within the State that are qualified census tracts and existing or proposed areas of chronic economic distress.
(C) Where applicable, a certification of the local Area Manager of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in which the proposed area is located that the proposed area is a Neighborhood Strategy Area (NSA) under 24 CFR 570.301(c) promulgated pursuant to the Community Development Block Grant program or an area comparable to a NSA which has been reviewed and approved by the Area Manager as meeting the standards for an NSA.
(D) Where applicable, a certification from the HUD Area Manager with jurisdiction over the proposed area that the proposed area is within a geographic area which has been declared eligible for grants under the Urban Development Action Grant Program, Pursuant to 24 CFR 570.452, by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
(E) Statistical and descriptive information pertinent to the criteria enumerated in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, and a succinct statement of how the information furnished satisfies those criteria. Such statistical information shall be based upon the most recent data available.
(F) If the State so desires, a written request for a conference prior to any adverse decision on the proposed designation.
(G) A certification by the Governor or designated official that the proposed designation conforms to these regulations.
(v) The proposed designation and the information furnished with it as required by subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph shall be submitted in triplicate to the Assistant Secretary for Housing/Federal Housing Commissioner of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (Attention: Office of State Agency and Bond Financed Programs, Rm. 6138, 451 7th Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20410).
(vi) Only those areas of chronic economic distress that have been previously designated by the State and approved in accordance with this subparagraph at least 3 months prior to the date of issuance need to be taken into account for any particular bond issue. Residences located in areas designated as areas of chronic economic distress approved in accordance with this subparagraph within such 3-month period or after the date of issue, however, may be treated as targeted area
residences. However, for purposes of paragraph (h)(2), relating to the specified portion of proceeds to be placed in targeted areas, and paragraph (i)(3)(ii)(A), relating to the 1
1/2
year temporary period, only areas approved as areas of chronic economic distress in accordance with this subparagraph at the time of issue may be taken into consideration.
(6)
Standard metropolitan statistical area.
A standard metropolitan statistical area (“SMSA”) is an area in and around a city of 50,000 inhabitants or more (or equivalent area) and defined by the Secretary of Commerce as an SMSA.
(7)
Statistical area.
The term “statistical area” means—
(i) An SMSA,
(ii) Any county (or portion thereof) which is not within an SMSA, or
(iii) If there is insufficient recent statistical information with respect to a county (or portion thereof) described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, such other area as may be designated by the Commissioner, upon proper application, as a substitute for such county (or portion thereof).
For purposes of subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, in Alaska, the entire State, and in Louisiana, a parish, shall be treated in a manner similar to a county.
(8)
Acquisition cost.
(i) The term “acquisition cost” means the cost of acquiring a residence from the seller as a completed residential unit. Acquisition cost includes the following:
(A) All amounts paid, either in cash or in kind, by the purchaser (or a related party or for the benefit of the purchaser) to the seller (or a related party or for the benefit of the seller) as consideration for the residence.
(B) If a residence is incomplete, the reasonable cost of completing the residence whether or not the cost of completing construction is to be financed with bond proceeds. For example, where a mortgagor purchases a building which is so incomplete that occupancy of the building is not permitted under local law, the acquisition cost includes the cost of completing the building so that occupancy of the building is permitted.
(C) Where a residence is purchased subject to a ground rent, the capitalized value of the ground rent. Such value shall be calculated using a discount rate equal to the yield on the issue (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(i)(2)(vi)).
(ii) The term “acquisition cost” does not include the following:
(A) The usual and reasonable settlement or financing costs. Settlement costs include titling and transfer costs, title insurance, survey fees, or other similar costs. Financing costs include credit reference fees, legal fees, appraisal expenses, “points” which are paid by the buyer (but not the seller, even though borne by the mortgagor through a higher purchase price) or other costs of financing the residence. However, such amounts will be excluded in determining acquisition cost only to the extent that the amounts do not exceed the usual and reasonable costs which would be paid by the buyer where financing is not provided through a qualified mortgage bond issue. For example, if the purchaser agrees to pay to the seller more than a pro rata share of property taxes, such excess shall be treated as part of the acquisition cost of a residence.
(B) The value of services performed by the mortgagor or members of the mortgagor's family in completing the residence. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the family of an individual shall include only the individual's brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half blood), spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants. For example, where the mortgagor builds a home alone or with the help of family members, the acquisition cost includes the cost of materials provided and work performed by subcontractors (whether or not related to the mortgagor) but does not include the imputed cost of any labor actually performed by the mortgagor or a member of the mortgagor's family in constructing the residence. Similarly, where the mortgagor purchases an incomplete residence the acquisition cost includes the cost of material and labor paid by the mortgagor to complete the residence but does not include the imputed value of the mortgagor's labor or the labor of the mortgagor's family in completing the residence.
(C) The cost of land which has been owned by the mortgagor for at least 2 years prior to the date on which construction of the residence begins.
(iii) The following examples illustrate the provisions of subparagraph (8):

# Example (1).
A contracts with B, a builder of single-family residences, for the purchase of a residence. Under the terms of the contract, B will deliver a residential unit to A that contains an uncompleted recreation room and an unfinished third floor and which lacks a garage. Normally, a completed recreation room, a finished third floor and a garage are provided as part of the residence built by B. The contract price for the residence is $58,000. At the same time, A contracts with C, an affiliate of B, to complete the recreation room and third floor and to construct the garage for a contract price of $10,000. C will perform this work after A receives title to the unit from B. Under § 6a.103A-2(b)(8)(i)(A), the acquisition cost of A's completed residential unit is $68,000, which represents the contract price of the residence plus the cost of completion of the recreation room and third floor and construction of the garage.

# Example (2).
E owns a single-family residence which E has listed for sale. D contracts to purchase E's residence, and the contract provides for a selling price of $30,000. D also agrees to pay an unsecured debt in the amount of $5,000, which E owes to X, a local bank. D further agrees to purchase from E the refrigerator, stove, washer, and dryer located in E's residence for $500. Such amount is equal to the fair market value of such personalty. D also agrees to purchase the light fixtures, curtain rods, and wall-to-wall carpeting for a fair market value price of $700. Under § 6a.103A-2(b)(8)(i)(A), the acquisition cost of D's completed residential unit is $35,700. Such amount includes the $5,000 unsecured debt paid off by D. The $500 paid for the refrigerator, stove, washer, and dryer are not included because such items are not included within the definition of a residence under § 6a.103A-2(d)(4). Such definition does include, however, the light fixtures, curtain rods, and wall-to-wall carpeting purchased by D.

# Example (3).
F contracts with G to purchase G's home for $40,000. After purchasing the residence, F pays a party unrelated to G $3,000 for painting, minor repairs, and refinishing the floors. Under § 6a.103A-2(b)(8)(i)(A), the acquisition cost of the residence is $40,000. Such fix-up expenses are not treated as part of the acquisition costs. If G had incurred such fix-up expenses, however, F may not reduce his acquisition cost of the residence by such amounts.
(9)
Qualified home improvement loan.
(i) The term “qualified home improvement loan” means the financing (whether or not secured by a mortgage), in an amount which does not exceed $15,000 with respect to any residence, of alterations, repairs, and improvements on, or in connection with, an existing single-family, owner-occupied residence by the owner thereof, but only if such items substantially protect or improve the basic livability or energy efficiency of the residence.
(ii) Alterations, repairs, or improvements that satisfy the requirement of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph include the renovation of plumbing or electric systems, the installation of improved heating or air conditioning systems, the addition of living space, or the renovation of a kitchen area. Items that will not be considered to substantially protect or improve the basic livability of the residence include swimming pools, tennis courts, saunas, or other recreational or entertainment facilities.
(iii) If—
(A) Two or more qualified home improvement loans are provided for the same residence, whether or not by the same lender, and
(B) Any person who had a present ownership interest in such residence at the time the previous qualified home improvement loan or loans were made has a present ownership interest in the residence at the time the subsequent qualified home improvement loan is made,
Then the allowable amount of the subsequent qualified home improvement loan shall be reduced by the amount, at origination, of any previous qualified home improvement loan, so that the sum of such loans does not exceed $15,000.
(iv) The following example illustrates the provisions of subparagraph (9):

# Example.
A and B jointly own a residence located in Town M. They obtain a qualified home improvement loan for $10,000 from Town M. A acquires B's interest in the residence. A applies to State X for a qualified home improvement loan. The maximum amount of a qualified home improvement loan which may be made by State X is $5,000, the amount that when added to the $10,000
previous loan from Town M does not exceed $15,000.
(10)
Qualified rehabilitation loans.
(i) The term “qualified rehabilitation loan” means any owner financing provided in connection with—
(A) A qualified rehabilitation, or
(B) The acquisition of a residence with respect to which there has been a qualified rehabilitation,
But only if the mortgagor to whom such financing is provided is the first resident of the residence after completion of the rehabilitation. Where there are two or more mortgagors of a rehabilitation loan, the first residency requirement is met if any of the mortgagors meets the first residency requirement.
(ii) The term “qualified rehabilitation” means any rehabilitation of a residence if—
(A) There is a period of at least 20 years between the date on which the building was first used and the date on which physical work on such rehabilitation begins,
(B) 75 percent or more of the existing external walls of such building are retained in place as external walls in the rehabilitation process, and
(C) The expenditures for such rehabilitation are 25 percent or more of the mortgagor's adjusted basis in the residence (including the land on which the residence is located).
(iii) For purposes of (A) and (B), the rules applicable to the investment tax credit for qualified rehabilitated buildings under section 48(g)(1) (A)(iii) and (B) shall apply. However, unlike section 48(g)(1)(B), once a building meets the 20-year test, more than one rehabilitation of that building within a 20-year period may qualify as a qualified rehabilitation.
(iv) The adjusted basis to the mortgagor is the mortgagor's adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain or loss on the sale or exchange of a capital asset (as defined in section 1221). The mortgagor's adjusted basis shall be determined as of the date of completion of the rehabilitation, or, if later, the date the mortgagor acquires the residence,
i.e.,
the date on which the mortgagor includes in basis any amounts expended for rehabilitation that are expended for capital assets.
(v) The amounts expended by the mortgagor for rehabilitation include all amounts expended for rehabilitation regardless of whether the amounts expended were financed from the proceeds of the loan or from other sources, and regardless of whether the expenditure is a capital expenditure, so long as the expenditure is made during the rehabilitation of the residence and is reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the residence. The value of services performed by the mortgagor or members of the mortgagor's family (as used in § 6a.103A-2(b)(8)(ii)(B)) in rehabilitating the residence will not be included in determining the rehabilitation expenditures for purposes of the 25-percent test.
(vi) Where a mortgagor purchases a residence that has been substantially rehabilitated, the 25-percent test is determined by comparing the total expenditures made by the seller for the rehabilitation of the residence with the acquisition cost of the residence to the mortgagor. The total expenditures made by the seller for rehabilitation do not include the cost of acquiring the building or land but do include all amounts directly expended by the seller in rehabilitating the building (excluding overhead and other indirect charges).
(c)
Good faith compliance efforts
—(1)
Mortgage eligibility requirements.
An issue of qualified mortgage bonds which fails to meet one or more of the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (j) of this section shall be treated as meeting such requirements if each of the following provisions is met.
(i) The issuer in good faith attempted to meet all such requirements before the mortgages were executed. Good faith requires that the trust indenture, participation agreements with loan originators, and other relevant instruments contain restrictions that permit the financing of mortgages only in accordance with such requirements. In addition, the issuer must establish reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with such requirements. Such procedures include reasonable investigations by the issuer or its agent to determine that the mortgages satisfy such requirements.
(ii) Ninety-five percent or more of the lendable proceeds (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(1)) that were devoted to owner financing were devoted to residences with respect to which, at the time the mortgages were executed or assumed, all such requirements were met. In determining whether the proceeds are devoted to owner financing which meets such requirements, the issuer may rely on an affidavit of the mortgagor that the property is located within the issuer's jurisdiction and an affidavit of the mortgagor and the seller that the requirements of § 6a.103A-2(f) are met. The issuer may also rely on his own or his agent's examination of copies of income tax returns which were filed with the Internal Revenue Service and which are provided by the mortgagor or obtained by the issuer or loan originator in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 301.6103(c)-1 which indicate that, during the preceding 3 years, the mortgagor did not claim deductions for taxes or interest on indebtness with respect to real property constituting his principal residence, in addition to an affidavit of the mortgagor that the requirements of § 6a.103A-2(e) are met. The mortgagor may also provide the issuer or his agent with an affidavit that the mortgagor was not required to file such return in accordance with section 6012 during one or all of the preceding 3 years. Where a particular mortgage fails to meet more than one of these requirements, the amount of the mortgage will be taken into account only once in determining whether the 95-percent requirement is met. However, all of the defects in the mortgage must be corrected pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
(iii) Any failure to meet such requirements is corrected within a reasonable period after such failure is discovered. For example, where a mortgage fails to meet one or more of such requirements those failures can be corrected by calling the nonqualifying mortgage or by replacing the nonqualifying mortgage with a qualifying mortgage.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

# Example (1).
State X issues obligations to be used to provide mortgages for owner-occupied residences. X contracts with bank M to originate and service the mortgages. The trust indenture and participation agreement require that the mortgages meet the mortgage eligibility requirements referred to in paragraph (c)(1). In addition, pursuant to procedures established by X, M obtains a signed affidavit from each applicant that the applicant intends to occupy the property as his or her principal residence within 60 days after the final closing and thereafter to maintain the property as his or her principal residence. Further, M obtains from each applicant copies certified by the Internal Revenue Service of the applicant's Federal tax returns for the preceding 3 years and examines each statement to determine whether the applicant has claimed a deduction for taxes on real property which was the applicant's principal residence pursuant to section 164(a)(1) or a deduction pursuant to section 163 for interest paid on a mortgage secured by real property which was the applicant's principal residence. Also in accordance with X's procedures, M obtains from each applicant a signed affidavit as to facts that are sufficient for M to determine whether the residence is located within X's jurisdiction and affidavits from the seller and the buyer that the purchase price and the new mortgage requirements have been met, and neither M nor X knows or has reason to believe that such affidavits are false. The mortgage instrument provides that the mortgage may not be assumed by another person unless X determines that the principal residence, 3-year, and purchase price requirements are met at the time of the assumption. These facts are sufficient evidence of the good faith of the issuer and meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i). Further, if 95 percent of the lendable proceeds are devoted to owner financing which according to these procedures meet the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (i), then the issue meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii).

# Example (2).
State Y issues obligations to be used to provide mortgages for owner-occupied residences. Y contracts with bank N to originate and service the mortgages. The trust indenture and participation agreement require that the mortgagor certify compliance with the requirements referred to in paragraph (c)(1). By itself, this certification is not sufficient evidence of the good faith of the issuer to meet the requirements referred to in paragraph (c)(1).

# Example (3).
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that M discovers through a verification procedure required by X that, at the time of closing, A fraudulently executed the residencey affidavit. Instead of occupying the property as a principal residence, A leased the property to B for one year. A did not use the property as his residence during the lease term. Thus, at the
time that A's mortgage was executed the residence failed to meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
More than 95 percent of the lendable proceeds of the issue were devoted to residences which met all the requirements referred to in paragraph (c)(1) at the time the mortgages were executed. Furthermore, pursuant to a provision in the mortgage instrument M called the loan. Any failures with respect to other mortgages are corrected by M. Based on these facts, the issue meets the requirements of subparagraph (c)(1).

# Example (4).
The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that the issuer requires copies of the applicant's signed tax returns that were filed with the Internal Revenue Service for the preceding 3 years but does not require that such returns be certified. If 95 percent of the lendable proceeds are devoted to owner financing which according to these procedures meet the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (i), then the issue meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii).
(2)
Nonmortgage eligibility requirements.
An issue of qualified mortgage bonds which fails to meet one or more of the requirements of paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section and § 6a.103A-1(a)(5) shall be treated as meeting such requirements if each of the following provisions is met.
(i) The issuer in good faith attempted to meet all such requirements. This good faith requirement will be met if all reasonable steps are taken by the issuer to ensure that the issue complies with these requirements.
(ii) Any failure to meet such requirements is due to inadvertent error, e.g., mathematical error, after taking reasonable steps to comply with such requirements.
(iii) The following examples illustrate the application of this subparagraph (2):

# Example (1).
City X issues obligations to finance owner-occupied residences. However, despite taking all reasonable steps to determine accurately the size of the market share limitation, as provided in paragraph (g)(3), the limit is exceeded because the amount of the mortgages originated in the area during the past 3 years is incorrectly computed as a result of mathematical error. Such facts are sufficient evidence of the good faith of the issuer to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2).

# Example (2).
City Y issues $25 million of bonds to finance single-family, owner-occupied homes. Attorney A gives an opinion that the bonds satisfy the arbitrage requirements of § 6a.103A-2(i) and § 6a.103A-1(a)(3). In fact, however, the legal conclusion reached by A is erroneous, and the bonds do not meet the requirements of § 6a.103A-2(i). The issue does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (c)(2) because the erroneous opinion does not constitute inadvertent error.
(d)
Residence requirements
—(1)
In general.
An issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if all of the residences for which owner financing is provided under the issue meet the requirements of this paragraph. A residence meets the requirements of this paragraph only if—
(i) It is a single-family residence (as defined in § 6a.103A-1(b)(6)) which, at the time the mortgage is executed or assumed, can reasonably be expected by the issuer to become the principal residence of the mortgagor within a reasonable time after the financing is provided; and
(ii) It is located within the jurisdiction of the authority issuing the obligation.
(2)
Affidavit.
The requirements of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph may normally be met if the mortgagor executes an affidavit of his intent to use the residence as his principal residence within a reasonable time (e.g., 60 days) after the financing is provided.
(3)
Principal residence.
Whether a residence is used as a principal residence depends upon all the facts and circumstances of each case, including the good faith of the mortgagor. A residence which is primarily intended to be used in a trade or business shall not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any use of a residence which does not qualify for a deduction allowable for certain expenses incurred in connection with the business use of a home under section 280A shall not be considered as a use in a trade or business. Except for certain owner-occupied residences described in paragraph (b)(6) of § 6a.103A-1, a residence more than 15 percent of the total area of which is reasonably expected to be used primarily in a trade or business does not satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph. Further, a residence used as an investment property or a recreational home does not satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph.
(4)
Residence.
(i) The term “residence” includes stock held by a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation (as those terms are defined in section 216(b) (1) and (2)). It does not include property such as an appliance, a piece of furniture, a radio, etc., which, under applicable local law, is not a fixture. The term also includes factory-made housing which is permanently fixed to real property. The determination of whether factory-made housing is permanently fixed to real property shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
(ii)
Land.
Land appurtenant to a residence shall be considered as part of the residence only if such land reasonably maintains the basic livability of the residence and does not provide, other than incidentally, a source of income to the mortgagor.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d):

# Example (1).
A contracts to purchase a new residence from B. Since B is unable to move from the residence until 1 month after the scheduled closing date, A agrees to lease the residence to B for 1 month at a rent equal to the fair rental value. A applies for a mortgage to be provided from the proceeds of a qualified mortgage bond. In light of all the facts and circumstances in the case, the fact that A temporarily leases the residence to B does not prevent the residence from being considered as property that can reasonably be expected to be used as A's principal residence within a reasonable period of time after financing is provided.

# Example (2).
C contracts to purchase a new residence located on 2 acres of land in city X. City X has a zoning regulation which prevents the subdividing of any lot in that part of the city for use as a private residence into parcels of less than 2 acres. In light of all the facts and circumstances in the case, the fact that the residence is located on 2 acres of land appurtenant to the residence does not prevent the entire property from being considered as property to be used by C as a residence.

# Example (3).
D contracts to purchase a new residence located on 40 acres of land that D intends to farm. Any financing provided for the purchase of that portion of the property intended to be farmed will not be considered as financing provided for an owner-occupied residence.
(e)
3-year requirement
—(1)
In general.
An issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if each of the mortgagors to whom owner financing is provided under the issue meets the requirements of this paragraph. A mortgagor meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the mortgagor had no present ownership interest in a principal residence at any time during the 3-year period prior to the date on which the mortgage is executed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the mortgagor's interest in the residence with respect to which the financing is being provided shall not be taken into account.
(2)
Exceptions.
Subparagraph (1) shall not apply with respect to—
(i) Any financing provided with respect to a targeted area residence (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(3)),
(ii) Any qualified home improvement loan (as defined in § 6a103A-2(b)(9)), and
(iii) Any qualified rehabilitation loan (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(10)).
(3)
Multiple mortgagors.
In the event that there is more than one mortgagor with respect to a particular residence, each of such mortgagors must meet the 3-year requirement. A person who is liable under a note secured by the mortgage but who does not have a present ownership interest in a residence subject to the mortgage need not meet the 3-year requirement. For example, where a parent of a home purchaser cosigns the note for a child but the parent takes no interest in the residence, it is not necessary that the parent meet the 3-year requirement since the parent is not a mortgagor of the residence.
(4)
Included interests.
Examples of interests which constitute present ownership interests are the following:
(i) A fee simple interest;
(ii) A joint tenancy, a tenancy in common, or tenancy by the entirety;
(iii) The interest of a tenant-shareholder in a cooperative;
(iv) A life estate;
(v) A land contract (
i.e.,
a contract pursuant to which possession and the benefits and burdens of ownership are transferred although legal title is not transferred until some later time); and
(vi) An interest held in trust for the mortgagor (whether or not created by the mortgagor) that would constitute a
present ownership interest if held directly by the mortgagor.
(5)
Excluded interests.
Examples of interests which do not constitute present ownership interests are the following:
(i) A remainder interest;
(ii) A lease with or without an option to purchase;
(iii) A mere expectancy to inherit an interest in a principal residence;
(iv) The interest that a purchaser of a residence acquires on the execution of a purchase contract; and
(v) An interest in other than a principal residence during the previous 3 years.
(f)
Purchase price requirements
—(1)
In general.
An issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the acquisition cost (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(8)) of each residence, other than a targeted area residence, for which owner financing is provided does not exceed 90 percent of the average area purchase price applicable to such residence. In the case of a targeted area residence (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(3)), the acquistion cost may not exceed 110 percent of the average area purchase price applicable to such residence.
(2)
Exception.
Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to any qualified home improvement loan (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(9)).
(3)
Average area purchase price.
The term “average area purchase price” means, with respect to any residence, the average purchase price of all single-family residences in the statistical area (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(7)) in which the residence being financed is located for the most recent 12-month period for which sufficient statistical information is available. The determination whether a particular residence meets the purchase price requirement shall be made as of the date on which the commitment to provide the financing is made or, if earlier, the date of purchase of the residence.
(4)
Special rules.
(i) In the case of a qualified rehabilitation loan, the requirements of this paragraph are met if the mortgagor's adjusted basis in the property as of the completion of the rehabilitation (including the cost of the rehabilitation) meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1). For this purpose, a rehabilitated residence is to be treated as a residence which has been previously occupied.
(ii) The determination of average area purchase price shall be made separately with respect to—
(A) Residences which have not been previously occupied;
(B) Residences which have been previously occupied; and
(C) One-family, two-family, three-family, and four-family residences.
(5)
Safe harbor limitation.
(i) For purposes of meeting the requirements of this paragraph, an issuer may rely upon average area purchase price limitations published by the Treasury Department for the statistical area in which a residence is located. These safe harbor limitations will be effective for the period stated at the time of publication. An issuer may use a limitation different from such safe harbor limitation for any statistical area (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(7)) for which the issuer has more accurate and comprehensive data.
(ii) The following example illustrates the application of subparagraph (5)(i):

# Example.
The average area purchase price safe harbor limitation for new single-family residences published by the Treasury Department for the second half of 1981 for the jurisdiction of governmental unit X is $41,500. However, on July 1, 1981, X determines that its average area purchase price for new single-family residences is actually $43,000. Such determination is based on a comprehensive survey of residential housing sales in the jurisdiction over the previous calendar year. The data accumulated are based on records maintained by the county clerk's office in X's jurisdiction, which enables X to compute average area purchase prices separately for new and used residences and for one-, two-, three-, and four-family residences. X cannot reasonably update such data more often than once a year. X may use average area purchase prices computed from these data for mortgages made from July 1, 1981, through June 30, 1982, rather than the safe harbor published by the Treasury Department.
(g)
Limitation on aggregate amount of qualified mortgage bonds issued during any calendar year
—(1)
In general.
An issue meets the requirements of this section only if the aggregate amount of bonds issued pursuant thereto, when added to the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of qualified mortgage bonds
previously issued by the issuing authority during the calendar year and (ii) the amount of qualified mortgage bonds which the issuing authority previously elected not to issue under section 25(c)(2)(A)(ii) and the regulations thereunder during the calendar year, does not exceed the applicable limit (“market limitation”) for such authority for such calendar year.
(2)
State housing finance agency.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the market limitation for any State housing finance agency for any calendar year shall be 50 percent of the State ceiling for such year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if any State has more than one housing finance agency all such agencies shall be treated as a single agency.
(3)
Other issuers.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(4), the market limitation for any issuing authority (other than a State housing finance agency) for any calendar year is an amount equal to that authority's proportionate share of 50 percent of the State ceiling amount for such calendar year. The proportionate share is an amount which bears the same ratio to 50 percent of the State ceiling for such year as—
(i) The average annual aggregate principal amount of mortgages executed during the immediately preceding 3 calendar years for single-family, owner-occupied residences located within the jurisdiction of such issuing authority, bears to
(ii) An average determined in the same way for the entire State.
(4)
Constitutional home rule city.
(i) In determining the market limitation for any constitutional home rule city (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), subparagraph (3) shall be applied by substituting “100 percent” for “50 percent.”
(ii) In a State with one or more constitutional home rule cities, in computing the market limitation for issuers other than constitutional home rule cities, the State ceiling amount for any calendar year shall be reduced by the aggregate market limitation for such year for all constitutional home rule cities in the State.
(5)
Overlapping jurisdictions.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, if an area is within the jurisdiction of two or more governmental units, such area shall be treated as only within the jurisdiction of the unit having jurisdiction over the smallest geographical area. However, the governmental unit with jurisdiction over the smallest geographical area may enter into a written agreement to allocate all or a designated portion of such overlapping area to the governmental unit having jurisdiction over the next smallest geographical area.
(ii) Where two governmental units have authority to issue mortgage subsidy bonds and both governmental units have jurisdiction over the identical geographical area, the aggregate principal amount of mortgages on residences located within that area shall be allocated to the governmental unit having broader sovereign powers.
(6)
State ceiling.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(6)(v), the State ceiling applicable to any State for any calendar year shall be the greater of—
(A) 9 percent of the average annual aggregate principal amount of mortgages executed during the immediately preceding 3 calendar years for single-family, owner-occupied residences located within the jurisdiction of such State, or
(B) $200,000,000.
Only single-family owner-occupied residences (without regard to the definition of such term under § 6a.103A-1(b)(6)) may be used in determining the market limitation regardless of whether or not residences with up to four family units are to be financed by the program. First and second mortgages or mortgages used to refinance an existing mortgage shall be used in making such determination. Liens, special assessments, and similar encumbrances may not be taken into consideration.
(ii) For mortgages on residences with more than one family unit, the full amount of the mortgage shall be applied toward the market limitation and not merely that portion allocable to the owner-occupied unit.
(iii) For purposes of determining the State ceiling amount applicable to any State for any calendar year an issuer may rely upon the State ceiling amount published by the Treasury Department for such calendar year. An
issuer may rely on a different State ceiling amount than such safe-harbor limitation where the issuer has made a more accurate and comprehensive determination of such amount.
(iv) The following example illustrates the application of subparagraphs (3) and (6) of this paragraph (g):

# Example.
Pursuant to the allocation rule provided in subparagraph (3), City Y determines that its maximum market limitation in 1981 is $15,000,000. This determination is based on records maintained by the county clerk's office from which data for the preceding 3 years have been accumulated by City Y as to the number of sales of single-family homes in City Y's jurisdiction, the purchase price in each such sales transaction, the number of such sales that were financed by mortgages and the volume of second mortgages and refinancing on previously purchased owner-occupied single-family residences. This information, combined with estimates made by City Y of the average mortgage-loan-to-purchase-price ratio and the ratio of sales of single-family, owner-occupied residences to all sales of single-family residences from a representative sample of sales transactions, enables Y to estimate the preceding 3 years' annual aggregate mortgage volume by using the following formula:
EC16OC91.001
where
v = The preceding 3 years' average annual aggregate volume of mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied residences in City Y,
u
i
= Number of sales of single-family residences,
w
i
= Average purchase price of all sales,
x
i
= Percent of all sales transactions that were financed with mortgages,
y
i
= Estimated average mortgage-loan-to-purchase-price ratio,
z
i
= Estimated percent of sales that were owner-occupied residences,
a
i
= Total volume of second mortgages and refinancing on previously purchased owner-occupied, single-family residences,
i = The annual period of calculation, and
t = The current year.
City Y determines its applicable limit for 1981 based on the following formula:
L = 0.5 (v/s) r, where
L = Market limitation for City Y for the current year,
s = The preceding 3 years' average annual aggregate volume of mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied residences in State X, and
r = Ceiling for State X (
i.e.,
r = the greater of .09s or $200,000,000).
City Y may use the Treasury estimate of s which will be published with the mortgage volume safe harbor limitation. City Y may rely on its determination of its market limitation for obligations issued during 1981.
(v)
Reduction in State ceiling.
If for any calendar year an issuer of mortgage credit certificates, as defined in section 25 and the regulations thereunder, fails to meet the requirements of section 25 (d)(2) and the regulations thereunder, relating to the limit on the aggregate amount of mortgage credit certificates that may be issued, the applicable State ceiling under paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section for the State in which the program operates will be reduced by 1.25 times the correction amount (as defined in section 25 (f)(2) and the regulations thereunder) with respect to that failure for the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Commissioner determines the correction amount with respect to that failure.
(7)
Excess obligations.
Where an issue of obligations when added to the aggregate amount of bonds issued by the same issuing authority in the same calendar year exceeds the market limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph (g), no portion of the issue will be treated as a qualified mortgage bond issue, and interest on such obligations shall be subject to Federal income taxation. However, previously issued qualified mortgage bond issues which met the market limitation at the time of their issuance will not cease to be qualified mortgage bond issues even though a subsequent issue causes the aggregate amount of obligations to exceed such limitation for a calendar year.
(8)
Transitional rule obligations.
In applying this paragraph (g) to any calendar year, there shall not be taken into account any bond which, by reason of section 1104 of the Mortgage Subsidy Bond Tax Act of 1980 (94 Stat. 2670) (relating to transitional rules), receives the same tax treatment as bonds issued on or before April 24, 1979.
(9)
Procedure for providing a different allocation.
(i) A State may, by law enacted after December 5, 1980, provide a different formula for allocating the
State ceiling amount among the governmental units in such State (other than constitutional home rule jurisdictions) having authority to issue qualified mortgage bonds.
(ii) The governor of any State may proclaim a different formula than provided in subparagraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) for allocating the State ceiling amount among the governmental units in such State having authority to issue qualified mortgage bonds. The authority of the governor to proclaim a different formula shall not apply after the earlier of—
(A) The 1st day of the 1st calendar year beginning after the 1st calendar year after 1980 during which the legislature of the State met in regular session, or
(B) The effective date of any State legislation dealing with such ceiling enacted after December 5, 1980.
If, on or before either date, the governor of any State exercises the authority to provide a different allocation, such allocation shall be effective until the date specified in (B).
(iii) Unless otherwise provided in a State constitutional amendment or by law changing the home rule provisions adopted in the manner provided by the State constitution, the allocation of that portion of the State ceiling which is allocated to any constitutional home rule city may not be changed by the governor or State legislature unless such city agrees to such different allocation.
(iv) Where a State elects to make a different allocation in accordance with subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph, the determination as to whether a particular bond issue meets the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section will be based upon the allocation in effect at the time such bonds were issued. Moreover, the authority to provide for a different allocation may not be used directly or indirectly to increase the State ceiling amount.
(v) An issuing authority located in a State with one or more constitutional home rule cities may use an alternative method to those provided in subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) for determining such issuing authority's market limitation if, prior to issuing any obligations for the calendar year, it demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that—
(A) The use of the methods provided in subparagraph (2), (3), or (4) would impose an unreasonable hardship on the issuing authority, and
(B) Such alternative method is reasonable.
(h)
Portion of loans required to be placed in targeted areas
—(1)
In general.
An issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if—
(i) The portion of the lendable proceeds (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(1)) of the issue specified in subparagraph (2) is made available for owner financing of targeted area residences (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(3)) for at least 1 year after the date on which owner financing is first made available with respect to targeted area residences, and
(ii) The issuer attempts with reasonable diligence to place such proceeds in qualified mortgages.
Proceeds are considered first made available with respect to targeted area residences on the date on which any financing of mortgages with the lendable proceeds of an issue first becomes available. Reasonable diligence requires that the issuer and the loan originators use reasonable efforts in trying to place mortgages in targeted areas, such as by advertising that mortgage funds are available for targeted areas. Reasonable diligence is not shown by merely providing in the governing instruments that the required amount be set aside for targeted areas.
(2)
Specified portion.
The specified portion of lendable proceeds of an issue required to be made available in targeted areas is the lesser of—
(i) 20 percent of the lendable proceeds, or
(ii) 40 percent of the average annual aggregate principal amount of mortgages executed during the immediately preceding 3 calendar years for single-family, owner-occupied residences in targeted areas within the jurisdiction of the issuing authority.
(3)
Safe harbor.
For purposes of computing the required portion of proceeds specified in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, where such provision is applicable, an issuer may rely upon the
amount produced by the following formula:
EC16OC91.002
where
P = Required portion to be made available in targeted areas,
X = Average annual aggregate principal amount of mortgages executed during the immediately preceding 3 calendar years for single-family, owner-occupied residences within the State in which the issuing jurisdiction is located,
Y = The total population within the State, based on the most recent decennial census for which data are available, and
Z = The total population in the targeted areas located within the issuer's jurisdiction, based on the most recent decennial census for which data are available.
The issuing jurisdiction may use the Treasury Department estimate of X which will be published with the mortgage volume safe harbor limitation.
(4)
Minimum amount.
(i) The specified portion required to be made available in targeted areas is a minimum amount. More than the minimum amount may be (but need not be) made available in targeted areas.
(ii) With respect to any proceeds not required to be made available in targeted areas, the requirements of this paragraph do not abrogate the requirement of the arbitrage rules that due diligence be used in placing lendable proceeds into mortgages.
(i)
Arbitrage and investment gain
—(1)
In general.
An issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if such issue meets the requirements of subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph. For purposes of these requirements, all determinations of yield, effective interest rates, and amounts required to be paid or credited to mortgagors under paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section shall be made on an actuarial basis taking into account the present value of money. The requirements of section 103A(i) and this paragraph are applicable in addition to the requirements of section 103(c) and §§ 1.103-13, 1.103-14, and 1.103-15.
(2)
Effective rate of mortgage interest not to exceed bond yield by more than 1 percentage point
—(i)
Maximum yield.
An issue of qualified mortgage bonds shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this subparagraph only if the excess of—
(A) The effective rate of interest on the mortgages financed by the issue, over
(B) The yield on the issue,
is not greater over the term of the issue than 1 percentage point.
(ii)
Effective rate of interest.
(A) In determining the effective rate of interest on any mortgage for purposes of this subparagraph, there shall be taken into account all fees, charges, and other amounts borne by the mortgagor which are attributable to the mortgage or to the bond issue. Such amounts include points, commitment fees, origination fees, servicing fees, and prepayment penalties paid by the mortgagor.
(B) Items that shall be treated as borne by the mortgagor and shall be taken into account in calculating the effective rate of interest also include—
(
1
) All points, commitment fees, origination fees, or similar charges borne by the seller of the property;
(
2
) The excess of any amounts received from any person other than the mortgagor by any person in connection with the acquisition of the mortgagor's interest in the property over the usual and reasonable costs incurred by a person acquiring like property where owner financing is not provided through the use of qualified mortgage bonds.
(C) The following items shall not be treated as borne by the mortgagor and shall not be taken into account in calculating the effective rate of interest:
(
1
) Any expected rebate of arbitrage profit (as required by § 6a.103A-2(i)(4)).
(
2
) Any application fee, survey fee, credit report fee, insurance fee or similar settlement or financing cost to the extent such amount does not exceed amounts charged in such area in cases where owner financing is not provided through the use of qualified mortgage bonds. For example, amounts paid for FHA, VA, or similar private mortgage insurance on an individual's mortgage need not be taken into account so long as such amounts do not exceed the amounts charged in the area with respect to a similar mortgage that is not financial with qualified mortgage bonds. Premiums charged for pool mortgage insurance will be considered
amounts in excess of the usual and reasonable amounts charged for insurance in cases where owner financing is not provided through the use of qualified mortgage bonds.
(D)(
1
) Where amounts other than those derived from the proceeds of a mortgage subsidy bond are used to finance single-family residences such amounts will not be treated as the proceeds of a qualified mortgage bond issue and will not be subject to the limitations set forth in subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph (i). Such amounts may, however, be treated as proceeds for purposes of the requirements of section 103(c) and the regulations thereunder. Thus, the portion of the mortgage pool financed by the proceeds of a qualified mortgage bond issue will be subject to the limitations of subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph (i), while the portion not provided with bond proceeds will not be subject to such limitations. The interest rate, points, origination fees, servicing fees, and other amounts charged with respect to that portion of a mortgage loan financed with non-bond amounts may not exceed the reasonable and customary amount which would be charged where financing is not provided through a qualified mortgage bond issue. Where the charge does exceed such reasonable and customary amount, any excess will be taken into account in computing the effective interest rate on the portion of the loan provided with the proceeds of the qualified mortgage bond issue. Furthermore, where such fees and other charges are less than the reasonable and customary charges, the issuer may not allocate that portion of the charges on the loan amounts made with bond proceeds which is equal to such differential to loan amounts made with non-bond proceeds.
(
2
) If any mortgage is allocated to two or more sources of funds, the receipt of amounts which are described in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section, repayments of principal, or payments of interest on such mortgage must be allocated to each source of funds.
(E) The effective rate of interest on any mortgage shall be determined in a manner consistent with actuarial methods and shall take into account the discounted value of all amounts from the time received to an amount equal to the “purchase price” of the mortgage. Such discount rate is the effective rate of interest on the mortgages. The “purchase price” of a mortgage means the net amount loaned to the mortgagor. For example, if a mortgage loan is in the amount of $30,000 and the mortgagor is charged one point ($300) as an origination fee which amount is deducted from loan proceeds available to the mortgagor, the purchase price is $29,700. If interest on an issue is paid semiannually, all regular monthly mortgage payments and prepayments of principal may be treated as being received at the end of each semiannual debt service period.
(
1
) If interest on an issue is paid semiannually, all regular monthly mortgage payments may be treated as being received at the end of each semiannual debt service period.
(
2
) Prepayments of principal shall be treated as being received on the last day of the month in which the issuer reasonably expects to receive such prepayments.
(F) The rate shall be determined on a composite basis for all mortgages financed by the issue.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrate the provisions of subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph:

# Example.
Purchaser A contracts with seller B, who is represented by real estate agent C, for the purchase of B's residence for $65,000. A applies to County X for a mortgage provided by the proceeds of a qualified mortgage bond. County X requires that agent C provide it with a principal residence affidavit as well as verify the purchase price of the residence and the location of the purchasers previous residences. Due to the increased administrative burden imposed on agent C by County X, C charges B a real estate commission of 8 percent ($5,200), rather than 6 percent ($3,900). The normal real estate commission is 6 percent. Since the 8 percent commission charged by C and paid by B is in excess of the usual and reasonable real estate commission where owner financing is not provided through the use of qualified mortgage bonds, 2 percent ($1,300) shall be treated as borne by A and taken into account in calculating the effective rate of interest on the mortgage.
(iv)
Prepayment assumption
In determining the affective rate of interest on
mortgages, it shall be assumed that the mortagage prepayment rate for mortgages made out of both original proceeds and mortgages that the issuer expects with reasonable certainty to be made out of prepayments of principal will be equal to 100 percent of the rate set forth in the most recent mortgage maturity experience table for mortgages having the same term insured under section 203 of the National Housing Act and published by the Federal Housing Administration in “Survivorship and Decrement Tables for HUD/FHA Home MORTGAGE Insurance Program” for the region, or, if available, the State in which the residence is located. For purposes of applying these tables, either the original balance method or the declining balance method of calculating mortgage loan prepayments may be used. For proceeds used to finance qualified home improvement loans or shorter term qualified rehabilitation loans for which there are no comparable FHA mortgage maturity experience tables, the assumption used by the issuer as to the rate of prepayment shall be based upon the reasonable expectations of the issuer, as reflected, where applicable, by the issuer's prior experience with such loans.
(v)
Net losses.
The projected net losses on the mortgage pool (after foreclosure and payment of insurance proceeds), based on the most recent default experience for the area in which the residences are located, shall be taken into consideration in calculating the effective rate of interest on the mortgages. However, where mortgages provided under an issue are insured with FHA, VA, or private mortgage insurance, in conjunction with pool mortgage insurance, the expected net losses will be presumed to be zero. In the event that the actual losses on the mortgage pool exceed the projected net losses which were taken into consideration in calculating the effective rate of interest on the mortgages, investment proceeds earned from nonmortgage assets may be used to recover the excess losses and need not be paid or credited to the mortgagors under § 6a.103A-2(i)(4).
(vi)
Yield on the issue.
(A) The yield on an issue of qualified mortgage bonds shall be calculated on the basis of—
(
1
) The issue price, and
(
2
) An expected maturity for the bonds which is consistent with the prepayment assumption required under subparagraph (2)(iv) of this paragraph.
The expected maturity will be considered consistent with such prepayment assumption if all prepayments are assumed to be used to call bonds proportionately (
i.e.,
a “strip” call). The preceding sentence shall not apply to prepayments of mortgages provided from original proceeds to the extent such prepayments are used to provide mortgages.
(B) For purposes of (
1
) of this subdivision (vi), the term “issue price” shall have the same meaning as in section 1232(b)(2). Thus, in general, such term means the initial offering price to the public, not including bond houses and brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters or wholesalers, at which price a substantial amount of such obligations were sold or, if privately placed, the price paid by the first buyer of such obligations or the acquisition cost of the first buyer.
(3)
Nonmortgage investments
—(i)
Maximum investment.
Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, an issue meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if—
(A) At no time during any bond year does the aggregate amount invested in nonmortgage investments, e.g., reasonably required reserve funds, with a yield materially higher than the yield on the issue exceed 150 percent of the debt service on the issue for the current bond year, and
(B) Such aggregate amount invested in nonmortgage assets with a yield materially higher than the yield on the issue is promptly and appropriately reduced as mortgages are repaid.
The amount subject to the maximum investment rule in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph includes the original bond proceeds, investment proceeds and repayments of principal on the mortgages. For purposes of subdivision (B), the amount described in subdivision (A) shall be considered promptly and appropriately reduced if beginning
in the first bond year after the expiration of the temporary period for original proceeds described in subdivision (ii)(A) of this subparagraph, such amount is reduced within 30 days of the beginning of each bond year by an amount equal to the difference between the average scheduled monthly mortgage receipts for the bond year (excluding any receipts that were scheduled with respect to mortgages that were discharged in the preceding bond year) and the average scheduled monthly mortgage receipts for the preceding bond year.
(ii)
Temporary periods.
Subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph shall not apply to—
(A) Proceeds (including prepayments of principal designated to be used to acquire additional mortgages) of the issue invested for an initial temporary period not to exceed 1 year (1
1/2
years for proceeds required to be set aside for placing mortgages in targeted areas) until such proceeds are needed for mortgages, and
(B) Repayments of principal and interest on mortgages that are contributed to a bona fide debt service fund (as defined in § 1.103-13(b)(12)) and invested for a 13-month temporary period as provided in § 1.103-14(b)(10).
(iii)
Debt service defined.
For purposes of subparagraph (3)(i)(A) of this paragraph, the debt service on the issue for any bond year is the scheduled amount of interest and amortization of principal payable for such year with respect to such issue. There shall not be taken into account amounts scheduled with respect to any bond which has been retired before the beginning of the bond year.
(iv)
Nonmortgage investments.
A nonmortgage investment is any investment other than an investment in a qualified mortgage. For example, a mortgage-secured certificate or obligation is a nonmortgage investment. Investment earnings from participation fees (described in § 6a.103A-1(b)(5)) are treated as investment proceeds on nonmortgage investments unless such fees are used to pay debt service or to finance owner occupied residences.
(v)
Bonds issued after June 30, 1993.
Section 1.148-2(f)(2)(iv) applies to bonds issued after June 30, 1993, in lieu of this paragraph (i)(3).
(4)
Arbitrage and investment gains to be used to reduce costs of owner financing
—(i)
Rebate requirement.
An issue shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this subparagraph only if an amount equal to the sum of:
(A) The excess of—
(
1
) The net amount earned on all nonmortgage investments pursuant to subparagraph (3)(i) and (ii) of this paragraph (other than investments attributable to an excess described in this subdivision (A)) over
(
2
) The amount which would have been earned if the investments were invested at a rate equal to the yield on the issue, plus
(B) Any income attributable to the excess described in subdivision (A),—
shall be paid or credited to the mortgagors as rapidly as practicable. Such amount may be disproportionately distributed to the mortgagors if the larger portion of such amount is distributed to lower income mortgagors. The determination of the excess described in subdivision (A) shall take into account any reinvestment of nonmortgage investment receipts and any gain or loss realized on the disposition of nonmortgage investments. In addition, where nonmortgage investments are retained by the issuer after retirement of an issue, any unrealized gains or losses as of the date of retirement of such issue must be taken into account, in calculating the amount to be rebated to the mortgagors. The amount described in subdivision (A)(

) is the amount that would have been earned if the investments in nonmortgage obligations were invested at a rate equal to the yield on the issue calculated in the same manner as provided in § 6a.103A-2(i)(2)(vi) and by using the same compounding method. For purposes of subdivision (B), any income attributable to the excess described in subdivision (A) shall be taken into account whether or not such income exceeds the yield on the bonds.
(ii)
Computation period.
Whether earnings are amounts described in subdivision (i) (A) or (B) of this subparagraph shall be determined by making computations on an annual basis. For example, if at the end of the first year
the earnings on nonmortgage investments exceed the amount that could have been earned if such investments were invested at the bond yield, the amount of earnings equal to such difference constitutes an excess described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph. In the following year, investment proceeds earned on such excess must be taken into account, whether or not such earnings exceed the yield on the bonds, and may not be treated as “negative arbitrage”.
(iii)
Paid or credited.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, amounts are paid or credited to mortgagors as rapidly as practicable if such amounts are paid or credited to such mortgagors at the time the mortgagor discharges the mortgage, for example, through prepayment of the entire principal amount or through making the last regular payment on the mortgage. The amount paid or credited to the mortgagors must have a present value at least equal to the present value of the amount described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, using the yield on the bonds as the discount rate. In the case of prepayments, the cumulative amount required to be rebated under subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph may be determined as of a date before the actual prepayment but not more than 1 year earlier than the date of prepayment. Except as provided in subparagraph (2)(v) or subparagraph (4)(iv) of this paragraph, such amount may not be subject to the claim of any party, e.g., a bondholder, and may not be paid over to any party other than the mortgagor or the United States.
(iv)
Reduction where issuer does not use full 1 percentage point.
(A) The amount required to be paid or credited to mortgagors under subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph shall be reduced by the amount which (if it were treated as an interest payment made by mortgagors) would result in the excess referred to in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph being equal to 1 percentage point. Such amount shall be fixed and determined as of the yield determination date. This fixed dollar amount may be received by the issuer at any time but may not be adjusted for the time of payment. Such fixed dollar amount shall be equal to the difference between the purchase price of mortgages financed by the proceeds of the issue and the present value of expected payments of principal and interest on such mortgages, using a discount rate equal to the bond yield plus 1 percentage point.
(B) The following example illustrates the provisions of subparagraph (4)(iv)(A) of this paragraph:

# Example.
In 1981, County X issues obligations to provide mortgages for owner-occupied residences. The yield paid on the obligations is 10 percent, and the effective rate of interest on the mortgages provided by the proceeds of such obligations is 9.75 percent. X maintains a reasonably required reserve fund which is invested at 15 percent and intends to recover that additional amount computed in the manner described in subparagraph (4)(iv) which could have been earned from investment of the proceeds in mortgages with an effective interest rate of 11 percent from the arbitrage earned from the reserve fund nonmortgage assets. X plans to recover such amount from the arbitrage over a period of 3 years; thus, X will not recover such amount until 1984. X may not adjust the amount to be received to account for the time when such amount will be received.
(v)
Election to pay United States.
Subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph shall be satisfied with respect to any issue if the issuer elects in writing before issuing the obligations to pay over to the United States—
(A) Not less frequently than once each 5 years after the date of issue, an amount equal to 90 percent of the aggregate amount described in subdivision (i) earned during such period (and not theretofore paid to the United States), and
(B) Not later than 30 days after the redemption of the last obligation, 100 percent of such aggregate amount not theretofore paid to the United States.
(j)
New mortgages
—(1)
In general.
An issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if no part of the proceeds of such issue is to be used to acquire or replace an existing mortgage. All of the lendable proceeds must be used to provide mortgage loans to persons who did not have a mortgage (whether or not paid off) on the residence securing the mortgage note at any time prior to the execution of the mortgage.
(2)
Exceptions.
For purposes of this paragraph, the replacement of—
(i) Construction period loans,
(ii) Bridge loans or similar temporary initial financing, and
(iii) In the case of a qualified rehabilitation, an existing mortgage,
shall not be treated as the acquisition or replacement of an existing mortgage. Generally, temporary initial financing is any financing which has a term of 24 months or less.
(3)
Assumptions.
An issue meets the requirement of this paragraph only if a mortgage with respect to which owner financing has been provided under such issue may be assumed only if the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section are met with respect to such assumption. The determination of whether these requirements are met is based upon the facts as they exist at the time of the assumption as if the loan were being made for the first time. For example, the purchase price requirement is to be determined by reference to the average area purchase price at the time of the assumption and not when the mortgage was originally placed. If the bond documents and relevant mortgage instruments provide that a mortgage may be assumed only if the issuer has determined that the conditions stated in this subparagraph are satisfied, the good faith and 95-percent requirements of paragraph (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section will be considered satisfied with respect to the requirements of this subparagraph at the time the mortgages were executed. However, any failure to meet the requirements of this subparagraph at the time a mortgage is assumed is subject to the remedy requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (j):

# Example (1).
In June 1981 mortgagor A obtained a mortgage from a private lending institution in order to construct a house on land which A purchased without a mortgage in May 1981. In January 1982 A applies to obtain permanent financing on the residence from a program sponsored by State housing finance agency Y. Such program is funded with the proceeds of qualified mortgage bonds. If A meets the other requirements of this section, A qualifies for such permanent financing since the replacing of construction financing is not treated as the acquisition or replacement of an existing mortgage.

# Example (2).
In June 1981 mortgagor B purchased a new residence in a targeted area but was unable to sell his former residence. Therefore, B obtained temporary financing for his new residence until his former residence was sold. In October 1981 B applies to County Z to obtain financing from a program funded with proceeds of qualified mortgage bonds. Such financing is needed by B to replace the temporary financing for his new residence. If B meets the other requirements of this section, the mortgage qualifies for such permanent financing since the permanent financing replaces temporary initial financing.

# Example (3).
In 1979 mortgagor C purchased a residence but was unable to obtain financing from a program sponsored by County W because such program prohibited loans from the program which were in excess of 80 percent of the fair market value of the property. Therefore, in 1979 C obtained financing from a private lending institution with the intention of refinancing when he accumulated sufficient equity in the property. In 1981 C has accumulated sufficient equity in the property so as to comply with the requirements of the program. C applies to County W to refinance under the program, which is funded with the proceeds of qualified mortgage bonds. Even if C met the other requirements of this section, the mortgage would fail to meet the requirement of paragraph (j) since such a mortgage would replace an existing mortgage.

# Example (4).
In 1969 mortgagor D purchased a residence and obtained financing from a private lending institution. In 1981 D applies to County U for a loan for the rehabilitation of the property and for the refinancing of the existing mortgage. The program is funded with qualified mortgage bonds. If D meets the other requirements of this section the mortgage qualifies for such permanent financing since the replacement of the mortgage is not treated as the replacement or acquisition of an existing mortgage.

# Example (5).
In 1950 mortgagor E purchased a residence, obtaining a mortgage from a private lending institution to finance the purchase price. In 1980 E completed repaying the mortgage. In 1981 E applies for a loan from a program sponsored by State housing finance agency X and funded with the proceeds of qualified mortgage bonds. The mortgage does not meet the requirements of paragraph (j) since E had a previous mortgage on his residence, even though such mortgage was previously released.

(ii) Substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be used to provide financing for qualified veterans; and
(iii) Payment of the principal and interest on which is secured by a pledge of the full faith and credit of the issuing State.
A qualified veterans' mortgage bond does not include any bond that is an industrial development bond under section 103(b).
(c)
Qualified veteran.
(1) An issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if each of the mortgagors to whom owner financing is provided is a qualified veteran.
(2) With respect to obligations issued prior to July 19, 1984, the term “qualified veteran” means any veteran.
(3) With respect to obligations issued after July 18, 1984, the term “qualified veteran” means any veteran who—
(i) Served on active duty at some time before January 1, 1977, and
(ii) Applied for financing before the later of—

(d)
Husband and wife.

The alterations, repairs, and improvements, however, must substantially protect or improve the basic livability or energy efficiency of the property, such as the renovation of
plumbing or electric systems, the installation of improved heating or air conditioning systems, the addition of living space, or the renovation of a kitchen area. Items that will not be considered to substantially protect or improve the basic livability of the property include swimming pools, tennis courts, saunas, or other recreational or entertainment facilities.
(g)
Volume limitation
—(1)
In general.
In the case of obligations issued after June 22, 1984, an issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the aggregate amount of obligations issued pursuant thereto, when added to the aggregate amount of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds previously issued by the State during the calendar year, does not exceed the State veterans limit for such calendar year. In determining the aggregate amount of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued in calendar year 1984, obligations issued prior to June 23, 1984, shall not be taken into account.
(2)
State veterans limit.
(i) The State veterans limit for any State is the amount equal to—
(A) The aggregate amount of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued by the State during the period beginning on January 1, 1979, and ending on June 22, 1984 (not including the amount of any qualified veterans' mortgage bonds actually issued during the calendar year, or the applicable portion of 1984, in such period for which the amount of such bonds was the lowest), divided by
(B) The number (not to exceed 5) of calendar years after 1978 and before 1985 during which the State issued qualified veterans' mortgage bonds.
In determining the number of calendar years after 1978 and before 1985 during which the State issued qualified veterans' mortgage bonds, any qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued after June 22, 1984, shall not be taken into account. A State that did not issue qualified veterans' mortgage bonds during the period beginning on January 1, 1979, and ending on June 22, 1984, may not issue qualified veterans' mortgage bonds after June 22, 1984.
(ii) In the case of any obligation which has a term of 1 year or less and which was issued to provide financing for property taxes, the amount taken into account under this paragraph with respect to such obligation shall be
1/15
of its principal amount.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph:

# Example (1).
State R issued the following issues of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds: a $200 million issue on March 31, 1979, a $150 million issue on May 1, 1980, a $75 million issue on September 1, 1981, a $200 million issue on June 5, 1982, a $125 million issue on March 1, 1983, a $60 million issue on April 1, 1984, and a $100 million issue on September 1, 1984. R issued no other issues of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds during the period beginning January 1, 1979, and ending on December 31, 1984. The aggregate amount of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued during the period January 1, 1984, through June 22, 1984 ($60 million), is not taken into account in determining R's State veterans limit because that is the lowest aggregate amount of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued during the calendar year or the applicable portion of 1984, in the period beginning on January 1, 1979, and ending on June 22, 1984. Thus, R's State veterans limit is $150 million ($750 million (which is the sum of $200 million, $150 million, $75 million, $200 million, and $125 million) divided by 5). The September 1, 1984, issue is not included in determinig the State veterans limit because that issue was issued after June 22, 1984. The September 1, 1984, issue of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds meets the requirements of § 6a.103A-3 (g) since the aggregate amount of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued in calendar year 1984 (not including obligations issued prior to June 23, 1984), does not exceed the State veterans limit.

# Example (2).
State S issued a $100 million issue of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds on March 31, 1984. S issued no other issues of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds during the period beginning on January 1, 1979, and ending on June 22, 1984. The aggregate amount of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued in the calendar year, or the applicable portion of 1984, in the period January 1, 1979, through June 22, 1984, for which the amount of bonds was the lowest is zero. Thus, the State veterans limit for S is $100 million (($100 million minus $0) divided by 1).
(h)
Good faith compliance efforts
—(1)
Mortgage eligibility requirements.
An issue of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued after July 18, 1984, which fails to meet the requirements of section 103A(o)(1), § 6a.103A-2(d) relating to residence requirements), and § 6a.103A-2(j) (1) and (2) (relating to new
mortgage requirements) shall be treated as meeting such requirements if each of the following provisions is complied with:
(i) The issuer in good faith attempted to meet all such requirements before the mortgages were executed. Good faith requires that the trust indenture, participation agreements with loan originators, and other relevant instruments contain restrictions that permit the financing of residences only in accordance with such requirements. In addition, the issuer must establish reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with such requirements. Such procedures include reasonable investigations by the issuer to satisfy such requirements.
(ii) Ninety-five percent or more of the lendable proceeds (as defined in § 6a.103A-2(b)(1)) that were devoted to owner-financing were devoted to residences with respect to which, at the time the mortgages were executed, all such requirements were met. In determining whether a person is a qualified veteran the issuer may rely on copies of the mortgagor's certificate of discharge indicating that the mortgagor served on active duty at some time before January 1, 1977, and stating the date on which the mortgagor left active service provided that neither the issuer nor its agent knows or has reason to believe that such affidavit is false. Where a particular mortgage fails to meet more than one of these requirements, the amount of the mortgage will be taken into account only once in determining whether the 95-percent requirement is met. However, all of the defects in the mortgage must be corrected pursuant to subdivision (iii).
(iii) Any failure to meet such requirements is corrected within a reasonable period after such failure is discovered. For example, failures can be corrected by calling the nonqualifying mortgage or by replacing the nonqualifying mortgage with a qualifying mortgage.
(2)
Nonmortgage eligibility requirements.
An issue of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued after July 18, 1984, which fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section shall be treated as meeting such requirements if each of the requirements of § 6a.103A-2(c)(2) (i) and (ii) is met.
(98 Stat. 901(26 U.S.C. 103A(j) (3) and (4)); 68A Stat. 917 (26 U.S.C. 7805))
[T.D. 7780, 46 FR 34314, July 1, 1981; 46 FR 37890, July 23, 1981, as amended by T.D. 7995, 49 FR 48297, Dec. 12, 1984]
§ 6a.6652(g)-1
Failure to make return or furnish statement required under section 6039C.
(a)
Amount imposed.
In the case of each failure to meet the requirements of—
(1) Section 6039C, relating to information returns with respect to United States real property interests, or
(2) Section 6039C(b)(3), relating to statements to be provided to substantial investors in United States real property interests,
on or before the date prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), the person failing to meet such requirement shall pay $25 for each day during which such failure continues.
(b)
Limitation
—(1)
Domestic corporations and nominees.
The maximum penalty which may be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section on a domestic corporation or nominee for failure to meet the requirements of section 6039C(a) for any calendar year is $25,000.
(2)
Partnerships, trusts, estates and foreign corporations.
The maximum penalty which may be imposed on a partnership, trust, estate or foreign corporation for failure to meet the requirements of section 6039C(b) for any calendar year is $25,000.
(3)
Foreign persons holding U.S. real property interests and nominees.
The maximum penalty which may be imposed on a foreign person holding a U.S. real property interest or on a nominee holding a U.S. real property interest for a foreign person for failure to meet the requirements of section 6039C(c) for any calendar year is the lesser of $25,000 or 5 percent of the aggregate of the fair market value of the U.S. real property interests owned by such person at any time during such calendar year.
(c)
Definitions
—(1)
Fair market value.
The term “fair market value” as used
in this section is defined in § 6a.897-1 (in the
Federal Register
47 FR 41541, Sept. 21, 1982).
(2)
Failure.
The term “failure to meet the requirements of section 6039C” includes the failure to file a return for any calendar year on the date prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for such filing), or the omission on a return of one or more items of information required by section 6039C and the regulations thereunder to be provided on the return. It also includes the failure to furnish a statement required by section 6039C(b)(3). The failure to furnish a return required under section 6039C(b)(1) and the failure to furnish a statement to a substantial investor as required by section 6039C(b)(3), are separate failures for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section. Also, each failure to provide a statement to each substantial investor is a separate failure for purposes of paragraph (a). Thus, if an entity has 100 substantial investors as defined in section 6039C and fails to furnish any of the required statements to substantial investors, there are 100 separate failures to furnish the required statement.
(3)
Aggregate of the fair market value of the United States real property interests.
The “aggregate of the fair market value of the U.S. real property interests” is the total of the fair market values of each U.S. real property interest owned at any time during the calendar year. Fair market value is determined as of December 31 of such year for property held at the end of the year and on the date of disposition for property disposed of during the year.
(d)
Attribution of ownership.
For purposes of calculating the penalty limitation under § 6a.6652(g)-1(b)(3) with respect to failure to meet the requirements of section 6039C(c), U.S. real property interests held by a partnership, trust, or estate shall be treated as owned proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries.
(e)
Exceptions
—(1)
Provision of security.
If a person otherwise required by section 6039C to file a return for a calendar year or furnish a statement to a substantial investor complies with the requirements of § 6a.6039C-5 relating to furnishing security in lieu of filing such return, or is exempt, by virtue of § 6a.6039C-5(f), from filing a return for such year with respect to its U.S. real property interests held, no penalty will be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section for failure to file such return or furnish such statement.
(2)
Showing of reasonable cause.
No amount shall be imposed under paragraph (a) of this section for a failure described in such paragraph if it is established to the satisfaction of the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center, 11601 Roosevelt Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19155 or in the case of returns concerning the Virgin Islands, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Tax Division, Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, V.I. 00801, that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. An affirmative showing of reasonable cause must be made in the form of a written statement, made under the penalties of perjury, containing a declaration by the person failing to make a return or furnish a statement under section 6039C setting forth all the facts alleged as reasonable cause. Whether reasonable cause is shown may depend upon the subsection of section 6039C under which the failure occurs. However, the fact that stock of a foreign corporation, or any other interest in any entity to which this section applies, is registered in bearer form does not constitute reasonable cause under this paragraph (e)(2) of this section for failure to comply with the requirements of section 6039C(b). Also, the fact that disclosure of ownership would contravene a secrecy law of any country does not constitute reasonable cause for failure to comply with the requirements of section 6039C(b). Where a return has been filed and there is an omission of one or more items of information required by section 6039C and the regulations thereunder, one of the facts to be considered in determining whether such failure is due to reasonable cause is the materiality of the item omitted.
(3)
Spouse or parent already filed with respect to same property.
If an individual files a return with respect to all U.S. real property interests held by such individual in accordance with § 6a.6039C-4(b), no penalty shall be imposed under
this section on such individual's spouse or minor child for failure to file a return under § 6a.6039C-4 with respect to the same property.
(f)
Manner of payment.
The amount imposed under paragraph (a) of this section on any person shall be paid in the same manner as tax upon the issuance of a notice and demand therefor.
(g)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
Domestic corporation X is required under section 6039C (a) to make a return for calendar year 1982. X does not file such return on or before May 15, 1983 as required under § 6a.6039C-1(c). The failure to file the return for calendar year 1982 continues throughout calendar years 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986. The failure to file is not due to reasonable cause and no security has been furnished in lieu of filing. The maximum penalty which can be imposed on X for failure to file the 1982 return is $25,000, determined as follows:
Penalty incurred in given year
Cumulative penalty for failure to file 1982 return
Total penalty incurred in 1983 ($25 per day × 230 days)
$5,750
$5,750
Total penalty incurred in 1984 (a leap year): ($25 per day × 366 days)

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that X also fails to file a return under section 6039C (a) for calendar year 1983. The failure to file its return for calendar year 1983 continues throughout calendar years 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. The total penalty which may be imposed on X for failure to file its return for calendar year 1983 is $25,000. The amount of penalty which can be imposed on X in calendar years 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 is determined as follows:
Penalty for 1982 failure
Penalty for 1983 failure
Total penalty for given year
Penalty incurred in 1984 (a leap year):
For failure to file 1982 return ($25 per day × 366 days)
$9,150
For failure to file 1983 return ($25 per day × 230 days)
$5,750
Total
$14,900
Penalty incurred in 1985:
For failure to file 1982 return ($25 per day × 365 days)
9,125
For failure to file 1983 return ($25 per day × 365 days)
9,125
Total
18,250
Penalty incurred in 1986:
For failure to file 1982 return (lesser of $25 per day × 365 days or $975 (remaining penalty which may be imposed))
975
For failure to file 1983 return ($25 per day × 365 days)
9,125
Total
10,100
Penalty incurred in 1987: For failure to file 1983 return (lesser of $25 per day × 365 days or $1,000 (remaining penalty which may be imposed))
1,000
Total
1,000

# Example (3).
Foreign corporation Y is required under section 6039C(b)(1) to make a return for calendar year 1982. In addition, Y is required under section 6039C(b)(3) to furnish statements to each substantial investor in U.S. real property interests. Y has 10 such substantial investors. Y does not file such return on or before May 15, 1983 as required under § 6a.6039C-1(c), nor does it furnish the required statements on or before January 31, 1983 as required under § 6a.6039C-3(h). The failure to file the return for calendar year 1982 and to furnish the required statements for 1982 continues throughout calendar years 1984 and 1985. The failure to meet the requirements of section 6039C(b) are not due to reasonable cause and no security has been furnished in lieu of filing. The total penalty which can be imposed on Y for failure to file the return and statements required under section 6039C(b) for calendar year 1982 is $25,000. The amount of penalty incurred by Y in calendar year 1983 for failure to file the return and statements for calendar year 1982 is $25,000, determined as follows:
Penalty incurred in 1982:
For failure to file return ($25 per day × 230 days)
$5,750
For each failure to furnish a statement required by section 6039C(b)(3) ($25 per day × 10 statements × the 334 days from February 1, 1983 to December 31, 1983 ($83,500) but not more than $19,250 (which when added to $5,750 would total $25,000))
19,250
Total
25,000
Since Y has incurred the maximum penalty for failure to file its return and statements required for 1982 by the end of calendar year 1983, no further penalty for these failures is imposed.

# Example (4).
Under section 6039C(c) foreign person Y is required to make a return for calendar year 1982. Y does not file such return on May 15, 1983 and the failure is not due to reasonable cause. No security has been furnished in lieu of filing. All properties owned by Y in 1982 are U.S. real property interests. Y purchased property M in January 1982 when its fair market value was $10,000. In March, Y purchased property N when its fair market value was $15,000. In November, Y sold property M for $20,000. The fair market value of property N on December 31, 1982, was $20,000. The total of the fair market values of M and N (M as of the date of its sale and N as of December 31, 1982) is $40,000. The maximum penalty which may be imposed on Y for failure to meet the requirements of section 6093C(c) for any calendar year is the lesser of $25,000 or 5 percent of the aggregate of the fair market values of the U.S. real property interests owned by Y at any time during such calendar year. Since $2,000 (5 percent of $40,000) is less than $5,750 ($25 times 230 days, the number of days in calendar year 1983 for which the failure continues), the maximum penalty which may be imposed on Y in 1983 is $2,000. Since the maximum penalty for the failure to file the 1982 return is incurred in 1983, no amount may be imposed for Y's continuing failure to file the return for calendar year 1982 during calendar years after 1983.

§ 7.48-1
Election to have investment credit for movie and television films determined in accordance with previous litigation.
(a)
Generally.
Under section 804(c)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-455, 90 Stat. 1595), any taxpayer who filed an action in any court of competent jurisdiction before January 1, 1976, for a determination of such taxpayer's rights to investment credit under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 with respect to any film placed in service in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1975, may elect to have investment credit on all films placed in service in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975, (except those subject to an election under section 804(e)(2) of the Act), determined as though section 804 of the Act (except section 804(c)(3) of the Act) had not been enacted.
(b)
Manner of making the election.
The election allowed by section 804(c)(3) of the Act may be made by a notification in the form of a letter signed by the taxpayer or an authorized representative of the taxpayer stating:
(1) The taxpayer's name, address, and identification number;
(2) The taxable years in which the films were placed in service with respect to which the election shall apply; and
(3) The court in which the litigation was commenced and information adequate to identify the particular litigation, for example, the names of the litigants, the date the suit was commenced, and the court case or docket number of the litigation.
The letter should be sent to the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: CC:RL:Br2, Room 4617, 1111 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20224.
(c)
Time for making the election.
The election under section 804(c)(3) of the Act must be made not later than January 3, 1977. If mailed, the cover containing the notification of such election must be postmarked not later than January 3, 1977.
(d)
Revocation of election.
An election under section 804(c)(3) of the Act, once made, shall be irrevocable.
[T.D. 7449, 41 FR 56629, Dec. 29, 1976]
§ 7.48-2
Election of forty-percent method of determining investment credit for movie and television films placed in service in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1975.
(a)
General rule.
Under section 804(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 1595), taxpayers who placed movie or television films (here- inafter referred to as films and tapes) in service during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975, may elect to have their investment credit on all such films and tapes determined under section 46(c) of the Code using an amount equal to 40 percent of aggregate production costs in lieu of the basis of such property. If the election is made, 100 percent is the applicable percentage used in determining qualified investment under section 46(c) of the Code regardless of actual useful life. The election can be made only with respect to qualified films and tapes that are new section 38 property and the investment credit is allowed only to the extent that a taxpayer has an ownership interest in the film or tape. No investment credit is allowed under section 804(c)(2) of the Act on any film or tape that is not section 38 property or that was produced and shown exclusively outside of the United States. Thus, no election may be made under this section with respect to a film or tape which is suspension period property to which section 48(h) applies or to a film or tape which is termination period property to which section 49(a) applies. Any investment credit taken on any film or tape subject to the election is not subject to recapture because of an early disposition or because a film or tape otherwise ceases to be section 38 property under section 47(a) of the Code. Thus, there will be no recapture because a film or tape is used outside the United States under section 48(a)(2) of the Code or section 804(c)(1)(C) of the Act, or because of any disposition under section 47(a)(7)(B) of the Code.
(b)
Time and manner of making an election
—(1)
Time for making the election.
The election under section 804(c)(2) of the Act must be made not later than April 25, 1977.
(2)
Manner of making the election.
An election under this section must be made by filing amended income tax returns for each taxable year beginning before January 1, 1975, in which films and tapes subject to the election were placed in service, together with a statement signed by the taxpayer containing the information described below. The amended returns and the statement must be filed with the district director having audit jurisdiction over the last return filed to which the election relates. Each amended return shall contain a schedule listing by name all films and tapes placed in service during the year to which the amended return relates and setting forth all computations necessary to determine the aggregate production costs of each such film or tape listed and the ownership interest of the taxpayer in each film or tape listed. In the case of a taxpayer which is a partner, shareholder of an electing small business corporation, or beneficiary of a trust or estate, such computations must be adequate to determine the ownership interest of the partnership, electing small business corporation, or trust or estate in each such film or tape, (a taxpayer which is a partner, shareholder, or beneficiary may satisfy the requirements of the preceding sentence by attaching to his amended return a copy of an amended return, if one is filed, of the partnership, electing small business corporation, or trust or estate
which sets forth computations necessary to determine the ownership interest of the entity in each such film or tape.) No amended return need be filed for a taxable year if application of the election to films and tapes placed in service during that year would not affect tax liability for any taxable year.
The statement shall contain the following information:
(i) The taxpayer's name and taxpayer identification number (under section 6109 of the Code).
(ii) A statement that the taxpayer is making the election under section 804(c)(2) of the Act.
(iii) A statement that the taxpayer agrees that the period for assessment and collection under section 6501 of the Code will remain open until December 31, 1978, solely with respect to adjustments of tax liability attributable to investment credit allowed on films and tapes placed in service in each year covered by the election. Unless the district director notifies the taxpayer within 7 days of receipt of the statement that such extension is denied, it will be presumed that the district director consents to such extension. Of course, the period covered by this statement may be extended beyond December 31, 1978 by mutual agreement. This statement does not shorten the regular statutory period for any year or take precedence over a previous or subsequent agreement with the Internal Revenue Service extending the statutory period for any year.
(iv) A list of the addresses used by the taxpayer on each return filed during each taxable year subject to the election.
(v) A statement that the taxpayer consents to join in judicial proceedings to determine the investment credit allowable and entitlement to investment credit on any film or tape subject to the election, which meets all of the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(vi) A statement as to whether an election has been made by the taxpayer under section 804(e)(2) of the Act for films and tapes which are property described in section 50(a) of the Code which were placed in service in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975.
(vii) A list by name of all films or tapes placed in service during the years to which the election relates.
(viii) With respect to each film or tape listed in paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, a list of all producers, distributors, and persons with a participation interest (with addresses where available).
(ix) In the case of an election made by a partner, shareholder of an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b) of the Code), or beneficiary, a statement indicating the name, taxpayer identification number, and address for tax return purposes of the respective partnership, electing small business corporation, or trust or estate.
(3)
Consent to join in judicial proceedings.
No election may be made by any taxpayer unless the statement made under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section provides that the taxpayer shall:
(i) Treat the determination of the investment credit allowable on each film or tape subject to an election as a separate cause of action;
(ii) Make all reasonable efforts necessary to join in or intervene in any judicial proceeding in any court for determining the person entitled to, and the amount of, the investment credit allowable with respect to any film or tape covered by the election after receiving notice from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate indicating that a conflicting claim to the investment credit for such film or tape is being asserted in such court by another person; and
(iii) Consent to revocation of the election by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate with respect to all films and tapes placed in service in taxable years for which the election applies, if the taxpayer fails to make all reasonable efforts necessary to join in or intervene in any judicial proceeding under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Who makes the election.
The election must be made separately by each person who has an ownership interest. However, where a film or tape is owned by a partnership, electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b) of the Code), or trust or estate,
the election must be made separately by each partner, shareholder or beneficiary. The election is not to be made by a partnership or electing small business corporation, and is to be made by a trust or estate only if the trust or estate in determining its tax liability would be allowed investment credit on a film or tape subject to the election. The election of any partner, shareholder, beneficiary or trust or estate shall be effective regardless of whether any related partner, shareholder, beneficiary, or trust or estate makes the election.
(5)
Additional time to perfect election.
A taxpayer that by April 25, 1977, files a statement containing the information described in paragraph (b)(2) (i) through (v) of this section shall be deemed to have made a timely election under paragraph (b)(2) of this section if by July 5, 1977, the taxpayer has complied with all of the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If a taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the district director that it is unable to meet the July 5, 1977, date even though it has made a good faith effort to do so, the district director may at his discretion extend that date to no later than October 4, 1977, for that taxpayer. Requests for extensions of the July 5, 1977, date should be addressed to the district director with whom the statement was filed.
(c)
Revocation of election
—(1)
Revocation by taxpayer.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, an election made under section 804(c)(2) of the Act may not be revoked by a taxpayer unless consent to revoke the election is obtained from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate. Application for consent to revoke the election will be accepted only if permanent regulations are issued which contain rules which may not reasonably have been anticipated by taxpayers at the time the election was made. Any permanent regulations will provide a reasonable period of time within which taxpayers will be permitted to apply for consent to revoke the election and will allow revocation (where revocation is not barred by the limitations on credit or refund inspection 6511 of the Code) in the event of a determination by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate that such permanent regulations contain provisions that may not reasonably have been anticipated by taxpayers at the time of making such election.
(ii) An election properly made under section 804(e)(2) of the Act, to have sections 48(k) and 47 (a)(7) of the Code apply to films and tapes which are property described in section 50(a) of the Code and which were placed in service in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975, shall automatically revoke any election under section 804(c)(2) of the Act with respect to such films and tapes. Such revocation does not require the consent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate.
(2)
Revocation by Commissioner.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate shall revoke an election made under section 804(c)(2) of the Act if a taxpayer fails to make all reasonable efforts necessary to join in or intervene, in a judicial proceeding for determination of the person entitled to, and the amount of, the investment credit allowable with respect to any film or tape covered by the election after receiving notice from the Commissioner or his delegate which indicates that a conflicting claim to the investment credit for such film or tape is being asserted in court by another person.
(d)
Furnishing of supplementary information required.
If these regulations are revised to require the furnishing of information in addition to that which was furnished with the amended returns and statement of election filed pursuant to paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of this section, the taxpayer must furnish such additional information in a statement addressed to the district director with whom the amended return and statement of election were filed.

§ 7.57(d)-1
Election with respect to straight line recovery of intangibles.
(a)
Purpose.
This section prescribes rules for making the election permitted under section 57(d)(2), as added by the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Under this election taxpayers may use cost depletion to compute straight line recovery of intangibles.
(b)
Election.
The election under section 57(d) is subject to the following rules:
(1) The election is made within the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for the taxable year in which the intangible drilling costs are paid or incurred or, if later, by July 25, 1978.
(2) The election is made separately for each well. Thus, a taxpayer may make the election for only some of his or her wells.
(3) The election is made by using, for the well or wells to which the election applies, cost depletion to compute straight line recovery of intangibles for purposes of determining the amount of the preference under section 57(a)(11).
(4) The election may be made whether or not the taxpayer uses cost depletion in computing taxable income.
(5) The election is made by a partnership rather than by each partner.
(c)
Computation of cost depletion.
For purposes of computing straight line recovery of intangibles through cost depletion, both depletable and depreciable intangible drilling and development costs for the taxable year are taken into account. They are treated as if capitalized, added to basis, and recovered under § 1.611-2(a). Costs paid or incurred in other taxable years are not taken into account.
(Secs. 57(d) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (90 Stat. 1551; 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 57(d), 7805))
[T.D. 7541, 43 FR 17816, Apr. 26, 1978; 43 FR 18993, May 3, 1978]
§ 7.465-1
Amounts at risk with respect to activities begun prior to effective date; in general.
Section 465 provides that a taxpayer (other than a corporation which is not a subchapter S corporation or a personal holding company) engaged in certain activities may not deduct losses from such activity to the extent the losses exceed the amount the taxpayer is at risk with respect to the activity. For the types of activities to which section 465 applies and for determining what constitutes a separate activity, see section 465(c). Section 465 generally applies to losses attributable to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975. For the purposes of applying the at risk limitation to activities begun before the effective date of the provision (and which were not excepted from application of the provision), it is necessary to determine the amount at risk as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975. The amount at risk in an activity as of the first day of the first taxable year of the taxpayer beginning after December 31, 1975, (for the purposes of § 7.465-1 through 7.465-5 such first day shall be
referred to as the effective date) shall be determined according to the rules provided in §§ 7.465-2 through 7.465-5.
[T.D. 7504, 42 FR 42197, Aug. 22, 1977]
§ 7.465-2
Determination of amount at risk.
(a)
Initial amount.
The amount a taxpayer is at risk on the effective date with respect to an activity to which section 465 applies shall be determined in accordance with this section. The initial amount the taxpayer is at risk in the activity shall be the taxpayer's initial basis in the activity as modified by disregarding amounts described in section 465(b) (3) or (4) (relating generally to amounts protected against loss or borrowed from related persons).
(b)
Succeeding adjustments.
For each taxable year ending before the effective date, the initial amount at risk shall be increased and decreased by the items which increased and decreased the taxpayer's basis in the activity in that year as modified by disregarding the amounts described in section 465(b) (3) or (4).
(c)
Application of losses and withdrawals.
(1) Losses described in section 465(d) which are incurred in taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1976 and deducted in such taxable years, will be treated as reducing first that portion of the taxpayer's basis which is attributable to amounts not at risk. On the other hand, withdrawals made in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, will be treated as reducing the amount which the taxpayer is at risk.
(2) Therefore, if in a taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1976 there is a loss described in section 465(d), it shall reduce the amount at risk only to the extent it exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's basis which is not at risk. For the purposes of this paragraph the taxpayer's basis which is not at risk is that portion of the taxpayer's basis in the activity (as of the close of the taxable year and prior to reduction for the loss) which is attributable to amounts described in section 465(b) (3) or (4).
(d)
Amount at risk shall not be less than zero.
If, after determining the amount described in paragraph (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the amount at risk (but for this paragraph) would be less than zero, the amount at risk on the effective date shall be zero.
[T.D. 7504, 42 FR 42197, Aug. 22, 1977]
§ 7.465-3
Allocation of loss for different taxable years.
If the taxable year of the entity conducting the activity differs from that of the taxpayer, the loss attributable to the activity for the first taxable year of the entity ending after the beginning of the first taxable year of the taxpayer beginning after December 31, 1975, shall be allocated in the following manner. That portion of the loss from the activity for such taxable year of the entity which bears the same ratio as the number of days in such taxable year before January 1, 1976, divided by the total number of days in the taxable year, shall be attributable to taxable years of the taxpayer beginning before January 1, 1976. Consequently, that portion shall be treated in accordance with § 7.465-2.
[T.D. 7504, 42 FR 42198, Aug. 22, 1977]
§ 7.465-4
Insufficient records.
If sufficient records do not exist to accurately determine under § 7.465-2 the amount which a taxpayer is at risk on the effective date, the amount at risk shall be the taxpayer's basis in the activity reduced (but not below zero) by the taxpayer's share of amounts described in section 465(b) (3) or (4) with respect to the activity on the day before the effective date.
[T.D. 7504, 42 FR 42198, Aug. 22, 1977]
§ 7.465-5
Examples.
The provisions of § 7.465-1 and § 7.465-2 may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
J and K, as equal partners, form partnership JK on January 1, 1975. Partnership JK is engaged solely in an activity described in section 465(c)(1). On January 1, 1975, each partner contributes $10,000 in cash from personal assets to JK. On July 1, 1975, JK borrows $40,000 (of which J's share is $20,000) from a bank under a nonrecourse financing arrangement secured only by the new equipment (for use in the activity) purchased with the $40,000. On September 1, 1975, JK reduces the amount due on the loan to $36,000 (of which J's share is $18,000). On October 1, 1975, JK distributes $3,000 to each
partner. For taxable year 1975, JK has no income or loss. Although J's basis in the activity is $25,000 ($10,000 + $18,000—$3,000) J's amount at risk on the effective date is $7,000 determined as follows:
Initial amount at risk
$10,000
Plus: Items which increased basis other than amounts described in sec. 465(b) (3) or (4)
0
Total
10,000
Less: Distribution

# Example (2).
Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that JK has a loss (as described in section 465(d) for 1975 of which J's share is $12,000. Although J's basis in the activity is $13,000 ($10,000 + $18,000—($3,000 + $12,000)) J's amount at risk on the effective date is $7,000 determined as follows:
Initial amount at risk
$10,000
Plus: Items which increased basis other than amounts described in sec. 465(b) (3) or (4)
0
Total
10,000
Less: Distribution

Portion of loss ($12,000) in excess of portion of basis not at risk ($18,000)
0

3,000
J's amount at risk on effective date
7,000

# Example (3).
Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that JK has a loss (as described in section 465(d) for 1975, and J's share is $23,000. J's basis in the activity is $2,000 ($10,000 + $18,000—($3,000 + $23,000)). The amount at risk on the effective date is determined as follows:
Initial amount at risk
$10,000
Plus: Items which increased basis other than amounts described in sec. 465(b) (3) or (4)

§ 7.999-1
Computation of the international boycott factor.
(a)
In general.
Sections 908(a), 952(a)(3), and 995(b)(1)(F) provide that certain benefits of the foreign tax credit, deferral of earnings of foreign corporations, and DISC are denied if a person or a member of a controlled group (within the meaning of section 993(a)(3)) that includes that person participates in or cooperates with an international boycott (within the meaning of section 999(b)(3)). The loss of tax benefits may be determined by multiplying the otherwise allowable tax benefits by the “international boycott factor.” Section 999(c)(1) provides that the international boycott factor is to be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The method of computing the international boycott factor is set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. A special rule for computing the international boycott factor of a person that is a member of two or more controlled groups is set forth in paragraph (d). Transitional rules for making adjustments to the international boycott factor for years affected by the effective dates are set forth in paragraph (e). The definitions of the terms used in this section are set forth in paragraph (b).
(b)

To determine the country of direct use, consumption, or disposition of tangible personal property and the end product of services, see paragraph (b)(10) of this section.
(7)
Sales made from a country.
The terms “sales made from a boycotting country” and “sales made from any country other than the United States” mean, in respect of a particular country, the gross receipts from the sale, exchange, other disposition, or use of:
(i) Tangible personal property (including money) from a stock of goods located in that country,

—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section, for purposes of allocating to a particular country:
(A) The gross amount paid in connection with the purchase or use of,
(B) The gross receipts from the sale, exchange, other disposition or use of, and
(C) The payroll paid or accrued for services performed, or the end product of services performed, partly within and partly without that country, the amount paid, received, or accrued to be allocated to that country, unless the facts and circumstances of a particular case warrant a different amount, will be that amount that bears the same relation to the total amount paid, received, or accrued as the number of days of performance of the services within that country bears to the total number of days of performance of services for which the total amount is paid, received, or accrued.
(ii)
Transportation, telegraph, and cable services.
Transportation, telegraph, and cable services performed partly within one country and partly within another country are allocated between the two countries as follows:

(10)
Country of use, consumption, or disposition.
As a general rule, the country of use, consumption, or disposition of tangible personal property (including money) and the end product of services (wherever performed) is deemed to be the country of destination of the tangible personal property or the end product of the services. (Thus, if legal services are performed in one country and an opinion is given for use by a client in a second country, the end product of the legal services is used, consumed, or disposed of in the second country.) The occurrence in a country of a temporary interruption in the shipment of the tangible personal property or the delivery of the end product of services shall not constitute such country the country of destination. However, if at the time of the transaction the person providing the tangible personal property or the end product of services knew, or should have known from the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, that the tangible personal property or the end product of services probably would not be used, consumed, or disposed of in the country of destination, that person must determine the country of ultimate use, consumption or disposition of the tangible personal property or the end product of services. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subparagraph, a person that sells, exchanges, otherwise disposes of, or makes available for use, tangible personal property to any person all of whose business except for an insubstantial part consists of selling from inventory to retail customers at retail outlets all within one country may assume at the time of such sale to such person that the tangible personal property will be used, consumed, or disposed of within such country.

The taxable year election is a binding election to be changed only with the approval of the Secretary of his delegate. The election is to be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the instructions to Form 5713, the International Boycott Report.
(c)
Computation of international boycott factor
—(1)
In general.
The method of computing the international boycott factor of a person that is not a member of a controlled group is set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The
method of computing the international boycott factor of a person that is a member of a controlled group is set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. For purposes of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3), purchases and sales made by, and payroll paid or accrued by, a partnership are deemed to be made or paid or accrued by a partner in that proportion that the partner's distributive share bears to the purchases and sales made by, and the payroll paid or accrued by, the partnership. Also for purposes of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3), purchases and sales made by, and payroll paid or accrued by, a trust referred to in section 671 are deemed to be made both by the trust (for purposes of determining the trust's international boycott factor), and by a person treated under section 671 as the owner of the trust (but only in that proportion that the portion of the trust that such person is considered as owning under sections 671 through 679 bears to the purchases and sales made by, and the payroll paid and accrued by, the trust).
(2)
International boycott factor of a person that is not a member of a controlled group.
The international boycott factor to be applied by a person that is not a member of a controlled group (within the meaning of section 993(a)(3)) is a fraction.
(i) The numerator of the fraction is the sum of the—
(A) Purchases made from all boycotting countries associated in carrying out a particular international boycott.
(B) Sales made to or from all boycotting countries associated in carrying out a particular international boycott, and
(C) Payroll paid or accrued for services performed in all boycotting countries associated in carrying out a particular international boycott by that person during that person's taxable year, minus the amount of such purchases, sales, and payroll that is clearly demonstrated to be attributable to clearly separate and identifiable operations in connection with which there was no participation in or cooperation with that international boycott.
(ii) The denominator of the fraction is the sum of the—
(A) Purchases made from any country other than the United States,
(B) Sales made to or from any country other than the United States, and
(C) Payroll paid or accrued for services performed in any country other than the United States by that person during that person's taxable year.
(3)
International boycott factor of a person that is a member of a controlled group.
The international boycott factor to be applied by a person that is a member of a controlled group (within the meaning of section 993(a)(3)) shall be computed in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, except that there shall be taken into account the purchases and sales made by, and the payroll paid or accrued by, each member of the controlled group during each member's own taxable year that ends with or within the controlled group taxable year that ends with or within that person's taxable year.
(d)
Computation of the international boycott factor of a person that is a member of two or more controlled groups.
The international boycott factor to be applied under sections 908(a), 952(a)(3), and 995(b)(1)(F) by a person that is a member of two or more controlled groups shall be determined in the manner described in paragraph (c)(3), except that the purchases, sales, and payroll included in the number and denominator shall include the purchases, sales, and payroll of that person and of all other members of the two or more controlled groups of which that person is a member.
(e)
Transitional rules
—(1)
Pre-November 3, 1976 boycotting operations.
The international boycott factor to be applied under sections 908(a), 952(a)(3), and 995(b)(1)(F) by a person that is not a member of a controlled group, for that person's taxable year that includes November 3, 1976, or a person that is a member of a controlled group, for the controlled group taxable year that includes November 3, 1976, shall be computed in the manner described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3), respectively, of this section. However, that the following adjustments shall be made:
(i) There shall be excluded from the numerators described in paragraphs
(c)(2)(i) and (c)(3)(i) of this section purchases, sales, and payroll clearly demonstrated to be attributable to clearly separate and identifiable operations—
(A) That were completed on or before November 3, 1976, or
(B) In respect of which it is demonstrated that the agreements constituting participation in or cooperation with the international boycott were renounced, the renunciations were communicated on or before November 3, 1976, to the governments or persons with which the agreements were made and the agreements have not been reaffirmed after November 3, 1976, and
(ii) The international boycott factor resulting after the numerator has been modified in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section shall be further modified by multiplying it by a fraction. The numerator of that fraction shall be the number of days in that person's taxable year (or, if applicable, in that person's controlled group taxable year) remaining after November 3, 1976, and the denominator shall be 366.
The principles of this subparagraph are illustrated in the following example:

# Example.
Corporation A, a calendar year taxpayer, is not a member of a controlled group. During the 1976 calendar year, Corporation DA had three operations in a boycotting country under three separate contracts, each of which contained agreements constituting participation in or cooperation with an international boycott. Each contract was entered into on or after September 2, 1976. Operation (1) was completed on November 1, 1976. The sales made to a boycotting country in connection with Operation (1) amounted to $10. Operation (2) was not completed during the taxable year, but on November 1, 1976, Corporation A communicated a renunciation of the boycott agreement covering that operation to the government of the boycotting country. The sales made to a boycotting country in connection with Operation (2) amounted to $40. Operation (3) was not completed during the taxable year, nor was any renunciation of the boycott agreement made. The sales made to a boycotting country in connection with Operation (3) amounted to $25. Corporation A had no purchases made from, sales made from, or payroll paid or accrued for services performed in, a boycotting country. Corporation A had $500 of purchases made from, sales made from, sales made to, and payroll paid or accrued for services performed in, countries other than the United States. Company A's boycott factor for 1976, computed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section (before the application of this subparagraph) would be:
EC16OC91.003
However, the $10 is eliminated from the numerator by reason of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section, and the $40 is eliminated from the numerator by reason of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section. Thus, before the application of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, Corporation A's international boycott factor is $25/$500. After the application of paragraph (e)(1)(ii), Corporation A's international boycott factor is:
EC16OC91.004
(2)
Pre-December 31, 1977 boycotting operations.
The international boycott factor to be applied under sections 908(a), 952(a)(3), and 995(b)(1)(F) by a person that is not a member of a controlled group, for that person's taxable year that includes December 31, 1977, or by a person that is a member of a controlled group, for the controlled group taxable year that includes December 31, 1977, shall be computed in the manner described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3), respectively, of this section. However, the following adjustments shall be made:
(i) There shall be excluded from the numerators described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(3)(i) of this section purchases, sales, and payroll clearly demonstrated to be attributable to clearly separate and identifiable operations that were carried out in accordance with the terms of binding contracts entered into before September 2, 1976, and—
(A) That were completed on or before December 31, 1977, or
(B) In respect of which it is demonstrated that the agreements constituting participation in or cooperation with the international boycott were renounced, the renunciations were communicated on or before December 31, 1977, to the governments or persons with which the agreements were made, and the agreements were not reaffirmed after December 31, 1977, and
(ii) In the case of clearly separate and identifiable operations that are carried out in accordance with the terms of binding contracts entered into before September 2, 1976, but that do
not meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the numerators described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(3)(i) of this section shall be adjusted by multiplying the purchases, sales, and payroll clearly demonstrated to be attributable to those operations by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such person's taxable year (or, if applicable, in such person's controlled group taxable year) remaining after December 31, 1977, and the denominator of which is 365.
The principles of this subparagraph are illustrated in the following example:

# Example.
Corporation A is not a member of a controlled group and reports on the basis of a July 1-June 30 fiscal year. During the 1977-1978 fiscal year, Corporation A had 2 operations carried out pursuant to the terms of separate contracts, each of which had a clause that constituted participation in or cooperation with an international boycott. Neither operation was completed during the fiscal year, nor were either of the boycotting clauses renounced. Operation (1) was carried out in accordance with the terms of a contract entered into on November 15, 1976. Operation (2) was carried out in accordance with the terms of a binding contract entered into before September 2, 1976. Corporation A had sales made to a boycotting country in connection with Operation (1) in the amount of $50, and in connection with Operation (2) in the amount of $100. Corporation A had sales made to countries other than the United States in the amount of $500. Corporation A had no purchases made from, sales made from, or payroll paid or accrued for services performed in, any country other than the United States. In the absence of this subparagraph, Corporation A's international boycott factor would be
EC16OC91.005
However, by reason of the application of this subparagraph, Corporation A's international boycott factor is reduced to
EC16OC91.006
(3)
Incomplete controlled group taxable year.
If, at the end of the taxable year of a person that is a member of a controlled group, the controlled group taxable year that includes November 3, 1976 has not ended, or the taxable year of one or more members of the controlled group that includes November 3, 1976 has not ended, then the international boycott factor to be applied under sections 908(a), 952(a)(3) and 995(b)(1)(F) by such person for the taxable year shall be computed in the manner described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. However, the numerator and the denominator in that paragraph shall include only the purchases, sales, and payroll of those members of the controlled group whose taxable years ending after November 3, 1976 have ended as the end of the taxable year of such person.
(f)
Effective date.
This section applies to participation in or cooperation with an international boycott after November 3, 1976. In the case of operations which constitute participation in or cooperation with an international boycott and which are carried out in accordance with the terms of a binding contract entered into before September 2, 1976, this section applies to such participation or cooperation after December 31, 1977.

§ 9.1
Investment credit—public utility property elections.
(a)
Applicability of prior election under section 46(f)
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an election made before March 10, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as a 1972 election) under section 46(f) (redesignated from section 46(e) by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975) applies to the credit allowable for a taxable year with respect to public utility property described in section 46(f)(5) by reason of sections 301 and 302 of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975.
(2)
1972 immediate flow-through election.
A 1972 election under section 46(f)(3) (hereinafter referred to as an election for immediate flow-through) does not apply to the additional credit allowed under section 38 with respect to limited property (public utility property described in section 46(c)(3)(B) to which section 167(1)(2)(C) applies, other than nonregulated communication property of the type described in the last sentence of section 46(c)(3)(B) by reason of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975. However, a 1972 election for immediate flow-through does apply to the additional credit allowed for a taxable year with respect to property described in section 46(f)(5)(B). See paragraph (b) of this section for a new election under section 46(f)(3) with regard to the additional credit with respect to limited property allowed by reason of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975. See paragraph (a)(3) of this section for determination of additional credit. For purposes of this section the phrase “determined as if the Tax Reduction Act had not been enacted” means the following amendments shall be disregarded in determining credit allowable or allowed:
(i) The increase in the amount of credit from 7 percent to 10 or 11 percent under section 46(a)(1) (A), (B), and (D),
(ii) The increase in the amount of qualified investment from 4/7 to 7/7 under section 46(a)(1)(C) and (c)(3)(A),
(iii) The increase in the dollar limitation from $50,000 to $100,000 on used property under section 48(c)(2), and
(iv) The increase in the limitation based on tax under section 46(a)(6) for certain public utilities.
In determining the amount of credit attributable to limited property possible disallowance under section 46(f) shall be disregarded.
(3)
Additional credit allowed
—(i)
Credit earned in taxable year.
The amount of additional credit allowed for credit earned for limited property for taxable year is an amount equal to the excess of—
(A) The credit allowed by section 38 for the taxable year (determined without regard to section 46(b)) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of credit earned for limited property for the taxable year and the denominator of which is the amount of credit earned for all section 38 property for the taxable year, over
(B) The amount of normal credit allowed for limited property for the taxable year (determined without regard to section 46(b)). The amount of normal credit allowed for limited property is the amount of credit that would be allowed for the taxable year determined as if the Tax Reduction Act had not been enacted multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of credit earned for limited property for the taxable year determined as if the Tax Reduction Act had not been enacted and the denominator of which is the credit earned for all section 38 property for the taxable year determined as if the Tax Reduction Act had not been enacted.
(ii)
Carryover or carryback to taxable year.
The amount of additional credit allowed for limited property attributable to a carryover or a carryback of any unused credit to any taxable year in an amount equal to the excess of—
(A) The amount of credit allowed by section 38 for the taxable year by reason of section 46(b) multiplied by the fraction contained in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section for the unused credit year, over
(B) The amount of unused normal credit allowed for limited property for the taxable year. The amount of unused normal credit allowed for limited property is the amount of unused credit that would be allowed for the taxable year under section 38 by reason of section 46(b), taking into account the amount of unused credit that would be allowed for any preceding year, determined as if the Tax Reduction Act had not been enacted, multiplied by the fraction contained in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section for the unused credit year.
(b)
New election
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer who made a 1972 election for immedite flow-through under section 46(f)(3) with respect to limited property may elect to apply section 46(f)(3) to the additional credit allowed by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 with respect to such property, or, if eligible, may make the election in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to apply section 46(f)(2) to such additional credit.

If the taxpayer does not make a new election, section 46(f)(1) shall apply to additional credit for limited property. However, if the taxpayer made a 1972 election under section 46(f)(2) with respect to property to which section 46(f)(3) does not apply, then section 46(f)(2) shall apply to such additional credit notwithstanding any prohibition in section 46(f)(3) to the contrary.

Special section 46(f)(2) election.
A taxpayer who:
(i) Made a 1972 election under section 46(f)(3),
(ii) Did not make an election to apply section 46(f)(2) with respect to property to which section 46(f)(3) does not apply, and
(iii) Did not acquire property to which section 46(f)(1) applied in any taxable year ending before January 1, 1975, may elect to apply section 46(f)(2) to the additional credit allowed by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 with respect to limited property notwithstanding any prohibition in section 46(f)(3) to the contrary.
(c)
Method of making election.

§ 11.401(a)-11
Qualified joint and survivor annuities.
(a)
In general
—(1)
General rule.
A trust, which is a part of a plan providing for the payment of benefits in any form of a life annuity (
i.e.,
an annuity requiring survival of the participant or his spouse as a condition for payment), shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401(a)(11) and this section unless such plan provides that these benefits must be paid in a form having the effect of a qualified joint and survivor annuity. Therefore, any benefits which may be paid in any form of a life annuity must be paid in a form having the effect of a qualified joint and survivor annuity unless the participant makes the election, described in paragraph (c) of this section, not to receive benefits in this form. A plan will not fail to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(11) and this section merely because it provides that the spouse of a deceased participant may elect to have benefits paid in a form other than a qualified joint and survivor annuity. Section 401(a)(11) and this section shall apply only in the case of a plan to which section 411 (relating to minimum vesting standards) applies without regard to section 411(e)(2). Without regard to the election provided under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, unless an election has been made under paragraph (c) of this section, a plan to which this section applies must provide that a survivor annuity shall be payable on the death of an active participant after normal retirement age.
(2)
Illustration.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The X Corporation Defined Contribution Plan was established in 1960. As in effect on January 1, 1974, the plan provided that, upon his retirement, a participant could elect to receive the balance of his individual account in the form of (1) a lump-sum cash payment, (2) a lump-sum distribution consisting of X Corporation stock, (3) five equal annual cash payments, (4) a life annuity, or (5) a combination of options (1) through (4). The plan also provided that, if a participant did not elect another form of distribution, the balance of his individual account would be distributed to him in the form of a lump-sum cash payment upon his retirement. Assume that section 401(a)(11) and this section first become applicable to the plan as of its plan year beginning January 1, 1976, with respect to persons who were active participants in the plan on such date (see paragraph (h) of this section). Unless the X Corporation Defined Contribution Plan either discontinues the life annuity payment option or is amended to provide that the balance of a participant's individual account will be paid to him in a form having the effect of a qualified joint and survivor annuity unless the participant elects another form of benefit payment, the trust established under the plan will fail to qualify under section 401(a).
(b)
Definitions.
As used in this section—
(1)
Qualified joint and survivor annuity.
The term “qualified joint and survivor annuity” means an annuity for the life of the participant with a survivor annuity for the life of his spouse which is neither (i) less than one-half of, nor (ii) greater than, the amount of the annuity payable during the joint lives of the participant and his spouse. A qualified joint and survivor annuity must be at least the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of annuity or any optional form of benefit offered under the plan. Equivalence may be determined, on the basis of consistently applied reasonable actuarial factors,
for each participant or for all participants or reasonable groupings of participants, if such determination does not result in discrimination in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated. An annuity is not a qualified joint and survivor annuity if payments to the spouse of a deceased participant are terminated because of such spouse's remarriage.
(2)
Annuity starting date.
The term “annuity starting date” means the first day of the first period with respect to which an amount is received as an annuity, whether by reason of retirement or by reason of disability.
(3)
Earliest retirement age.
The term “earliest retirement age” means the earliest date on which, under the plan, the participant could elect to receive retirement benefits, including any benefit the participant is entitled to receive on account of disability.
(c)
Election not to take joint and survivor annuity form
—(1)
In general.
A plan shall not be treated as satisfying the requirements of this section unless each participant has the right to elect in writing not to take a joint and survivor annuity during a reasonable period before the annuity starting date. However, if a plan provides that a qualified joint and survivor annuity is the only form of benefit payable under the plan, no election need be provided.
(2)
Information to be provided to the participant.
(i) The plan administrator must furnish to the participant a written notification, in nontechnical terms, of the availability of the election provided by this paragraph, within a reasonable amount of time after the first day of the election period. This notification shall also inform the participant of the availability of the information specified in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(ii) The plan administrator must furnish to the participant a written explanation in nontechnical language of the terms and conditions of the joint and survivor annuity and the financial effect upon the participant's annuity (in terms of dollars per annuity payment) of making an election under this paragraph. This explanation must be provided to the participant within a reasonable amount of time from the date of the participant's request during the election period.
(3)
Form of election.
The election shall be in writing and clearly indicate that the participant is electing to receive his benefits under the plan in a form other than that of a joint and survivor annuity.
(4)
Election is revocable.
This election may be revoked in writing during the election period. After an election is revoked another election under this paragraph may be made during the election period.
(d)
Plans providing for early retirement
—(1)
Period during which qualified joint and survivor annuity not required.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, in the case of a plan which provides for the payment of benefits before the normal retirement age (as defined in section 411(a)(8)), the plan is not required to provide for the payment of annuity benefits in a form having the effect of a qualified joint and survivor annuity during the period beginning on the date on which the employee enters into the plan as a participant and ending on the later of—
(i) The date the employee reaches the earliest retirement age under the plan (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), or
(ii) The first day of the 120th month beginning before the date on which the employee reaches normal retirement age.
(2)
Period during which qualified joint and survivor annuity required.
(i) If a participant terminates employment and begins to receive retirement benefits during the period described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, he and his spouse must receive, after the termination of such period (or after the date such period would have terminated if the participant had survived), benefits having the effect of a qualified joint and survivor annuity, unless the participant has made an election under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) If a participant terminates employment and begins to receive retirement benefits after the period described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, he and his spouse must receive benefits having the effect of a qualified joint and survivor annuity,
unless the participant has made an election under paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A plan which provides a benefit in the form of a life annuity also provides that a participant may retire before the normal retirement age of 65 and receive a benefit, if he has completed 30 years of service. A, an employee, became a participant at the age of 18. A retires and begins to receive retirement benefits at the age of 48. Unless A otherwise elects, the plan must provide a qualified joint and survivor annuity to A and his spouse after A reaches age 55 (the later of the earliest retirement age (age 48) or 10 years before normal retirement age (age 55)) or after the date A would have reached age 55, if he had survived. The survivor annuity paid to the spouse must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The plan may, but is not required to, provide the survivor annuity before age 55 if the participant dies between age 48 and age 55.
(3)
Election of survivor annuity
—(i)
In general.
(A) A plan described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section unless, under the plan, a participant may elect, during a reasonable period, a survivor annuity to be payable on his death during the period beginning on the date on which the period described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph ends and ending on the date on which he reaches normal retirement age if he continues his employment during that period. Breaks in service during that period will neither invalidate a previous election or revocation nor prevent an election from being made or revoked during the election period.
(B) If a plan provides that a survivor annuity is the only form of benefit payable under the plan, no election need be provided.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A plan which provides a life annuity also provides that a participant may retire before the normal retirement age of 65 and receive a benefit, if he has completed 30 years of service. Under this plan, an employee who became a participant at the age of 18 will be eligible to receive retirement benefits at the age of 48. This plan must allow a participant who continues his employment to elect a survivor annuity, described in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph, to be payable on the death of the participant if death occurs after age 55 (the later of the date the participant reaches the earliest retirement age (age 48) or 10 years before normal retirement age (age 55)) but before the date the participant reaches normal retirement age (age 65).
(iii)
Information to be provided by plan administrator.
(A) The plan administrator must furnish to the participant a written notification in nontechnical terms of the availability of the election provided by this subparagraph, within a reasonable amount of time after the first day of the election period. This notification shall also inform the participant of the availability of the information specified in subdivision (iii)(B) of this subparagraph.
(B) During the election period, the plan administrator must furnish to the participant, within a reasonable amount of time from the date of his request, a written explanation in nontechnical language of the terms and conditions of the survivor annuity and the financial effect upon the participant's annuity (in terms of dollars per annuity payment) of an election or of a revocation of an election under this subparagraph.
(iv)
Payments under the survivor annuity.
In order to meet the requirements of this subparagraph, if an election is made, the payments under the survivor annuity must not be less than the payments which would have been made under the joint and survivor annuity to which the surviving spouse would have been entitled if the participant had made the election described in this subparagraph immediately prior to his retirement and if his retirement had occurred on the day before his death and within the period during which an election can be made. For example, if a participant is entitled to a single life annuity of $100 per month or a reduced amount under a qualified joint and survivor annuity of $80 per month, regardless of when he makes a valid election under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, his spouse is entitled to a payment of at least $40, but not more than $80 per month, under the survivor annuity.
(v)
Form of election.
The election shall be in writing and clearly indicate that the participant is electing the joint and survivor annuity form.
(vi)
Election is revocable.
An election under this subparagraph may be revoked in writing during the election period. After an election has been revoked, another election under this subparagraph may be made during the election period. See paragraph (c) of this section, relating to the right to elect not to take the joint and survivor annuity form.
(e)
Marriage requirements.
(1) A plan shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of this section even though it requires the participant and his spouse to have been married to each other on the annuity starting date.
(2) A plan shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of this section even though it provides that the spouse of the participant is not entitled to receive a survivor annuity (whether or not the election described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section has been made) unless the participant and his spouse have been married to each other throughout the 1-year period ending on the date of such participant's death.
(f)
Effect of participant's death on an election or revocation of an election under paragraph (c) or (d)(3).
A plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this section merely because the plan contains a provision that any election made under paragraph (c) or (d)(3) of this section and any revocation of any such election does not become effective or ceases to be effective if the participant dies within a period, not in excess of 2 years, beginning on the date of such election or revocation. A plan containing a provision described in the preceding sentence shall not satisfy the requirements of this section unless it also provides that any such election and any revocation of any such election will be given effect in any case in which—
(1) The participant dies from accidental causes,
(2) A failure to give effect to the election or revocation would deprive the participant's survivor of a survivor annuity, and
(3) Such election or revocation is made before such accident occurred.
(g)
Costs of providing joint and survivor annuity form.
A plan may take into account in any equitable manner consistent with generally accepted actuarial principles applied on a consistent basis any increased costs resulting from providing joint and survivor annuity benefits.
(h)
Application and effective date.
(1) Section 401(a)(11) and this section shall apply to a plan only with respect to plan years to which section 411 (relating to minimum vesting standards) is applicable to the plan.
(2) Section 401(a)(11) and this section shall apply if—
(i) The participant's annuity starting date falls within a plan year beginning after December 31, 1975, and
(ii) The participant was an active participant in the plan on or after the first day of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1975.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “active participant” means a participant for whom benefits are being accrued under the plan on his behalf, the employer is obligated to contribute to or under the plan on his behalf, or the employer would have been obligated to contribute to or under the plan on his behalf if any contributions were made to or under the plan.

§ 11.401(a)-19
Nonforfeitability in case of certain withdrawals.
(a)
Application of section.
Section 401(a)(19) and this section apply to a plan to which section 411(a) applies. (See section 411(e) and § 11.411(a)-2 for applicability of section 411.)
(b)
Prohibited forfeitures
—(1)
General rule.
A plan to which this section applies is not a qualified plan (and a trust forming a part of such plan is not a qualified trust) if, under such plan, any part of a participant's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions is forfeitable solely because a benefit derived from the participant's contributions under the plan is voluntarily
withdrawn by him after he has become a 50 percent vested participant.
(2)
50 percent vested participant.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a participant is a 50 percent vested participant when he has a nonforfeitable right (within the meaning of section 411 and the regulations thereunder) to at least 50 percent of his accrued benefit derived from employer contributions.
(3)
Certain forfeitures.
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply in the case of a forfeiture permitted by section 411(a)(3)(D)(iii) and § 11.411(a)-4(b)(5)(i) (relating to forfeitures of certain benefits accrued before September 2, 1974).
[T.D. 7387, 40 FR 51421, Nov. 5, 1975]
§ 11.401(b)-1
Certain retroactive changes in plan.
(a)
General rule.
(1) Under section 401(b), a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing or annuity plan or bond purchase plan which does not satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) on any day solely as a result of a disqualifying provision (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) shall be considered to have satisfied such requirements on such day if there is adopted during the remedial amendment period (as determined under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section) with respect to such disqualifying provision an amendment which causes the plan to satisfy all such requirements of section 401(a), 403(a) or 405(a) for the whole of the remedial amendment period (including extension thereof).
(2) This section shall not apply to any disqualifying provision if the remedial amendment period (as determined under paragraphs (c) and (d)(1) of this section determined without regard to paragraph (d)(2) of this section) with respect to such disqualifying provision ends prior to September 2, 1974.
(b)
Disqualifying provisions.
For purposes of this section, with respect to a plan described in paragraph (a) of this section the term “disqualifying provision” means any provision of—
(1) A plan as adopted,
(2) A plan amendment, or
(3) The Employee Income Security Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-406, 88 Stat. 829),
which causes such plan to fail to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a), 403(a), or 405(a).
(c)
Remedial amendment period.
(1) The remedial amendment period with respect to a disqualifying provision begins on the effective date of the disqualifying provision. For purposes of this section, the effective date of a disqualifying provision is—
(i) In the case of a disqualifying provision in a plan as adopted, the date the plan is put into effect,
(ii) In the case of a plan amendment, the date the plan amendment is adopted or put into effect (whichever is earlier), or
(iii) In the case of a statutory provision described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the effective date of such provision.
(2) Unless extended as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, the remedial amendment period ends with the time prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the return of the employer for the employer's taxable year in which falls—
(i) With respect to a disqualifying provision in a plan as adopted, or a plan amendment, the later of the date on which such provision was adopted or put into effect.
(ii) With respect to a statutory provision described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the effective date of such provision.
(d)
Extension for determination letters
—(1)
In general.
If, before the end of the remedial amendment period (determined without regard to this paragraph) with respect to a disqualifying provision, the employer or plan administrator files a request pursuant to § 601.210(o) of this chapter (Statement of Procedural Rules) for a determination letter with respect to the initial qualifications of the plan or the effect of such disqualifying provision on the qualified status of the plan (or a trust which is part of a plan) under section 401(a), 403(a), or 405(a), then except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, such remedial amendment period may be extended for a period not to exceed 150 days, beginning on the day after the last day of the employers taxable year in which falls the dates described in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of
paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The 150-day period does not include any day on which there is pending before the Internal Revenue Service a request for a determination letter described in this subparagraph. For this purpose, such a request is considered to be pending before the Internal Revenue Service from the date it is filed with the Internal Revenue Service to the date on which notice of the final determination with respect to the request is issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the request is withdrawn, or the request is otherwise finally disposed of by the Internal Revenue Service.
(2)
Special rules.
Except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, the period provided by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not end prior to the later of December 31, 1975, or the expiration of 30 days after—
(i) The date on which a notice of final determination with respect to a request described in that subparagraph is issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or, where applicable,
(ii) The date on which a judgment pursuant to section 7476 (relating to declaratory judgments) by the United States Tax Court in a case or controversy involving such determination becomes final.
(3)
Overall limitation.
The period provided by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not expire later than the last day (determined under section 6501) for assessment of any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the taxable year of the employer immediately preceding the first day of such period.

§ 11.410-1
Election by church to have participation, vesting, funding, etc., provisions apply.
(a)
In general.
If a church or convention or association of churches which maintains any church plan, as defined in section 414(e), makes an election under this section, certain provisions of the Code and title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the “Act”) shall apply to such church plan as if such plan were not a church plan. The provisions of the Code referred to are section 410 (relating to minimum participation standards), section 411 (relating to minimum vesting standards), section 412 (relating to minimum funding standards), section 4975 (relating to prohibited transactions), and paragraphs (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), and (19) of section 401(a) (relating to joint and survivor annuities, mergers and consolidations, assignment or alienation of benefits, time of benefit commencement, certain social security increases, and withdrawals of employee contributions, respectively).
(b)
Election is irrevocable.
An election under this section with respect to any church plan shall be binding with respect to such plan and, once made, shall be irrevocable.
(c)
Procedure for making election
—(1)
Time of election.
An election under this section may be made for plan years for which the provisions of section 410(d) of the Code apply to the church plan. By reason of section 1017(b) of the Act section 410(d) does not apply to a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, for plan years beginning before December 31, 1975. Section 1017(d) of the Act permits a plan administrator to elect to have certain provisions of the Code (including section 410(d)) apply to a plan before the otherwise applicable effective dates of such provisions. See § 420.0-1 of the regulations in this chapter (Temporary Regulations on Procedure and Administration under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974). Therefore, an election under section 410(d) of the Code may be made for a plan year beginning before December 31, 1975, only if an election has been made under section 1017(d) of the Act with respect to that plan year.
(2)
By whom election is to be made.
The election provided by this section may be made only by the plan administrator of the church plan.
(3)
Manner of making election.
The plan administrator may elect to have the provisions of the Code described in paragraph (a) of this section apply to the church plan as if it were not a church plan by attaching the statement described in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph to either (i) the annual return required under section 6058(a) (or an amended return) with respect to the plan which is filed for the first plan year for which the election is effective or (ii) a written request for a determination letter relating to the qualification of the plan under section 401(a), 403(a), or 405(a) of the Code and, if trusteed, the exempt status under section 501(a) of the Code of a trust constituting a part of the plan.
(4)
Conditional election.
If an election is made with a written request for a determination letter, the election may be conditioned upon issuance of a favorable determination letter and will become irrevocable upon issuance of such letter.
(5)
Statement.
The statement described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph shall indicate (i) that the election is made under section 410(d) of the Code and (ii) the first plan year for which it is effective.

(a)-(c) [Reserved]
(d)
Special rules.
(1) [Reserved]
(2)
Discrimination.
The determination as to whether a plan discriminates in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated, is made on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each case, allowing a reasonable difference between the percentage of such employees benefited by the plan to all employees benefited by the plan and the percentage of all such employees of the employer to all employees of the employer. A showing that a specified percentage of employees covered by a plan are not officers, shareholders, or highly compensated, without a showing that the difference (if any) between such percentage and the percentage of all employees who are not officers, shareholders, or highly compensated is reasonable, is not sufficient to establish that the plan does not discriminate in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated.

§ 11.412(c)-11
Election with respect to bonds.
(a)
In general.
Section 412(c)(2)(B) provides that, at the election of the administrator of a plan which includes a trust qualified under section 401(a) or of a plan which satisfies the requirements of section 403(a) or section 405(a), the value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is held by the plan and which is not in default as to principal or interest may be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to the amount payable at maturity (or, in the case of a bond which is callable prior to maturity, the earliest call date). So long as this election is in effect, the value of any such evidence of indebtedness shall, for purposes of section 412, be determined on such an amortized basis rather than on a method taking into account fair market value as described in section 412(c)(2)(A).
(b)
Manner of making election.
The election to value evidences of indebtedness in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by a statement to that effect attached to and filed as a part of the annual return of the plan required under section 6058 of the Code.
(c)
Effect of election.
The election provided by section 412(c)(2)(B), once made, will affect the valuation of all evidences of indebtedness, not in default as to principal or interest, which are held by the plan for the plan year for which the election is made and any evidences of indebtedness which are subsequently acquired by the plan. The value of any evidence of indebtedness which is in default as of the valuation date for the plan year must be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value in accordance with section 412(c)(2)(A) and must continue to be so valued until the indebtedness is no longer in default.
(d)
Consent to revoke required
—(1)
In general.
An election made in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may be revoked only if consent to revoke the election is obtained from the Secretary or his delegate.
(2)
Manner of obtaining permission for revocation.

that for purposes of section 412 a contribution for a plan year made after the end of such plan year but not later than two and one-half months after the last day of such plan year shall be deemed to have been made on such last day.

(b)
Six month extension of two and one-half month period.
(1) For purposes of section 412 a contribution for a plan year to which section 412 applies that is made not more than eight and one-half months after the end of such plan year shall be deemed to have been made on the last day of such year.

§ 12.3
Investment credit, public utility property elections.
(a)
Elections
—(1)
In general.
Under section 46(e), three elections may be made on or before March 9, 1972, with respect to section 46(e) property (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph). An election made under the provisions of section 46(e) shall be irrevocable.
(2)
Applicability of elections.
(i) Any election under section 46(e) shall be made with respect to all of the taxpayer's property eligible for the election whether or not the taxpayer is regulated by more than one regulatory body.
(ii)(
a
) Paragraph (1) of section 46(e) shall apply to all of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property in the absence of an election under paragraph (2) or (3) of section 46(e). If an election is made under paragraph (2) of section 46(e), paragraph (1) of such section shall not apply to any of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property.
(
b
) An election made under the last sentence of section 46(e)(1) shall apply to that portion of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property to which paragraph (1) of section 46(e) applies and which is short supply property within the meaning of § 1.46-5(b)(2) of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) as set forth in a notice of proposed rule making published in 37 FR 3526 on February 17, 1971.
(iii) If a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (2) of section 46(e), and makes no election under paragraph (3) of such section, the election under paragraph (2) of section 46(e) shall apply to all of its section 46(e) property.
(iv) If a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (3) of section 46(e), such election shall apply to all of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies. Paragraph (1) or (2) of section 46(e) (as the case may be) shall apply to that portion of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property which is not property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (2) of section 46(e), and also makes an election under paragraph (3) of section 46(e), paragraph (3) shall apply to all of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies and paragraph (2) shall apply to the remainder of the taxpayer's section 46(e) property.
(3)
Section 46(e) property.
“Section 46(e) property” is section 38 property which is both property described in section 50 and is—
(i) Public utility property within the meaning of section 46(c)(3)(B) (other
than nonregulated communication property of the type described in the last sentence of section 46(c)(3)(B)), or
(ii) Property used predominantly in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of (
a
) steam through a local distribution system or (
b
) the transportation of gas or steam by pipeline, if the rates for such furnishing or sale are established or approved by a governmental unit, agency, instrumentality, or commission described in section 46(c)(3)(B).
(b)
Method of making elections.
A taxpayer may make the elections described in section 46(e) by filing a statement, on or before March 9, 1972, with the district director or director of the internal revenue service center with whom the taxpayer ordinarily files its income tax return. For rules in the case of taxpayers filing consolidated returns, see § 1.1502-77(a) of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). Such statement shall contain the following information:
(1) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer,
(2) The paragraph (or paragraphs) of section 46(e) under which the taxpayer is making the election,
(3) If an election is made under the last sentence of section 46(e)(1), the name and address of all regulatory bodies which have jurisdiction over the taxpayer with respect to the section 46(e) property covered by such election and a statement setting forth the type of the public utility activity described in section 46(e)(5)(B) in which the taxpayer engages, and
(4) If an election is made under paragraph (3) of section 46(e), a statement indicating whether an election has been made by the taxpayer under section 167(l)(4)(A).

§ 12.4
Election of Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR).
(a)
Elections filed before February 1, 1972.
No election or tax return shall be filed which does not conform to section 109 of the Revenue Act of 1971 (Pub. L. 92-178, 85 Stat. 508). If a taxpayer has before February 1, 1972 filed an election and a tax return in accordance with § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter (relating to depreciation allowances using the Asset Depreciation Range System published in the
Federal Register
for June 23, 1971), such election will be treated as an election under the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR) as contained in section 109 of the Revenue Act of 1971 and the proposed amendments to § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter published in the
Federal Register
for January 27, 1972, provided that the election conforms with the provisions of the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR) contained in section 109 of the Revenue Act of 1971 and the amendments to the regulations as finally adopted. Such an election and the determination of tax liability on the tax return are subject to the terms and conditions of section 109 of the Revenue Act of 1971 and the final regulations prescribing the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR). (For revocation of an election, see paragraph (c) of this section.) An election and tax return filed before February 1, 1972, which does not conform with the final regulations prescribing the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR) is an invalid election unless corrected by an amended tax return and election filed no later than the time permitted by paragraph (c) of this section. If a valid election under § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter is not filed for a taxable year, the taxpayer is required to file or amend his tax return and determine tax liability for the taxable year without regard to § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter.
(b)
Elections filed after January 31, 1972.
No election or tax return shall be filed which does not conform with section 109 of the Revenue Act of 1971. An election and tax return filed under § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter after January 31, 1972, and before the final amendments to the regulations are published in the
Federal Register,
should be filed in accordance with section 109 of the Revenue Act of 1971 and the proposed amendments to § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter relating to the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR). Such election and the determination of tax liability on the tax return are subject to the terms and conditions of section 109 of the Revenue Act of 1971 and the final regulations
prescribing the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR). An election and tax return filed after January 31, 1972, which does not conform with the final regulations prescribing the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR), is not a valid election unless corrected by an amended tax return and election filed no later than the time permitted by paragraph (c) of this section. (For revocation of election, see paragraph (c) of this section.) If a valid election under § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter is not filed for a taxable year the taxpayer is required to file or amend his tax return and determine tax liability for the taxable year without regard to § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter.
(c)
Special rule for election and revocation.
Notwithstanding the rules of § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter, a taxpayer is permitted to make, amend or revoke an election under § 1.167(a)-11 of this chapter at any time before the latest of (1) the time the taxpayer files his first return for the taxable year of election, (2) 120 days after the final regulations prescribing the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR) are published in the
Federal Register,
or (3) the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for the taxable year of election. The notification of amendment or revocation of an election shall be made by filing an amended tax return with the Internal Revenue Service Center with which the election was filed. The election should be filed in the manner specified in the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR) regulations as finally prescribed.
(d)
Examples.
The principles of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
Taxpayer A filed an election under § 1.167(a)-11 before February 1, 1972. A elected to use the modified half-year convention by treating all assets as placed in service on the first day of the second quarter of the taxable year, excluded section 1250 property (as defined in section 1250(c)) and property used predominantly outside the United States from the election, and included “subsidiary assets” (as defined in § 1.167(a)-11(b)(5)(vii) of the proposed amendments to the regulations) in the election. A's election does not conform with the regulations under § 1.167(a)-11 as proposed to be amended. A should file an amended return and election within 120 days after the publication of the final Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR) regulations under § 1.167(a)-11. Such amended return and election must conform to the final amendments to the regulations. In the amended election, A must adopt one of the conventions permitted by the final amendments. Assuming the proposed amendments are finally adopted, A may exclude his subsidiary assets from the election provided the conditions of paragraph (b)(5)(vii) of § 1.167(a)-11 of the regulations, as proposed to be amended, are met, and A must include property used predominantly outside the United States in the election unless paragraph (b)(5)(iii), (v), or (vi) of § 1.167(a)-11, as proposed to be amended, permit the exclusion of the property. Generally, A must include section 1250 property in the election unless paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of § 1.167(a)-11, as proposed to be amended, permits the exclusion of the property.

# Example (2).
Taxpayer B filed an election to compute depreciation under § 1.167(a)-11 before February 1, 1972. B elected to use the half-year convention and has no assets used predominantly outside the United States. B excluded section 1250 property from the election and included his subsidiary assets in the election. Assume that the provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of § 1.167(a)-11, as proposed to be amended, apply and permit the exclusion of section 1250 property and that B does not elect to exclude subsidiary assets pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(vii), as proposed to be amended. B has no assets which were excluded from the election under paragraph (b)(5)(v) of § 1.167(a)-11, as proposed to be amended. The election which was filed before February 1, 1972, will be treated as a valid election under the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (ADR) as contained in the final amendments to the regulations, if it conforms with those amendments. B need not file an amended election provided his election conforms to the final regulations under § 1.167(a)-11. However, B may file an amended election within 120 days after the final regulations under § 1.167(a)-11 are published in the
Federal Register
in order to include section 1250 property, or to exclude subsidiary assets, or to make other changes, or to revoke the election.

§ 12.7
Election to be treated as a DISC.
(a)
Manner and time of election
—(1)
Manner
—(i)
In general.
A corporation can elect to be treated as a DISC under section 992(b) for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971. Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the election is made by the corporation filing Form 4876 with the
service center with which it would file its income tax return if it were subject for such taxable year to all the taxes imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and a copy of the completed Form 4876 with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (attention: ACTS:A:AO), Washington, D.C. 20224. The form shall be signed by any person authorized to sign a corporation return under section 6062, and shall contain the information required by such form. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c) of this section, such election to be treated as a DISC shall be valid only if the consent of every person who is a shareholder of the corporation as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which such election is effective is on or attached to such Form 4876 when filed with the service center.
(ii)
Transitional rule for corporations electing during 1972.
If the first taxable year for which an election by a corporation to be treated as a DISC is a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971, and on or before December 31, 1972, such election may be made either in the manner prescribed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph or by filing, at the place prescribed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a statement captioned “Election to be Treated as a DISC”. Such statement of election shall be valid only if the consent of each shareholder is filed with the service center in the form, and at the time, prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Such statement shall be signed by any person authorized to sign a corporation return under section 6062 and shall include the name, address, and employer identification number (if known) of the corporation, the beginning date of the first taxable year for which the election is effective, the number of shares of stock of the corporation issued and outstanding as of the earlier of the beginning of the first taxable year for which the election is effective or the time the statement is filed, the number of shares held by each shareholder as of the earlier of such dates, and the date and place of incorporation. As a condition of the election being effective, a corporation which elects to become a DISC by filing a statement in accordance with this subdivision must furnish (to the service center with which the statement was filed) such additional information as is required by Form 4876 by March 31, 1973.
(2)
Time of making election
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a corporation making an election to be treated as a DISC for its first taxable year, such election shall be made within 90 days after the beginning of such taxable year. In the case of a corporation which makes an election to be treated as a DISC for any taxable year beginning after March 31, 1972 (other than the first taxable year of such corporation), the election shall be made during the 90-day period immediately preceding the first day of such taxable year.
(ii)
Transitional rules for certain corporations electing during 1972.
In the case of a corporation which makes an election to be treated as a DISC for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971, and on or before March 31, 1972 (other than its first taxable year), the election shall be made within 90 days after the beginning of such taxable year.
(b)
Consent by shareholders
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Time and manner of consent.
Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, subject to certain exceptions, the election to be treated as a DISC is not valid unless each person who is a shareholder as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which the election is effective signs either the statement of consent on Form 4876 or a separate statement of consent attached to such form. A shareholder's consent is binding on such shareholder and all transferees of his shares and may not be withdrawn after a valid election is made by the corporation. In the case of a corporation which files an election to become a DISC for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, if a person who is a shareholder as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which the election is effective does not consent by signing the statement of consent set forth on Form 4876, such election shall be valid (except in the case of an extension of the time for filing granted under the provisions of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph or paragraph (c) of this section) only if
the consent of such shareholder is attached to the Form 4876 upon which such election is made.
(ii)
Form of consent.
A consent other than the statement of consent set forth on Form 4876 shall be in the form of a statement which is signed by the shareholder and which sets forth (
a
) the name and address of the corporation and of the shareholder and (
b
) the number of shares held by each such shareholder as of the time the consent is made and (if the consent is made after the beginning of the corporation's taxable year for which the election is effective) as of the beginning of such year. If the consent is made by a recipient of transferred shares pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the statement of consent shall also set forth the name and address of the person who held such shares as of the beginning of such taxable year and the number of such shares. Consent shall be made in the following form: “I (insert name of shareholder), a shareholder of (insert name of corporation seeking to make the election) consent to the election of (insert name of corporation seeking to make the election) to be treated as a DISC under section 992(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The consent so made by me is irrevocable and is binding upon all transferees of my shares in (insert name of corporation seeking to make the election).” The consents of all shareholders may be incorporated in one statement.
(iii)
Who may consent.
Where stock of the corporation is owned by a husband and wife as community property (or the income from such stock is community property), or is owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants by the entirety, each person having a community interest in such stock or the income therefrom and each tenant in common, joint tenant, and tenant by the entirety must consent to the election. The consent of a minor shall be made by his legal guardian or by his natural guardian if no legal guardian has been appointed. The consent of an estate shall be made by the executor or administrator thereof. The consent of a trust shall be made by the trustee thereof. The consent of an estate or trust having more than one executor, administrator, or trustee may be made by any executor, administrator, or trustee authorized to make a return of such estate or trust pursuant to section 6012(b)(5). The consent of a corporation or partnership shall be made by an officer or partner authorized pursuant to section 6062 or 6063, as the case may be, to sign the return of such corporation or partnership. In the case of a foreign person, the consent may be signed by any individual (whether or not a U.S. person) who would be authorized under sections 6061 through 6063 to sign the return of such foreign person if he were a U.S. person.
(2)
Transitional rule for corporations electing during 1972.
In the case of a corporation which files an election to be treated as a DISC for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971, and on or before December 31, 1972, such election shall be valid only if the consent of each person who is a shareholder as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which such election is effective is filed with the service center with which the election was filed within 90 days after the first day of such taxable year or within the time granted for an extension of time for filing such consent. The form of such consent shall be the same as that prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Such consent shall be attached to the statement of election or shall be filed separately (with such service center) with a copy of the statement of election. An extension of time for filing a consent may be granted in the manner, and subject to the conditions, described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(3)
Extension of time to consent.
An election which is timely filed and would be valid except for the failure to attach the consent of any shareholder to the Form 4876 upon which the election was made or to comply with the 90-day requirement in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph or paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as the case may be, will not be invalid for such reason if it is shown to the satisfaction of the service center that there was a reasonable cause for the failure to file such consent, and if such shareholder files a proper consent to the election within such extended period of time as may be
granted by the Internal Revenue Service. In the case of a late filing of a consent, a copy of the Form 4876 or statement of election shall be attached to such consent and shall be filed with the same service center as the election. The form of such consent shall be the same as that set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. In no event can any consent be made pursuant to this paragraph on or after the last day of the first taxable year for which a corporation elects to be treated as a DISC.
(c)
Consent by holder of transferred shares
—(1)
In general.
If a shareholder of a corporation transfers—
(i) Prior to the first day of the first taxable year for which such corporation elects to be treated as a DISC, some or all of the shares held by him without having consented to such election, or
(ii) On or before the 90th day after the first day of the first taxable year for which such corporation elects to be treated as a DISC, some or all of the shares held by him as of the first day of such year (or if later, held by him as of the time such shares are issued), without having consented to such election, then consent may be made by any recipient of such shares on or before the 90th day after the first day of such first taxable year. If such recipient fails to file his consent on or before such 90th day, an extension of time for filing such consent may be granted in the manner, and subject to the conditions, described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. In addition, if the transfer occurs more than 90 days after the first day of such taxable year, an extension of time for filing such consent may be granted to such recipient only if it is determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section that an extension of time would have been granted the transferor for the filing of such consent if the transfer had not occurred. A consent which is not attached to the original Form 4876 or statement of election (as the case may be) shall be filed with the same service center as the original Form 4876 or statement of election and shall have attached a copy of such original form or statement of election. The form of such consent shall be the same as that set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. For the purposes of this paragraph, a transfer of shares includes any sale, exchange, or other disposition, including a transfer by gift or at death.
(2)
Requirement for the filing of an amended form 4876 or statement of election.
In any case in which a consent to a corporation's election to be treated as a DISC is made pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, such corporation must file an amended form 4876 or statement of election (as the case may be) reflecting all changes in ownership of shares. Such form must be filed with the same service center with which the original form 4876 or statement of election was filed by such corporation.
(d)
Effect of election
—(1)
Effect on corporation.
A valid election to be treated as a DISC remains in effect (without regard to whether the electing corporation qualifies as a DISC for a particular year) until terminated by any of the methods provided in paragraph (e) of this section. While such election is in effect, the electing corporation is subject to sections 991 through 997 and other provisions of the code applicable to DISC's for any taxable year for which it qualifies as a DISC (or is treated as qualifying as a DISC pursuant to section 992(a)(2)). Such corporation is also subject to such provisions for any taxable year for which it is treated as a former DISC as a result of qualifying or being treated as a DISC for any taxable year for which such election was in effect.
(2)
Effect on shareholders.
A valid election by a corporation to be treated as a DISC subjects the shareholders of such corporation to the provisions of section 995 (relating to the taxation of the shareholders of a DISC or former DISC) and to all other provisions of the code relating to the shareholders of a DISC or former DISC. Such provisions of the code apply to any person who is a shareholder of a DISC or former DISC whether or not such person was a shareholder at the time the corporation elected to become a DISC.
(e)
Termination of election
—(1)
In general.
An election to be treated as a DISC is terminated only as provided in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph.
(2)
Revocation of election
—(i)
Manner of revocation.
An election by a corporation to be treated as a DISC may be revoked by the corporation for any taxable year of the corporation after the first taxable year for which the election is effective. Such revocation shall be made by the corporation filing a statement that the corporation revokes its election under section 992(b) to be treated as a DISC. Such statement shall indicate the corporation's name, address, employer identification number, and the first taxable year of the corporation for which the revocation is to be effective. The statement shall be signed by any person authorized to sign a corporation return under section 6062. Such revocation shall be filed with the service center with which the corporation filed its election, except that, if it filed an annual information return under section 6011(e)(2), the revocation shall be filed with the service center with which it filed its last such return.
(ii)
Years for which revocation is effective.
If a corporation files a statement revoking its election to be treated as a DISC during the first 90 days of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which such election is effective), such revocation will be effective for such taxable year and all taxable years thereafter. If the corporation files a statement revoking its election to be treated as a DISC after the first 90 days of a taxable year, the revocation will be effective for all taxable years following such taxable year.
(3)
Continued failure to be a DISC.
If a corporation which has elected to be treated as a DISC does not qualify as a DISC (and is not treated as a DISC pursuant to section 992(a)(2)) for each of any 5 consecutive taxable years, such election terminates and will not be effective for any taxable year after such 5th taxable year. Such termination will be effective automatically, without notice to such corporation or to the Internal Revenue Service. If, during any 5-year period for which an election is effective, the corporation should qualify as a DISC (or be treated as a DISC pursuant to section 992(a)(2)) for a taxable year, a new 5-year period shall automatically start at the beginning of the following taxable year.
(4)
Election after termination.
If a corporation has made a valid election to be treated as a DISC and such election terminates in either manner described in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph, such corporation is eligible to reelect to be treated as a DISC at any time by following the procedures described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. If a corporation terminates its election and subsequently reelects to be treated as a DISC, the corporation and its shareholders continue to be subject to sections 995 and 996 with respect to the period during which its first election was in effect. Thus, for example, distributions upon disqualification includible in the gross incomes of shareholders of a corporation pursuant to section 995(b)(2) continue to be so includible for taxable years for which a second election of such corporation is in effect without regard to the second election.
[T.D. 7237, 37 FR 28626, Dec. 28, 1972]
§ 12.8
Elections with respect to net leases of real property.
(a)
In general.
The elections described in this section are available for determining whether real property held by the taxpayer is subject to a net lease for purposes of section 57 (relating to items of tax preference for purposes of the minimum tax for tax preferences) or 163(d) (relating to limitation on interest on investment indebtedness). Under sections 57(c)(1)(A) and 163(d)(4)(A)(i), property will be considered to be subject to a net lease for a taxable year where the sum of the deductions of the lessor with respect to the property for the taxable year allowable solely by reason of section 162 (other than rents and reimbursed amounts with respect to the property) is less than 15 percent of the gross income from rents produced by the property (hereinafter referred to as the “expense test”). Under sections 57(c)(2) and 163(d)(7)(A), where a parcel of real property of the taxpayer is leased under two or more leases, the taxpayer may elect to apply the expense test set forth in sections 57(c)(1)(A) and 163(d)(4)(A)(i) by treating all leased portions of such property as subject to a single lease. Under sections 57(c)(3) and 163(d)(7)(B), at the election of the
taxpayer, the expense test set forth in sections 57(c)(1)(A) and 163(d)(4)(A)(i) shall not apply with respect to real property of the taxpayer which has been in use for more than 5 years.
(b)
Election with respect to multiple leases of single parcel of real property.
If a parcel of real property of the taxpayer is leased under two or more leases, the expense test referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall, at the election of the taxpayer, be applied by treating all leased portions of such property as subject to a single lease. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “parcel of real property” includes adjacent properties each of which is subject to lease.
(c)
Election with respect to real property in use for more than 5 years.
At the election of the taxpayer, the expense test referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply with respect to real property of the taxpayer which has been in use for more than 5 years. For this purpose, real property is in use only during the period that such property is both owned and used for commercial purposes by the taxpayer. If an improvement to the property was made during the time such property was owned by the taxpayer, and if, as a result of such improvement, the adjusted basis of such property was increased by 50 percent or more, use of such property for commercial purposes shall be deemed to have commenced for purposes of this paragraph as of the date such improvement was completed. An election under this paragraph shall apply to all real property of the taxpayer which has been in use for more than 5 years.
(d)
Procedure for making election
—(1)
Time and scope of election.
An election under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be made for each taxable year to which such election is to apply. The election must be made before the later of (i) the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's return for the taxable year for which the election is made (determined with regard to any extension of time) or (ii) August 31, 1973, but the election may not be made after the expiration of the time prescribed by law for the filing of a claim for credit or refund of tax with respect to the taxable year for which the election is to apply.
(2)
Manner of making election.
Except as provided in the following sentence, an election by the taxpayer with respect to a taxable year shall be made by a statement containing the information described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section which is—
(i) Attached to the taxpayer's return or amended return for such taxable year,
(ii) Attached to a timely filed claim by the taxpayer for credit or refund of tax for such taxable year, or
(iii) Filed by the taxpayer with the director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the return for such taxable year was filed.
In the case of a taxable year ending before July 1, 1973, no formal statement of election is necessary if the taxpayer's return took into account an election under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section; the taxpayer will be considered to have made an election in accordance with the manner in which leases with respect to parcels of real property described in paragraph (b) of this section, or leases of property which has been in use for more than 5 years as described in paragraph (c) of this section, are treated in the return.
(3)
Statement.
The statement described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall contain the following information:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer;
(ii) The taxable year to which the election is to apply if the statement is not attached to the return or a claim for credit or refund;
(iii) A description of any leases which are to be treated as a single lease; and
(iv) A description of any real property in use for more than 5 years to which the expense test is not to apply.
(4)
Revocation of election.
An election made pursuant to this paragraph may be revoked within the time prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for making an election and may not be revoked thereafter. Any such revocation shall be made in the manner prescribed by paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the making of an election.
(e)
Election by members of partnership.
Under section 703(b) (as amended by
section 304(c) of the Revenue Act of 1971), any election under section 57(c) or 163(d)(7) with respect to property held by a partnership shall be made by each partner separately, rather than by the partnership. If an election made by a taxpayer under paragraph (b) of this section applies in whole or in part to property held by a partnership, the taxpayer shall, in applying the expense test referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, take into account his distributive share of the deductions of the partnership with respect to the property for the taxable year allowable solely by reason of section 162 (other than rents and reimbursed amounts with respect to the property) and also his distributive share of the partnership's rental income from such property for the taxable year.

§ 12.9
Election to postpone determination with respect to the presumption described in section 183(d).
(a)
In general.
An individual, electing small business corporation, trust or estate may elect in accordance with the rules set forth in this section to postpone a determination whether the presumption described in section 183(d) applies with respect to any activity in which the taxpayer engages until after the close of the fourth taxable year (sixth taxable year, in the case of an activity described in § 1.183-1(c)(3)) following the taxable year in which the taxpayer first engages in such activity. The election must be made in accordance with the applicable requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, an election made pursuant to this section shall be binding for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer first engages in the activity and for all subsequent taxable years in the five (or seven) year period referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer shall be treated as not having engaged in an activity during any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.
(b)
Period to which an election applies.
An individual, trust, estate, or small business corporation may make the election. The five year presumption period (seven year presumption period in the case of an activity described in § 1.183-1(c)(3)) to which the election shall apply shall be the five (or seven) consecutive taxable years of such taxpayer beginning with the taxable year in which such taxpayer first engages in the activity. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer who engages in an activity as a partner, engages in it in each of his taxable years with or within which ends a partnership year during which the activity was carried on by the partnership.
(c)
Time for making an election.
A taxpayer who is an individual, trust, estate or small business corporation may make the election provided in § 183(e) by filing the statement and consents required by paragraph (d) of this section within—
(1) 3 years after the due date of such taxpayer's return (determined without extensions) for the taxable year in which such taxpayer first engages in the activity, but not later than
(2) 60 days after such taxpayer receives a written notice (if any) from a district director that the district director proposes to disallow deductions attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit under section 183.
The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall in no event be construed to extend the period described in (c)(1) of this section for making such election. Notwithstanding the time periods prescribed in paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section, if no election has been made before a suit or proceeding described in section 7422(a) is maintained or a petition is filed in the Tax Court for a redetermination of a deficiency for any taxable year within the presumption period to which the election would apply, no election may be made except with the consent of the Commissioner which will not be given unless no appreciable delay in the suit or proceeding will be caused.
(d)
Manner of making election.
(1) The election shall be made by the individual, trust, estate, or electing small business corporation, as the case may be, engaged in the activity, by filing a statement which sets forth the following information—
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of such taxpayer, and, if applicable, of the partnership in which he engages in the activity,
(ii) A declaration stating that the taxpayer elects to postpone a determination as to whether the presumption described in section 183(d) applies until after the close of the taxpayer's fourth taxable year (sixth taxable year, in the case of an activity described in § 1.183-1(c)(3)) following the taxable year in which the taxpayer first engaged in such activity and identifying that first such taxable year, and,
(iii) A description of each activity (as defined in § 1.183-1(d)(1)) with respect to which the election is being made.
(2) For an election to be effective, there must be attached to the statement properly executed consents, in the form prescribed by the Commissioner, extending the period prescribed by section 6501 for the assessment of any tax to a date which is not earlier than 18 months after the due date of the return (determined without extensions) for the final year in the presumption period to which the election applies, as follows:
(i) Consents for each of the taxpayer's taxable years in the presumption period to which the election applies,
(ii) If the election is made by an electing small business corporation, a consent of each person who is a shareholder during any taxable year to which the election applies, for each of such shareholder's taxable years with or within which end each of the corporation's taxable years in the presumption period,
(iii) If a taxpayer referred to in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section or shareholder referred to in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is married at the time of the election, in the case of his present spouse, a consent for each of such spouse's taxable years which correspond to the taxable years (other than prior years of the shareholder during no part of which he was a shareholder) for which consents are required by paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section as the case may be. Such consents shall not be construed to shorten the period described in section 6501 for any taxable year within the presumption period to which the election applies.
(3) The statement, with the required consents attached, shall be filed—
(i) With the service center at which the taxpayer making the election is required to file his return, or
(ii) If the taxpayer is notified by a district director that, pursuant to section 183 he is proposing to disallow deductions with respect to an activity not engaged in for profit, with such district director.
(e)
Subsequent invalidations.
If, after a timely election has been made, but still within the presumption period, a suit or proceeding (as described in section 7422(a)) is maintained by the electing taxpayer, a shareholder referred to in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, or spouse referred to in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section for any taxable year for which a consent is required by this section and the taxpayer, shareholder, or spouse has not been issued a notice of deficiency (as described in section 6212(a)) with respect to such taxable year, such election shall not be effective to postpone the determination whether the presumption applies, for such taxable year, but the consents extending the statute of limitations filed with the election shall not thereby be invalidated. The immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to a suit or proceeding maintained by the spouse of an electing taxpayer for a taxable year for which such spouse has filed a separate return, or a suit or proceeding maintained by a shareholder for a taxable year in which he was not such a shareholder. An election by an individual taxpayer or electing small business corporation, shall be subsequently invalidated for all years in the presumption period to which it had applied if—
(1) The electing taxpayer or shareholder taxpayer files a joint return for one of the first three (five, in the case of an activity described in § 1.183-1(c) (3)) taxable years in such presumption period, and
(2) The spouse with whom he files such joint return has not previously executed a consent described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, and
(3) Within one year after the filing of such joint return (or, if later, 90 days
after March 14, 1974), such spouse has not filed a consent described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
An election by an electing small business corporation shall be invalidated for all years in the presumption period to which it applies if a person who was not a shareholder on the date of election becomes a shareholder during the first three (or five) years of the presumption period to which the election applies and does not, within 90 days after the date on which he becomes a shareholder (or, if later, 90 days after March 14, 1974), file a consent required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Invalidation of the election by operation of this paragraph will in no case affect the validity of the consents filed with such election.
(f)
Extension of time for filing election in hardship cases.
The Commissioner may upon application by a taxpayer, consent to an extension of time prescribed in this section for making an election if he finds that such an extension would be justified by hardship incurred by reason of the time at which this section is published. The burden will be on the taxpayer to establish that under the relevant facts the Commissioner should so consent.

Distribution of money in lieu of fractional shares.

§§ 13.0-13.9
[Reserved]
§ 13.10
Distribution of money in lieu of fractional shares.
(a)
In general.
(1) Under the general rule of section 305, as amended by section 421(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, gross income does not include the amount of any distribution of the stock (or rights to acquire the stock) of a corporation made by such corporation to its shareholders with respect to its stock. Under an exception to the general rule, a distribution by a corporation of its stock or rights to acquire its stock is treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies if the distribution (or a series of distributions of which such distribution is one) has the result of (i) the receipt of money or other property by some shareholders, and (ii) an increase in the proportionate interests of other shareholders in the assets or earnings and profits of the corporation. Also, the Secretary or his delegate is directed to prescribe regulations under which a redemption which is treated as a distribution to which section 301 applies, or any other transaction having a similar effect on the interest of any shareholder, shall be treated as a distribution with respect to any shareholder whose proportionate interest in the assets or earnings and profits of the corporation is increased by such redemption or transaction.
(2) The general rule, and not the exception, applies in the case where cash is distributed in lieu of fractional shares to which the shareholders would otherwise be entitled, provided the purpose in distributing the cash is to save the distributing corporation the trouble, expense, and inconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares (or scrip representing fractional shares), or issuing full shares representing the sum of fractional shares, and not to give any particular group of shareholders an increased interest in the assets or earnings and profits of the corporation.
(b)
Illustration.
The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation X is a large corporation whose stock is widely held by the public, no one shareholder owning more than 10 percent of the outstanding stock. The stock is listed on a recognized exchange and is currently selling at less than $75 per share. During the year the corporation pays a 3-percent stock dividend. Cash is paid to each shareholder in lieu of a fractional share to which he would otherwise be entitled. The distribution of cash in lieu of fractional shares is not intended to give any particular group of shareholders an increased interest in the assets or earnings and profits of the corporation, but is intended to save the corporation the trouble, expense, and inconvenience of issuing and transferring scrip representing
fractional shares. The general rule, and not the exception, applies in this situation.

§ 13.11
Revocation of election to report income on the installment basis.
(a)
In general.
Under section 453(c)(4) taxpayers who are dealers in personal property and who elected installment-basis income reporting, subject to the provisions of section 453(c)(1) (relating to change from accrual to installment basis), may revoke their previously made election.
(b)
Time and manner of revoking election.
The revocation by a taxpayer may be made by filing an amended return on an appropriate form or forms, such as Form 1040X for an individual taxpayer, for the year of change (the first year for which income was computed using the installment basis) and for each subsequent year for which a return was filed using the installment basis. The taxpayer should indicate on such amended returns that he is revoking an election to report income on the installment basis. Such revocation must be made within 3 years from the last date prescribed for the filing of the return for the year of change including any extension of time granted the taxpayer. In reporting income on the amended returns described in this section, the taxpayer shall use the accrual method of accounting.

§ 15.0-1
Scope of regulations in this part.
The regulations in this part relate to expenditures of the type described in section 615(a) or in section 617(a)(1) paid or incurred after September 12, 1966. The regulations in this part do not apply to the income tax treatment of mining exploration expenditures paid or incurred before September 13, 1966, and no election made pursuant to the provisions of the regulations in this part shall have any effect on the income tax treatment of exploration expenditures paid or incurred before such date. See § 15.1-4 for rules relating to treatment of exploration expenditures paid or incurred during taxable years beginning before September 13, 1966, and ending after September 12, 1966.
§ 15.1-1
Elections to deduct.
(a)
Manner of making election
—(1)
Election to deduct under section 617(a).
The election to deduct exploration expenditures as expenses under section 617(a) may be made by deducting such expenditures in the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, for which the taxpayer desires to deduct exploration expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during such taxable year and after September 12, 1966. This election may be exercised by deducting such expenditures either in the taxpayer's return for such taxable year or in an amended return filed before the expiration of the period for filing a claim for credit or refund of income tax for such taxable year. Where the election is made in an amended return for a taxable year prior to the most recent year for which the taxpayer has filed a return, the taxpayer shall file amended income tax returns, reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the election, for all taxable years affected by the election. See section 617(a)(2)(C) for provisions relating to the tolling of the statute of limitations for the assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year, to the extent the deficiency is attributable to an election under section 617(a). In applying the election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments
resulting from the election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as the deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign tax credit, net operating loss and other deductions or credits the amount of which is limited by the taxpayer's taxable income, and the effect that adjustments of any such items have on other taxable years. Amended returns filed for taxable years subsequent to the taxable year for which the election under section 617(a) is made by amended return shall apply the recapture provisions of subsections (b)(1)(B), (c), and (d) of section 617.
(2)
Election to deduct under section 615
—(i)
General rule.
The election to deduct exploration expenditures under section 615 shall be made in a statement filed with the district director, or director of the regional service center, with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed. If the election is made within the time period prescribed for filing an income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, during which the taxpayer pays or incurs expenditures which are within the scope of section 615 and which are paid or incurred by him after September 12, 1966, this statement shall be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for such taxable year. If the election is made after the time prescribed for filing such return but before the expiration of the period (described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) for making the election under section 615(e), the statement must be signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative. The statement shall be filed even though the taxpayer charges to capital account all such expenditures paid or incurred by him during such taxable year after such date. The statement shall clearly indicate that the taxpayer elects to have section 615 apply to all amounts deducted by him with respect to mining exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966. If the taxpayer desires, he may file this statement by attaching it to his return for a taxable year prior to the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, in which he pays or incurs mining exploration expenditures. Except as provided, in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, if the taxpayer does not file such a statement within the period prescribed by section 615(e) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, any amounts deducted by him with respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred by him after September 12, 1966, will be deemed to have been deducted pursuant to an election under section 617(a).
(ii)
Exception.
The last sentence of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply if all mining exploration expenditures which are paid or incurred by the taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and which are deducted by him in his income tax return for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, during which he pays or incurs such expenditures are outside the scope of section 617(a). For example, assume that, in his return for his first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, a taxpayer deducts mining exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and does not attach to his return the statement described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. However, all of the exploration expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and before the end of the taxable year were paid or incurred with respect to minerals located neither in the United States nor on the Outer Continental Shelf. The taxpayer will be deemed to have made an election under section 615(e) by deducting all or part of those expenditures as expenses in his income tax return.
(b)
Information to be furnished.
A taxpayer who makes or has made an election under either section 615(e) or section 617(a) to deduct expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, shall indicate clearly on his income tax return for each taxable year for which he deducts any such expenditures the amount of the deduction claimed under section 615 (a) or (b) or section 617(a) with respect to each property or area of interest. Such property or area of interest shall be identified by a description sufficiently adequate to permit application of the recapture rules of section 617 (b), (c), and (d) and the rules of section 615(g) (relating to effect of transfer of mineral property).
(c)
Effect of election.
A taxpayer who has made an election under section 615(e) may never make an election under section 617(a) unless, within the period set forth in section 615(e) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 15.1-2, he revokes his election under section 615(e). A taxpayer who has made an election under section 617(a) may never make an election under section 615(e) unless, within the period set forth in section 615(e) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 15.1-2, he revokes his election under section 617(a). A taxpayer who has made, and has not revoked, an election under section 617(a) may not, in his return for the taxable year for which the election is made or for any subsequent taxable year, charge to capital account any expenditures which are within the scope of section 617(a), and he must deduct all such expenditures as expenses. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.615-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations), a taxpayer who makes an election under 615(e) may not change his treatment of exploration expenditures deducted, deferred, or capitalized pursuant to such election unless he revokes the election made under section 615(e).
(d)
Time for making election
—(1)
Election under section 615(e).
A taxpayer may not make an election under section 615(e) after the expiration of the 3-year period beginning with the date prescribed by section 6072 or other provision of law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, in which the taxpayer pays or incurs expenditures to which section 615(a) would apply if an election were made under section 615(e). This 3-year period shall be determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the taxpayer's income tax return. An election under section 615(e) may not be made after the expiration of the 3-year period even though the taxpayer charged to capital account, or erroneously deducted as development expenditures under section 616, all mine exploration expenditures paid or incurred by him after September 12, 1966, and before the end of his first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, in which he paid or incurred such expenditures.
(2)
Election under section 617(a).
The election under section 617(a) may be made at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed for filing a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 for the first taxable year for which the taxpayer desires to deduct exploration expenditures under section 617.
(3)
Timely mailing treated as timely filing.
Section 7502 (relating to timely mailing treated as timely filing) shall apply in determining the date when an election under either section 615(e) or section 617(a) is made.

A taxpayer may revoke an election made by him under section 615(e) or section 617(a) by filing with the internal revenue officer with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed, within the periods set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, a statement, signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative, which sets forth that the taxpayer is revoking the election previously made by him with respect to the deduction of mining exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and states with whom the document making the election was filed. A taxpayer revoking such an election shall file amended income tax returns, reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the revocation of election, for all taxable years affected by the revocation of election. See section 617(a)(2)(C) for provisions relating to the tolling of the statute of limitations for the assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year, to the extent the deficiency is attributable to an election or revocation of election under section 617(a). In applying the revocation of an election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the revocation of election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as the deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and other deductions or credits the amount of which is limited by the
taxpayer's taxable income, and the effect that adjustments of any such items have on other taxable years.
(b)
Time for revoking election
—(1)
Election under section 615(e).
An election under section 615(e) may be revoked at any time before the expiration of the 3-year period described in paragraph (d)(1) of § 15.1-1. Such an election may not be revoked after the expiration of the 3-year period.
(2)
Election under section 617(a).
An election under section 617(a) may be revoked before the expiration of the last day of the third month following the month in which the final regulations issued under the authority of section 617 are published in the
Federal Register.
After the expiration of this period, a taxpayer who has made an election under section 617(a) may not revoke that election unless he obtains the consent of the Secretary or his delegate in the manner to be set forth in the final regulations under section 617.
(c)
Additional information to be furnished by a transferor of mineral property.
If, before revoking his election, the taxpayer has transferred any mineral property with respect to which he deducted exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, to another person in a transaction as a result of which the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, the statement submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall state that such property has been so transferred and shall identify the transferee, the property transferred, and the date of the transfer.
§ 15.1-3
Elections as to method of recapture.
(a)
In general.
If the taxpayer so elects with respect to all mines with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 617(a) and which reach the producing stage during a taxable year, he shall include in gross income for the taxable year an amount equal to the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such mines (determined under section 617(f)(1)). The amount so included in income shall be treated for purposes of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code as expenditures which are paid or incurred on the respective dates on which the mines reach the producing stage and which are properly chargeable to capital account. If the taxpayer does not make this election for a taxable year during which any mine with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 617(a) reaches the producing stage, the deduction for depletion under section 611 with respect to the property (whether determined under § 1.611-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations) or under section 613) shall be disallowed until the amount of depletion which would be allowable but for section 617(b)(1)(B) equals the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the mine. The fact that a taxpayer does not make the election described in the first sentence of this paragraph for a taxable year during which mines with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 617(a) reach the producing stage shall not preclude the taxpayer from making the election with respect to other mines which reach the producing stage during a subsequent taxable year. However, an election may not be made for any taxable year with respect to any mines which reached the producing stage during a preceding taxable year.
(b)
Manner of making elections.
A taxpayer will be considered to have made an election in accordance with the manner in which the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the mines reaching the producing stage during a taxable year are treated in his return for such taxable year.
(c)
Time for making election.
The election described in paragraph (a) of this section may be made, or changed by filing an amended return, not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year.
§ 15.1-4
Special rules.
(a)
Taxable years beginning before September 13, 1966, and ending after September 12, 1966
—(1)
General rule.
An election made under section 615(e) or section 617(a) applies only to expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966. The income tax treatment of exploration expenditures paid or incurred
before September 13, 1966, will be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 615 prior to its amendment by the Act of September 12, 1966 (Pub. L. 89-570, 80 Stat. 759). If a taxpayer makes an election under section 615(e) in his income tax return for a taxable year beginning before September 13, 1966, and ending after September 12, 1966, amounts deducted under section 615 with respect to expenditures paid or incurred during such taxable year but before September 13, 1966, will be taken into account in determining whether the $100,000 limitation set forth in section 615(a) is reached during 1966. Similarly, a taxpayer making an election under section 615(e) shall take into account expenditures deducted under section 615 for periods prior to September 13, 1966, in determining when the $400,000 overall limitation set forth in section 615(c) is reached. The fact that a taxpayer deducts under section 615 expenditures paid or incurred prior to September 13, 1966, shall not affect his right to make an election under section 617(a) to deduct under section 617 expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966.
(2)
Allocation in case of inadequate records.
If a taxpayer pays or incurs exploration expenditures during a taxable year beginning before September 13, 1966, and ending after September 12, 1966, but his records as to any mine or property are inadequate to permit a determination of the amount paid or incurred during the portion of the year ending after September 12, 1966, and the amount paid or incurred on or before such date, the exploration expenditures as to which the records are inadequate paid or incurred with respect to the mine or property during the taxable year shall be allocated to each part year (that is, the part occurring before September 13, 1966, and the part occurring after September 12, 1966) in the ratio which the number of days in such part year bears the number of days in the entire taxable year. For example, if the records of a calendar year taxpayer for 1966 are inadequate to permit a determination of the amount of exploration expenditures paid or incurred with respect to a certain mine or property after September 12, 1966, and the amount paid or incurred before September 13, 1966,
255/365
of the total exploration expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer with respect to the mine or property during 1966 shall be allocated to the period beginning January 1, 1966, and ending September 12, 1966, and
110/365
of the total exploration expenditures paid or incurred with respect to the mine or property during 1966 shall be allocated to the period beginning September 13, 1966, and ending December 31, 1966.
(3)
Partnership elections.
With respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred by a partnership before September 13, 1966, the option to deduct under section 615(a) and the election to defer under section 615(b) shall be made by the partnership, rather than by the individual partners. All elections under sections 615(e), 617(a), or 617(b) as to the tax treatment of a partner's distributive share of exploration expenditures paid or incurred by any partnership of which he is a member shall be made by the individual partner, rather than by the partnership.
(b)
Effect of transfer of mineral property.
The binding effect of a taxpayer's election under section 615(e) shall not be affected by his receiving property with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 617(a). The binding effect of a taxpayer's election under section 617(a) shall not be affected by his receiving property with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 615 pursuant to an election made under section 615(e). However, see section 615(g)(2) for rules under which amounts deducted under section 615 by a transferor may be subject to recapture in the hands of a transferee who has made an election under section 617(a).

Taxable years affected.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided, the provisions of § 15a.453-1 (a) through (e) generally apply to installment method reporting for sales of real property and casual sales of personal property occurring after October 19, 1980. See 26 CFR § 1.453-1 (rev. as of April 1, 1980) for the provisions relating to installment method reporting for sales of real property and casual sales before October 20, 1980 (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) and for provisions relating to installment sales by dealers in personal property occurring before October 20, 1980.
(b)
Certain limitations.
The provisions of prior law (section 453(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, in effect as of October 18, 1980) which required that the buyer receive no more than 30 percent of the selling price in the taxable year of the installment sale and that at least two payments be received shall not apply to reporting for casual installment sales of personal property and installment sales of real property occurring in a taxable year ending after October 19, 1980.
[T.D. 7768, 46 FR 10709, Feb. 4, 1981; 46 FR 43036, Aug. 26, 1981]
§ 15a.453-1
Installment method reporting for sales of real property and casual sales of personal property.
(a)
In general.
Unless the taxpayer otherwise elects in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, income from a sale of real property or a casual sale of personal property, where any payment is to be received in a taxable year after the year of sale, is to be reported on the installment method.
(b)
Installment sale defined
—(1)
In general.
The term “installment sale” means a disposition of property (except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) where at least one payment is to be received after the close of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. The term “installment sale” includes dispositions from which payment is to be received in a lump sum in a taxable year subsequent to the year of sale. For purposes of this paragraph, the taxable year in which payments are to be received is to be determined without regard to section 453(e) (relating to related party sales), section (f)(3) (relating to the definition of a “payment”) and section (g) (relating to sales of depreciable property to a spouse or 80-percent-owned entity).
(2)
Installment method defined
—(i)
In general.
Under the installment method, the amount of any payment which is income to the taxpayer is that portion of the installment payment received in that year which the gross profit realized or to be realized bears to the total contract price (the “gross profit ratio”). See paragraph (c) of this section for rules describing installment method reporting of contingent payment sales.
(ii)
Selling price defined.
The term “selling price” means the gross selling price without reduction to reflect any existing mortgage or other encumbrance on the property (whether assumed or taken subject to by the buyer) and, for installment sales in taxable years ending after October 19, 1980, without reduction to reflect any selling expenses. Neither interest, whether stated or unstated, nor original issue discount is considered to be a part of the selling price. See paragraph (c) of this section for rules describing installment method reporting of contingent payment sales.
(iii)
Contract price defined.
The term “contract price” means the total contract price equal to selling price reduced by that portion of any qualifying indebtedness (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section), assumed or taken subject to by the buyer, which does not exceed the seller's basis in the property (adjusted, for installment sales in taxable years ending after October 19, 1980, to reflect commissions and other selling expenses as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section). See paragraph (c) of this section for rules describing installment method reporting of contingent payment sales.
(iv)
Qualifying indebtedness.
The term “qualifying indebtedness” means a mortgage or other indebtedness encumbering the property and indebtedness, not secured by the property but incurred or assumed by the purchaser incident to the purchaser's acquisition, holding, or operation in the ordinary
course of business or investment, of the property. The term “qualifying indebtedness” does not include an obligation of the taxpayer incurred incident to the disposition of the property (e.g., legal fees relating to the taxpayer's sale of the property) or an obligation functionally unrelated to the acquisition, holding, or operating of the property (e.g., the taxpayer's medical bill). Any obligation created subsequent to the taxpayer's acquisition of the property and incurred or assumed by the taxpayer or placed as an encumbrance on the property in contemplation of disposition of the property is not qualifying indebtedness if the arrangement results in accelerating recovery of the taxpayer's basis in the installment sale.
(v)
Gross profit defined.
The term “gross profit” means the selling price less the adjusted basis as defined in section 1011 and the regulations thereunder. For sales in taxable years ending after October 19, 1980, in the case of sales of real property by a person other than a dealer and casual sales of personal property, commissions and other selling expenses shall be added to basis for purposes of determining the proportion of payments which is gross profit attributable to the disposition. Such additions to basis will not be deemed to affect the taxpayer's holding period in the transferred property.
(3)
Payment
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section (relating to purchaser evidences of indebtedness payable on demand or readily tradable), the term “payment” does not include the receipt of evidences of indebtedness of the person acquiring the property (“installment obligation”), whether or not payment of such indebtedness is guaranteed by a third party (including a government agency). For special rules regarding the receipt of an evidence of indebtedness of a transferee of a qualified intermediary, see §§ 1.1031(b)-2(b) and 1.1031(k)-1(j)(2)(iii) of this chapter. A standby letter of credit (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) shall be treated as a third party guarantee. Payments include amounts actually or constructively received in the taxable year under an installment obligation. For a special rule regarding a transfer of property to a qualified intermediary followed by the sale of such property by the qualified intermediary, see § 1.1031(k)-1(j)(2)(ii) of this chapter. Receipt of an evidence of indebtedness which is secured directly or indirectly by cash or a cash equivalent, such as a bank certificate of deposit or a treasury note, will be treated as the receipt of payment. For a special rule regarding a transfer of property in exchange for an obligation that is secured by cash or a cash equivalent held in a qualified escrow account or a qualified trust, see § 1.1031(k)-1(j)(2)(i) of this chapter. Payment may be received in cash or other property, including foreign currency, marketable securities, and evidences or indebtedness which are payable on demand or readily tradable. However, for special rules relating to the receipt of certain property with respect to which gain is not recognized, see paragraph (f) of this section (relating to transactions described in sections 351, 356(a) and 1031). Except as provided in § 15a.453-2 of these regulations (relating to distributions of installment obligations in corporate liquidations described in section 337), payment includes receipt of an evidence of indebtedness of a person other than the person acquiring the property from the taxpayer. For purposes of determining the amount of payment received in the taxable year, the amount of qualifying indebtedness (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section) assumed or taken subject to by the person acquiring the property shall be included only to the extent that it exceeds the basis of the property (determined after adjustment to reflect selling expenses). For purposes of the preceding sentence, an arrangement under which the taxpayer's liability on qualifying indebtedness is eliminated incident to the disposition (e.g., a novation) shall be treated as an assumption of the qualifying indebtedness. If the taxpayer sells property to a creditor of the taxpayer and indebtedness of the taxpayer is cancelled in consideration of the sale, such cancellation shall be treated as payment. To the extent that cancellation is not in consideration of the sale, see §§ 1.61-12(b)(1) and 1.1001-2(a)(2) relating to
discharges of indebtedness. If the taxpayer sells property which is encumbered by a mortgage or other indebtedness on which the taxpayer is not personally liable, and the person acquiring the property is the obligee, the taxpayer shall be treated as having received payment in the amount of such indebtedness.
(ii)
Wrap-around mortgage.
This paragraph (b)(3)(ii) shall apply generally to any installment sale after March 4, 1981 unless the installment sale was completed before June 1, 1981 pursuant to a written obligation binding on the seller that was executed on or before March 4, 1981. A “wrap-around mortgage” means an agreement in which the buyer initially does not assume and purportedly does not take subject to part or all of the mortgage or other indebtedness encumbering the property (“wrapped indebtedness”) and, instead, the buyer issues to the seller an installment obligation the principal amount of which reflects such wrapped indebtedness. Ordinarily, the seller will use payments received on the installment obligation to service the wrapped indebtedness. The wrapped indebtedness shall be deemed to have been taken subject to even though title to the property has not passed in the year of sale and even though the seller remains liable for payments on the wrapped indebtedness. In the hands of the seller, the wrap-around installment obligation shall have a basis equal to the seller's basis in the property which was the subject of the installment sale, increased by the amount of gain recognized in the year of sale, and decreased by the amount of cash and the fair market value of other nonqualifying property received in the year of sale. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), the amount of any indebtedness assumed or taken subject to by the buyer (other than wrapped indebtedness) is to be treated as cash received by the seller in the year of sale. Therefore, except as otherwise required by section 483 or 1232, the gross profit ratio with respect to the wrap-around installment obligation is a fraction, the numerator of which is the face value of the obligation less the taxpayer's basis in the obligation and the denominator of which is the face value of the obligation.
(iii)
Standby letter of credit.
The term “standby letter of credit” means a non-negotiable, non-transferable (except together with the evidence of indebtedness which it secures) letter of credit, issued by a bank or other financial institution, which serves as a guarantee of the evidence of indebtedness which is secured by the letter of credit. Whether or not the letter of credit explicitly states it is non-negotiable and nontransferable, it will be treated as non-negotiable and nontransferable if applicable local law so provides. The mere right of the secured party (under applicable local law) to transfer the proceeds of a letter of credit shall be disregarded in determining whether the instrument qualifies as a standby letter of credit. A letter of credit is not a standby letter of credit if it may be drawn upon in the absence of default in payment of the underlying evidence of indebtedness.
(4)
Exceptions.
The term “installment sale” does not include, and the provisions of section 453 do not apply to, dispositions of personal property on the installment plan by a person who regularly sells or otherwise disposes of personal property on the installment plan, or to dispositions of personal property of a kind which is required to be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year. See section 453A and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to installment sales by dealers in personal property. A dealer in real property or a farmer who is not required under his method of accounting to maintain inventories may report the gain on the installment method under section 453.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate installment method reporting under this section:

# Example (1).
In 1980, A, a calendar year taxpayer, sells Blackacre, an unencumbered capital asset in A's hands, to B for $100,000: $10,000 down and the remainder payable in equal annual installments over the next 9 years, together with adequate stated interest. A's basis in Blackacre, exclusive of selling expenses, is $38,000. Selling expenses paid by A are $2,000. Therefore, the gross profit is $60,000 ($100,000 selling price−$40,000 basis inclusive of selling expenses). The gross profit ratio is
3/5
(gross profit of $60,000 divided by
$100,000 contract price). Accordingly, $6,000
3/5
of $10,000) of each $10,000 payment received is gain attributable to the sale and $4,000 ($10,000−$6,000) is recovery of basis. The interest received in addition to principal is ordinary income to A.

# Example (2).
C sells Whiteacre to D for a selling price of $160,000. Whiteacre is encumbered by a longstanding mortgage in the principal amount of $60,000. D will assume or take subject to the $60,000 mortgage and pay the remaining $100,000 in 10 equal annual installments together with adequate stated interest. C's basis in Whiteacre is $90,000. There are no selling expenses. The contract price is $100,000, the $160,000 selling price reduced by the mortgage of $60,000 assumed or taken subject to. Gross profit is $70,000 ($160,000 selling price less C's basis of $90,000). C's gross profit ratio is
7/10
(gross profit of $70,000 divided by $100,000 contract price). Thus, $7,000 (
7/10
of $10,000) of each $10,000 annual payment is gain attributable to the sale, and $3,000 ($10,000−$7,000) is recovery of basis.

# Example (3).
The facts are the same as in example (2), except that C's basis in the land is $40,000. In the year of the sale C is deemed to have received payment of $20,000 ($60,000−$40,000, the amount by which the mortgage D assumed or took subject to exceeds C's basis). Since basis is fully recovered in the year of sale, the gross profit ratio is 1 ($120,000/$120,000) and C will report 100% of the $20,000 deemed payment in the year of sale and each $10,000 annual payment as gain attributable to the sale.

# Example (4).
E sells Blackacre, an unencumbered capital gain property in E's hands, to F on January 2, 1981. F makes a cash down payment of $500,000 and issues a note to E obliging F to pay an additional $500,000 on the fifth anniversary date. The note does not require a payment of interest. In determining selling price, section 483 will apply to recharacterize as interest a portion of the $500,000 future payment. Assume that under section 483 and the applicable regulations $193,045 is treated as total unstated interest, and the selling price is $806,955 ($1 million less unstated interest). Assuming E's basis (including selling expenses) in Blackacre is $200,000) gross profit is $606,955 ($806,955−$200,000) and the gross profit ratio is 75.21547%. Accordingly, of the $500,000 cash down payment received by E in 1981, $376,077 (75.21547% of $500,000) is gain attributable to the sale and $123,923 is recovery of basis ($500,000−$376,077).

# Example (5).
In 1982, G sells to H Blackacre, which is encumbered by a first mortgage with a principal amount of $500,000 and a second mortgage with a principal amount of $400,000, for a selling price of $2 million. G's basis in Blackacre is $700,000. Under the agreement between G and H, passage of title is deferred and H does not assume and purportedly does not take subject to either mortgage in the year of sale. H pays G $200,000 in cash and issues a wrap-around mortgage note with a principal amount of $1,800,000 bearing adequate stated interest. H is deemed to have acquired Blackacre subject to the first and second mortgages (wrapped indebtedness) totalling $900,000. The contract price is $1,300,000 (selling price of $2 million less $700,000 mortgages within the seller's basis assumed or taken subject to). Gross profit is also $1,300,000 (selling price of $2 million less $700,000 basis). Accordingly in the year of sale, the gross profit ratio is 1 ($1,300,000/$1,300,000). Payment in the year of sale is $400,000 ($200,000 cash received plus $200,000 mortgage in excess of basis ($900,000−$700,000)). Therefore, G recognizes $400,000 gain in the year of sale ($400,000 × 1). In the hands of G the wrap-around installment obligation has a basis of $900,000, equal to G's basis in Blackacre ($700,000) increased by the gain recognized by G in the year of sale ($400,000) reduced by the cash received by G in the year of sale ($200,000). G's gross profit with respect to the note is $900,000 ($1,800,000 face amount less $900,000 basis in the note) and G's contract price with respect to the note is its face amount of $1,800,000. Therefore, the gross profit ratio with respect to the note is
1/2
($900,000/$1,800,000).

# Example (6).
The facts are the same as example (5) except that under the terms of the agreement H assumes the $500,000 first mortgage on Blackacre. H does not assume and purportedly does not take subject to the $400,000 second mortgage on Blackacre. The wrap-around installment obligation issued by H to G has a face amount of $1,300,000. The tax results in the year of sale to G are the same as example (5) ($400,000 payment received and gain recognized). In the hands of G, basis in the wrap-around installment obligation is $400,000 ($700,000 basis in Blackacre plus $400,000 gain recognized in the year of sale minus $700,000 ($200,000 cash received and $500,000 treated as cash received as a result of H's assumption of the first mortgage)). G's gross profit with respect to the note is $900,000 ($1,300,000 face amount of the wrap-around installment obligation less $400,000 basis in that note) and G's contract price with respect to the note is its face value of $1,300,000. Therefore, the gross profit ratio with respect to the note is
9/13
($900,000/$1,300,000).

# Example (7).
A sells the stock of X corporation to B for a $1 million installment obligation payable in equal annual installments over the next 10 years with adequate stated interest. The installment obligation is secured by a standby letter of credit (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) issued by M bank. Under the agreement between B and M bank, B is required to
maintain a compensating balance in an account B maintains with M bank and is required by the M bank to post additional collateral, which may include cash or a cash equivalent, with M bank. Under neither the standby letter of credit nor any other agreement or arrangement is A granted a direct lien upon or other security interest in such cash or cash equivalent collateral. Receipt of B's installment obligation secured by the standby letter of credit will not be treated as the receipt of payment by A.

# Example (8).
The facts are the same as in example (7) except that the standby letter of credit is in the drawable sum of $600,000. To secure fully its $1 million note issued to A, B deposits in escrow $400,000 in cash and Treasury bills. Under the escrow agreement, upon default in payment of the note A may look directly to the escrowed collateral. Receipt of B's installment obligation will be treated as the receipt payment by A in the sum of $400,000.
(c)
Contingent payment sales
—(1)
In general.
Unless the taxpayer otherwise elects in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, contingent payment sales are to be reported on the installment method. As used in this section, the term “contingent payment sale” means a sale or other disposition of property in which the aggregate selling price cannot be determined by the close of the taxable year in which such sale or other disposition occurs.
The term “contingent payment sale” does not include transactions with respect to which the installment obligation represents, under applicable principles of tax law, a retained interest in the property which is the subject of the transaction, an interest in a joint venture or a partnership, an equity interest in a corporation or similar transactions, regardless of the existence of a stated maximum selling price or a fixed payment term. See paragraph (c)(8) of this section, describing the extent to which the regulations under section 385 apply to the determination of whether an installment obligation represents an equity interest in a corporation.
This paragraph prescribes the rules to be applied in allocating the taxpayer's basis (including selling expenses except for selling expenses of dealers in real estate) to payments received and to be received in a contingent payment sale. The rules are designed appropriately to distinguish contingent payment sales for which a maximum selling price is determinable, sales for which a maximum selling price is not determinable but the time over which payments will be received is determinable, and sales for which neither a maximum selling price nor a definite payment term is determinable. In addition, rules are prescribed under which, in appropriate circumstances, the taxpayer will be permitted to recover basis under an income forecast computation.

Stated maximum selling price
—(i)
In general.
(A) contingent payment sale will be treated as having a stated maximum selling price if, under the terms of the agreement, the maximum amount of sale proceeds that may be received by the taxpayer can be determined as of the end of the taxable year in which the sale or other disposition occurs. The stated maximum selling price shall be determined by assuming that all of the contingencies contemplated by the agreement are met or otherwise resolved in a manner that will maximize the selling price and accelerate payments to the earliest date or dates permitted under the agreement. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) and (7) of this section (relating to certain payment recomputations), the taxpayer's basis shall be allocated to payments received and to be received under a stated maximum selling price agreement by treating the stated maximum selling price as the selling price for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section. The stated maximum selling price, as initially determined, shall thereafter be treated as the selling price unless and until that maximum amount is reduced, whether pursuant to the terms of the original agreement, by subsequent amendment, by application of the payment recharacterization rule (discribed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section), or by a subsequent supervening event such as bankruptcy of the obligor. When the maximum amount is subsequently reduced, the gross profit ratio will be recomputed with respect to payments received in or after the taxable year in which an event requiring reduction occurs. If, however, application of the foregoing
rules in a particular case would substantially and inappropriately accelerate or defer recovery of the taxpayer's basis, a special rule will apply. See paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
(B) The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. In each example, it is assumed that application of the rules illustrated will not substantially and inappropriately defer or accelerate recovery of the taxpayer's basis.

# Example (1).
A sells all of the stock of X corporation to B for $100,000 payable at closing plus an amount equal to 5% of the net profits of X for each of the next nine years, the contingent payments to be made annually together with adequate stated interest. The agreement provides that the maximum amount A may receive, inclusive of the $100,000 down payment but exclusive of interest, shall be $2,000,000. A's basis in the stock of X inclusive of selling expenses, is $200,000. Selling price and contract price are considered to be $2,000,000. Gross profit is $1,800,000, and the gross profit ratio is 9/10 ($1,800,000/$2,000,000). Accordingly, of the $100,000 received by A in the year of sale, $90,000 is reportable as gain attributable to the sale and $10,000 is recovery of basis.

# Example (2).
C owns Blackacre which is encumbered by a long-standing mortgage of $100,000. On January 15, 1981, C sells Blackacre to D under the following payment arrangement: $100,000 in cash on closing; nine equal annual installment payments of $100,000 commencing January 15, 1982; and nine annual payments (the first to be made on March 30, 1982) equal to 5% of the gross annual rental receipts from Blackacre generated during the preceding calendar year. The agreement provides that each deferred payment shall be accompanied by a payment of interest calculated at the rate of 12% per annum and that the maximum amount payable to C under the agreement (exclusive of interest) shall be $2,100,000. The agreement also specifies that D will assume the long-standing mortgage. C's basis (inclusive of selling expenses) in Blackacre is $300,000. Accordingly, selling price is $2,100,000 and contract price is $2,000,000 (selling price of $2,100,000 less the $100,000 mortgage). The gross profit ratio is 9/10 (gross profit of $1,800,000 divided by $2,000,000 contract price). Of the $100,000 cash payment received by C in 1981, $90,000 is gain attributable to the sale of Blackacre and $10,000 is recovery of basis.
(ii)
Certain interest recomputations.
When interest is stated in the contingent price sale agreement at a rate equal to or greater than the applicable prescribed test rate referred to in § 1.483-1(d)(1)(ii) and such stated interest is payable in addition to the amounts otherwise payable under the agreement, such stated interest is not considered a part of the selling price. In other circumstances (
i.e.,
section 483 is applicable because no interest is stated or interest is stated below the applicable test rate, or interest is stated under a payment recharacterization provision of the sale agreement), the special rule set forth in this (ii) shall be applied in the initial computation and subsequent recomputations of selling price, contract price, and gross profit ratio. The special rule is referred to in this section as the “price-interest recomputation rule.” As used in this section, the term “payment recharacterization” refers to a contractual arrangement under which a computed amount otherwise payable as part of the selling price is denominated an interest payment. The amount of unstated interest determined under section 483 or (if section 483 is inapplicable in the particular case) the amount of interest determined under a payment recharacterization arrangement is collectively referred to in this section as “internal interest” amounts. The price-interest recomputation rule is applicable to any stated maximum selling price agreement which contemplates receipt of internal interest by the taxpayer. Under the rule, stated maximum selling price will be determined as of the end of the taxpayer's taxable year in which the sale or other disposition occurs, taking into account all events which have occurred and are subject to prompt subsequent calculation and verification and assuming that all amounts that may become payable under the agreement will be paid on the earliest date or dates permitted under the agreement. With respect to the year of sale, the amount (if any) of internal interest then shall be determined taking account of the respective components of that calculation. The maximum amount initially calculated, minus the internal interest so determined, is the initial stated maximum selling price under the price-interest recomputation rule. For each subsequent taxable year, stated maximum selling price (and thus selling price, contract price, and gross profit
ratio) shall be recomputed, taking into account all events which have occurred and are subject to prompt subsequent calculation and verification and assuming that all amounts that may become payable under the agreement will be paid on the earliest date or dates permitted under the agreement. The redetermined gross profit ratio, adjusted to reflect payments received and gain recognized in prior taxable years, shall be applied to payments received in that taxable year.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate installment method reporting of a contingent payment sale under which there is a stated maximum selling price. In each example, it is assumed that application of the rules described will not substantially and inappropriately defer or accelerate recovery of the taxpayer's basis.

# Example (1).
A owns all of the stock of X corporation with a basis to A of $20 million. On July 1, 1981, A sells the stock of X to B under an agreement calling for fifteen annual payments respectively equal to 5% of the net profits of X earned in the immediately preceding fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending March 31, 1982. Each payment is to be made on the following June 15th, commencing June 15, 1982, together with adequate stated interest. The agreement specifies that the maximum amount (exclusive of interest) payable to A shall not exceed $60 million. Since stated interest is payable as an addition to the selling price and the specified rate is not below the section 483 test rate, there is no internal interest under the agreement. The stated maximum selling price is $60 million. The gross profit ratio is
2/3
(gross profit of $40 million divided by $60 million contract price). Thus, if on June 15, 1982, A receives a payment of $3 million (exclusive of interest) under the agreement, in that year A will report $2 million ($3 million ×
2/3
) as gain attributable to the sale, and $1 million as recovery of basis.

# Example (2).
(i) The facts are the same as in example (1) except that the agreement does not call for the payment of any stated interest but does provide for an initial cash payment of $3 million on July 1, 1981. The maximum amount payable, including the $3 million initial payment, remains $60 million. Since section 483 will apply to each payment received by A more than one year following the date of sale (section 483 is inapplicable to the contingent payment that will be received on June 15, 1982 since that date is within one year following the July 1, 1981 sale date), the agreement contemplates internal interest and the price-interest recomputation rule is applicable. Under the rule, an initial determination must be made for A's taxable year 1981. On December 31, 1981, the last day of the taxable year, no events with regard to the first fiscal year have occurred which are subject to prompt subsequent calculation and verification because that fiscal year will end March 31, 1982. Under the price-interest recomputation rule, on December 31, 1981 A is required to assume that the maximum amount subsequently payable under the agreement ($57 million, equal to $60 million less the $3 million initial cash payment received by A in 1981) will be paid on the earliest date permissible under the agreement,
i.e.,
on June 15, 1982. Since no part of a payment received on that date would be treated as interest under section 483, the initial stated maximum selling price, applicable to A's 1981 tax calculations, is deemed to be $60 million. Thus, the 1981 gross profit ratio is
2/3
and for the taxable year 1981 A will report $2 million as gain attributable to the sale.
(ii) The net profits of X for its fiscal year ending March 31, 1982 are $120 million. On June 15, 1982 A receives a payment from B equal to 5% of that amount, or $6 million. On December 31, 1982, A knows that the maximum amount he may subsequently receive under the agreement is $51 million, and A is required to assume that this amount will be paid to him on the earliest permissible date, June 15, 1983. Section 483 does not treat as interest any part of the $6 million received by A on June 15, 1982, but section 483 will treat as unstated interest a computed part of the $51 million it is assumed A will receive on June 15, 1983. Assuming that under the tables in the regulations under section 483, it is determined that the principal component of a payment received more than 21 months but less than 27 months after the date of sale is considered to be .82270, $41,957,700 of the presumed $51 million payment will be treated as principal. The balance of $9,042,300 is interest. Accordingly, in A's 1982 tax calculations stated maximum selling price will be $50,957,700, which amount is equal to the stated maximum selling price that was determined in the 1981 tax calculations ($60 million) reduced by the section 483 interest component of the $6 million payment received by A in 1982 ($0) and further reduced by the section 483 interest component of the $51 million presumed payment to be received by A on June 15, 1983 ($9,042,300). Similarly, in determining gross profit for 1982 tax calculations, the gross profit of $40 million determined in the 1981 tax calculations must be reduced by the same section 483 interest amounts, yielding a recomputed gross profit of $30,957,700 ($40,000,000-$9,042,300). Further, since prior to 1982 A received payment under the agreement (1981 payment of $3 million of which $2 million was profit), the appropriate amounts must be subtracted in the 1982 tax calculation. The total previously received
selling price payment of $3 million is subtracted from the recomputed maximum selling price of $50,957,700, yielding an adjusted selling price of $47,957,700. The total previously recognized gain of $2 million is subtracted from the recomputed maximum gross profit of $30,957,700, yielding an adjusted gross profit of $28,957,700. The gross profit percentage applicable to 1982 tax calculations thus is determined to be 60.38175%, equal to the quotient of dividing the adjusted gross profit of $28,957,700 by the adjusted selling price of $47,957,700. Accordingly, of the $6 million received by A in 1982, no part of which is unstated interest under section 483, A will report $3,622,905 (60.38175% of $6 million) as gain attributable to the sale and $2,377,095 ($6,000,000-$3,622,905) as recovery of basis.
(iii) The net profits of X for its fiscal year ending March 31, 1983 are $200 million. On June 15, 1983 A receives a payment from B equal to $10 million. On December 31, 1983, A knows that the maximum amount he may subsequently receive under the agreement is $41 million, and A is required to assume that this amount will be paid to him on the earliest permissible date, June 15, 1984. Assuming that under the tables in the regulations under section 483 it is determined that the principal component of a payment received more than 33 months but less than 39 months after the date of sale is .74622, $30,595,020 of the presumed $41 million ($51 million-$10 million) payment will be treated as principal and $10,404,980 is interest. Based upon the assumed factor for 21 months but less than 27 months (.82270) $8,227,000 of the $10 million payment is principal and $1,773,000 is interest. Accordingly, in A's 1983 tax calculations stated maximum selling price will be $47,822,020, which amount is equal to the stated maximum selling price determined in the 1981 calculation ($60 million) reduced by the section 483 interest component of the $6 million 1982 payment ($0), the section 483 interest component of the 1983 payment ($1,773,000) and by the section 483 interest component of the presumed $41 million payment to be received in 1984 ($10,404,980). The recomputed gross profit is $27,822,020 ($40 million−$10,404,980−$1,773,000). The previously reported payments must be deducted for the 1983 calculation. Selling price is reduced to $38,822,020 by subtracting the $3 million 1981 payment and the $6 million 1982 payment ($47,822,020-$9 million) and gross profit is reduced to $22,199,115 by subtracting the 1981 profit of $2 million and the 1982 profit of $3,622,905 ($27,822,020-$5,622,905), yielding a gross profit percentage of 57.18176% ($22,199,115/$38,822,020). Accordingly, of the $10 million received in 1983, A will report $1,773,000 as interest under section 483, and of the remaining principal component of $8,227,000, $4,704,343 as gain attributable to the sale ($8,227,000 × 57.18176%) and $3,522,657 ($8,227,000-$4,704,343) as recovery of basis.

# Example (3).
The facts are the same as in example (2) except that X is a collapsible corporation as defined in section 341(b)(1) and no limitation or exception under section 341 (d), (e), or (f) is applicable. Under section 341(a), all of A's gain on the sale will be ordinary income. Accordingly, section 483 will not apply to treat as interest any part of the payments to be received by A under his agreement with B. See section 483(f)(3). Therefore, the price-interest recomputation rule is inapplicable and the tax results to A in each year in which payment is received will be determined in a manner consistent with example (1).

# Example (4).
The facts are the same as in example (2) (maximum amount payable under the agreement $60 million) except that the agreement between A and B contains the following “payment recharacterization” provision:
“Any payment made more than one year after the (July 1, 1981) date of sale shall be composed of an interest element and a principal element, the interest element being computed on the principal element at an interest rate of 9% per annum computed from the date of sale to the date of payment.”
The results reached in example (2), with respect to the $3 million initial cash payment received by A in 1981 remain the same because, under the payment recharacterization formula, no amount received or assumed to be received prior to July 1, 1982 is treated as interest. The 1982 tax computation method described in example (2) is equally applicable to the $6 million payment received in 1982. However, the adjusted gross profit ratio determined in this example (4) will differ from the ratio determined in example (2). The difference is attributable to the difference between a 9% stated interest rate calculation (in this example (4)) and the compound rate of unstated interest required under section 483 and used in calculating the results in example (2).

# Example (5).
The facts are the same as in example (1). In 1992 X is adjudged a bankrupt and it is determined that, in and after 1992, B will not be required to make any further payments under the agreement,
i.e.,
B's contingent payment obligation held by A now has become worthless. Assume that A previously received aggregate payments (exclusive of interest) of $45 million and out of those payments recovered $15 million of A's total $20 million basis. For 1992 A will report a loss of $5 million attributable to the sale, taken at the time determined to be appropriate under the rules generally applicable to worthless debts.

# Example (6).
(i) C owns all of the stock of Z corporation, a calendar year taxpayer. On July 1, 1981, C sells the stock of Z to D under
an agreement calling for payment, each year for the next ten years, of an amount equal to 10% of the net profits of Z earned in the immediately preceding calendar year beginning with the year ending December 31, 1981. Each payment is to be made on the following April 1st, commencing April 1, 1982. In addition, C is to receive a payment of $5 million on closing. The agreement specifies that the maximum amount payable to C, including the $5 million cash payment at closing, is $24 million. The agreement does not call for the payment of any stated interest. Since section 483 will apply to each payment received by C more than one year following the date of sale (section 483 is inapplicable to the payment that will be received on April 1, 1982, since that date is within one year following the July 1, 1981 sale date), the agreement contemplates internal interest and the price interest recomputation rule is applicable. Under that rule, C must make an initial determination for his taxable year 1981.
(ii) On December 31, 1981, the exact amount of Z's 1981 net profit is not known, since it normally takes a number of weeks to compile the relevant information. However, the events which will determine the amount of the payment C will receive on April 1, 1982 have already occurred, and the information (Z's 1981 financial statement) will be promptly calculated and verified and will be available prior to the time C's 1981 tax return is timely filed. On March 15, 1982, Z reports net income of $14 million, and on April 1, 1982 D pays C $1.4 million.
(iii) Under the price-interest recomputation rule, C is required to determine the gross profit ratio for the 1981 $5 million payment on the basis of the events which occurred by the close of that taxable year and which are verifiable before the due date of the 1981 return. Because at the end of C's 1981 taxable year all events which will determine the amount of the April 1, 1982 payment have occurred and because the actual facts are known prior to the due date of C's return, C will take those facts into account when calculating the gross profit ratio. Thus, because C knows that the 1982 payment is $1.4 million, C knows that the remaining amount to be recovered under the contract is $17.6 million ($24 million − ($5 million + $1.4 million)). For purposes of this paragraph C must assume that the entire $17.6 million will be paid on the earliest possible date, April 1, 1983. Because section 483 will apply to that payment, and assuming that under the tables in the regulations under section 483 the principal component of a payment received 21 months after the date of sale is considered to be .86384, $15,203,584 of the $17.6 million would be principal and $2,396,416 ($17,600,000 − $15,203,584) would be interest. Therefore, C must assume, for purposes of reporting the $5 million payment received in 1981, that the selling price is $21,603,584 calculated as follows:
Total selling price
$24,000,000
Interest component of the $17,600,000 payment which C must assume will be made April 1, 1983
−2,396,416
Adjusted selling price to be used when reporting the 1981 payment
21,603,584
(iv) Assume that on March 15, 1982, Z reports net income of $15 million for 1982 and that on April 1, 1983 D pays C $1.5 million. Because section 483 will apply to that payment, and assuming that under the tables in the regulations under section 483 the principal component of a payment received 21 months after the date of sale is considered to be .86384, $1,295,760 of the $1,500,000 payment will be principal and $204,240 ($1,500,000 − $1,295,760) will be interest. Because C knows the amount of the 1983 payment when filing the 1982 tax return, C must assume that the remaining amount to be received under the contract, $16.1 million ($24 million − ($5 million + $1.4 million + $1.5 million)), will be received as a lump sum on April 1, 1984. Because section 483 will again apply, and assuming that the principal component of a payment made 34 months after the date of the sale is .74622, $12,014,142 of the $16.1 million would be principal, and $4,085,858 ($16,100,000 − $12,014,142) would be interest. Therefore, C must assume, for purpose of reporting the $1.4 million payment made April 1, 1982, that the adjusted selling price (within the meaning of example (2)) is $14,709,902, calculated as follows:
Total selling price
$24,000,000
Interest component of the $1,500,000 payment made April 1, 1983
−204,240
Interest component of the $16,100,000 payment which C must assume will be made April 1, 1984
−4,085,858
Payment made in 1981
−5,000,000
Adjusted selling price for calculations for reporting the 1982 payment
14,709,902
(3)
Fixed period
—(i)
In general.
When a stated maximum selling price cannot be determined as of the close of the taxable year in which the sale or other disposition occurs, but the maximum period over which payments may be received under the contingent sale price agreement is fixed, the taxpayer's basis (inclusive of selling expenses) shall be allocated to the taxable years in which payment may be received under the agreement in equal annual increments. In making the allocation it is not relevant whether the buyer is required to pay adequate stated interest. However, if the terms of the agreement incorporate an arithmetic component that is not identical for all taxable years,
basis shall be allocated among the taxable years to accord with that component unless, taking into account all of the payment terms of the agreement, it is inappropriate to presume that payments under the contract are likely to accord with the variable component. If in any taxable year no payment is received or the amount of payment received (exclusive of interest) is less than the basis allocated to that taxable year, no loss shall be allowed unless the taxable year is the final payment year under the agreement or unless it is otherwise determined in accordance with the rules generally applicable to worthless debts that the future payment obligation under the agreement has become worthless. When no loss is allowed, the unrecovered portion of basis allocated to the taxable year shall be carried forward to the next succeeding taxable year. If application of the foregoing rules to a particular case would substantially and inappropriately defer or accelerate recovery of the taxpayer's basis, a special rule will apply. See paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules for recovery of basis in a contingent payment sale in which stated maximum selling price cannot be determined but the period over which payments are to be received under the agreement is fixed. In each case, it is assumed that application of the described rules will not substantially and inappropriately defer or accelerate recovery of the taxpayer's basis.

# Example (1).
A sells Blackacre to B for 10 percent of Blackacre's gross yield for each of the next 5 years. A's basis in Blackacre is $5 million. Since the sales price is indefinite and the maximum selling price is not ascertainable from the terms of the contract, basis is recovered ratably over the period during which payment may be received under the contract. Thus, assuming A receives the payments (exclusive of interest) listed in the following table, A will report the following:
Year
Payment
Basis recovered
Gain attributable to the sale
1
$1,300,000
$1,000,000
$300,000
2
1,500,000

1,000,000
800,000
5
2,100,000
1,000,000
1,100,000

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the payment in year 1 is only $900,000. Since the installment payment is less than the amount of basis allocated to that year, the unrecovered basis, $100,000, is carried forward to year 2.

# Example (3).
C owns all of the stock of X corporation with a basis of $100,000 (inclusive of selling expenses). D purchases the X stock from C and agrees to make four payments computed in accordance with the following formula: 40% of the net profits of X in year 1, 30% in year 2, 20% in year 3, and 10% in year 4. Accordingly, C's basis is allocated as follows: $40,000 to year 1, $30,000 to year 2, $20,000 to year 3, and $10,000 to year 4.

# Example (4).
The facts are the same as in example (3), but the agreement also requires that D make fixed installment payments in accordance with the following schedule: no payment in year 1, $100,000 in year 2, $200,000 in year 3, $300,000 in year 4, and $400,000 in year 5. Thus, while it is reasonable to project that the contingent component of the payments will decrease each year, the fixed component of the payments will increase each year. Accordingly, C is required to allocate $20,000 of basis to each of the taxable years 1 through 5.
(4)
Neither stated maximum selling price nor fixed period.
If the agreement neither specifies a maximum selling price nor limits payments to a fixed period, a question arises whether a sale realistically has occurred or whether, in economic effect, payments received under the agreement are in the nature of rent or royalty income. Arrangements of this sort will be closely scrutinized. If, taking into account all of the pertinent facts, including the nature of the property, the arrangement is determined to qualify as a sale, the taxpayer's basis (including selling expenses) shall be recovered in equal annual increments over a period of 15 years commencing with the date of sale. However, if in any taxable year no payment is received or the amount of
payment received (exclusive of interest) is less than basis allocated to the year, no loss shall be allowed unless it is otherwise determined in accordance with the timing rules generally applicable to worthless debts that the future payment obligation under the agreement has become worthless; instead the excess basis shall be reallocated in level amounts over the balance of the 15 year term. Any basis not recovered at the end of the 15th year shall be carried forward to the next succeeding year, and to the extent unrecovered thereafter shall be carried forward from year to year until all basis has been recovered or the future payment obligation is determined to be worthless. The general rule requiring initial level allocation of basis over 15 years shall not apply if the taxpayer can establish to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service that application of the general rule would substantially and inappropriately defer recovery of the taxpayer's basis. See paragraph (c)(7) of this section. If the Service determines that initially allocating basis in level amounts over the first 15 years will substantially and inappropriately accelerate recovery of the taxpayer's basis in early years of that 15-year term, the Service may require that basis be reallocated within the 15-year term but the Service will not require that basis initially be allocated over more than 15 years. See paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
(5)
Foreign currency and other fungible payment units
—(i)
In general.
An installment sale may call for payment in foreign currency. For federal income tax purposes, foreign currency is property. Because the value of foreign currency will vary over time in relation to the United States dollar, an installment sale requiring payment in foreign currency is a contingent payment sale. However, when the consideration payable under an installment sale agreement is specified in foreign currency, the taxpayer's basis (including selling expenses) shall be recovered in the same manner as basis would have been recovered had the agreement called for payment in United States dollars. This rule is equally applicable to any installment sale in which the agreement specifies that payment shall be made in identified, fungible units of property the value of which will or may vary over time in relation to the dollar (e.g., bushels of wheat or ounces of gold).
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this subparagraph:

# Example.
A sells Blackacre to B for 4 million Swiss francs payable 1 million in year 2 and 3 million in year 3, together with adequate stated interest. A's basis (including selling expenses) in Blackacre is $100,000. Twenty five thousand dollars of A's basis (
1/4
of total basis) is allocable to the year 2 payment of 1 million Swiss francs and $75,000 of A's basis is allocable to the year 3 payment of 3 million Swiss francs.
(6)
Income forecast method for basis recovery
—(i)
In general.
The rules for ratable recovery of basis set forth in paragraph (c) (2) through (4) of this section focus on the payment terms of the contingent selling price agreement. Except to the extent contemplated by paragraph (c)(7) of this section (relating to a special rule to prevent substantial distortion of basis recovery), the nature and productivity of the property sold is not independently relevant to the basis to be recovered in any payment year. The special rule for an income forecast method of basis recovery set forth in paragraph (c)(6) of this section recognizes that there are cases in which failure to take account of the nature or productivity of the property sold may be expected to result in distortion of the taxpayer's income over time. Specifically, when the property sold is depreciable property of a type normally eligible for depreciation on the income forecast method, or is depletable property of a type normally eligible for cost depletion in which total future production must be estimated, and payments under the contingent selling price agreement are based upon receipts or units produced by or from the property, the taxpayer's basis may appropriately be recovered by using an income forecast method.
(ii)
Availability of method.
In lieu of applying the rules set forth in paragraph (c) (2) through (4) of this section, in an appropriate case the taxpayer may elect (on its tax return timely filed for the first year under the contingent payment agreement in which a payment is received) to recover basis
using the income forecast method of basis recovery. No special form of election is prescribed. An appropriate case is one meeting the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section in which the property sold is a mineral property, a motion picture film, a television film, or a taped television show. The Internal Revenue Service may from time to time specify other properties of a similar character which, in appropriate circumstances, will be eligible for recovery of basis on the income forecast method. In addition, a taxpayer may seek a ruling from the Service as to whether a specific property qualifies as property of a similar character eligible, in appropriate circumstances, for income forecast recovery of basis.
(iii)
Required calculations.
The income forecast method requires application of a fraction, the numerator of which is the payment (exclusive of interest) received in the taxable year under a contingent payment agreement, and the denominator of which is the forecast or estimated total payments (exclusive of interest) to be received under the agreement. This fraction is multiplied by the taxpayer's basis in the property sold to determine the basis recovered with respect to the payment received in the taxable year. If in a subsequent year it is found that the income forecast was substantially overestimated or underestimated by reason of circumstances occurring in such subsequent year, an adjustment of the income forecast of such subsequent year shall be made. In such case, the formula for computing recovery of basis would be as follows: payment received in the taxable year (exclusive of interest) divided by the revised estimated total payments (exclusive of interest) then and thereafter to be made under the agreement (the current year's payment and total estimated future payments), multiplied by the taxpayer's unrecovered basis remaining as of the beginning of the taxable year. If the agreement contemplates internal interest (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section), in making the initial income forecast computation and in making any required subsequent recomputation the amount of internal interest (which shall not be treated as payment under the agreement) shall be calculated by assuming that each future contingent selling price payment will be made in the amount and at the time forecast. The total forecast of estimated payments to be received under the agreement shall be based on the conditions known to exist at the end of the taxable year for which the return is filed. If a subsequent upward or downward revision of this estimate is required, the revision shall be made at the end of the subsequent taxable year based on additional information which became available after the last prior estimate. No loss shall be allowed unless the taxable year is the final payment year under the agreement or unless it is otherwise determined in accordance with the rules generally applicable to the time a debt becomes worthless that the future payment obligation under the agreement has become worthless.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the income forecast method of basis recovery:

# Example (1).
A sells a television film to B for 5% of annual gross receipts from the exploitation of the film. The film is an ordinary income asset in the hands of A. A reasonably forecasts that total payments to be received under the contingent selling price agreement will be $1,200,000, and that A will be paid $600,000 in year 1, $150,000 in year 2, $300,000 in year 3, $100,000 in year 4, and $50,000 in year 5. A reasonably anticipates no or only insignificant receipts thereafter. A's basis in the film is $100,000. Under the income forecast method, A's basis initially is allocated to the five taxable years of forecasted payment as follows:
Year
Percentage
Basis
1
50.00
$50,000
2
12.50
12,500
3
25.00
25,000
4
8.33
8,333
5
4.17
4,167
Payments are received and A reports the sale under the installment method as follows:
Year
Payment received
Basis recovered
Gain on sale
1
$600,000
$50,000
$550,000
2
150,000
12,500
137,500
3
300,000
25,000
275,000
4
100,000
8,333
91,667
5
50,000
4,167
45,833

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that in year 2 A receives
no payment. In year 3 A receives a payment of $300,000 and reasonably estimates that in subsequent years he will receive total additional payments of only $100,000. In year 2 A will be allowed no loss. At the beginning of year 3 A's unrecovered basis is $50,000. In year 3 A must recompute the applicable basis recovery fraction based upon facts known and forecast as at the end of year 3: year 3 payment of $300,000 divided by estimated current and future payments of $400,000, equaling 75%. Thus, in year 3 A recovers $37,500 (75% of $50,000) of A's previously unrecovered basis.
(7)
Special rule to avoid substantial distortion
—(i)
In general.
The normal basis recovery rules set forth in paragraph (c) (2) through (4) of this section may, with respect to a particular contingent payment sale, substantially and inappropriately defer or accelerate recovery of the taxpayer's basis.
(ii)
Substantial and inappropriate deferral.
The taxpayer may use an alternative method of basis recovery if the taxpayer is able to demonstrate prior to the due date of the return including extensions for the taxable year in which the first payment is received, that application of the normal basis recovery rule will substantially and inappropriately defer recovery of basis. To demonstrate that application of the normal basis recovery rule will substantially and inappropriately defer recovery of basis, the taxpayer must show (A) that the alternative method is a reasonable method of ratably recovering basis and, (B) that, under that method, it is reasonable to conclude that over time the taxpayer likely will recover basis at a rate twice as fast as the rate at which basis would have been recovered under the otherwise applicable normal basis recovery rule. The taxpayer must receive a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service before using an alternative method of basis recovery described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section.
The request for a ruling shall be made in accordance with all applicable procedural rules set forth in the Statement of Procedural Rules (26 CFR part 601) and any applicable revenue procedures relating to submission of ruling requests. The request shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: Assistant Commissioner (Technical), Washington, DC 20224. The taxpayer must file a request for a ruling prior to the due date for the return including extensions. In demonstrating that application of the normal basis recovery rule would substantially and inappropriately defer recovery of the taxpayer's basis, the taxpayer in appropriate circumstances may rely upon contemporaneous or immediate past relevant sales, profit, or other factual data that are subject to verification. The taxpayer ordinarily is not permitted to rely upon projections of future productivity, receipts, profits, or the like. However, in special circumstances a reasonable projection may be acceptable if the projection is based upon a specific event that already has occurred (e.g., corporate stock has been sold for future payments contingent on profits and an inadequately insured major plant facility of the corporation has been destroyed).
(iii)
Substantial and inappropriate acceleration.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, the Internal Revenue Service may find that the normal basis recovery rule will substantially and inappropriately accelerate recovery of basis. In such a case, the Service may require an alternate method of basis recovery, unless the taxpayer is able to demonstrate either (A) that the method of basis recovery required by the Service is not a reasonable method of ratable recovery, or (B) that it is not reasonable to conclude that the taxpayer over time is likely to recover basis at a rate twice as fast under the normally applicable basis recovery rule as the rate at which basis would be recovered under the method proposed by the Service. In making such demonstrations the taxpayer may rely in appropriate circumstances upon contemporaneous or immediate past relevant sales, profit, or other factual data subject to verification. In special circumstances a reasonable projection may be acceptable, but only with the consent of the Service, if the projection is based upon a specific event that has already occurred.
(iv)
Subsequent recomputation.
A contingent payment sale may initially and properly have been reported under the normally applicable basis recovery rule and, during the term of the agreement,
circumstances may show that continued reporting on the original method will substantially and inappropriately defer or accelerate recovery of the unrecovered balance of the taxpayer's basis. In this event, the special rule provided in this paragraph is applicable.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the special rule of this paragraph. In examples (1) and (2) it is assumed that rulings consistent with paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section have been requested.

# Example (1).
A owns all of the stock of X corporation with a basis of $100,000. A sells the stock of X to B for a cash down payment of $1,800,000 and B's agreement to pay A an amount equal to 1% of the net profits of X in each of the next 10 years (together with adequate stated interest). The agreement further specifies that the maximum amount that may be paid to A (exclusive of interest) shall not exceed $10 million. A is able to demonstrate that current and recent profits of X have approximated $2 million annually, and that there is no reason to anticipate a major increase in the annual profits of X during the next 10 years. One percent of $2 million annual profits is $20,000, a total of $200,000 over 10 years. Under the basis recovery rule normally applicable to a maximum contingent selling price agreement, in the year of sale A would recover $18,000 of A's total $100,000 basis, and would not recover more than a minor part of the balance until the final year under the agreement. On a $2 million selling price ($200,000 plus $1,800,000 down payment), A would recover $90,000 of A's total $100,000 basis in the year of sale and 5% of each payment ($100,000/$2,000,000) received up to a maximum of $10,000 over the next ten years. Since the rate of basis recovery under the demonstrated method is more than twice the rate under the normal rule, A will be permitted to recover $90,000 basis in the year of sale.

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that no maximum contingent selling price is stated in the agreement. Under the basis recovery rule normally applicable when no maximum amount is stated but the payment term is fixed, in the year of sale and in each subsequent year A would recover approximately $9,100 (1/11 of $100,000) of A's total basis. A will be permitted to recover $90,000 of A's total basis in the year of sale.

# Example (3).
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that A sells the X stock to B on the following terms: 1% of the annual net profits of X in each of the next 10 years and a cash payment of $1,800,000 in the eleventh year, all payments to be made together with adequate stated interest. No maximum contingent selling price is stated. Under the normally applicable basis recovery rule, A would recover
1/11
of A's total $100,000 basis in each of the 11 payment years under the agreement. On the facts (see example (1)), A cannot demonstrate that application of the normal rule would not substantially and inappropriately accelerate recovery of A's basis. Accordingly, A will be allowed to recover only $1,000 of A's total basis in each of the 10 contingent payment years under the agreement, and will recover the $90,000 balance of A's basis in the final year in which the large fixed cash payment will be made.
(8)
Coordination with regulations under section 385
—(i)
In general.
The regulations under section 385 do not apply to an instrument (as defined in § 1.385-3(c)) providing for a contingent payment of principal (with or without stated interest) issued in connection with a sale or other disposition of property to a corporation if § 1.385-6 (relating to proportionality) does not apply to such instrument (or to a class of instruments which includes such instrument). Thus, such instrument will be treated as stock or indebtedness under applicable principles of law without reference to the regulations under section 385.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph:

# Example (1).
On January 1, 1982, corporation X buys a factory from Y, an independent creditor (within the meaning of § 1.385-6(b)). In exchange for the factory, Y receives $200,000 in cash on January 1, 1982. In addition, on January 1, 1984, Y will receive a payment in the range of $100,000 to $300,000, plus adequate stated interest, depending on the factory's output. Based on these facts, § 1.385-6 does not apply to X's obligation to Y (see § 1.385-6(a)(3)(ii)) and the regulations under section 385 doe not apply to X's obligation to Y.

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the contingent payment due on January 1, 1984 will be in the range of $50,000 to $250,000. In addition, on January 1, 1982, Y receives a $50,000 noninterest-bearing note due absolutely and unconditionally on January 1, 1984. Based on these facts, the $50,000 note is treated as stock or indebtedness under the regulations under section 385.
(d)
Election not to report an installment sale on the installment method
—(1)
In
general.
An installment sale is to be reported on the installment method unless the taxpayer elects otherwise in accordance with the rules set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(2)
Treatment of an installment sale when a taxpayer elects not to report on the installment method
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer who elects not to report an installment sale on the installment method must recognize gain on the sale in accordance with the taxpayer's method of accounting. The fair market value of an installment obligation shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section. In making such determination, any provision of contract or local law restricting the transferability of the installment obligation shall be disregarded. Receipt of an installment obligation shall be treated as a receipt of property, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the installment obligation, whether or not such obligation is the equivalent of cash. An installment obligation is considered to be property and is subject to valuation, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section, without regard to whether the obligation is embodied in a note, an executory contract, or any other instrument, or is an oral promise enforceable under local law.
(ii)
Fixed amount obligations.
(A) A fixed amount obligation means an installment obligation the amount payable under which is fixed. Solely for the purpose of determining whether the amount payable under an installment obligation is fixed, the provisions of section 483 and any “payment recharacterization” arrangement (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) shall be disregarded. If the fixed amount payable is stated in identified, fungible units of property the value of which will or may vary over time in relation to the United States dollar (e.g., foreign currency, ounces of gold, or bushels of wheat), such units shall be converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange or dollar value on the date the installment sale is made. A taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements methods of accounting shall treat as an amount realized in the year of sale the fair market value of the installment obligation. In no event will the fair market value of the installment obligation be considered to be less than the fair market value of the property sold (minus any other consideration received by the taxpayer on the sale). A taxpayer using the accrual method of accounting shall treat as an amount realized in the year of sale the total amount payable under the installment obligation. For this purpose, neither interest (whether stated or unstated) nor original issue discount is considered to be part of the amount payable. If the amount payable is otherwise fixed, but because the time over which payments may be made is contingent, a portion of the fixed amount will or may be treated as internal interest (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section), the amount payable shall be determined by applying the price interest recomputation rule (described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section). Under no circumstances will an installment sale for a fixed amount obligation be considered an “open” transaction. For purposes of this (ii), remote or incidential contingencies are not to be taken into account.
(B) The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

# Example (1).
A, an accrual method taxpayer, owns all of the stock of X corporation with a basis of $20 million. On July 1, 1981, A sells the stock of X corporation to B for $60 million payable on June 15, 1992. The agreement also provides that against this fixed amount, B shall make annual prepayments (on June 15) equal to 5% of the net profits of X earned in the immediately preceding fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending March 31, 1982. Thus the first prepayment will be made on June 15, 1982. No stated interest is payable under the agreement and thus the unstated interest provisions of section 483 are applicable. Under section 483, no part of any payment made on June 15, 1982 (which is within one year following the July 1, 1981 sale date), will be treated as unstated interest. Under the price interest recomputation rule, it is presumed that the entire $60 million fixed amount will be paid on June 15, 1982. Accordingly, if A elects not to report the transaction on the installment method, in 1981 A must report $60 million as the amount realized on the sale and must report $40 million as gain on the sale in that year.

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that A uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. In 1981 A must report as an amount realized on the sale the fair market value of the installment obligation and must report as gain on the sale in 1981 the excess of that amount realized over A's basis of $20 million. In no event will the fair market value of the installment obligation be considered to be less than the fair market value of the stock of X. In determining the fair market value of the installment obligation, any contractual or legal restrictions on the transferability of the installment obligation, and any remote or incidental contingencies otherwise affecting the amount payable or time of payments under the installment obligation, shall be disregarded.
(iii)
Contingent payment obligations.
Any installment obligation which is not a fixed amount obligation (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section) is a contingent payment obligation. If an installment obligation contains both a fixed amount component and a contingent payment component, the fixed amount component shall be treated under the rules of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section and the contingent amount component shall be treated under the rules of this (iii). The fair market value of a contingent payment obligation shall be determined by disregarding any restrictions on transfer imposed by agreement or under local law. The fair market value of a contingent payment obligation may be ascertained from, and in no event shall be considered to be less than, the fair market value of the property sold (less the amount of any other consideration received in the sale). Only in those rare and extraordinary cases involving sales for a contingent payment obligation in which the fair market value of the obligation (determinable under the preceding sentences) cannot reasonably be ascertained will the taxpayer be entitled to assert that the transaction is “open.” Any such transaction will be carefully scrutinized to determine whether a sale in fact has taken place. A taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting must report as an amount realized in the year of sale the fair market value of the contingent payment obligation. A taxpayer using the accrual method of accounting must report an amount realized in the year of sale determined in accordance with that method of accounting, but in no event less than the fair market value of the contingent payment obligation.
(3)
Time and manner for making election
—(i)
In general.
An election under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be made on or before the due date prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the taxpayer's return for the taxable year in which the installment sale occurs. The election must be made in the manner prescribed by the appropriate forms for the taxpayer's return for the taxable year of the sale. A taxpayer who reports an amount realized equal to the selling price including the full face amount of any installment obligation on the tax return filed for the taxable year in which the installment sale occurs will be considered to have made an effective election under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. A cash method taxpayer receiving an obligation the fair market value of which is less than the face value must make the election in the manner prescribed by appropriate instructions for the return filed for the taxable year of the sale.
(ii)
Election made after the due date.
Elections after the time specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section will be permitted only in those rare circumstances when the Internal Revenue Service concludes that the taxpayer had good cause for failing to make a timely election. A recharacterization of a transaction as a sale in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which the transaction occurred (e.g., a transaction initially reported as a lease later is determined to have been an installment sale) will not justify a late election. No conditional elections will be permitted. For a special transitional rule relating to certain taxable years for which a return is filed prior to February 19, 1981, see paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(4)
Revoking an election.
Generally, an election made under paragraph (d)(1) is irrevocable. An election may be revoked only with the consent of the Internal Revenue Service. A revocation is retroactive. A revocation will not be permitted when one of its purposes is the avoidance of Federal income taxes, or when the taxable year in which any payment was received has closed. For a
special transitional rule relating to certain taxable years for which a return is filed prior to February 19, 1981, see paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(5)
Transitional rules.
The following transitional rules shall apply with respect to any contingent payment sale made after October 19, 1980 in a taxable year, ending after that date, for which the taxpayer has filed a federal income tax return prior to February 19, 1981. If in such tax return the taxpayer has treated the contingent payment sale under the installment method, consent of the Internal Revenue Service to a late election by the taxpayer not to report the transaction on the installment method will generally be granted if the request for election out of installment method treatment is filed by May 5, 1981. If in such tax return the taxpayer has elected not to report the contingent payment sale under the installment method, consent of the Service to revocation of the election by the taxpayer will generally be granted if the request for revocation is filed by May 5, 1981.
(e)
Purchaser evidences of indebtedness payable on demand or readily tradable
—(1)
Treatment as payment
—(i)
In general.
A bond or other evidence of indebtedness (hereinafter in this section referred to as an obligation) issued by any person and payable on demand shall be treated as a payment in the year received, not as installment obligations payable in future years. In addition, an obligation issued by a corporation or a government or political subdivision thereof—
(A) With interest coupons attached (whether or not the obligation is readily tradable in an established securities market),
(B) In registered form (other than an obligation issued in registered form which the taxpayer establishes will not be readily tradable in an established securities market), or
(C) In any other form designed to render such obligation readily tradable in an established securities market,
shall be treated as a payment in the year received, not as an installment obligation payable in future years. For purposes of this paragraph, an obligation is to be considered in registered form if it is registered as to principal, interest, or both and if its transfer must be effected by the surrender of the old instrument and either the reissuance by the corporation of the old instrument to the new holder or the issuance by the corporation of a new instrument to the new holder.
(ii)
Examples.
The rules stated in this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
On July 1, 1981, A, an individual on the cash method of accounting reporting on a calendar year basis, transferred all of his stock in corporation X (traded on an established securities market and having a fair market value of $1,000,000) to corporation Y in exchange for 250 of Y's registered bonds (which are traded in an over-the-counter-market) each with a principal amount and fair market value of $1,000 (with interest payable at the rate of 12 percent per year), and Y's unsecured promissory note with a principal amount of $750,000. At the time of such exchange A's basis in the X stock is $900,000. The promissory note is payable at the rate of $75,000 annually, due on July 1 of each year following 1981 until the principal balance is paid. The note provides for the payment of interest at the rate of 12 percent per year also payable on July 1 of each year. Under the rule stated in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the 250 registered bonds of Y are treated as a payment in 1981 in the amount of the value of the bonds, $250,000.

# Example (2).
Assume the same facts as in example (1). Assume further that on July 1, 1982, Y makes its first installment payment to A under the terms of the unsecured promissory note with 75 more of its $1,000 registered bonds. A must include $7,500 (
i.e.,
10 percent gross profit percentage times $75,000) A's gross income for calendar year 1982. In addition, A includes the interest payment made by Y on July 1 in A's gross income for 1982.
(2)
Amounts treated as payment.
If under paragraph (e)(1) of this section an obligation is treated as a payment in the year received, the amount realized by reason of such payment shall be determined in accordance with the taxpayer's method of accounting. If the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, the amount realized on such payment is the fair market value of the obligation. If the taxpayer uses the accrual method of accounting, the amount realized on receipt of an obligation payable on
demand is the face amount of the obligation, and the amount realized on receipt of an obligation with coupons attached or a readily tradable obligation is the stated redemption price at maturity less any original issue discount (as defined in section 1232(b)(1)) or, if there is no original issue discount, the amount realized is the stated redemption price at maturity appropriately discounted to reflect total unstated interest (as defined in section 483(b)), if any.
(3)
Payable on demand.
An obligation shall be treated as payable on demand only if the obligation is treated as payable on demand under applicable state or local law.
(4)
Designed to be readily tradable in an established securities market
—(i)
In general.
Obligations issued by a corporation or government or political subdivision thereof will be deemed to be in a form designed to render such obligations readily tradable in an established securities market if—
(A) Steps necessary to create a market for them are taken at the time of issuance (or later, if taken pursuant to an expressed or implied agreement or understanding which existed at the time of issuance),
(B) If they are treated as readily tradable in an established securities market under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, or
(C) If they are convertible obligations to which paragraph (e)(5) of this section applies.
(ii)
Readily tradable in an established securities market.
An obligation will be treated as readily tradable in an established securities market if—
(A) The obligation is part of an issue or series of issues which are readily tradable in an established securities market, or
(B) The corporation issuing the obligation has other obligations of a comparable character which are described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the determination as to whether there exist obligations of a comparable character depends upon the particular facts and circumstances. Factors to be considered in making such determination include, but are not limited to, substantial similarity with respect to the presence and nature of security for the obligation, the number of obligations issued (or to be issued), the number of holders of such obligation, the principal amount of the obligation, and other relevant factors.
(iii)
Readily tradable.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, an obligation shall be treated as readily tradable if it is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market in such obligation or is part of an issue a portion of which is in fact traded in an established securities market.
(iv)
Established securities market.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “established securities market” includes (A) a national securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f), (B) an exchange which is exempted from registration under section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78e) because of the limited volume of transactions, and (c) any over-the-counter market. For purposes of this (iv), an over-the-counter market is reflected by the existence of an interdealer quotation system. An interdealer quotation system is any system of general circulation to brokers and dealers which regularly disseminates quotations of obligations by identified brokers or dealers, other than a quotation sheet prepared and distributed by a broker or dealer in the regular course of business and containing only quotations of such broker or dealer.
(v)
Examples.
The rules stated in this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
On June 1, 1982, 25 individuals owning equal interests in a tract of land with a fair market value of $1 million sell the land to corporation Y. The $1 million sales price is represented by 25 bonds issued by Y, each having a face value of $40,000. The bonds are not in registered form and do not have interest coupons attached, and, in addition, are payable in 120 equal installments, each due on the first business day of each month. In addition, the bonds are negotiable and may be assigned by the holder to any other person. However, the bonds are not quoted by any brokers or dealers who deal in corporate bonds, and, furthermore, there are no comparable obligations of Y (determined with reference to the characteristics set
forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) which are so quoted. Therefore, the bonds are not treated as readily tradable in an established securities market. In addition, under the particular facts and circumstances stated, the bonds will not be considered to be in a form designed to render them readily tradable in an established securities market. The receipt of such bonds by the holder is not treated as a payment for purposes of section 453(f)(4), notwithstanding that they are freely assignable.

# Example (2).
On April 1, 1981, corporation M purchases in a casual sale of personal property a fleet of trucks from corporation N in exchange for M's negotiable notes, not in registered form and without coupons attached. The M notes are comparable to earlier notes issued by M, which notes are quoted in the Eastern Bond section of the National Daily Quotation Sheet, which is an interdealer quotation system. Both issues of notes are unsecured, held by more than 100 holders, have a maturity date of more than 5 years, and were issued for a comparable principal amount. On the basis of these similar characteristics it appears that the latest notes will also be readily tradable. Since an interdealer system reflects an over-the-counter market, the earlier notes are treated as readily tradable in an established securities market. Since the later notes are obligations comparable to the earlier ones, which are treated as readily tradable in an established securities market, the later notes are also treated as readily tradable in an established securities market (whether or not such notes are actually traded).

Special rule for convertible securities
—(i)
General rule.
If an obligation contains a right whereby the holder of such obligation may convert it directly or indirectly into another obligation which would be treated as a payment under paragraph (e)(1) of this section or may convert it directly or indirectly into stock which would be treated as readily tradable or designed to be readily tradable in an established securities market under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the convertible obligation shall be considered to be in a form designed to render such obligation readily tradable in an established securities market unless such obligation is convertible only at a substantial discount. In determining whether the stock or obligation into which an obligation is convertible is readily tradable or designed to be readily tradable in an established securities market, the rules stated in paragraph (e)(4) of this section shall apply, and for purposes of such paragraph (e)(4) if such obligation is convertible into stock then the term “stock” shall be substituted for the term “obligation” wherever it appears in such paragraph (e)(4).
(ii)
Substantial discount rule.
Whether an obligation is convertible at a substantial discount depends upon the particular facts and circumstances. A substantial discount shall be considered to exist if at the time the convertible obligation is issued, the fair market value of the stock or obligation into which the obligation is convertible is less than 80 percent of the fair market value of the obligation (determined by taking into account all relevant factors, including proper discount to reflect the fact that the convertible obligation is not readily tradable in an established securities market and any additional consideration required to be paid by the taxpayer). Also, if a privilege to convert an obligation into stock or an obligation which is readily tradable in an established securities market may not be exercised within a period of one year from the date the obligation is issued, a substantial discount shall be considered to exist.
(6)
Effective date.
The provisions of this paragraph (e) shall apply to sales or other dispositions occurring after May 27, 1969, which are not made pursuant to a binding written contract entered into on or before such date. No inference shall be drawn from this section as to any questions of law concerning the application of section 453 to sales or other dispositions occurring on or before May 27, 1969.

§ 16A.126-0
Effective dates.
These temporary regulations shall apply to any payments received under a contract signed by the taxpayer and the appropriate agency after September 30, 1979.
§ 16A.126-1
Certain cost-sharing payments—in general.
(a)
Introduction.
In general, section 126 provides that recipients of payments made after September 30, 1979 under certain conservation, reclamation and restoration programs may exclude all or a portion of those payments from income if the payments do not substantially increase the annual income derived by the taxpayer from the affected property. For purposes of this section, the term “payment” as used in section 126 means payment of the economic benefit, if any, conferred upon the taxpayer upon receipt of the improvement. An increase in annual income is substantial if it exceeds the greater of 10 percent of the average annual income derived from the affected property prior to receipt of the improvement or an amount equal to $2.50 times the number of affected acres. The amount of gross income which a taxpayer realizes upon the receipt of a section 126 payment is the value of the section 126 improvement, reduced by the sum of the excludable portion and the taxpayer's share of the cost of the improvement (if any).
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the term:
(1) “Cost of the improvement” means the sum of amounts paid by a government and the taxpayer, whether or not with borrowed funds, for the improvement.
(2) “Section 126 cost” means the cost of the improvement less the sum of
(i) Any government payments under a program which is not listed in section 126(a),
(ii) Any portion of a government payment under a program which is listed in section 126(a) which the Secretary of Agriculture has not certified is primarily for purposes of conservation,
(iii) Any government payment to the taxpayer which is in the nature of rent or compensation for services.
(3) “Value of the section 126 improvement” means the fair market value of the improvement multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the section 126 cost and the denominator of which is the cost of the improvement.
(4) “Affected acreage” means the acres affected by the improvement.
(5) “Excludable portion” means the present fair market value of the right to receive annual income from the affected acreage of the greater of 10 percent of the prior average annual income from the affected acreage or $2.50 times the number of affected acres.
(6) “Prior average annual income” means the average of the gross receipts from the affected acreage for the last three taxable years preceding the taxable year in which installation of the improvement is commenced.
(7) “Section 126 improvement” means the portion of the improvement equal to the percentage which government payments made to the taxpayer, which the Secretary of Agriculture has certified were made primarily for the purpose of conservation, bear to the cost of the improvement.
(c)
Income realized upon receipt of a section 126 improvement
—(1)
Section 126 exclusion applied.
Unless a taxpayer elects not to have section 126 apply, the amount of gross income realized on receipt of the section 126 improvement is the value of the section 126 improvement less the sum of the taxpayer's share of the cost of the improvement and the excludable portion.
(2)
Section 126 exclusion not applied.
If a taxpayer elects under section 126(c) not to have section 126 apply in whole or in part, the amount realized on the receipt of the section 126 improvement is the value of the section 126 improvement less the sum of the taxpayer's share of the cost of the improvement
and the excludable portion that applies, if any.
(d)
Payments under watershed programs
—(1)
Programs within section 126(a)(9).
Section 126(a)(9) covers certain programs affecting small watersheds.
These programs must be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture and be determined by the Commissioner to be substantially similar to the type of program described in section 126(a) (1) through (8). The Commissioner has determined that section 126 improvements made in connection with small watersheds are within the scope of section 126(a)(9) if they are made under one of the following programs:
(A) The Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, Pub. L. 566, 68 Stat. 666, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1001,
et seq.
), as funded by the Act of November 9, 1979, Pub. L. 96-108, 93 Stat. 834.
(B) Flood Prevention Projects, Pub. L. 86-468, sec. 1, 74 Stat. 131, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1006a); Pub. L. 78-534, sec. 2, 58 Stat. 889 (33 U.S.C. 701a-1); Pub. L. 78-534, sec. 13, 58 Stat. 905;
(C) Emergency Watershed Protection, Pub. L. 81-516, sec. 216, 64 Stat. 184 (33 U.S.C. 701b-1), and
(D) Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act, Pub. L. 93-320, 88 Stat. 266:
(
1
) Title 1—Programs downstream from Imperial Dam, and
(
2
) Title 2—Measures upstream from Imperial Dam.
(2)
Other programs.
The Commissioner may announce further determinations under section 126(a)(9) from time to time in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(3)
Small watershed defined.
A watershed is a “small watershed” under this paragraph and section 126(a)(9) if the watershed or subwatershed does not exceed 250,000 acres and does not include any single structure providing more than 12,500 acre-feet of floodwater detention capacity, nor more than 25,000 acre-feet of total capacity.
(e)
Basis of property not increased by reason of excludable amounts.
Notwithstanding any provision of section 1016 (relating to adjustments to basis) to the contrary, basis of any property does not include any amount which is excludable from gross income under section 126.
(f)
Cross reference.
For rules relating to the recapture as ordinary income of the gain from the disposition (within 20 years of the date of receipt) of property for which an exclusion is claimed for a section 126 improvement, see section 1255 and the regulations thereunder.
(g)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
In 1981, 100 acres of the taxpayer's land is reclaimed under a Rural Abandoned Mine Program contract with the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The total cost of the improvement is $700,000. USDA pays $690,000, the taxpayer $10,000. The Secretary of Agriculture certifies that 95% of the $690,000 USDA payment was primarily for the purpose of conservation. Therefore, $34,500 ($690,000 × .05) is a nonsection 126 payment. $150,000 of USDA's payment is compensation for the taxpayer's service in the reclamation project and is includable in gross income as compensation for services. The taxpayer has $20,000 of allowable deductions in 1981, $15,500 of which are properly attributable to the USDA payment. Based on all the facts and circumstances, the value of the improvement is $21,000. The taxpayer elects not to have section 126 apply. The taxpayer computes the amount which is included in gross income as a result of receipt of the improvement as follows:
(1)
Cost of improvement
$700,000
Nonsection 126 payment
(34,500)
Compensation for services
(150,000)
Current deductions
(15,500)
Section 126 cost
500,000
(2)
Value of improvement
21,000
Multiplied by section 126 cost
× 500,000
Cost of improvement
700,000
Value of section 126 improvement
15,000
(3)
Value of section 126 improvement
15,000
(Taxpayer's contribution)
10,000
Amount included in gross income
5,000

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as example (1) except that section 126 applies. Based on all the facts and circumstances, the present fair market value of the right to receive annual income from the property of 10 percent of the prior average annual income of the affected acreage prior to the receipt of the improvement is $1,380 and the present fair market value of the right to receive $250 ($2.50 × 100 acres) is $1,550. The excludable portion is, therefore, $1,550. The taxpayer
computes the amount included in gross income as follows:
Value of section 126 improvement
$15,000
(Taxpayer's contribution)
(10,000)
(Excludable portion)
(1,550)
Amount included in income
3,450

# Example (3).
The facts are the same as example (2) except that the present value of 10 percent of the prior average annual income is $5,600. The taxpayer realizes no income as a result of receipt of the section 126 project.
(1)
Value of section 126 improvement
$15,000
(Taxpayer's contribution)
(10,000)
(Excludable portion)
(5,600)
Amount included in income

# Example (4).
In 1983, the taxpayer signs a contract under the water bank program under which he will maintain 20 acres of undisturbed wetlands as a wildfowl preserve. In return he will receive $90 an acre as rent from the government. Although the payment is made under a program listed in section 126(a) and the Secretary of Agriculture has certified that the entire amount of payment was made primarily for the purpose of conservation, there is no income eligible for section 126 exclusion because the full payment is rent. The rent is included in full in gross income.

# Example (5).
In 1980, the taxpayer reforests 200 acres of nonindustrial private forest land by planting tree seedlings. The taxpayer pays the full cost of the reforestation, $15,000. Under the cost-sharing provisions of the forestry incentives program, the taxpayer receives a reimbursement from USDA of $12,000. The Secretary of Agriculture certifies that 100% of the USDA payment is primarily for the purpose of conservation. Assume that the excludable portion is $3,500 and that based on all the facts and circumstances, the value of the improvement is $15,000. The amount which is includable in income is the value of the section 126 improvement, reduced by the excludable portion and the taxpayer's share of the cost of the improvement. Therefore the taxpayer includes $8,500 in gross income as a result of the USDA payment, computed as follows:
Value of the section 126 improvement
$15,000
(Excludable portion)
(3,500)
(Taxpayer's contribution)
(3,000)
Amount included in gross income
8,500

§ 16A.126-2
Section 126 elections.
(a)
Election for section 126 not to apply in whole or in part.
A taxpayer may elect under section 126(c) not to have section 126 apply to all or any part of an improvement described in section 126.
(b)
Application of the section 126 exclusion.
To the extent the section 126 exclusion applies, the taxpayer should so indicate on an attachment to the tax return (or amended return) for the taxable year in which the taxpayer received the last payment made by a government for the improvement. The attachment should state the dollar amount of the section 126 cost funded by a government payment, the value of the section 126 improvement, and the amount that the taxpayer is excluding under section 126.
§ 16A.1255-1
General rule for treatment of gain from disposition of section 126 property.
(a)
Ordinary income
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this section and § 16A.1255-2, if section 126 property is disposed of after September 30, 1979, then under section 1255(a)(1) there shall be recognized as ordinary income the lesser of—
(i) The “excludable portion” under section 126, or
(ii)(A) The excess of the amount realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion), or the fair market value of the section 126 property (in the case of any other disposi-tion), over the adjusted basis of the property, less
(B) The amount recognized as ordinary income under the other provisions of Chapter I, Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code.
(2)
Application of section.
Any gain treated as ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1) shall be recognized as ordinary income notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Code except that section 1255 does not apply to the extent the gain is recognized as ordinary income under the other provisions of Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code. For special rules with respect to the application of section 1255, see § 16A.1255-2. For the relation of section 1255 to other provisions, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Meaning of terms.
For purposes of section 1255 and these regulations—
(i) The term “section 126 property” means any property acquired, improved, or otherwise modified as a result of a payment listed in section 126(a) which has been certified by the Secretary of Agriculture as primarily for the purpose of conservation;
(ii) The term “excludable portion” is defined in § 16A.126-1(b)(5);
(iii) The term “disposition” has the same meaning as in § 1.1245-1(a)(3);
(iv) The term “date of receipt of the section 126 payment” means the last date the government made a payment for the improvements.
(4)
Applicable percentage.
If section 126 property is disposed of less than 10 years after the date of receipt of the last payment which has been certified by the Secretary of Agriculture as primarily for the purpose of conservation, the “applicable percentage” is 100 percent; if section 126 property is disposed of more than 10 years after that date, the applicable percentage is 100 percent reduced (but not below zero) by 10 percent for each year or part thereof in excess of 10 years such property was held after the date of the section 126 payment.
(5)
Portion of parcel.
The amount of gain to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1) shall be determined separately for each parcel of section 126 property in a manner consistent with the principles of § 1245-1(a) (4) and (5) relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property. If (i) only a portion of a parcel of section 126 property is disposed of in a transaction, or if two or more portions of a single parcel are disposed of in one transaction, and (ii) the aggregate of “excludable portions” with respect to any such portion cannot be established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, then the aggregate of the “excludable portions” in respect of the entire parcel shall be allocated to each portion in proportion to the fair market value of each at the time of the disposition.
(b)
Instances of nonapplication
—(1)
In general.
Section 1255 does not apply if a taxpayer disposes of section 126 property more than 20 years after receipt of the last section 126 payment with respect to the property.
(2)
Losses.
Section 1255(a)(1) does not apply to losses. Thus, section 1255(a)(1) does not apply if a loss is realized upon a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of property, all of which is section 126 property, nor does the section apply to a disposition of the property other than by way of sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion if at the time of the disposition the fair market value of the property is not greater than its adjusted basis.
(c)
Relation of section 1255 to other provisions
—(1)
General.
The provisions of section 1255 apply notwithstanding any other provisions of Subtitle A of the Code except that they do not apply to the extent gain is recognized as ordinary income under the other provisions of Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code. Thus, unless an exception or limitation under § 16A.1255-2 applies, gain under section 1255(a)(1) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For example, since section 1255 overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in the trade or business), the gain recognized under section 1255 upon a disposition of section 126 property will be treated as ordinary income and only the remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of property to which section 1231 applies. See example (1) of paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Nonrecognition sections overridden.
The nonrecognition of gain provisions of Subtitle A of the Code which section 1255 overrides include, but are not limited to, sections 267(d), 311(a), 336, 337, and 512(b)(5). See § 16A.1255-2 for the extent to which section 1255(a)(1) overrides sections 332, 351, 361, 371(a), 374(a), 721, 731, 1031, and 1033.
(3)
Installment method.
Gain from a disposition to which section 1255(a)(1) applies may be reported under the installment method if such method is otherwise available under section 453 of the Code. In such a case, the portion of the installment payment that is gain is treated as follows: first as ordinary gain under other sections of Chapter I Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code until all that gain has been reported; next as ordinary gain to which section
1255 applies until all that gain is reported; and finally as gain under other sections of Chapter I, Subchapter D, Part IV of the Code. For treatment of amounts as interest on certain deferred payments, see section 483.
(4)
Exempt income.
With regard to exempt income, the principles of § 1.1245-6(e) shall be applicable.
(5)
Treatment of gain not recognized under section 1255(a)(1).
For treatment of gain not recognized under this section, the principles of § 1.1245-6(f) shall be applicable.
(d)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Individual A uses the calendar year as his taxable year. On April 10, 1995, A sells for $75,000 section 126 property with an adjusted basis of $52,500 for a realized gain of $22,500. The excludable portion under section 126 was $18,000. A received the section 126 payment on January 5, 1990. No gain is recognized as ordinary gain under sections 1231 through 1254. Because the applicable percentage, 100 percent, of the aggregate of the section 126 improvements ($18,000), $18,000, is lower than the gain realized, $22,500, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1) is $18,000. The remaining $4,500 of the gain may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.
§ 16A.1255-2
Special rules.
(a)
Exception for gifts
—(1)
General rule.
In general, no gain shall be recognized under section 1255(a)(1) upon a disposition of section 126 property by gift. For purposes of section 1255 and this paragraph, the term “gift” shall have the same meaning as in § 1.1245-4(a) and, with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles illustrated by the examples of § 1.1245-4(a)(2) shall apply.
(2)
Disposition in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift.
Where a disposition of section 126 property is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, the amount of gain which shall be recognized as ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1) shall be computed under § 16A.1255-1(a)(1), applied by treating the gain realized (for purposes of § 16A.1255-1(a)(1)(ii)), as the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the section 126 property.
(3)
Treatment of section 126 property in hands of transferee.
See paragraph (d) of this section for treatment of the transferee in the case of a disposition to which this paragraph applies.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
On March 2, 1986, A makes a gift to B of a parcel of land having an adjusted basis of $40,000 and fair market value of $65,000. On the date of that gift, the aggregate of excludable portions under section 126 was $24,000. The section 126 payments were all received on January 15, 1981. Upon making the gift, A recognizes no gain under section 1255(a)(1). See paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For treatment of the property in the hands of B, see example (1) of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

# Example (2).
(i) Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that A transfers the land to B for $50,000. Assume further that no gain is recognized as ordinary income under any other provision of Chapter I, Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code. Thus, the gain realized is $10,000 (amount realized, $50,000, minus adjusted basis, $40,000), and A has made a gift of $15,000 (fair market value, $65,000, minus amount realized, $50,000).
(ii) Upon the transfer of the land to B, A recognizes $10,000 as ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1), computed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section as follows:
(1) Aggregate of excludable portions under section 126
$24,000
(2) Multiply: Applicable percentage for land disposed if within sixth year after section 126 payments were received
100
(3) Amount in § 16A.1255-1(a)(1)(i)
$24,000
(4) Gain realized (see (i) of this example)
10,000
(5) Amount in § 16A.1255-1(a)(1)(ii) applied in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section
10,000
(6) Lower of line (3) or line (5)
10,000
Thus, the entire gain realized on the transfer, $10,000, is recognized as ordinary income.
For treatment of the farm land in the hands of B, see example (2) of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(b)
Exception for transfer at death
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect of a decedent), no gain shall be recognized under section 1255(a)(1) upon a transfer at death. For purposes of section 1255 and this paragraph, the term “transfer at death” shall have the same meaning as in § 1.1245-4(b) and, with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles illustrated by the examples of § 1.1245-4(b)(2) shall apply.
(2)
Treatment of section 126 property in hands of transferee.
If, as of the date a
person acquires section 126 property from a decedent, the person's basis is determined by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent's death, or on the applicable date provided in section 2032 (relating to alternative valuation date), then on that date the aggregate of excludable portions under section 126 in the hands of such transferee is zero.
(c)
Limitation for certain tax-free transactions
—(1)
Limitation on amount of gain.
Upon a transfer of section 126 property described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1) shall not exceed an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1255) over (ii) the amount (if any) of gain recognized as ordinary income under the other provisions of Chapter I, Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the principles of § 1.1245-4(c)(1) shall apply. Thus, in the case of a transfer of section 126 property and other property in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the section 126 property (as determined in a manner consistent with the principles of § 1.1245-1(a)(5)) shall consist of that portion of the fair market value of each property acquired which bears the same ratio to the fair market value of the acquired property as the amount realized from the disposition of the section 126 property bears to the total amount realized. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1255) which is eligible to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1). The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to a disposition of property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by Chapter I of the Code.
(2)
Transfers covered.
The transfers referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are transfers of section 126 property in which the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any of the following provisions:
(i) Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary corporation). For application of paragraph (c)(1) of this section to such a complete liquidation, the principles of § 1.1245-4(c)(3) shall apply. Thus, for example, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply to a liquidating distribution of section 126 property by an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to its parent if the parent's basis for the property is determined, under section 334(b)(2), by reference to its basis for the stock of the subsidiary.
(ii) Section 351 (relating to transfer to a corporation controlled by the transferor).
(iii) Section 361 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain corporate reorganizations).
(iv) Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).
(v) Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain railroad reorganizations).
(vi) Section 721 (relating to transfers to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest). See paragraph (e) of this section.
(vii) Section 731 (relating to distributions by a partnership to a partner). For special carryover of basis rule, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(viii) Section 1031 (relating to like kind exchanges).
(ix) Section 1034 (relating to rollover of gain on the sale of a principal residence).
(3)
Treatment of section 126 property in the hands of transferee.
See paragraph (d) of this section for treatment of the transferee in the case of a disposition to which this paragraph applies.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
On January 4, 1986, A holds a parcel of property that is section 126 property having an adjusted basis of $15,000 and a fair market value of $40,000. On that date he transfers the parcel to corporation M in exchange for stock in the corporation worth
$40,000 in a transaction qualifying under section 351. On the date of the transfer, the aggregate of excludable portions under section 126 with respect to the transferred property is $18,000 and all of such amount was received on March 25, 1981. With regard to section 1255, A would recognize no gain under section 351 upon the transfer and M's basis for the land would be determined under section 362(a) by reference to its basis in the hands of A. Thus, as a result of the disposition, no gain is recognized as ordinary income under section 1255 by A since the amount of gain recognized under that section is limited to the amount of gain which is recognized under section 351 (determined without regard to section 1255). See paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For treatment of the section 126 property in the hands of B, see paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

# Example (2).
Assume the same facts in example (1), except that A transferred the property to M for stock in the corporation worth $32,000 and $8,000 cash. The gain realized is $25,000 (amount realized, $40,000, minus adjusted basis, $15,000). Without regard to section 1255, A would recognize $8,000 of gain under section 351(b). Assume further that no gain is recognized as ordinary income under the other provisions of Chapter I, Subchapter P, Part IV of the Code. Therefore, since the applicable percentage, 100 percent of the aggregate excludable portions under section 126, $18,000, is lower than the gain realized, $25,000, the amount of gain to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1) would be $18,000 if the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply. Since under section 351(b) gain in the amount of $8,000 would be recognized to the transferor without regard to section 1255, the limitation provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section limits the gain taken into account by A under section 1255(a)(1) to $8,000.

# Example (3).
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that $5,000 of gain is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1255(a)(1) is $3,000 computed as follows:
(1) Amount of gain under section 1255(a)(1) (determined without regard to paragraph (c)(1) of this section):
(a) Aggregate of excludable portions under section 126
$18,000
(b) Multiply: Applicable percentage for property disposed of within the fifth year after section 126 payments were received (percent)
100
(c) Amount in § 16A.1255-1(a)(1)(i)
$18,000
(d) Gain realized (amount realized $40,000 less adjusted basis, $15,000)
$25,000
(e) Lower of line (c) or line (d)
$18,000
(2) Limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
(a) Gain recognized (determined without regard to section 1255)
$8,000
(b) Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1)
$5,000
(c) Difference
$3,000
(3) Lower of line (1)(e) or line (2)(c)
$3,000
Thus, the entire gain recognized under section 351(b) (determined without regard to sections 1251 and 1255), $8,000, is recognized as ordinary income since that amount is equal to the sum of the gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), $5,000, and under section 1255(a)(1), $3,000.
(d)
Treatment of section 126 property received by a transferee in a disposition by gift and certain tax-free transactions
—(1)
General rule.
If section 126 property is disposed of in a transaction which is either a gift to which paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies, or a completely tax-free transfer to which paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies, then for purposes of section 1255—
(i) The aggregate of the excludable portions under section 126 in respect of the land in the hands of the transferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to the amount of such aggregate in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition, and
(ii) For purposes of applying section 1255 upon a subsequent disposition by the transferee (including a computation of the applicable percentage), the dates of receipt of section 126 payments shall not be affected by the dispositions.
(2)
Certain partially tax-free transfers.
If section 126 property is disposed of in a transaction which either is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift to which paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies, or is a partially tax-free transfer to which paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies, then for purposes of section 1255 the amount determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be reduced by the amount of gain taken into account under section 1255 by the transferor upon the disposition. Upon a subsequent disposition by the transferee, the dates of receipt of section 126 payments remain the same in the hands of the transferee as they were in the hands of the transferor. With respect to the 175 and 182 deductions taken by the transferee, the holding period shall not include the holding period of the transferor.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
Assume the same facts as in example (1) of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Therefore, on the date B receives the land in the gift transaction, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the aggregate of excludable portions under section 126 in respect of the land in the hands of B is the amount in the hands of A, $24,000, and for purposes of applying section 1255 upon a subsequent disposition by B (including a computation of the applicable percentage) the date the section 126 payments were received is the same as it was when the property was in A's hands (January 15, 1981).

# Example (2).
Assume the same facts as in example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the aggregate of excludable portions under section 126 which pass over to B for purposes of section 1255 is $14,000 ($24,000 excluded under section 126 minus $10,000 gain recognized under section 1255(d)(1) in accordance with example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of this section). The date the section 126 payments were received is the same as when the property was in B's hands (January 15, 1981).
(e)
Disposition of section 126 property not specifically covered.
If section 126 property is disposed of in a transaction not specifically covered under § 16A.1255-1, and this section, then the principles of section 1245 shall apply.

# Introduction
§ 20.0-1
Introduction.
(a)
In general.
(1) The regulations in this part (part 20, subchapter B, chapter I, title 26, Code of Federal Regulations) are designated “Estate Tax Regulations.” These regulations pertain to (i) the Federal estate tax imposed by chapter 11 of subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code on the transfer of estates of decedents dying after August 16, 1954, and (ii) certain related administrative provisions of subtitle F of the Code. It should be noted that the application of many of the provisions of these regulations may be affected by the provisions of an applicable death tax convention with a foreign country. Unless otherwise indicated, references in the regulations to the “Internal Revenue Code” or the “Code” are references to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and references to a section or other provision of law are references to a section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. Unless otherwise provided, the Estate Tax Regulations are applicable to the estates of decedents dying after August 16, 1954, and supersede the regulations contained in part 81, subchapter B, chapter I, title 26, Code of Federal Regulations (1939) (Regulations 105, Estate Tax), as prescribed and made applicable to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 by Treasury Decision 6091, signed August 16, 1954 (19 FR 5167, Aug. 17, 1954). The regulations in this part do not reflect the amendments made by the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1539).
(2) Section 2208 makes the provisions of chapter 11 of the Code apply to the transfer of the estates of certain decedents dying after September 2, 1958, who were citizens of the United States and residents of a possession thereof at the time of death. Section 2209 makes the provisions of chapter 11 apply to the transfer of the estates of certain other decedents dying after September 14, 1960, who were citizens of the United States and residents of a possession thereof at the time of death. See §§ 20.2208-1 and 20.2209-1. Except as otherwise provided in §§ 20.2208-1 and 20.2209-1, the provisions of these regulations do not apply to the estates of such decedents.
(b)
Scope of regulations
—(1)
Estates of citizens or residents.
Subchapter A of Chapter 11 of the Code pertains to the taxation of the estate of a person who was a citizen or a resident of the United States at the time of his death. A “resident” decedent is a decedent who, at the time of his death, had his domicile in the United States. The term “United States”, as used in the estate tax regulations, includes only the States and the District of Columbia. The term also includes the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii prior to
their admission as States. See section 7701(a)(9). A person acquires a domicile in a place by living there, for even a brief period of time, with no definite present intention of later removing therefrom. Residence without the requisite intention to remain indefinitely will not suffice to constitute domicile, nor will intention to change domicile effect such a change unless accompanied by actual removal. For the meaning of the term “citizen of the United States” as applied in a case where the decedent was a resident of a possession of the United States, see § 20.2208-1. The regulations pursuant to subchapter A are set forth in §§ 20.2001-1 to 20.2056(d)-1.
(2)
Estates of nonresidents not citizens.
Subchapter B of Chapter 11 of the Code pertains to the taxation of the estate of a person who was a nonresident not a citizen of the United States at the time of his death. A “nonresident” decedent is a decedent who, at the time of his death, had his domicile outside the United States under the principles set forth in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. (See, however, section 2202 with respect to missionaries in foreign service.) The regulations pursuant to subchapter B are set forth in §§ 20.2101-1 to 20.2107-1.
(3)
Miscellaneous substantive provisions.
Subchapter C of Chapter 11 of the Code contains a number of miscellaneous substantive provisions. The regulations pursuant to subchapter C are set forth in §§ 20.2203-1 through 20.2209-1.
(4)
Procedure and administration provisions.
Subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code contains some sections which are applicable to the Federal estate tax. The regulations pursuant to those sections are set forth in §§ 20.6001-1 to 20.7101-1. Such regulations do not purport to be all the regulations on procedure and administration which are pertinent to estate tax matters. For the remainder of the regulations on procedure and administration which are pertinent to estate tax matters, see part 301 (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) of this chapter.
(c)
Arrangement and numbering.
Each section of the regulations in this part (other than this section and § 20.0-2) is designated by a number composed of the part number followed by a decimal point (20.); the section of the Internal Revenue Code which it interprets; a hyphen (-); and a number identifying the section. By use of these designations one can ascertain the sections of the regulations relating to a provision of the Code. For example, the regulations pertaining to section 2012 of the Code are designated § 20.2012-1.
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 6526, 26 FR 414, Jan. 19, 1961; T.D. 7238, 37 FR 28717, Dec. 29, 1972; T.D. 7296, 38 FR 34191, Dec. 12, 1973; T.D. 7665, 45 FR 6089, Jan. 25, 1980; T.D. 8522, 59 FR 9646, Mar. 1, 1994; T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9238, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 20.0-2
General description of tax.
(a)
Nature of tax.
The Federal estate tax is neither a property tax nor an inheritance tax. It is a tax imposed upon the transfer of the entire taxable estate and not upon any particular legacy, devise, or distributive share. Escheat of a decedent's property to the State for lack of heirs is a transfer which causes the property to be included in the decedent's gross estate.
(b)
Method of determining tax; estate of citizen or resident
—(1)
In general.
Subparagraphs (2) to (5) of this paragraph contain a general description of the method to be used in determining the Federal estate tax imposed upon the transfer of the estate of a decedent who was a citizen or resident of the United States at the time of his death.
(2)
Gross estate.
The first step in determining the tax is to ascertain the total value of the decedent's gross estate. The value of the gross estate includes the value of all property to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death. (For certain exceptions in the case of real property situated outside the United States, see paragraphs (a) and (c) of § 20.2031-1.) In addition, the gross estate may include property in which the decedent did not have an interest at the time of his death. A decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes may therefore be very different from the same decedent's estate for local probate purposes. Examples of items which may be included in a decedent's gross estate and not in his probate estate are the following: certain property
transferred by the decedent during his lifetime without adequate consideration; property held jointly by the decedent and others; property over which the decedent had a general power of appointment; proceeds of certain policies of insurance on the decedent's life; annuities; and dower or curtesy of a surviving spouse or a statutory estate in lieu thereof. For a detailed explanation of the method of ascertaining the value of the gross estate, see sections 2031 through 2044, and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Taxable estate.
The second step in determining the tax is to ascertain the value of the decedent's taxable estate. The value of the taxable estate is determined by subtracting from the value of the gross estate the authorized exemption and deductions. Under various conditions and limitations, deductions are allowable for expenses, indebtedness, taxes, losses, charitable transfers, and transfers to a surviving spouse. For a detailed explanation of the method of ascertaining the value of the taxable estate, see sections 2051 through 2056, and the regulations thereunder.
(4)
Gross estate tax.
The third step is the determination of the gross estate tax. This is accomplished by the application of certain rates to the value of the decedent's taxable estate. In this connection, see section 2001 and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Net estate tax payable.
The final step is the determination of the net estate tax payable. This is done by subtracting from the gross estate tax the authorized credits against tax. Under certain conditions and limitations, credits are allowable for the following (computed in the order stated below):
(i) State death taxes paid in connection with the decedent's estate (section 2011);
(ii) Gift taxes paid on inter-vivos transfers by the decedent of property included in his gross estate (section 2012);
(iii) Foreign death taxes paid in connection with the decedent's estate (section 2014); and
(iv) Federal estate taxes paid on transfers of property to the decedent (section 2013).
Sections 25.2701-5 and 25.2702-6 of this chapter contain rules that provide additional adjustments to mitigate double taxation in cases where the amount of the decedent's gift was previously determined under the special valuation provisions of sections 2701 and 2702. For a detailed explanation of the credits against tax, see sections 201l through 2016 and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Method of determining tax; estate of nonresident not a citizen.
In general, the method to be used in determining the Federal estate tax imposed upon the transfer of an estate of a decedent who was a nonresident not a citizen of the United States is similar to that described in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the estate of a citizen or resident. Briefly stated, the steps are as follows: First, ascertain the sum of the value of that part of the decedent's “entire gross estate” which at the time of his death was situated in the United States (see §§ 20.2103-1 and 20.2014-1) and, in the case of an estate of an expatriate to which section 2107 applies, any amounts includible in his gross estate under section 2107(b) (see paragraph (b) of § 20.2107-1); second, determine the value of the taxable estate by subtracting from the amount determined under the first step the amount of the allowable deductions (see § 20.2106-1); third, compute the gross estate tax on the taxable estate (see § 20.2106-1); and fourth, subtract from the gross estate tax the total amount of any allowable credits in order to arrive at the net estate tax payable (see § 20.2102-1 and paragraph (c) of § 20.2107-1).

§ 20.2001-1
Valuation of adjusted taxable gifts and section 2701(d) taxable events.
(a)
Adjusted taxable gifts made prior to August 6, 1997.
For purposes of determining the value of adjusted taxable gifts as defined in section 2001(b), if the gift was made prior to August 6, 1997, the value of the gift may be adjusted at any time, even if the time within which a gift tax may be assessed has
expired under section 6501. This paragraph (a) also applies to adjustments involving issues other than valuation for gifts made prior to August 6, 1997.
(b)
Adjusted taxable gifts and section 2701(d) taxable events occurring after August 5, 1997.
For purposes of determining the amount of adjusted taxable gifts as defined in section 2001(b), if, under section 6501, the time has expired within which a gift tax may be assessed under chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code (or under corresponding provisions of prior laws) with respect to a gift made after August 5, 1997, or with respect to an increase in taxable gifts required under section 2701(d) and § 25.2701-4 of this chapter, then the amount of the taxable gift will be the amount as finally determined for gift tax purposes under chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code and the amount of the taxable gift may not thereafter be adjusted. The rule of this paragraph (b) applies to adjustments involving all issues relating to the gift, including valuation issues and legal issues involving the interpretation of the gift tax law.
(c)
Finally determined.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of a taxable gift as finally determined for gift tax purposes is—
(1) The amount of the taxable gift as shown on a gift tax return, or on a statement attached to the return, if the Internal Revenue Service does not contest such amount before the time has expired under section 6501 within which gift taxes may be assessed;
(2) The amount as specified by the Internal Revenue Service before the time has expired under section 6501 within which gift taxes may be assessed on the gift, if such specified amount is not timely contested by the taxpayer;
(3) The amount as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction; or
(4) The amount as determined pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into between the taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service.
(d)
Definitions.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the amount is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction when the court enters a final decision, judgment, decree or other order with respect to the amount of the taxable gift that is not subject to appeal. See, for example, section 7481 regarding the finality of a decision by the U.S. Tax Court. Also, for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a settlement agreement means any agreement entered into by the Internal Revenue Service and the taxpayer that is binding on both. The term includes a closing agreement under section 7121, a compromise under section 7122, and an agreement entered into in settlement of litigation involving the amount of the taxable gift.
(e)
Expiration of period of assessment.
For purposes of determining if the time has expired within which a tax may be assessed under chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code, see § 301.6501(c)-1(e) and (f) of this chapter.
(f)
Effective dates.
Paragraph (a) of this section applies to transfers of property by gift made prior to August 6, 1997, if the estate tax return for the donor/decedent's estate is filed after December 3, 1999. Paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section apply to transfers of property by gift made after August 5, 1997, if the gift tax return for the calendar period in which the gift is made is filed after December 3, 1999.

§ 20.2001-2
Valuation of adjusted taxable gifts for purposes of determining the deceased spousal unused exclusion amount of last deceased spouse.
(a)
General rule.
Notwithstanding § 20.2001-1(b), §§ 20.2010-2(d) and 20.2010-3(d) provide additional rules regarding the authority of the Internal Revenue Service to examine any gift or other tax return(s), even if the time within which a tax may be assessed under section 6501 has expired, for the purpose of determining the deceased spousal unused exclusion amount available under section 2010(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (a) of this section applies to the estates of decedents dying on or after June 12, 2015. See 26 CFR 20.2001-2T(a), as contained in 26 CFR part 20, revised as of April 1, 2015, for the rules applicable to estates of decedents dying on or after January 1, 2011, and before June 12, 2015.
[T.D. 9725, 80 FR 34284, June 16, 2015]
§ 20.2002-1
Liability for payment of tax.
The Federal estate tax imposed both with respect to the estates of citizens or residents and with respect to estates of nonresidents not citizens is payable by the executor or administrator of the decedent's estate. This duty applies to the entire tax, regardless of the fact that the gross estate consists in part of property which does not come within the possession of the executor or administrator. If there is no executor or administrator appointed, qualified and acting in the United States, any person in actual or constructive possession of any property of the decedent is required to pay the entire tax to the extent of the value of the property in his possession. See section 2203, defining the term “executor”. The personal liability of the executor or such other person is described in section 3467 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. 192) as follows:
Every executor, administrator, or assignee, or other person, who pays, in whole or in part, any debt due by the person or estate for whom or for which he acts before he satisfies and pays the debts due to the United States from such person or estate, shall become answerable in his own person and estate to the extent of such payments for the debts so due to the United States, or for so much thereof as may remain due and unpaid.
As used in said section, the word “debt” includes a beneficiary's distributive share of an estate. Thus, if the executor pays a debt due by the decedent's estate or distributes any portion of the estate before all the estate tax is paid, he is personally liable, to the extent of the payment or distribution, for so much of the estate tax as remains due and unpaid. In addition, section 6324(a)(2) provides that if the estate tax is not paid when due, then the spouse, transferee, trustee (except the trustee of an employee's trust which meets the requirements of section 401(a)), surviving tenant, person in possession of the property by reason of the exercise, nonexercise, or release of a power of appointment, or beneficiary, who receives, or has on the date of the decedent's death, property included in the gross estate under section 2034 through 2042, is personally liable for the tax to the extent of the value, at the time of the decedent's death, of such property. See also the following related sections of the Internal Revenue Code: Section 2204, discharge of executor from personal liability; section 2205, reimbursement out of estate; sections 2206 and 2207, liability of life insurance beneficiaries and recipients of property over which decedent had power of appointment; sections 6321 through 6325, concerning liens for taxes; and section 6901(a)(1), concerning the liabilities of transferees and fiduciaries.

§ 20.2010-1
Unified credit against estate tax; in general.
(a)
General rule.
Section 2010(a) allows the estate of every decedent a credit against the estate tax imposed by section 2001. The allowable credit is the applicable credit amount. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section for an explanation of the term
applicable credit amount.
(b)
Special rule in case of certain gifts made before 1977.
The applicable credit amount allowable under paragraph (a) of this section must be reduced by an amount equal to 20 percent of the aggregate amount allowed as a specific exemption under section 2521 (as in effect before its repeal by the Tax Reform Act of 1976) for gifts made by the decedent after September 8, 1976, and before January 1, 1977.
(c)
Special rule in the case of a difference between the basic exclusion amount applicable to gifts and that applicable at the donor's date of death.
Changes in the basic exclusion amount that occur between the date of a donor's gift and the date of the donor's death may cause the basic exclusion amount allowable on the date of a gift to exceed that allowable on the date of death. If the total of the amounts allowable as a credit in computing the gift tax payable on the decedent's post-1976 gifts, within the meaning of section 2001(b)(2), to the extent such credits are based solely on the basic exclusion amount as defined and adjusted in section 2010(c)(3), exceeds the credit allowable within the meaning of section 2010(a) in computing the estate tax, again only to the extent such credit is based solely on such basic exclusion amount, in each case by applying the tax rates in effect at the decedent's death, then the portion of the credit allowable in computing the estate tax on the decedent's taxable estate that is attributable to the basic exclusion amount is the sum of the amounts attributable to the basic exclusion amount allowable as a credit in computing the gift tax payable on the decedent's post-1976 gifts.
(1)
Computational rules.
For purposes of this paragraph (c):
(i) In determining the amounts allowable as a credit:
(A) The amount allowable as a credit in computing gift tax payable for any calendar period may not exceed the tentative tax on the gifts made during that period (section 2505(c)); and
(B) The amount allowable as a credit in computing the estate tax may not exceed the net tentative tax on the taxable estate (section 2010(d)).
(ii) In determining the extent to which an amount allowable as a credit in computing gift tax payable is based solely on the basic exclusion amount:
(A) Any deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount available to the decedent is deemed to be applied to gifts made by the decedent before the decedent's basic exclusion amount is applied to those gifts (see §§ 20.2010-3(b) and 25.2505-2(b));
(B) In a calendar period in which the applicable exclusion amount allowable with regard to gifts made during that period includes amounts other than the basic exclusion amount, the allowable basic exclusion amount may not exceed that necessary to reduce the tentative gift tax to zero; and
(C) In a calendar period in which the applicable exclusion amount allowable with regard to gifts made during that
period includes amounts other than the basic exclusion amount, the portion of the credit based solely on the basic exclusion amount is that which corresponds to the result of dividing the basic exclusion amount allocable to those gifts by the applicable exclusion amount allocable to those gifts.
(iii) In determining the extent to which an amount allowable as a credit in computing the estate tax is based solely on the basic exclusion amount, the credit is computed as if the applicable exclusion amount were limited to the basic exclusion amount.
(2)
Examples.
All basic exclusion amounts include hypothetical inflation adjustments. Unless otherwise stated, in each example the decedent's date of death is after 2025.
(i)
Example 1.
Individual A (never married) made cumulative post-1976 taxable gifts of $9 million, all of which were sheltered from gift tax by the cumulative total of $11.4 million in basic exclusion amount allowable on the dates of the gifts. The basic exclusion amount on A's date of death is $6.8 million. A was not eligible for any restored exclusion amount pursuant to Notice 2017-15. Because the total of the amounts allowable as a credit in computing the gift tax payable on A's post-1976 gifts (based on the $9 million of basic exclusion amount used to determine those credits) exceeds the credit based on the $6.8 million basic exclusion amount allowable on A's date of death, this paragraph (c) applies, and the credit for purposes of computing A's estate tax is based on a basic exclusion amount of $9 million, the amount used to determine the credits allowable in computing the gift tax payable on A's post-1976 gifts.
(ii)
Example 2.
Assume that the facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section except that A made cumulative post-1976 taxable gifts of $4 million. Because the total of the amounts allowable as a credit in computing the gift tax payable on A's post-1976 gifts is less than the credit based on the $6.8 million basic exclusion amount allowable on A's date of death, this paragraph (c) does not apply. The credit to be applied for purposes of computing A's estate tax is based on the $6.8 million basic exclusion amount as of A's date of death, subject to the limitation of section 2010(d).
(iii)
Example 3.
Individual B's predeceased spouse, C, died before 2026, at a time when the basic exclusion amount was $11.4 million. C had made no taxable gifts and had no taxable estate. C's executor elected, pursuant to § 20.2010-2, to allow B to take into account C's $11.4 million DSUE amount. B made no taxable gifts and did not remarry. The basic exclusion amount on B's date of death is $6.8 million. Because the total of the amounts allowable as a credit in computing the gift tax payable on B's post-1976 gifts attributable to the basic exclusion amount (zero) is less than the credit based on the basic exclusion amount allowable on B's date of death, this paragraph (c) does not apply. The credit to be applied for purposes of computing B's estate tax is based on B's $18.2 million applicable exclusion amount, consisting of the $6.8 million basic exclusion amount on B's date of death plus the $11.4 million DSUE amount, subject to the limitation of section 2010(d).
(iv)
Example 4.
Assume the facts are the same as in
Example 3
of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section except that, after C's death and before 2026, B makes taxable gifts of $14 million in a year when the basic exclusion amount is $12 million. B is considered to apply the DSUE amount to the gifts before applying B's basic exclusion amount. The amount allowable as a credit in computing the gift tax payable on B's post-1976 gifts for that year ($5,545,800) is the tax on $14 million, consisting of $11.4 million in DSUE amount and $2.6 million in basic exclusion amount. This basic exclusion amount is 18.6 percent of the $14 million exclusion amount allocable to those gifts, with the result that $1,031,519 (0.186 × $5,545,800) of the amount allowable as a credit for that year in computing gift tax payable is based solely on the basic exclusion amount. The amount allowable as a credit based solely on the basic exclusion amount for purposes of computing B's estate tax ($2,665,800) is
the tax on the $6.8 million basic exclusion amount on B's date of death. Because the portion of the credit allowable in computing the gift tax payable on B's post-1976 gifts based solely on the basic exclusion amount ($1,031,519) is less than the credit based solely on the basic exclusion amount ($2,665,800) allowable on B's date of death, this paragraph (c) does not apply. The credit to be applied for purposes of computing B's estate tax is based on B's $18.2 million applicable exclusion amount, consisting of the $6.8 million basic exclusion amount on B's date of death plus the $11.4 million DSUE amount, subject to the limitation of section 2010(d).
(3) [Reserved]
(d)
Credit limitation.
The applicable credit amount allowed under paragraph (a) of this section cannot exceed the amount of the estate tax imposed by section 2001.
(e)
Explanation of terms.
The explanation of terms in this section applies to this section and to §§ 20.2010-2 and 20.2010-3.
(1)
Applicable credit amount.
The term
applicable credit amount
refers to the allowable credit against estate tax imposed by section 2001 and gift tax imposed by section 2501. The applicable credit amount equals the amount of the tentative tax that would be determined under section 2001(c) if the amount on which such tentative tax is to be computed were equal to the applicable exclusion amount. The applicable credit amount is determined by applying the unified rate schedule in section 2001(c) to the applicable exclusion amount.
(2)
Applicable exclusion amount.
The
applicable exclusion amount
equals the sum of the basic exclusion amount and, in the case of a surviving spouse, the deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount.
(3)
Basic exclusion amount.
Except to the extent provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the
basic exclusion amount
is the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) For any decedent dying in calendar year 2011 or thereafter, $5,000,000; and
(ii) For any decedent dying after calendar year 2011 and before calendar year 2018, $5,000,000 multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year of the decedent's death by substituting “calendar year 2010” for “calendar year 1992” in section 1(f)(3)(B) and by rounding to the nearest multiple of $10,000. For any decedent dying after calendar year 2017, $5,000,000 multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year of the decedent's death by substituting “calendar year 2010” for “calendar year 2016” in section 1(f)(3)(A)(ii) and rounded to the nearest multiple of $10,000.
(iii) For any decedent dying after calendar year 2017, and before calendar year 2026, paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section will be applied by substituting “$10,000,000” for “$5,000,000.”
(4)
Deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount.
The term
DSUE amount
refers, generally, to the unused portion of a decedent's applicable exclusion amount to the extent this amount does not exceed the basic exclusion amount in effect in the year of the decedent's death. For the rules on computing the DSUE amount, see §§ 20.2010-2(c) and 20.2010-3(b).
(5)
Last deceased spouse.
The term
last deceased spouse
means the most recently deceased individual who, at that individual's death after December 31, 2010, was married to the surviving spouse. See §§ 20.2010-3(a) and 25.2505-2(a) for additional rules pertaining to the identity of the last deceased spouse for purposes of determining the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse.
(f)
Applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this section applies to the estates of decedents dying after June 11, 2015. For the rules applicable to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2010, and before June 12, 2015, see § 20.2010-1T, as contained in 26 CFR part 20, revised as of April 1, 2015.
(2)
Exceptions.
Paragraphs (c) and (e)(3) of this section apply to estates of decedents dying on and after November 26, 2019. However, paragraph (e)(3) of this section may be applied by estates of decedents dying after December 31,
2017, and before November 26, 2019. For the explanation of the basic exclusion amount applicable to estates of decedents dying after June 11, 2015, and before January 1, 2018, see § 20.2010-1(d)(3), as contained in 26 CFR part 20, revised as of April 1, 2019.
[T.D. 9725, 80 FR 34285, June 16, 2015, as amended by T.D. 9884, 84 FR 64999, Nov. 26, 2019]
§ 20.2010-2
Portability provisions applicable to estate of a decedent survived by a spouse.
(a)
Election required for portability.
To allow a decedent's surviving spouse to take into account that decedent's deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount, the executor of the decedent's estate must elect portability of the DSUE amount on a timely filed Form 706, “United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return” (estate tax return). This election is referred to in this section and in § 20.2010-3 as the portability election.
(1)
Timely filing required.
An estate that elects portability will be considered, for purposes of subtitle B and subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), to be required to file a return under section 6018(a). Accordingly, the due date of an estate tax return required to elect portability is nine months after the decedent's date of death or the last day of the period covered by an extension (if an extension of time for filing has been obtained). See §§ 20.6075-1 and 20.6081-1 for additional rules relating to the time for filing estate tax returns. An extension of time to elect portability under this paragraph (a) will not be granted under § 301.9100-3 of this chapter to an estate that is required to file an estate tax return under section 6018(a), as determined without regard to this paragraph (a). Such an extension, however, may be available under the procedures applicable under §§ 301.9100-1 and 301.9100-3 of this chapter to an estate that is not required to file a return under section 6018(a), as determined without regard to this paragraph (a).
(2)
Portability election upon filing of estate tax return.
Upon the timely filing of a complete and properly prepared estate tax return, an executor of an estate of a decedent survived by a spouse will have elected portability of the decedent's DSUE amount unless the executor chooses not to elect portability and satisfies the requirement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. See paragraph (a)(7) of this section for the return requirements related to the portability election.
(3)
Portability election not made; requirements for election not to apply.
The executor of the estate of a decedent survived by a spouse will not make or be considered to make the portability election if either of the following applies:
(i) The executor states affirmatively on a timely filed estate tax return, or in an attachment to that estate tax return, that the estate is not electing portability under section 2010(c)(5). The manner in which the executor may make this affirmative statement on the estate tax return is as set forth in the instructions issued with respect to such form (“Instructions for Form 706”).
(ii) The executor does not timely file an estate tax return in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(4)
Election irrevocable.
An executor of the estate of a decedent survived by a spouse who timely files an estate tax return may make or may supersede a portability election previously made, provided that the estate tax return reporting the election or the superseding election is filed on or before the due date of the return, including extensions actually granted. However, see paragraph (a)(6) of this section when contrary elections are made by more than one person permitted to make the election. The portability election, once made, becomes irrevocable once the due date of the estate tax return, including extensions actually granted, has passed.
(5)
Estates eligible to make the election.
An executor may elect portability on behalf of the estate of a decedent survived by a spouse if the decedent dies on or after January 1, 2011. However, an executor of the estate of a nonresident decedent who was not a citizen of the United States at the time of death may not elect portability on behalf of that decedent, and the timely filing of such a decedent's estate tax return will not
constitute the making of a portability election.
(6)
Persons permitted to make the election
—(i)
Appointed executor.
An executor or administrator of the estate of a decedent survived by a spouse that is appointed, qualified, and acting within the United States, within the meaning of section 2203 (an appointed executor), may timely file the estate tax return on behalf of the estate of the decedent and, in so doing, elect portability of the decedent's DSUE amount. An appointed executor also may elect not to have portability apply pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Non-appointed executor.
If there is no appointed executor, any person in actual or constructive possession of any property of the decedent (a non-appointed executor) may timely file the estate tax return on behalf of the estate of the decedent and, in so doing, elect portability of the decedent's DSUE amount, or, by complying with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, may elect not to have portability apply. A portability election made by a non-appointed executor when there is no appointed executor for that decedent's estate can be superseded by a subsequent contrary election made by an appointed executor of that same decedent's estate on an estate tax return filed on or before the due date of the return, including extensions actually granted. An election to allow portability made by a non-appointed executor cannot be superseded by a contrary election to have portability not apply made by another non-appointed executor of that same decedent's estate (unless such other non-appointed executor is the successor of the non-appointed executor who made the election). See § 20.6018-2 for additional rules relating to persons permitted to file the estate tax return.
(7)
Requirements of return
—(i)
General rule.
An estate tax return will be considered complete and properly prepared for purposes of this section if it is prepared in accordance with the instructions issued for the estate tax return (Instructions for Form 706) and if the requirements of §§ 20.6018-2, 20.6018-3, and 20.6018-4 are satisfied. However, see paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section for reduced requirements applicable to certain property of certain estates.
(ii)
Reporting of value not required for certain property
—(A)
In general.
A special rule applies with respect to certain property of estates in which the executor is not required to file an estate tax return under section 6018(a), as determined without regard to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. With respect to such an estate, for bequests, devises, or transfers of property included in the gross estate, the value of which is deductible under section 2056 or 2056A (marital deduction property) or under section 2055(a) (charitable deduction property), an executor is not required to report a value for such property on the estate tax return (except to the extent provided in this paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A)) and will be required to report only the description, ownership, and/or beneficiary of such property, along with all other information necessary to establish the right of the estate to the deduction in accordance with §§ 20.2056(a)-1(b)(i) through (iii) and 20.2055-1(c), as applicable. However, this rule does not apply in certain circumstances as provided in this paragraph (a) and as may be further described in guidance issued from time to time by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter). In particular, this rule does not apply to marital deduction property or charitable deduction property if—
(
1
) The value of such property relates to, affects, or is needed to determine, the value passing from the decedent to a recipient other than the recipient of the marital or charitable deduction property;
(
2
) The value of such property is needed to determine the estate's eligibility for the provisions of sections 2032, 2032A, or another estate or generation-skipping transfer tax provision of the Code for which the value of such property or the value of the gross estate or adjusted gross estate must be known (not including section 1014 of the Code);
(
3
) Less than the entire value of an interest in property includible in the decedent's gross estate is marital deduction property or charitable deduction property; or
(
4
) A partial disclaimer or partial qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) election is made with respect to a bequest, devise, or transfer of property includible in the gross estate, part of which is marital deduction property or charitable deduction property.
(B)
Return requirements when reporting of value not required for certain property.
Paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section applies only if the executor exercises due diligence to estimate the fair market value of the gross estate, including the property described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section. Using the executor's best estimate of the value of properties to which paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section applies, the executor must report on the estate tax return, under penalties of perjury, the amount corresponding to the particular range within which falls the executor's best estimate of the total gross estate, in accordance with the Instructions for Form 706.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section. In each example, assume that Husband (H) dies in 2015, survived by his wife (W), that both H and W are U.S. citizens, that H's gross estate does not exceed the excess of the applicable exclusion amount for the year of his death over the total amount of H's adjusted taxable gifts and any specific exemption under section 2521, and that H's executor (E) timely files Form 706 solely to make the portability election.

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
The assets includible in H's gross estate consist of a parcel of real property and bank accounts held jointly with W with rights of survivorship, a life insurance policy payable to W, and a survivor annuity payable to W for her life. H made no taxable gifts during his lifetime.
(ii)
Application.
E files an estate tax return on which these assets are identified on the proper schedule, but E provides no information on the return with regard to the date of death value of these assets in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section. To establish the estate's entitlement to the marital deduction in accordance with § 20.2056(a)-1(b) (except with regard to establishing the value of the property) and the instructions for the estate tax return, E includes with the estate tax return evidence to verify the title of each jointly held asset, to confirm that W is the sole beneficiary of both the life insurance policy and the survivor annuity, and to verify that the annuity is exclusively for W's life. Finally, E reports on the estate return E's best estimate, determined by exercising due diligence, of the fair market value of the gross estate in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(B) of this section. The estate tax return is considered complete and properly prepared and E has elected portability.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
H's will, duly admitted to probate and not subject to any proceeding to challenge its validity, provides that H's entire estate is to be distributed outright to W. The non-probate assets includible in H's gross estate consist of a life insurance policy payable to H's children from a prior marriage, and H's individual retirement account (IRA) payable to W. H made no taxable gifts during his lifetime.
(ii)
Application.
E files an estate tax return on which all of the assets includible in the gross estate are identified on the proper schedule. In the case of the probate assets and the IRA, no information is provided with regard to date of death value in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section. However, E attaches a copy of H's will and describes each such asset and its ownership to establish the estate's entitlement to the marital deduction in accordance with the instructions for the estate tax return and § 20.2056(a)-1(b) (except with regard to establishing the value of the property). In the case of the life insurance policy payable to H's children, all of the regular return requirements, including reporting and establishing the fair market value of such asset, apply. Finally, E reports on the estate return E's best estimate, determined by exercising due diligence, of the fair market value of the gross estate in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(B) of this section. The estate tax return is considered complete and properly prepared and E has elected portability.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
H's will, duly admitted to probate and not subject to any proceeding to challenge its validity, provides that 50 percent of the property passing under the terms of H's will is to be paid to a marital trust for W and 50 percent is to be paid to a trust for W and their descendants.
(ii)
Application.
The amount passing to the non-marital trust cannot be verified without knowledge of the full value of the property passing under the will. Therefore, the value of the property of the marital trust relates to or affects the value passing to the trust for W and the descendants of H and W. Accordingly, the general return requirements apply to all of the property includible in the gross estate and the provisions of paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section do not apply.
(b)
Requirement for DSUE computation on estate tax return.
Section 2010(c)(5)(A) requires an executor of a
decedent's estate to include a computation of the DSUE amount on the estate tax return to elect portability and thereby allow the decedent's surviving spouse to take into account that decedent's DSUE amount. This requirement is satisfied by the timely filing of a complete and properly prepared estate tax return, as long as the executor has not elected out of portability as described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. See paragraph (a)(7) of this section for the requirements for a return to be considered complete and properly prepared.
(c)
Computation of the DSUE amount
—(1)
General rule.
Subject to paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section, the DSUE amount of a decedent with a surviving spouse is the lesser of the following amounts—
(i) The basic exclusion amount in effect in the year of the death of the decedent; or
(ii) The excess of—
(A) The decedent's applicable exclusion amount; over
(B) The sum of the amount of the taxable estate and the amount of the adjusted taxable gifts of the decedent, which together is the amount on which the tentative tax on the decedent's estate is determined under section 2001(b)(1).
(2)
Special rule to consider gift taxes paid by decedent.
Solely for purposes of computing the decedent's DSUE amount, the amount of the adjusted taxable gifts of the decedent referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section is reduced by the amount, if any, on which gift taxes were paid for the calendar year of the gift(s).
(3)
Impact of applicable credits.
An estate's eligibility under sections 2012 through 2015 for credits against the tax imposed by section 2001 does not impact the computation of the DSUE amount.
(4)
Special rule in case of property passing to qualified domestic trust
—(i)
In general.
When property passes for the benefit of a surviving spouse in a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) as defined in section 2056A(a), the DSUE amount of the decedent is computed on the decedent's estate tax return for the purpose of electing portability in the same manner as this amount is computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but this DSUE amount is subject to subsequent adjustments. The DSUE amount of the decedent must be redetermined upon the occurrence of the final distribution or other event (generally, the termination of all QDOTs created by or funded with assets passing from the decedent or the death of the surviving spouse) on which estate tax is imposed under section 2056A. See § 20.2056A-6 for the rules on determining the estate tax under section 2056A. See § 20.2010-3(c)(3) regarding the timing of the availability of the decedent's DSUE amount to the surviving spouse.
(ii)
Surviving spouse becomes a U.S. citizen.
If the surviving spouse becomes a U.S. citizen and if the requirements of section 2056A(b)(12) and the corresponding regulations are satisfied, the estate tax imposed under section 2056A(b)(1) ceases to apply. Accordingly, no estate tax will be imposed under section 2056A either on subsequent QDOT distributions or on the property remaining in the QDOT on the surviving spouse's death and the decedent's DSUE amount is no longer subject to adjustment.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1.
Computation of DSUE amount.
(i)
Facts.
In 2002, having made no prior taxable gift, Husband (H) makes a taxable gift valued at $1,000,000 and reports the gift on a timely filed gift tax return. Because the amount of the gift is equal to the applicable exclusion amount for that year ($1,000,000), $345,800 is allowed as a credit against the tax, reducing the gift tax liability to zero. H dies in 2015, survived by Wife (W). H and W are U.S. citizens and neither has any prior marriage. H's taxable estate is $1,000,000. The executor of H's estate timely files H's estate tax return and elects portability, thereby allowing W to benefit from H's DSUE amount.
(ii)
Application.
The executor of H's estate computes H's DSUE amount to be $3,430,000 (the lesser of the $5,430,000 basic exclusion amount in 2015, or the excess of H's $5,430,000 applicable exclusion amount over the sum of the $1,000,000 taxable estate and the $1,000,000 amount of adjusted taxable gifts).

# Example 2.
Computation of DSUE amount when gift tax paid.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of this paragraph (c)(5) except that the value of H's taxable gift in 2002 is $2,000,000. After application of the applicable credit amount, H owes gift tax on
$1,000,000, the amount of the gift in excess of the applicable exclusion amount for that year. H pays the gift tax owed on the 2002 transfer.
(ii)
Application.
On H's death, the executor of H's estate computes the DSUE amount to be $3,430,000 (the lesser of the $5,430,000 basic exclusion amount in 2015, or the excess of H's $5,430,000 applicable exclusion amount over the sum of the $1,000,000 taxable estate and $1,000,000 of adjusted taxable gifts sheltered from tax by H's applicable credit amount). H's adjusted taxable gifts of $2,000,000 were reduced for purposes of this computation by $1,000,000, the amount of taxable gifts on which gift taxes were paid.

# Example 3.
Computation of DSUE amount when QDOT created.
(i)
Facts.
Husband (H), a U.S. citizen, makes his first taxable gift in 2002, valued at $1,000,000, and reports the gift on a timely filed gift tax return. No gift tax is due because the applicable exclusion amount for that year ($1,000,000) equals the fair market value of the gift. H dies in 2015 with a gross estate of $2,000,000. H's surviving spouse (W) is a resident, but not a citizen, of the United States and, under H's will, a pecuniary bequest of $1,500,000 passes to a QDOT for the benefit of W. H's executor timely files an estate tax return and makes the QDOT election for the property passing to the QDOT, and H's estate is allowed a marital deduction of $1,500,000 under section 2056(d) for the value of that property. H's taxable estate is $500,000. On H's estate tax return, H's executor computes H's preliminary DSUE amount to be $3,930,000 (the lesser of the $5,430,000 basic exclusion amount in 2015, or the excess of H's $5,430,000 applicable exclusion amount over the sum of the $500,000 taxable estate and the $1,000,000 adjusted taxable gifts). No taxable events within the meaning of section 2056A occur during W's lifetime with respect to the QDOT, and W makes no taxable gifts. At all times since H's death, W has been a U.S. resident. In 2017, W dies and the value of the assets of the QDOT is $1,800,000.
(ii)
Application.
H's DSUE amount is redetermined to be $2,130,000 (the lesser of the $5,430,000 basic exclusion amount in 2015, or the excess of H's $5,430,000 applicable exclusion amount over $3,300,000 (the sum of the $500,000 taxable estate augmented by the $1,800,000 of QDOT assets and the $1,000,000 adjusted taxable gifts)).

# Example 4.
Computation of DSUE amount when surviving spouse with QDOT becomes a U.S. citizen.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
of this paragraph (c)(5) except that W becomes a U.S. citizen in 2016 and dies in 2018. The U.S. Trustee of the QDOT notifies the IRS that W has become a U.S. citizen by timely filing a final estate tax return (Form 706-QDT). Pursuant to section 2056A(b)(12), the estate tax under section 2056A no longer applies to the QDOT property.
(ii)
Application.
Because H's DSUE amount no longer is subject to adjustment once W becomes a citizen of the United States, H's DSUE amount is $3,930,000, as it was preliminarily determined as of H's death. Upon W's death in 2018, the value of the QDOT property is includible in W's gross estate.
(d)
Authority to examine returns of decedent.
The IRS may examine returns of a decedent in determining the decedent's DSUE amount, regardless of whether the period of limitations on assessment has expired for that return. See § 20.2010-3(d) for additional rules relating to the IRS's authority to examine returns. See also section 7602 for the IRS's authority, when ascertaining the correctness of any return, to examine any returns that may be relevant or material to such inquiry.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to the estates of decedents dying on or after June 12, 2015. See 26 CFR 20.2010-2T, as contained in 26 CFR part 20, revised as of April 1, 2015, for the rule applicable to estates of decedents dying on or after January 1, 2011, and before June 12, 2015.
[T.D. 9725, 80 FR 34285, June 16, 2015]
§ 20.2010-3
Portability provisions applicable to the surviving spouse's estate.
(a)
Surviving spouse's estate limited to DSUE amount of last deceased spouse
—(1)
In general.
The deceased spousal unused exclusion (DSUE) amount of a decedent, computed under § 20.2010-2(c), is included in determining the surviving spouse's applicable exclusion amount under section 2010(c)(2), provided—
(i) Such decedent is the last deceased spouse of such surviving spouse within the meaning of § 20.2010-1(e)(5) on the date of the death of the surviving spouse; and
(ii) The executor of the decedent's estate elected portability (see § 20.2010-2(a) and (b) for applicable requirements).
(2)
No DSUE amount available from last deceased spouse.
If the last deceased spouse of such surviving spouse had no DSUE amount, or if the executor of such a decedent's estate did not make a portability election, the surviving spouse's estate has no DSUE amount
(except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) to be included in determining the applicable exclusion amount, even if the surviving spouse previously had a DSUE amount available from another decedent who, prior to the death of the last deceased spouse, was the last deceased spouse of such surviving spouse. See paragraph (b) of this section for a special rule in the case of multiple deceased spouses and a previously applied DSUE amount.
(3)
Identity of last deceased spouse unchanged by subsequent marriage or divorce.
A decedent is the last deceased spouse (as defined in § 20.2010-1(e)(5)) of a surviving spouse even if, on the date of the death of the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse is married to another (then-living) individual. If a surviving spouse marries again and that marriage ends in divorce or an annulment, the subsequent death of the divorced spouse does not end the status of the prior deceased spouse as the last deceased spouse of the surviving spouse. The divorced spouse, not being married to the surviving spouse at death, is not the last deceased spouse as that term is defined in § 20.2010-1(e)(5).
(b)
Special rule in case of multiple deceased spouses and previously-applied DSUE amount
—(1)
In general.
A special rule applies to compute the DSUE amount included in the applicable exclusion amount of a surviving spouse who previously has applied the DSUE amount of one or more deceased spouses to taxable gifts in accordance with § 25.2505-2(b) and (c). If a surviving spouse has applied the DSUE amount of one or more (successive) last deceased spouses to the surviving spouse's transfers during life, and if any of those last deceased spouses is different from the surviving spouse's last deceased spouse as defined in § 20.2010-1(e)(5) at the time of the surviving spouse's death, then the DSUE amount to be included in determining the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse at the time of the surviving spouse's death is the sum of—
(i) The DSUE amount of the surviving spouse's last deceased spouse as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and
(ii) The DSUE amount of each other deceased spouse of the surviving spouse, to the extent that such amount was applied to one or more taxable gifts of the surviving spouse.
(2)
Example.
The following example, in which all described individuals are U.S. citizens, illustrates the application of this paragraph (b):

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
Husband 1 (H1) dies in 2011, survived by Wife (W). Neither has made any taxable gifts during H1's lifetime. H1's executor elects portability of H1's DSUE amount. The DSUE amount of H1 as computed on the estate tax return filed on behalf of H1's estate is $5,000,000. In 2012, W makes taxable gifts to her children valued at $2,000,000. W reports the gifts on a timely filed gift tax return. W is considered to have applied $2,000,000 of H1's DSUE amount to the amount of taxable gifts, in accordance with § 25.2505-2(c), and, therefore, W owes no gift tax. W has an applicable exclusion amount remaining in the amount of $8,120,000 ($3,000,000 of H1's remaining DSUE amount plus W's own $5,120,000 basic exclusion amount). W marries Husband 2 (H2) in 2013. H2 dies in 2014. H2's executor elects portability of H2's DSUE amount, which is properly computed on H2's estate tax return to be $2,000,000. W dies in 2015.
(ii)
Application.
The DSUE amount to be included in determining the applicable exclusion amount available to W's estate is $4,000,000, determined by adding the $2,000,000 DSUE amount of H2 and the $2,000,000 DSUE amount of H1 that was applied by W to W's 2012 taxable gifts. The $4,000,000 DSUE amount added to W's $5,430,000 basic exclusion amount (for 2015), causes W's applicable exclusion amount to be $9,430,000.
(c)
Date DSUE amount taken into consideration by surviving spouse's estate
—(1)
General rule.
A portability election made by an executor of a decedent's estate (see § 20.2010-2(a) and (b) for applicable requirements) generally applies as of the date of the decedent's death. Thus, such decedent's DSUE amount is included in the applicable exclusion amount of the decedent's surviving spouse under section 2010(c)(2) and will be applicable to transfers made by the surviving spouse after the decedent's death (subject to the limitations in paragraph (a) of this section). However, such decedent's DSUE amount will not be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse, even if the surviving spouse had made a transfer in reliance on the availability or
computation of the decedent's DSUE amount:
(i) If the executor of the decedent's estate supersedes the portability election by filing a subsequent estate tax return in accordance with § 20.2010-2(a)(4);
(ii) To the extent that the DSUE amount subsequently is reduced by a valuation adjustment or the correction of an error in calculation; or
(iii) To the extent that the surviving spouse cannot substantiate the DSUE amount claimed on the surviving spouse's return.
(2)
Exception when surviving spouse not a U.S. citizen on date of deceased spouse's death.
If a surviving spouse becomes a citizen of the United States after the death of the surviving spouse's last deceased spouse, the DSUE amount of the surviving spouse's last deceased spouse becomes available to the surviving spouse on the date the surviving spouse becomes a citizen of the United States (subject to the limitations in paragraph (a) of this section). However, when the special rule regarding qualified domestic trusts in paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies, the earliest date on which a decedent's DSUE amount may be included in the applicable exclusion amount of such decedent's surviving spouse who becomes a U.S. citizen is as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(3)
Special rule when property passes to surviving spouse in a qualified domestic trust
—(i)
In general.
When property passes from a decedent for the benefit of the decedent's surviving spouse in one or more qualified domestic trusts (QDOT) as defined in section 2056A(a) and the decedent's executor elects portability, the DSUE amount available to be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse under section 2010(c)(2) is the DSUE amount of the decedent as redetermined in accordance with § 20.2010-2(c)(4) (subject to the limitations in paragraph (a) of this section). The earliest date on which such decedent's DSUE amount may be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse under section 2010(c)(2) is the date of the occurrence of the final QDOT distribution or final other event (generally, the termination of all QDOTs created by or funded with assets passing from the decedent or the death of the surviving spouse) on which tax under section 2056A is imposed. However, the decedent's DSUE amount as redetermined in accordance with § 20.2010-2(c)(4) may be applied to certain taxable gifts of the surviving spouse. See § 25.2505-2(d)(3)(i).
(ii)
Surviving spouse becomes a U.S. citizen.
If a surviving spouse for whom property has passed from a decedent in one or more QDOTs becomes a citizen of the United States and the requirements in section 2056A(b)(12) and the corresponding regulations are satisfied, then the date on which such decedent's DSUE amount may be included in the applicable exclusion amount of the surviving spouse under section 2010(c)(2) (subject the limitations in paragraph (a) of this section) is the date on which the surviving spouse becomes a citizen of the United States. See § 20.2010-2(c)(4) for the rules for computing the decedent's DSUE amount in the case of a qualified domestic trust.
(d)
Authority to examine returns of deceased spouses.
For the purpose of determining the DSUE amount to be included in the applicable exclusion amount of a surviving spouse, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may examine returns of each of the surviving spouse's deceased spouses whose DSUE amount is claimed to be included in the surviving spouse's applicable exclusion amount, regardless of whether the period of limitations on assessment has expired for any such return. The IRS's authority to examine returns of a deceased spouse applies with respect to each transfer by the surviving spouse to which a DSUE amount is or has been applied. Upon examination, the IRS may adjust or eliminate the DSUE amount reported on such a return of a deceased spouse; however, the IRS may assess additional tax on that return only if that tax is assessed within the period of limitations on assessment under section 6501 applicable to the tax shown on that return. See also section 7602 for the IRS's authority, when ascertaining the correctness of any return, to examine any returns that may be relevant or material to such inquiry. For purposes of these examinations to determine the DSUE amount,
the surviving spouse is considered to have a material interest that is affected by the return information of the deceased spouse within the meaning of section 6103(e)(3).
(e)
Availability of DSUE amount for estates of nonresidents who are not citizens.
The estate of a nonresident surviving spouse who is not a citizen of the United States at the time of such surviving spouse's death shall not take into account the DSUE amount of any deceased spouse of such surviving spouse within the meaning of § 20.2010-1(e)(5) except to the extent allowed under any applicable treaty obligation of the United States. See section 2102(b)(3).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to the estates of decedents dying on or after June 12, 2015. See 26 CFR 20.2010-3T, as contained in 26 CFR part 20, revised as of April 1, 2015, for the rules applicable to estates of decedents dying on or after January 1, 2011, and before June 12, 2015.

# Credits Against Tax
§ 20.2011-1
Credit for State death taxes.
(a)
In general.
A credit is allowed under section 2011 against the Federal estate tax for estate, inheritance, legacy or succession taxes actually paid to any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, or, in the case of decedents dying before September 3, 1958, any possession of the United States (hereinafter referred to as “State death taxes”). The credit, however, is allowed only for State death taxes paid (1) with respect to property included in the decedent's gross estate, and (2) with respect to the decedent's estate. The amount of the credit is subject to the limitation described in paragraph (b) of this section. It is subject to further limitations described in § 20.2011-2 if a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) for State death taxes paid with respect to a charitable gift. See paragraph (a) of § 20.2014-1 as to the allowance of a credit for death taxes paid to a possession of the United States in a case where the decedent died after September 2, 1958.
(b)
Amount of credit.
(1) If the decedent's taxable estate does not exceed $40,000, the credit for State death taxes is zero. If the decedent's taxable estate does exceed $40,000, the credit for State death taxes is limited to an amount computed in accordance with the following table:

(2) Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) The decedent died January 1, 1955, leaving a taxable estate of $150,000. On January 1, 1956, inheritance taxes totaling $2,500 were actually paid to a State with respect to property included in the decedent's gross estate. Reference to the table discloses that the specified amount in column (A) nearest to but less than the value of the decedent's taxable estate is $140,000. The maximum credit in respect of this amount, as indicated in column (C), is $1,200. The amount by which the taxable estate exceeds the same specified amount is $10,000. The maximum credit in respect of this amount, computed at the rate of 2.4 percent indicated in column (D), is $240. Thus, the maximum credit in respect of the decedent's taxable estate of $150,000 is $1,440, even though $2,500 in inheritance taxes was actually paid to the State.
(ii) If, in subdivision (i) of this example, the amount actually paid to the State was $950, the credit for State death taxes would be limited to $950. If, in subdivision (i) of this example, the decedent's taxable estate was
$35,000, no credit for State death taxes would be allowed.
(c)
Miscellaneous limitations and conditions to credit
—(1)
Period of limitations.
The credit for State death taxes is limited under section 2011(c) to those taxes which were actually paid and for which a credit was claimed within four years after the filing of the estate tax return for the decedent's estate. If, however, a petition has been filed with the Tax Court of the United States for the redetermination of a deficiency within the time prescribed in section 6213(a), the credit is limited to those taxes which were actually paid and for which a credit was claimed within four years after the filing of the return or within 60 days after the decision of the Tax Court becomes final, whichever period is the last to expire. Similarly, if an extension of time has been granted under section 6161 for payment of the tax shown on the return, or of a deficiency, the credit is limited to those taxes which were actually paid and for which a credit was claimed within four years after the filing of the return, or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, whichever period is last to expire. If a claim for refund or credit of an overpayment of the Federal estate tax is filed within the time prescribed in section 6511, the credit for State death taxes is limited to such taxes as were actually paid and credit therefor claimed within four years after the filing of the return or before the expiration of 60 days from the date of mailing by certified or registered mail by the district director to the taxpayer of a notice of disallowance of any part of the claim, or before the expiration of 60 days after a decision by any court of competent jurisdiction becomes final with respect to a timely suit instituted upon the claim, whichever period is the last to expire. See section 2015 for the applicable period of limitations for credit for State death taxes on reversionary or remainder interests if an election is made under section 6163(a) to postpone payment of the estate tax attributable to reversionary or remainder interests. If a claim for refund based on the credit for State death taxes is filed within the applicable period described in this subparagraph, a refund may be made despite the general limitation provisions of sections 6511 and 6512. Any refund based on the credit described in this section shall be made without interest.
(2)
Submission of evidence.
Before the credit for State death taxes is allowed, evidence that such taxes have been paid must be submitted to the district director. The district director may require the submission of a certificate from the proper officer of the taxing State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, showing: (i) The total amount of tax imposed (before adding interest and penalties and before allowing discount); (ii) the amount of any discount allowed; (iii) the amount of any penalties and interest imposed or charged; (iv) the total amount actually paid in cash; and (v) the date or dates of payment. If the amount of these taxes has been redetermined, the amount finally determined should be stated. The required evidence should be filed with the return, but if that is not convenient or possible, then it should be submitted as soon thereafter as practicable. The district director may require the submission of such additional proof as is deemed necessary to establish the right to the credit. For example, he may require the submission of a certificate of the proper officer of the taxing jurisdiction showing (vi) whether a claim for refund of any part of the State death tax is pending and (vii) whether a refund of any part thereof has been authorized, and if a refund has been made, its date and amount, and a description of the property or interest in respect of which the refund was made. The district director may also require an itemized list of the property in respect of which State death taxes were imposed certified by the officer having custody of the records pertaining to those taxes. In addition, he may require the executor to submit a written statement (containing a declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury) stating whether, to his knowledge, any person has instituted litigation or taken an appeal (or contemplates doing so), the final determination of which may affect the amount of those taxes. See section 2016 concerning the redetermination of the
estate tax if State death taxes claimed as credit are refunded.
(d)
Definition of “basic estate tax”.
Section 2011(d) provides definitions of the terms “basic estate tax” and “additional estate tax”, used in the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and “estate tax imposed by the Revenue Act of 1926”, for the purpose of supplying a means of computing State death taxes under local statutes using those terms, and for use in determining the exemption provided for in section 2201 for estates of certain members of the Armed Forces. See section 2011(e)(3) for a modification of these definitions if a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) for State death taxes paid with respect to a charitable gift.
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 6526, 26 FR 414, Jan. 19, 1961]
§ 20.2011-2
Limitation on credit if a deduction for State death taxes is allowed under section 2053(d).
If a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) for State death taxes paid with respect to a charitable gift, the credit for State death taxes is subject to special limitations. Under these limitations, the credit cannot exceed the least of the following:
(a) The amount of State death taxes paid other than those for which a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d);
(b) The amount indicated in section 2011(b) to be the maximum credit allowable with respect to the decedent's taxable estate; or
(c) An amount, A, which bears the same ratio to B (the amount which would be the maximum credit allowable under section 2011(b) if the deduction under section 2053(d) for State death taxes were not allowed in computing the decedent's taxable estate) as C (the amount of State death taxes paid other than those for which a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d)) bears to D (the total amount of State death taxes paid). For the purpose of this computation, in determining what the decedent's taxable estate would be if the deduction for State death taxes under section 2053(d) were not allowed, adjustment must be made for the decrease in the deduction for charitable gifts under section 2055 or 2106(a)(2) (for estates of nonresidents not citizens) by reason of any increase in Federal estate tax which would be charged against the charitable gifts.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The decedent died January 1, 1955, leaving a gross estate of $925,000. Expenses, indebtedness, etc., amounted to $25,000. The decedent bequeathed $400,000 to his son with the direction that the son bear the State death taxes on the bequest. The residuary estate was left to a charitable organization. Except as noted above, all Federal and State death taxes were payable out of the residuary estate. The State imposed death taxes of $60,000 on the son's bequest and death taxes of $75,000 on the bequest to charity. No death taxes were imposed by a foreign country with respect to any property in the gross estate. The decedent's taxable estate (determined without regard to the limitation imposed by section 2011(e)(2)(B) is computed as follows:
Gross estate
$925,000.00
Expenses, indebtedness, etc.
$25,000.00
Exemption
60,000.00
Deduction under section 2053(d)
75,000.00
Charitable deduction:
Gross estate
$925,000.00
Expenses, etc
$25,000.00
Bequest to son
400,000.00
State death tax paid from residue
75,000.00
Federal estate tax paid from residue
122,916.67
622,916.67
302,083.33
462,083.33
Taxable estate
462,916.67
If the deduction under section 2053(d) were not allowed, the decedent's taxable estate would be computed as follows:
Gross estate
$925,000.00
Expenses, indebtedness, etc.
$25,000.00
Exemption
60,000.00
Charitable deduction:
Gross estate
$925,000.00
Expenses, etc
$25,000.00
Bequest to son

State death tax paid from residue
75,000.00
Federal estate tax paid from residue
155,000.00
655,000.00
270,000.00
355,000.00
Taxable estate
570,000.00
On a taxable estate of $570,000, the maximum credit allowable under section 2011(b) would be $15,200. Under these facts, the credit for State death taxes is determined as follows:
(1) Amount of State death taxes paid other than those for which a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) ($135,000−$75,000)
$60,000.00
(2) Amount indicated in section 2011(b) to be the maximum credit allowable with respect to the decedent's taxable estate of $462,916.67
10,916.67
(3) Amount determined by use of the ratio described in paragraph (c) above [($60,000 ÷ $135,000) × $15,200]
6,755.56
(4) Credit for State death taxes (least of subparagraphs (1) through (3) above)
6,755.56
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 6600, 27 FR 4983, May 29, 1962]
§ 20.2012-1
Credit for gift tax.
(a)
In general.
With respect to gifts made before 1977, a credit is allowed under section 2012 against the Federal estate tax for gift tax paid under chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code, or corresponding provisions of prior law, on a gift by the decedent of property subsequently included in the decedent's gross estate. The credit is allowable even though the gift tax is paid after the decedent's death and the amount of the gift tax is deductible from the gross estate as a debt of the decedent.
(b)
Limitations on credit.
The credit for gift tax is limited to the smaller of the following amounts:
(1) The amount of gift tax paid on the gift computed as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, or
(2) The amount of the estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the gift in the gross estate, computed as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
When more than one gift is included in the gross estate, a separate computation of the two limitations on the credit is to be made for each gift.
(c)
“First limitation”.
The amount of the gift tax paid on the gift is the “first limitation”. Thus, if only one gift was made during a certain calendar quarter, or calendar year if the gift was made before January 1, 1971, and the gift is wholly included in the decedent's gross estate for the purpose of the estate tax, the credit with respect to the gift is limited to the amount of the gift tax paid for that calendar quarter or calendar year. On the other hand, if more than one gift was made during a certain calendar quarter or calendar year, the credit with respect to any such gift which is included in the decedent's gross estate is limited under section 2012(d) to an amount, A, which bears the same ratio to B (the total gift tax paid for that calendar quarter or calendar year) as C (the “amount of the gift,” computed as described below) bears to D (the total taxable gifts for the calendar quarter or the calendar year, computed without deduction of the gift tax specific exemption). Stated algebraically, the “first limitation” (A) equals:
“Amount of the gift” (C) ÷ Total taxable gifts, plus specific exemption allowed (D) × Total gift tax paid (B).
For purposes of the ratio stated above, the “amount of the gift” referred to as factor “C” is the value of the gift reduced by any portion excluded or deducted under sections 2503(b) (annual exclusion), 2522 (charitable deduction), or 2523 (marital deduction) of the Internal Revenue Code or corresponding provisions of prior law. In making the computations described in this paragraph, the values to be used are those
finally determined for the purpose of the gift tax, irrespective of the values determined for the purpose of the estate tax. A similar computation is made in case only a portion of any gift is included in the decedent's gross estate. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The donor made gifts during the calendar year 1955 on which a gift tax was determined as shown below:
Gift of property to son on February 1
$13,000
Gift of property to wife on May 1
86,000
Gift of property to charitable organization on May 15
10,000
Total gifts
109,000
Less exclusions ($3,000 for each gift)
9,000
Total included amount of gifts
100,000
Marital deduction (for gift to wife)
$43,000
Charitable deduction
7,000
Specific exemption ($30,000 less $20,000 used in prior years)
10,000
Total deductions
60,000
Taxable gifts
40,000
Total gift tax paid for calendar year 1955
3,600
The donor's gift to his wife was made in contemplation of death and was thereafter included in his gross estate. Under the “first limitation”, the credit with respect to that gift cannot exceed:
[$86,000 − $3,000 − $43,000 (gift to wife, less annual exclusion and marital deduction)] ÷ [$40,000 + $10,000 (taxable gifts, plus specific exemption allowed)] × $3,600 (total gift tax paid) = $2,880.
(d)
“Second limitation”.
(1) The amount of the estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the gift in the gross estate is the “second limitation”. Thus, the credit with respect to any gift of property included in the gross estate is limited to an amount, E, which bears the same ratio to F (the gross estate tax, reduced by any credit for State death taxes under section 2011) as G (the “value of the gift”, computed as described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) bears to H (the value of entire gross estate, reduced by the total deductions allowed under sections 2055 or 2106(a)(2) (charitable deduction) and 2056 (marital deduction)). Stated algebraically, the “second limitation” (E) equals:
“Value of the gift” (G) ÷ Value of gross estate, less marital and charitable deductions (H) × Gross estate tax, less credit for State death taxes (F).
(2) For purposes of the ratio stated in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the “value of the gift” referred to as factor “G” is the value of the property transferred by gift and included in the gross estate, as determined for the purpose of the gift tax or for the purpose of the estate tax, whichever is lower, and adjusted as follows:
(i) The appropriate value is reduced by all or a portion of any annual exclusion allowed for gift tax purposes under section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code or corresponding provisions of prior law. If the gift tax value is lower than the estate tax value, it is reduced by the entire amount of the exclusion. If the estate tax value is lower than the gift tax value, it is reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the estate tax value as the annual exclusion bears to the total value of the property as determined for gift tax purposes. To illustrate: In 1955, a donor, in contemplation of death, transferred certain property to his five children which was valued at $300,000, for the purpose of the gift tax. Thereafter, the same property was included in his gross estate at a value of $270,000. In computing his gift tax, the donor was allowed annual exclusions totalling $15,000. The reduction provided for in this subdivision is:
$15,000 (annual exclusions allowed) ÷ $300,000 (value of transferred property for the purpose of the gift tax) × $270,000 (value of transferred property for the purpose of the estate tax) = $13,500.
(ii) The appropriate value is further reduced if any portion of the value of the property is allowed as a marital deduction under section 2056 or as a charitable deduction under section 2055 or section 2106(a)(2) (for estates of nonresidents not citizens). The amount of the reduction is an amount which bears the same ratio to the value determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as the portion of the property allowed as a marital deduction or as a charitable deduction bears to the total value of the property as determined for the purpose of the estate tax. Thus, if a gift is made solely to the decedent's surviving spouse and is subsequently included in the decedent's gross estate as having been made in contemplation
of death, but a marital deduction is allowed under section 2056 for the full value of the gift, no credit for gift tax on the gift will be allowed since the reduction under this subdivision together with the reduction under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph will have the effect of reducing the factor “G” of the ratio in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to zero.
(e)
Credit for “split gifts”.
If a decedent made a gift of property which is thereafter included in his gross estate, and, under the provisions of section 2513 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or section 1000(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the gift was considered as made one-half by the decedent and one-half by his spouse, credit against the estate tax is allowed for the gift tax paid with respect to both halves of the gift. The “first limitation” is to be separately computed with respect to each half of the gift in accordance with the principles stated in paragraph (c) of this section. The “second limitation” is to be computed with respect to the entire gift in accordance with the principles stated in paragraph (d) of this section. To illustrate: A donor, in contemplation of death, transferred property valued at $106,000 to his son on January 1, 1955, and he and his wife consented that the gift should be considered as made one-half by him and one-half by her. The property was thereafter included in the donor's gross estate. Under the “first limitation”, the amount of the gift tax of the donor paid with respect to the one-half of the gift considered as made by him is determined to be $11,250, and the amount of the gift tax of his wife paid with respect to the one-half of the gift considered as made by her is determined to be $1,200. Under the “second limitation”, the amount of the estate tax attributable to the property is determined to be $28,914. Therefore, the credit for gift tax allowed is $12,450 ($11,250 plus $1,200).

§ 20.2013-1
Credit for tax on prior transfers.
(a)
In general.
A credit is allowed under section 2013 against the Federal estate tax imposed on the present decedent's estate for Federal estate tax paid on the transfer of property to the present decedent from a transferor who died within ten years before, or within two years after, the present decedent's death. See § 20.2013-5 for definition of the terms “property” and “transfer”. There is no requirement that the transferred property be identified in the estate of the present decedent or that the property be in existence at the time of the decedent's death. It is sufficient that the transfer of the property was subjected to Federal estate tax in the estate of the transferor and that the transferor died within the prescribed period of time. The executor must submit such proof as may be requested by the district director in order to establish the right of the estate to the credit.
(b)
Limitations on credit.
The credit for tax on prior transfers is limited to the smaller of the following amounts:
(1) The amount of the Federal estate tax attributable to the transferred property in the transferor's estate, computed as set forth in § 20.2013-2; or
(2) The amount of the Federal estate tax attributable to the transferred property in the decedent's estate, computed as set forth in § 20.2013-3.
Rules for valuing property for purposes of the credit are contained in § 20.2013-4.
(c)
Percentage reduction.
If the transferor died within the two years before, or within the two years after, the present decedent's death, the credit is the smaller of the two limitations described in paragraph (b) of this section. If the transferor predeceased the present decedent by more than two years, the credit is a certain percentage of the smaller of the two limitations described in paragraph (b) of this section, determined as follows:
(1) 80 percent, if the transferor died within the third or fourth years preceding the present decedent's death;
(2) 40 percent, if the transferor died within the fifth or sixth years preceding the present decedent's death;
(3) 40 percent, if the transferor died within the seventh or eighth years preceding the present decedent's death; and
(4) 20 percent, if the transferor died within the ninth or tenth years preceding the present decedent's death.
The word “within” as used in this paragraph means “during”. Therefore, if a death occurs on the second anniversary of another death, the first death is considered to have occurred within the two years before the second death. If the credit for tax on prior transfers relates to property received from two or more transferors, the provisions of this paragraph are to be applied separately with respect to the property received from each transferor. See paragraph (d) of example (2) in § 20.2013-6.
(d)
Examples.
For illustrations of the application of this section, see examples (1) and (2) set forth in § 20.2013-6.
§ 20.2013-2
“First limitation”.
(a) The amount of the Federal estate tax attributable to the transferred property in the transferor's estate is the “first limitation.” Thus, the credit is limited to an amount, A, which bears the same ratio to B (the “transferor's adjusted Federal estate tax”, computed as described in paragraph (b) of this section) as C (the value of the property transferred (see § 20.2013-4)) bears to D (the “transferor's adjusted taxable estate”, computed as described in paragraph (c) of this section). Stated algebraically, the “first limitation” (A) equals:
Value of transferred property (C) ÷ “Transferor's adjusted taxable estate” (D) × “Transferor's adjusted Federal estate tax” (B).
(b) For purposes of the ratio stated in paragraph (a) of this section, the “transferor's adjusted Federal estate tax” referred to as factor “B” is the amount of the Federal estate tax paid with respect to the transferor's estate plus:
(1) Any credit allowed the transferor's estate for gift tax under section 2012, or the corresponding provisions of prior law; and
(2) Any credit allowed the transferor's estate, under section 2013, for tax on prior transfers, but only if the transferor acquired property from a person who died within 10 years before the death of the present decedent.
(c)(1) For purposes of the ratio stated in paragraph (a) of this section, the “transferor's adjusted taxable estate” referred to as factor “D” is the amount of the transferor's taxable estate (or net estate) decreased by the amount of any “death taxes” paid with respect to his gross estate and increased by the amount of the exemption allowed in computing his taxable estate (or net estate). The amount of the transferor's taxable estate (or net estate) is determined in accordance with the provisions of § 20.2051-1 in the case of a citizen or resident of the United States or of § 20.2106-1 in the case of a nonresident not a citizen of the United States (or the corresponding provisions of prior regulations). The term “death taxes” means the Federal estate tax plus all other estate, inheritance, legacy, succession, or similar death taxes imposed by, and paid to, any taxing authority, whether within or without the United States. However, only the net amount of such taxes paid is taken into consideration.
(2) The amount of the exemption depends upon the citizenship and residence of the transferor at the time of his death. Except in the case of a decedent described in section 2209 (relating to certain residents of possessions of the United States who are considered nonresidents not citizens), if the decedent was a citizen or resident of the United States, the exemption is the $60,000 authorized by section 2052 (or the corresponding provisions of prior law). If the decedent was a nonresident not a citizen of the United States, or is considered under section 2209 to have been such a nonresident, the exemption is the $30,000 or $2,000, as the case may be, authorized by section 2106(a)(3) (or the corresponding provisions of prior law), or such larger amount as is authorized by section 2106(a)(3)(B) or may have been allowed as an exemption pursuant to the prorated exemption provisions of an applicable death tax convention. See § 20.2052-1 and paragraph (a)(3) of § 20.2106-1.
(d) If the credit for tax on prior transfers relates to property received from two or more transferors, the provisions of this section are to be applied separately with respect to the property received from each transferor. See paragraph (b) of example (2) in § 20.2013-6.
(e) For illustrations of the application of this section, see examples (1) and (2) set forth in § 20.2013-6.
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7296, 38 FR 34191, Dec. 12, 1973]
§ 20.2013-3
“Second limitation”.
(a) The amount of the Federal estate tax attributable to the transferred property in the present decedent's estate is the “second limitation”. Thus, the credit is limited to the difference between—
(1) The net estate tax payable (see paragraph (b)(5) or (c), as the case may be, of § 20.0-2) with respect to the present decedent's estate, determined without regard to any credit for tax on prior transfers under section 2013 or any credit for foreign death taxes claimed under the provisions of a death tax convention, and
(2) The net estate tax determined as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph but computed by subtracting from the present decedent's gross estate the value of the property transferred (see § 20.2013-4), and by making only the adjustment indicated in paragraph (b) of this section if a charitable deduction is allowable to the estate of the present decedent.
(b) If a charitable deduction is allowable to the estate of the present decedent under the provisions of section 2055 or section 2106 (a)(2) (for estates of nonresidents not citizens), for purposes of determining the tax described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the charitable deduction otherwise allowable is reduced by an amount, E, which bears the same ratio to F (the charitable deduction otherwise allowable) as G (the value of the transferred property (see § 20.2013-4)) bears to H (the value of the present decedent's gross estate reduced by the amount of the deductions for expenses, indebtedness, taxes, losses, etc., allowed under the provisions of sections 2053 and 2054 or section 2106(a)(1) (for estates of nonresidents not citizens)). See paragraph (c)(2) of example (1) and paragraph (c)(2) of example (2) in § 20.2013-6.
(c) If the credit for tax on prior transfers relates to property received from two or more transferors, the property received from all transferors is aggregated in determining the limitation on credit under this section (the “second limitation”). However, the limitation so determined is apportioned to the property received from each transferor in the ratio that the property received from each transferor bears to the total property received from all transferors. See paragraph (c) of example (2) in § 20.2013-6.
(d) For illustrations of the application of this section, see examples (1) and (2) set forth in § 20.2013-6.
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7296, 38 FR 34191, Dec. 12, 1973]
§ 20.2013-4
Valuation of property transferred.
(a) For purposes of section 2013 and §§ 20.2013-1 to 20.2013-6, the value of the property transferred to the decedent is the value at which the property was included in the transferor's gross estate for the purpose of the Federal estate tax (see sections 2031, 2032, 2103, and 2107, and the regulations thereunder) reduced as indicated in paragraph (b) of this section. If the decedent received a life estate or a remainder or other limited interest in property that was included in a transferor decedent's gross estate, the value of the interest is determined as of the date of the transferor's death on the basis of recognized valuation principles (see §§ 20.2031-7 (or, for certain prior periods, § 20.2031-7A) and 20.7520-1 through 20.7520-4). The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
A died on January 1, 1953, leaving Blackacre to B. The property was included in A's gross estate at a value of $100,000. On January 1, 1955, B sold Blackacre to C for $150,000. B died on February 1, 1955. For purposes of computing the credit against the tax imposed on B's estate, the value of the property transferred to B is $100,000.

# Example (2).
A died on January 1, 1953, leaving Blackacre to B for life and, upon B's death, remainder to C. At the time of A's death, B was 56 years of age. The property was included in A's gross estate at a value of $100,000. The part of that value attributable to the life estate is $44,688 and the part of that value attributable to the remainder is $55,312 (see § 20.2031-7A(b)). B died on January 1, 1955, and C died on January 1, 1956. For purposes of computing the credit against the tax imposed on B's estate, the value of the
property transferred to B is $44,688. For purposes of computing the credit against the tax imposed on C's estate, the value of the property transferred to C is $55,312.
(b) In arriving at the value of the property transferred to the decedent, the value at which the property was included in the transferor's gross estate (see paragraph (a) of this section) is reduced as follows:
(1) By the amount of the Federal estate tax and any other estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes which were payable out of the property transferred to the decedent or which were payable by the decedent in connection with the property transferred to him. For example, if under the transferor's will or local law all death taxes are to be paid out of other property with the result that the decedent receives a bequest free and clear of all death taxes, no reduction is to be made under this subparagraph;
(2) By the amount of any marital deduction allowed the transferor's estate under section 2056 (or under section 812(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) if the decedent was the spouse of the transferor at the time of the transferor's death;
(3)(i) By the amount of administration expenses in accordance with the principles of § 20.2056(b)-4(d).
(ii) This paragraph (b)(3) applies to transfers from estates of decedents dying on or after December 3, 1999; and
(4)(i) By the amount of any encumbrance on the property or by the amount of any obligation imposed by the transferor and incurred by the decedent with respect to the property, to the extent such charges would be taken into account if the amount of a gift to the decedent of such property were being determined.
(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, an obligation imposed by the transferor and incurred by the decedent with respect to the property includes a bequest, etc., in lieu of the interest of the surviving spouse under community property laws, unless the interest was, immediately prior to the transferor's death, a mere expectancy. However, an obligation imposed by the transferor and incurred by the decedent with respect to the property does not include a bequest, devise, or other transfer in lieu of dower, curtesy, or of a statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy, or of other marital rights in the transferor's property or estate.
(iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
The transferor devised to the decedent real estate subject to a mortgage. The value of the property transferred to the decedent does not include the amount of the mortgage. If, however, the transferor by his will directs the executor to pay off the mortgage, such payment constitutes an additional amount transferred to the decedent.

# Example (2).
The transferor bequeathed certain property to the decedent with a direction that the decedent pay $1,000 to X. The value of the property transferred to the decedent is the value of the property reduced by $1,000.

# Example (3).
The transferor bequeathed certain property to his wife, the decedent, in lieu of her interest in property held by them as community property under the law of the State of their residence. The wife elected to relinquish her community property interest and to take the bequest. The value of the property transferred to the decedent is the value of the property reduced by the value of the community property interest relinquished by the wife.

# Example (4).
The transferor bequeathed to the decedent his entire residuary estate, out of which certain claims were to be satisfied. The entire distributable income of the transferor's estate (during the period of its administration) was applied toward the satisfaction of these claims and the remaining portion of the claims was satisfied by the decedent out of his own funds. Thus, the decedent received a larger sum upon settlement of the transferor's estate than he was actually bequeathed. The value of the property transferred to the decedent is the value at which such property was included in the transferor's gross estate, reduced by the amount of the estate income and the decedent's own funds paid out in satisfaction of the claims.
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 7077, 35 FR 18461, Dec. 4, 1970; T.D. 7296, 38 FR 34191, Dec. 12, 1973; T.D. 8522, 59 FR 9646, Mar. 1, 1994; T.D. 8540, 59 FR 30151, June 10, 1994; T.D. 8846, 64 FR 67764, Dec. 3, 1999]
§ 20.2013-5
“Property” and “transfer” defined.
(a) For purposes of section 2013 and §§ 20.2013-1 to 20.2013-6, the term “property” means any beneficial interest in property, including a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041)
over property. Thus, the term does not include an interest in property consisting merely of a bare legal title, such as that of a trustee. Nor does the term include a power of appointment over property which is not a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041). Examples of property, as described in this paragraph, are annuities, life estates, estates for terms of years, vested or contingent remainders and other future interests.
(b) In order to obtain the credit for tax on prior transfers, there must be a transfer of property described in paragraph (a) of this section by or from the transferor to the decedent. The term “transfer” of property by or from a transferor means any passing of property or an interest in property under circumstances which were such that the property or interest was included in the gross estate of the transferor. In this connection, if the decedent receives property as a result of the exercise or nonexercise of a power of appointment, the donee of the power (and not the creator) is deemed to be the transferor of the property if the property subject to the power is includible in the donee's gross estate under section 2041 (relating to powers of appointment). Thus, notwithstanding the designation by local law of the capacity in which the decedent takes, property received from the transferor includes interests in property held by or devolving upon the decedent: (1) As spouse under dower or curtesy laws or laws creating an estate in lieu of dower or curtesy; (2) as surviving tenant of a tenancy by the entirety or joint tenancy with survivorship rights; (3) as beneficiary of the proceeds of life insurance; (4) as survivor under an annuity contract; (5) as donee (possessor) of a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041); (6) as appointee under the exercise of a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041); or (7) as remainderman under the release or nonexercise of a power of appointment by reason of which the property is included in the gross estate of the donee of the power under section 2041.
(c) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A devises Blackacre to B, as trustee, with directions to pay the income therefore to C, his son, for life. Upon C's death. Blackacre is to be sold. C is given a general testamentary power, to appoint one-third of the proceeds, and a testamentary power, which is not a general power, to appoint the remaining two-thirds of the proceeds, to such of the issue of his sister D as he should choose. D has a daughter, E, and a son, F. Upon his death, C exercised his general power by appointing one-third of the proceeds to D and his special power by appointing two-thirds of the proceeds to E. Since B's interest in Blackacre as a trustee is not a beneficial interest, no part of it is “property” for purpose of the credit in B's estate. On the other hand, C's life estate and his testamentary power over the one-third interest in the remainder constitute “property” received from A for purpose of the credit in C's estate. Likewise, D's one-third interest in the remainder received through the exercise of C's general power of appointment is “property” received from C for purpose of the credit in D's estate. No credit is allowed E's estate for the property which passed to her from C since the property was not included in C's gross estate. On the other hand, no credit is allowed in E's estate for property passing to her from A since her interest was not susceptible of valuation at the time of A's death (see § 20.2013-4).
§ 20.2013-6
Examples.
The application of §§ 20.2013-1 to 20.2013-5 may be further illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
(a) A died December 1, 1953, leaving a gross estate of $1,000,000. Expenses, indebtedness, etc., amounted to $90,000. A bequeathed $200,000 to B, his wife, $100,000 of which qualified for the marital deduction. B died November 1, 1954, leaving a gross estate of $500,000. Expenses, indebtedness, etc., amounted to $40,000. B bequeathed $150,000 to charity. A and B were both citizens of the United States. The estates of A and B both paid State death taxes equal to the maximum credit allowable for State death taxes. Death taxes were not a charge on the bequest to B.

§ 20.2014-1
Credit for foreign death taxes.
(a)
In general.
(1) A credit is allowed under section 2014 against the Federal estate tax for any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any foreign country (hereinafter referred to as “foreign death taxes”). The credit is allowed only for foreign death taxes paid (i) with respect to property situated within the country to which the tax is paid, (ii) with respect to property included in the decedent's gross estate, and (iii) with respect to the decedent's estate. The credit is allowable to the estate of a decedent who was a citizen of the United States at the time of his death. The credit is also allowable, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, to the estate of a decedent who was a resident but not a citizen of the United States at the time of his death. The credit is not allowable to the estate of a decedent who was neither a citizen nor a resident of the United States at the time of his death. See paragraph (b)(1) of § 20.0-1 for the meaning of the term “resident” as applied to a decedent. The credit is allowable not only for death taxes paid to foreign countries which are states in the international sense, but also for death taxes paid to possessions or political subdivisions of foreign states. With respect to the estate of a decedent dying after September 2, 1958, the term “foreign country”, as used in this section and §§ 20.2014-2 to 20.2014-6, includes a possession of the United States. See §§ 20.2011-1 and 20.2011-2 for the allowance of a credit for death taxes paid to a possession of the United States in the case of a decedent dying before September 3, 1958. No credit is allowable for interest or penalties paid in connection with foreign death taxes.
(2) In addition to the credit for foreign death taxes under section 2014, similar credits are allowed under death tax conventions with certain foreign countries. If credits against the Federal estate tax are allowable under section 2014, or under section 2014 and one or more death tax conventions, for death taxes paid to more than one country, the credits are combined and the aggregate amount is credited against the Federal estate tax, subject to the limitation provided for in paragraph (c) of § 20.2014-4. For application of the credit in cases involving a death tax convention, see § 20.2014-4.
(3) No credit is allowable under section 2014 in connection with property situated outside of the foreign country imposing the tax for which credit is claimed. However, such a credit may be allowable under certain death tax conventions. In the case of a tax imposed by a political subdivision of a foreign country, credit for the tax shall be allowed with respect to property having a situs in that foreign country, even though, under the principles described in this subparagraph, the property has a situs in a political subdivision different from the one imposing the tax. Whether or not particular property of a decedent is situated in the foreign country imposing the tax is determined in accordance with the same principles that would be applied in determining whether or not similar property of a nonresident decedent not a citizen of the United States is situated within the United States for Federal estate tax purposes. See §§ 20.2104-1 and 20.2105-1. For example, under § 20.2104-1 shares of stock are deemed to be situated in the United States only if issued by a domestic corporation. Thus, a share of corporate stock is regarded as
situated in the foreign country imposing the tax only if the issuing corporation is incorporated in that country. Further, under § 20.2105-1 amounts receivable as insurance on the life of a nonresident not a citizen of the United States at the time of his death are not deemed situated in the United States. Therefore, in determining the credit under section 2014 in the case of a decedent who was a citizen or resident of the United States, amounts receivable as insurance on the life of the decedent and payable under a policy issued by a corporation incorporated in a foreign country are not deemed situated in such foreign country. In addition, under § 20.2105-1 in the case of an estate of a nonresident not a citizen of the United States who died on or after November 14, 1966, a debt obligation of a domestic corporation is not considered to be situated in the United States if any interest thereon would be treated under section 862(a)(1) as income from sources without the United States by reason of section 861(a)(1)(B) (relating to interest received from a domestic corporation less than 20 percent of whose gross income for a 3-year period was derived from sources within the United States). Accordingly, a debt obligation the primary obligor on which is a corporation incorporated in the foreign country imposing the tax is not considered to be situated in that country if, under circumstances corresponding to those described in § 20.2105-1 less than 20 percent of the gross income of the corporation for the 3-year period was derived from sources within that country. Further, under § 20.2104-1 in the case of an estate of a nonresident not a citizen of the United States who died before November 14, 1966, a bond for the payment of money is not situated within the United States unless it is physically located in the United States. Accordingly, in the case of the estate of a decedent dying before November 14, 1966, a bond is deemed situated in the foreign country imposing the tax only if it is physically located in that country. Finally, under § 20.2105-1 moneys deposited in the United States with any person carrying on the banking business by or for a nonresident not a citizen of the United States who died before November 14, 1966, and who was not engaged in business in the United States at the time of death are not deemed situated in the United States. Therefore, an account with a foreign bank in the foreign country imposing the tax is not considered to be situated in that country under corresponding circumstances.
(4) Where a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) for foreign death taxes paid with respect to a charitable gift, the credit for foreign death taxes is subject to further limitations as explained in § 20.2014-7.
(b)
Limitations on credit.
The credit for foreign death taxes is limited to the smaller of the following amounts:
(1) The amount of a particular foreign death tax attributable to property situated in the country imposing the tax and included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes, computed as set forth in § 20.2014-2; or
(2) The amount of the Federal estate tax attributable to particular property situated in a foreign country, subjected to foreign death tax in that country, and included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes, computed as set forth in § 20.2014-3.
(c)
Credit allowable to estate of resident not a citizen.
(1) In the case of an estate of a decedent dying before November 14, 1966, who was a resident but not a citizen of the United States, a credit is allowed to the estate under section 2014 only if the foreign country of which the decedent was a citizen or subject, in imposing foreign death taxes, allows a similar credit to the estates of citizens of the United States who were resident in that foreign country at the time of death.
(2) In the case of an estate of a decedent dying on or after November 14, 1966, who was a resident but not a citizen of the United States, a credit is allowed to the estate under section 2014 without regard to the similar credit requirement of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph unless the decedent was a citizen or subject of a foreign country with respect to which there is in effect at the time of the decedent's death a Presidential proclamation, as authorized by section 2014(h), reinstating the similar credit requirement. In the case of an estate of a decedent who was a
resident of the United States and a citizen or subject of a foreign country with respect to which such a proclamation has been made, and who dies while the proclamation is in effect, a credit is allowed under section 2014 only if that foreign country, in imposing foreign death taxes, allows a similar credit to the estates of citizens of the United States who were resident in that foreign country at the time of death. The proclamation authorized by section 2014(h) for the reinstatement of the similar credit requirement with respect to the estates of citizens or subjects of a specific foreign country may be made by the President whenever he finds that—
(i) The foreign country, in imposing foreign death taxes, does not allow a similar credit to the estates of citizens of the United States who were resident in the foreign country at the time of death,
(ii) The foreign country, after having been requested to do so, has not acted to provide a similar credit to the estates of such citizens, and
(iii) It is in the public interest to allow the credit under section 2014 to the estates of citizens or subjects of the foreign country only if the foreign country allows a similar credit to the estates of citizens of the United States who were resident in the foreign country at the time of death.
The proclamation for the reinstatement of the similar credit requirement with respect to the estates of citizens or subjects of a specific foreign country may be revoked by the President. In that case, a credit is allowed under section 2014, to the estate of a decedent who was a citizen or subject of that foreign country and a resident of the United States at the time of death, without regard to the similar credit requirement if the decedent dies after the proclamation reinstating the similar credit requirement has been revoked.

§ 20.2014-2
“First limitation”.
(a) The amount of a particular foreign death tax attributable to property situated in the country imposing the tax and included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes is the “first limitation.” Thus, the credit for any foreign death tax is limited to an amount, A, which bears the same ratio to B (the amount of the foreign death tax without allowance of credit, if any, for Federal estate tax), as C (the value of the property situated in the country imposing the foreign death tax, subjected to the foreign death tax, included in the gross estate and for which a deduction is not allowed under section 2053(d)) bears to D (the value of all property subjected to the foreign death tax). Stated algebraically, the “first limitation” (A) equals—
Value of property in foreign country subjected to foreign death tax, included in gross estate and for which a deduction is not allowed under section 2053(d)(C) ÷ Value of all property subjected to foreign death tax (D) × Amount of foreign death tax (B)
The values used in this proportion are the values determined for the purpose of the foreign death tax. The amount of the foreign death tax for which credit is allowable must be converted into United States money. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
At the time of his death on June 1, 1966, the decedent, a citizen of the United States, owned stock in X Corporation (a corporation organized under the laws of Country Y) valued at $80,000. In addition, he owned bonds issued by Country Y valued at $80,000. The stock and bond certificates were in the United States. Decedent left by will $20,000 of the stock and $50,000 of the Country Y bonds to his surviving spouse. He left the rest of the stock and bonds to his son. Under the situs rules referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of § 20.2014-1 the stock is deemed situated in Country Y while the bonds are deemed to have their situs in the United States. (The bonds would be deemed to have their situs in Country Y if the decedent had died on or after November 14, 1966.) There is not death tax convention in existence between the United States and Country Y. The laws of Country Y provide for inheritance taxes computed as follows:
Inheritance tax of surviving spouse:
Value of stock
$20,000
Value of bonds
50,000
Total value
70,000
Tax (16 percent rate)
11,200
Inheritance tax of son:
Value of stock
60,000
Value of bonds
$30,000
Total value
90,000
Tax (16 percent rate)
14,400
The “first limitation” on the credit for foreign death taxes is:
$20,000 + $60,000 (factor C of the ratio stated at § 20.2014−2(a)) ÷ $70,000 + $90,000 (factor D of the ratio stated at § 20.2014−2(a)) × ($11,200 + $14,400) (factor B of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-2(a)) = $12,800
(b) If a foreign country imposes more than one kind of death tax or imposes taxes at different rates upon the several shares of an estate, or if a foreign country and a political subdivision or possession thereof each imposes a death tax, a “first limitation” is to be computed separately for each tax or rate and the results added in order to determine the total “first limitation.” The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The facts are the same as those contained in the example set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the tax of the surviving spouse was computed at a 10 percent rate and amounted to $7,000, and the tax of the son was computed at a 20 percent rate and amounted to $18,000. In this case, the “first limitation” on the credit for foreign death taxes is computed as follows:
“First limitation” with respect to inheritance tax of surviving spouse:
[$20,000 (factor C of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-2(a)) ÷ $70,000 (factor D of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-2(a))] × $7,000 (factor B of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-2(a)) =
$2,000.
“First limitation” with respect to inheritance tax of son:
[$60,000 (factor C of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-2(a)) ÷ $90,000 (factor D of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-2(a))] × $18,000 (factor B of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-2(a)) =
12,000.
Total “first limitation” on the credit for foreign death taxes
14,000
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 6600, 27 FR 4984, May 29, 1962; T.D. 6684, 28 FR 11408, Oct. 24, 1963; T.D. 7296, 38 FR 34193, Dec. 12, 1973; 39 FR 2090, Jan. 17, 1974]
§ 20.2014-3
“Second limitation”.
(a) The amount of the Federal estate tax attributable to particular property situated in a foreign country, subjected to foreign death tax in that country, and included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes is the “second limitation.” Thus, the credit is limited to an amount, E, which bears the same ratio to F (the gross Federal estate tax, reduced by any credit for State death taxes under section 2011 and by any credit for gift tax under section 2012) as G (the “adjusted value of the property situated in the foreign country, subjected to foreign death tax, and included in the gross estate”, computed as described in paragraph (b) of this section) bears to H (the value of the entire gross estate, reduced by the total amount of the deductions allowed under sections 2055 (charitable deduction) and 2056 (marital deduction)). Stated algebraically, the “second limitation” (E) equals:
“Adjusted value of the property situated in the foreign country, subjected to foreign death taxes, and included in the gross estate” (G) ÷ Value of entire gross estate, less charitable and marital deductions (H) × Gross Federal estate tax, less credits for State death taxes and gift tax (F)
The values used in this proportion are the values determined for the purpose of the Federal estate tax.
(b) Adjustment is required to factor “G” of the ratio stated in paragraph (a) of this section if a deduction for foreign death taxes under section 2053(d), a charitable deduction under section 2055, or a marital deduction under section 2056 is allowed with respect to the foreign property. If a deduction for foreign death taxes is allowed, the value of the property situated in the foreign country, subjected to foreign death tax, and included in the gross estate does not include the value of any property in respect of which the deduction for foreign death taxes is allowed. See § 20.2014-7. If a charitable deduction or a marital deduction is allowed, the value of such foreign property (after exclusion of the value of any property in respect of which the deduction for foreign death taxes is allowed) is reduced as follows:
(1) If a charitable deduction or a marital deduction is allowed to a decedent's estate with respect to any part of the foreign property, except foreign property in respect of which a deduction for foreign death taxes is allowed,
specifically bequeathed, devised, or otherwise specifically passing to a charitable organization or to the decedent's spouse, the value of the foreign property is reduced by the amount of the charitable deduction or marital deduction allowed with respect to such specific transfer. See example (1) of paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) If a charitable deduction or a marital deduction is allowed to a decedent's estate with respect to a bequest, devise or other transfer of an interest in a group of assets including both the foreign property and other property, the value of the foreign property is reduced by an amount, I, which bears the same ratio to J (the amount of the charitable deduction or marital deduction allowed with respect to such transfer of an interest in a group of assets) as K (the value of the foreign property, except foreign property in respect of which a deduction for foreign death taxes is allowed, included in the group of assets) bears to L (the value of the entire group of assets). As used in this subparagraph, the term “group of assets” has reference to those assets which, under applicable law, are chargeable with the charitable or marital transfer. See example (2) of paragraph (c) of this section.
Any reduction described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section on account of the marital deduction must proportionately take into account, if applicable, the limitation on the aggregate amount of the marital deduction contained in § 20.2056(a)-1(c). See § 20.2014-3(c),
Example 3.
(c) The application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In each case, the computations relate to the amount of credit under section 2014 without regard to the amount of credit which may be allowable under an applicable death tax convention.

# Example (1).
(i) Decedent, a citizen and resident of the United States at the time of his death on February 1, 1967, left a gross estate of $1,000,000 which includes the following: shares of stock issued by a domestic corporation, valued at $750,000; bonds issued in 1960 by the United States and physically located in foreign Country X, valued at $50,000; and shares of stock issued by a Country X corporation, valued at $200,000, with respect to which death taxes were paid to Country X. Expenses, indebtedness, etc., amounted to $60,000. Decedent specifically bequeathed $40,000 of the stock issued by the Country X corporation to a U.S. charity and left the residue of his estate, in equal shares, to his son and daughter. The gross Federal estate tax is $266,500, and the credit for State death taxes is $27,600. Under the situs rules referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of § 20.2014-1, the shares of stock issued by the Country X corporation comprise the only property deemed to be situated in Country X. (The bonds also would be deemed to have their situs in Country X if the decedent had died before November 14, 1966.)
(ii) The “second limitation” on the credit for foreign death taxes is:
[($200,000 − $40,000 (factor G of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(a); see also § 20.2014-3(b)(1))) ÷ ($1,000,000 − $40,000 (factor H of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(a)))] × ($266,500 − $27,600) (factor F of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(a)) = $39,816.67.
The lesser of this amount and the amount of the “first limitation” (computed under § 20.2014-2) is the credit for foreign death taxes.

# Example (2).
(i) Decedent, a citizen and resident of the United States at the time of his death, left a gross estate of $1,000,000 which includes: shares of stock issued by a United States corporation, valued at $650,000; shares of stock issued by a Country X corporation, valued at $200,000; and life insurance, in the amount of $150,000, payable to a son. Expenses, indebtedness, etc., amounted to $40,000. The decedent made a specific bequest of $25,000 of the Country X corporation stock to Charity A and a general bequest of $100,000 to Charity B. The residue of his estate was left to his daughter. The gross Federal estate tax is $242,450 and the credit for State death taxes is $24,480. Under these facts and applicable law, neither the stock of the Country X corporation specifically bequeathed to Charity A nor the insurance payable to the son could be charged with satisfying the bequest to Charity B. Therefore, the “group of assets” which could be so charged is limited to stock of the Country X corporation valued at $175,000 and stock of the United States corporation valued at $650,000.
(ii) Factor “G” of the ratio which is used in determining the “second limitation” is computed as follows:
Value of property situated in Country X
$200,000.00
Less:
Reduction described in § 20.2014-3(b)(1)
$25,000.00
Reduction described in § 20.2014-3(b)(2) = [$175,000 (factor K of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3 (b)(2)) ÷ ($175,000 + $650,000 (factor L of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3 (b)(2)))] × $100,000 (factor J of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(b)(2)) =
21,212.12
46,212.12
Factor “G” of the ratio
153,787.88
(iii) In this case, the “second limitation” on the credit for foreign death taxes is:
[$153,787.88 (factor G of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(a); see also subdivision (ii) above) ÷ ($1,000,000 − $125,000 (factor H of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(a)))] × ($242,450 − $24,480) (factor F of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(a)) = $38,309.88.

# Example (3).
(i) Decedent, a citizen and resident of the United States at the time of his death, left a gross estate of $850,000 which includes: shares of stock issued by United States corporations, valued at $440,000; real estate located in the United States, valued at $110,000; and shares of stock issued by Country X corporations, valued at $300,000. Expenses, indebtedness, etc., amounted to $50,000. Decedent devised $40,000 in real estate to a United States charity. In addition, he bequeathed to his wife $200,000 in United States stocks and $300,000 in Country X stocks. The residue of his estate passed to his children. The gross Federal estate tax is $81,700 and the credit for State death taxes is $5,520.
(ii) Decedent's adjusted gross estate is $800,000 (i.e., the $850,000, gross estate less $50,000, expenses, indebtedness, etc.). Assume that the limitation imposed by section 2056(c), as in effect before 1982, is applicable so that the aggregate allowable marital deduction is limited to one-half the adjusted gross estate, or $400,000 (which is 50 percent of $800,000). Factor “G” of the ratio which is used in determining the “second limitation” is computed as follows:
Value of property situated in Country X.
$300,000
Less: Reduction described in § 20.2014-3 (b)(1) determined as follows (see also end of § 20.2014-3(b))—
Total amount of bequests which qualify for the marital deduction:
Specific bequest of Country X stock
$300,000
Specific bequest of United States stock
200,000
500,000
Limitation on aggregate marital deduction under section 2056(c)
400,000
Part of specific bequest of Country X stock with respect to which the marital deduction is allowed—($400,000 ÷ $500,000 × $300,000)
240,000
Factor “G” of the ratio
60,000
(iii) Thus, the “second limitation” on the credit for foreign death taxes is:
[$60,000 (factor G of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(a); see also subdivision (ii) above) ÷ ($850,000 − $40,000 − $400,000 (factor H of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(a)))] × ($81,700 − $5,520) (factor F of the ratio stated at § 20.2014-3(a)) = $11,148.29.
(d) If the foreign country imposes more than one kind of death tax or imposes taxes at different rates upon the several shares of an estate, or if the foreign country and a political subdivision or possession thereof each imposes a death tax, the “second limitation” is still computed by applying the ratio set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. Factor “G” of the ratio is determined by taking into consideration the combined value of the foreign property which is subjected to each different tax or different rate. The combined value, however, cannot exceed the value at which such property was included in the gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes. Thus, if Country X imposes a tax on the inheritance of a surviving spouse at a 10-percent rate and on the inheritance of a son at a 20-percent rate, the combined value of their inheritances is taken into consideration in determining factor “G” of the ratio, which is then used in computing the “second limitation.” However, the “first limitation” is computed as provided in paragraph (b) of § 20.2014-2. The lesser of the “first limitation” and the “second limitation” is the credit for foreign death taxes.

§ 20.2014-4
Application of credit in cases involving a death tax convention.
(a)
In general.
(1) If credit for a particular foreign death tax is authorized by a death tax convention, there is allowed either the credit provided for by the convention or the credit provided for by section 2014, whichever is the more beneficial to the estate. For cases where credit may be taken under both
the death tax convention and section 2014, see paragraph (b) of this section. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) Decedent, a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of foreign Country X at the time of his death on December 1, 1966, left a gross estate of $1 million which includes the following: Shares of stock issued by a Country X corporation, valued at $400,000; bonds issued in 1962 by the United States and physically located in Country X, valued at $350,000; and real estate located in the United States, valued at $250,000. Expenses, indebtedness, etc., amounted to $50,000. Decedent left his entire estate to his son. There is in effect a death tax convention between the United States and Country X which provides for the allowance of credit by the United States for succession duties imposed by the national government of Country X. The gross Federal estate tax is $307,200, and the credit for State death taxes is $33,760. Country X imposed a net succession duty on the stocks and bonds of $180,000. Under the situs rules referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of § 20.2014-1, the shares of stock comprise the only property deemed to be situated in Country X. (If the decedent has died before November 14, 1966, the bonds also would be deemed to have their situs in Country X.) Under the convention, both the stocks and the bonds are deemed to be situated in Country X. In this example all figures are rounded to the nearest dollar.
(ii)(
a
) The credit authorized by the convention for death taxes imposed by Country X is computed as follows:
(
1
) Country X tax attributable to property situated in Country X and subjected to tax by both countries ($750,000 ÷ $750,000 × $180,000)
$180,000
(
2
) Federal estate tax attributable to property situated in Country X and subjected to tax by both countries—($750,000 ÷ $1,000,000 × $273,440)
205,080
(
3
) Credit (subdivision (
1
) or (
2
), whichever is less)
180,000
(
b
) The credit authorized by section 2014 for death taxes imposed by Country X is computed as follows:
(
1
) “First limitation” computed under § 20.2014-2 ($400,000 ÷ $750,000 × $180,000)
$96,000
(
2
) “Second limitation” computed under § 20.2014-3 ($400,000 ÷ $1,000,000 × $273,440)
109,376
(
3
) Credit (subdivision (
1
) or (
2
), whichever is less)
96,000
(iii) On the basis of the facts contained in this example, the credit of $180,000 authorized by the convention is the more beneficial to the estate.
(2) It should be noted that the greater of the treaty credit and the statutory credit is not necessarily the more beneficial to the estate. Such is the situation, for example, in those cases which involve both a foreign death tax credit and a credit under section 2013 for tax on prior transfers. The reason is that the amount of the credit for tax on prior transfers may differ depending upon whether the credit for foreign death tax is taken under the treaty or under the statute. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the advantage of taking the greater of the treaty credit and the statutory credit may be more than offset by a resultant smaller credit for tax on prior transfers. The solution is to compute the net estate tax payable first on the assumption that the treaty credit will be taken and then on the assumption that the statutory credit will be taken. Such computations will indicate whether the treaty credit or the statutory credit is in fact the more beneficial to the estate.
(b)
Taxes imposed by both a foreign country and a political subdivision thereof.
If death taxes are imposed by both a foreign country with which the United States has entered into a death tax convention and one or more of its possessions or political subdivisions, there is allowed, against the tax imposed by section 2001—
(1) A credit for the combined death taxes paid to the foreign country and its political subdivisions or possessions as provided for by the convention, or
(2) A credit for the combined death taxes paid to the foreign country and its political subdivisions or possessions as determined under section 2014, or
(3)(i) A credit for that amount of the combined death taxes paid to the foreign country and its political subdivisions or possessions as is allowable under the convention, and
(ii) A credit under section 2014 for the death taxes paid to each political subdivision or possession, but only to the extent such death taxes are not directly or indirectly creditable under the convention.
whichever is the most beneficial to the estate. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(1) Decedent, a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of Province Y of foreign Country X at the time of his death on February 1, 1966, left a gross estate of $250,000 which includes the following:
Bonds issued by Country X physically located in Province Y, valued at $75,000; bonds issued by Province Z of Country X and physically located in the United States, valued at $50,000; and shares of stock issued by a domestic corporation, valued at $125,000. Decedent left his entire estate to his son. Expenses, indebtedness etc., amounted to $26,000. The Federal estate tax after allowance of the credit for State death taxes is $38,124. Province Y imposed a death tax of 8 percent on the Country X bonds located therein which amounted to $6,000. No death tax was imposed by Province Z. Country X imposed a death tax of 15 percent on the Country X bonds and the Province Z bonds which amounted to $18,750 before allowance of any credit for the death tax of Province Y. Country X allows against its death taxes a credit for death taxes paid to any of its provinces on property which it also taxes, but only to the extent of one-half of the Country X death tax attributable to the property, or the amount of death taxes paid to its province, whichever is less. Country X, therefore, allowed a credit of $5,625 for the death taxes paid to Province Y. There is in effect a death tax convention between the United States and Country X which provides for allowance of credit by the United States for death taxes imposed by the national government of Country X. The death tax convention provides that in computing the “first limitation” for the credit under the convention, the tax of Country X is not to be reduced by the amount of the credit allowed for provincial taxes. Under the situs rules described in paragraph (a)(3) of § 20.2014-1, only the Country X bonds located in Province Y are deemed situated in Country X. (The bonds issued by Province Z also would be deemed to have their situs in Country X if the decedent had died on or after November 14, 1966.) Under the convention, both the Country X bonds and the Province Z bonds are deemed to be situated in Country X. In this example all figures are rounded to the nearest dollar.
(2)(i) The credit authorized by section 2014 for death taxes imposed by Country X (which includes death taxes imposed by Province Y according to § 20.2014-1(a)(1)) is computed as follows:
(
a
) “First limitation” with respect to tax imposed by national government of Country X (computed under paragraph (b) of § 20.2014-2)
(
1
) Gross Country X death tax attributable to Country X bonds (before allowance of provincial death taxes) (75,000 ÷ $125,000 × $18,750)
$11,250
(
2
) Less credit for Province Y death taxes on such bonds
5,625
(
3
) Net Country X death tax attributable to such bonds
5,625
(
b
) “First limitation” with respect to tax imposed by Province Y (computed under paragraph (b) of § 20.2014-2) ($75,000 ÷ $75,000 × $6,000)
6,000
(
c
) Total “first limitation”
11,625
(
d
) “Second limitation” (computed under paragraph (d) of § 20.2014-3) ($75,000 ÷ $250,000 × $38,124)
11,437
$(
e
) Credit (subdivision (
c
) or (
d
), whichever is less)
11,437
(ii) The credit authorized under the death tax convention between the United States and Country X is computed as follows:
(
a
) Country X tax attributable to property situated in Country X and subject to tax by both countries ($125,000 ÷ $125,000 × $18,750)
$18,750
(
b
) Federal estate tax attributable to property situated in Country X and subjected to tax by both countries ($125,000 ÷ $250,000 × $38,124)
19,062
(
c
) Credit (subdivision (
a
) or (
b
), whichever is less)
18,750
(3) If the estate takes a credit for death taxes under the convention, it would receive a credit of $18,750 which would include an indirect credit of $5,625 for death taxes paid to Province Y. The death tax of Province Y which was not directly or indirectly creditable under the convention is $375 ($6,000− $5,625). A credit for this tax would also be allowed under section 2014 but only to the extent of $187, as the amount of credit for the combined foreign death taxes is limited to the amount of Federal estate tax attributable to the property, determined in accordance with the rules prescribed for computing the “second limitation” under section 2014. In this case, the “second limitation” under section 2014 on the taxes attributable to the Country X bonds is $11,437 (see computation set forth in (2)(i)(
d
) of this example). The amount of credit under the convention for taxes attributable to Country X bonds is $11,250−($75,000 ÷ $125,000 × $18,750). Inasmuch as the “second limitation” under section 2014 in respect of the Country X bonds ($11,437) exceeds the amount of the credit allowed under the convention in respect of the Country X bonds ($11,250) by $187, the additional credit allowable under section 2014 for the death taxes paid to Province Y not directly or indirectly creditable under the convention is limited to $187.
(c)
Taxes imposed by two foreign countries with respect to the same property.
It is stated as a general rule in paragraph (a)(2) of § 20.2014-1 that if credits against the Federal estate tax are allowable under section 2014, or under section 2014 and one or more death tax conventions, for death taxes paid to more than one country, the credits are combined and the aggregate amount is credited against the Federal estate tax. This rule may result in credit being allowed for taxes imposed by two different countries upon the same item of property. If such is the case, the total amount of the credits with respect to such property is limited to the amount of the Federal estate tax attributable
to the property, determined in accordance with the rules prescribed for computing the “second limitation” set forth in § 20.2014-3. The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The decedent, a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of Country X at the time of his death on May 1, 1967, left a taxable estate which included bonds issued by Country Z and physically located in Country X. Each of the three countries involved imposed death taxes on the Country Z bonds. Assume that under the provisions of a treaty between the United States and Country X the estate is entitled to a credit against the Federal estate tax for death taxes imposed by Country X on the bonds in the maximum amount of $20,000. Assume, also, that since the decedent died after November 13, 1966, so that under the situs rules referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of § 20.2014-1 the bonds are deemed to have their situs in Country Z, the estate is entitled to a credit against the Federal estate tax for death taxes imposed by Country Z on the bonds in the maximum amount of $10,000. Finally, assume that the Federal estate tax attributable to the bonds is $25,000. Under these circumstances, the credit allowed the estate with respect to the bonds would be limited to $25,000.
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 6742, 29 FR 7928, June 23, 1964; T.D. 7296, 38 FR 34193, Dec. 12, 1973]
§ 20.2014-5
Proof of credit.
(a) If the foreign death tax has not been determined and paid by the time the Federal estate tax return required by section 6018 is filed, credit may be claimed on the return in an estimated amount. However, before credit for the foreign death tax is finally allowed, satisfactory evidence, such as a statement by an authorized official of each country, possession or political subdivision thereof imposing the tax, must be submitted on Form 706CE certifying:
(1) The full amount of the tax (exclusive of any interest or penalties), as computed before allowance of any credit, remission, or relief;
(2) The amount of any credit, allowance, remission, or relief, and other pertinent information, including the nature of the allowance and a description of the property to which it pertains;
(3) The net foreign death tax payable after any such allowance;
(4) The date on which the death tax was paid, or if not all paid at one time, the date and amount of each partial payment; and
(5) A list of the property situated in the foreign country and subjected to its tax, showing a description and the value of the property.
Satisfactory evidence must also be submitted showing that no refund of the death tax is pending and none is authorized or, if any refund is pending or has been authorized, its amount and other pertinent information. See also section 2016 and § 20.2016-1 for requirements if foreign death taxes claimed as a credit are subsequently recovered.
(b) The following information must also be submitted whenever applicable:
(1) If any of the property subjected to the foreign death tax was situated outside of the country imposing the tax, the description of each item of such property and its value.
(2) If more than one inheritance or succession is involved with respect to which credit is claimed, or if the foreign country, possession or political subdivision thereof imposes more than one kind of death tax, or if both the foreign country and a possession or political subdivision thereof each imposes a death tax, a separate computation with respect to each inheritance or succession tax.
(c) In addition to the information required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the district director may require the submission of any further proof deemed necessary to establish the right to the credit.
§ 20.2014-6
Period of limitations on credit.
The credit for foreign death taxes under section 2014 is limited to those taxes which were actually paid and for which a credit was claimed within four years after the filing of the estate tax return for the decedent's estate. If, however, a petition has been filed with the Tax Court of the United States for the redetermination of a deficiency within the time prescribed in section 6213(a), the credit is limited to those taxes which were actually paid and for which a credit was claimed within four years after the filing of the return, or before the expiration of 60 days after
the decision of the Tax Court becomes final, whichever period is the last to expire. Similarly, if an extension of time has been granted under section 6161 for payment of the tax shown on the return, or of a deficiency, the credit is limited to those taxes which were actually paid and for which a credit was claimed within four years after the filing of the return, or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, whichever period is the last to expire. See section 2015 for the applicable period of limitations for credit for foreign death taxes on reversionary or remainder interests if an election is made under section 6163(a) to postpone payment of the estate tax attributable to reversionary or remainder interests. If a claim for refund based on the credit for foreign death taxes is filed within the applicable period described in this section, a refund may be made despite the general limitation provisions of sections 6511 and 6512. Any refund based on the credit for foreign death taxes shall be made without interest.
§ 20.2014-7
Limitation on credit if a deduction for foreign death taxes is allowed under section 2053(d).
If a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) for foreign death taxes paid with respect to a charitable gift, the credit for foreign death taxes is subject to special limitations. In such a case the property described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 2014(b) shall not include any property with respect to which a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d). The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The decedent, a citizen of the United States, died July 1, 1955, leaving a gross estate of $1,200,000 consisting of: Shares of stock issued by United States corporations, valued at $600,000; bonds issued by the United States Government physically located in the United States, valued at $300,000; and shares of stock issued by a Country X corporation, valued at $300,000. Expenses, indebtedness, etc., amounted to $40,000. The decedent made specific bequests of $400,000 of the United States corporation stock to a niece and $100,000 of the Country X corporation stock to a nephew. The residue of his estate was left to charity. There is no death tax convention in existence between the United States and Country X. The Country X tax imposed was at a 50-percent rate on all beneficiaries. A State inheritance tax of $20,000 was imposed on the niece and nephew. The decedent did not provide in his will for the payment of the death taxes, and under local law the Federal estate tax is payable from the general estate, the same as administration expenses.

[T.D. 6600, 27 FR 4984, May 27, 1962]
§ 20.2015-1
Credit for death taxes on remainders.
(a) If the executor of an estate elects under section 6163(a) to postpone the time for payment of any portion of the Federal estate tax attributable to a reversionary or remainder interest in property, credit is allowed under sections 2011 and 2014 against that portion of the Federal estate tax for State death taxes and foreign death taxes attributable to the reversionary or remainder interest if the State death taxes or foreign death taxes are paid and if credit therefor is claimed either—
(1) Within the time provided for in sections 2011 and 2014, or
(2) Within the time for payment of the tax imposed by section 2001 or 2101 as postponed under section 6163(a) and as extended under section 6163(b) (on account of undue hardship) or, if the precedent interest terminated before July 5, 1958, within 60 days after the termination of the preceding interest or interests in the property.
The allowance of credit, however, is subject to the other limitations contained in sections 2011 and 2014 and, in the case of the estate of a decedent who was a nonresident not a citizen of the United States, in section 2102(b).
(b) In applying the rule stated in paragraph (a) of this section, credit for State death taxes or foreign death taxes paid within the time provided in sections 2011 and 2014 is applied first to the portion of the Federal estate tax payment of which is not postponed, and any excess is applied to the balance of the Federal estate tax. However, credit for State death taxes or foreign death taxes not paid within the time provided in section 2011 and 2014 is allowable only against the portion of the Federal estate tax attributable to the reversionary or remainder interest, and only for State or foreign death taxes attributable to that interest. If a State death tax or a foreign death tax is imposed upon both a reversionary or remainder interest and upon other property, without a definite apportionment of the tax, the amount of the tax deemed attributable to the reversionary or remainder interest is an amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax as the value of the reversionary or remainder interest bears to the value of the entire property with respect to which the tax was imposed. In applying this ratio, adjustments consistent with those required under paragraph (c) of § 20.6163-1 must be made.
(c) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
One-third of the Federal estate tax was attributable to a remainder interest in real property located in State Y, and two-thirds of the Federal estate tax was attributable to other property located in State X. The payment of the tax attributable to the remainder interest was postponed under the provisions of section 6163(a). The maximum credit allowable for State death taxes under the provisions of section 2011 is $12,000. Therefore, of the maximum credit allowable, $4,000 is attributable to the remainder interest and $8,000 is attributable to the other property. Within the 4-year period provided for in section 2011, inheritance tax in the amount of $9,000 was paid to State X in connection with the other property. With respect to this $9,000, $8,000 (the maximum amount allowable) is allowed as a credit against the Federal estate tax attributable to the other property, and $1,000 is allowed as a credit against the postponed tax. The life estate or other precedent interest expired after July 4, 1958. After the expiration of the 4-year period but before the expiration of the period of postponment elected under section 6163(a) and of the period of extension granted under section 6163(b) for payment of the tax, inheritance tax in the amount of $5,000 was paid to State Y in connection with the remainder interest. As the maximum credit allowable with respect to the remainder interest is $4,000 and $1,000 has already been allowed as a credit, an additional $3,000 will be credited against the Federal estate tax attributable to the remainder interest. It should be noted that if the life estate or other precedent interest had expired after the expiration of the 4-year period but before July 5, 1958, the same result would be reached only if the inheritance tax had been paid to State Y before the expiration of 60 days after the termination of the life estate or other precedent interest.

# Example (2).
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that within the 4-year period inheritance tax in the amount of $2,500 was paid to State Y with respect to the remainder interest and inheritance tax in the amount of $7,500 was paid to State X with respect to the other property. The amount of $8,000 is allowed as a credit against the Federal estate tax attributable to the other property and the amount of $2,000 is allowed as a credit against the postponed tax. The life estate or other precedent interest expired after July 4, 1958. After the expiration of the 4-year period but before the expiration of the period of postponement elected under section 6163(a) and of the period of extension granted under section 6163(b) for payment of the tax, inheritance tax in the amount of $5,000 was paid to State Y in connection with the remainder interest. As the maximum credit allowable with respect to the remainder interest is $4,000 and $2,000 already has been allowed as a credit, an additional $2,000 will be credited against the Federal estate tax attributable to the remainder interest. It should be noted that if the life estate or other precedent interest had expired after the expiration of the 4-year period but before July 5, 1958, the same result would be reached only if the inheritance tax had been paid to State Y before the expiration of 60 days after the termination of the life estate or other precedent interest.

# Example (3).
The facts are the same as in example (2), except that no payment was made to State Y within the 4-year period. The amount of $7,500 is allowed as a credit against the Federal estate tax attributable to the other property. After termination of the life interest additional credit will be allowed in the amount of $4,000 against the Federal estate tax attributable to the remainder interest. Since the payment of $5,000 was made to State Y following the expiration of the 4-year period, no part of the payment may be allowed as a credit against the Federal estate tax attributable to the other property.

§ 20.2016-1
Recovery of death taxes claimed as credit.
In accordance with the provisions of section 2016, the executor (or any other person) receiving a refund of any State death taxes or foreign death taxes claimed as a credit under section 2011 or section 2014 shall notify the district director of the refund within 30 days of its receipt. The notice shall contain the following information:
(a) The name of the decedent;
(b) The date of the decedent's death;
(c) The property with respect to which the refund was made;
(d) The amount of the refund, exclusive of interest;
(e) The date of the refund; and
(f) The name and address of the person receiving the refund.
If the refund was in connection with foreign death taxes claimed as a credit under section 2014, the notice shall also contain a statement showing the amount of interest, if any, paid by the foreign country on the refund. Finally, the person filing the notice shall furnish the district director such additional information as he may request. Any Federal estate tax found to be due by reason of the refund is payable by the person or persons receiving it, upon notice and demand, even though the refund is received after the expiration of the period of limitations set forth in section 6501 (see section 6501(c)(5)). If the tax found to be due results from a refund of foreign death tax claimed as a credit under section 2014, such tax shall not bear interest for any period before the receipt of the refund, except to the extent that interest was paid by the foreign country on the refund.

§ 20.2031-1
Definition of gross estate; valuation of property.
(a)
Definition of gross estate.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph the value of the gross estate of a decedent who was a citizen or resident of the United States at the time of his death is the total value of the interests described in sections 2033 through 2044. The gross estate of a decedent who died before October 17, 1962, does not include real property situated outside the United States (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of § 20.0-1). Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section (relating to the estates of decedents dying after October 16, 1962, and before July 1, 1964), in the case of a decedent dying after October 16, 1962, real property situated outside the United States which comes within the scope of sections 2033 through 2044 is included in the gross estate to the same extent as any other property coming within the scope of those sections. In arriving at the value of the gross estate the interests described in sections 2033 through 2044 are valued as described in this section, §§ 20.2031-2 through 20.2031-9 and § 20.2032-1. The contents of sections 2033 through 2044 are, in general, as follows:
(1) Sections 2033 and 2034 are concerned mainly with interests in property passing through the decedent's probate estate. Section 2033 includes in the decedent's gross estate any interest that the decedent had in property at the time of his death. Section 2034 provides that any interest of the decedent's surviving spouse in the decedent's property, such as dower or curtesy, does not prevent the inclusion of such property in the decedent's gross estate.
(2) Sections 2035 through 2038 deal with interests in property transferred by the decedent during his life under such circumstances as to bring the interests within the decedent's gross estate. Section 2035 includes in the decedent's gross estate property transferred in contemplation of death, even though the decedent had not interest in, or control over, the property at the time of his death. Section 2036 provides for the inclusion of transferred property with respect to which the decedent retained the income or the power to designate who shall enjoy the income. Section 2037 includes in the decedent's gross estate certain transfers under which the beneficial enjoyment of the property could be obtained only by surviving the decedent. Section 2038 provides for the inclusion of transferred property if the decedent had at the time of his death the power to change the beneficial enjoyment of the property. It should be noted that there is considerable overlap in the application of sections 2036 through 2038 with respect to reserved powers, so that transferred property may be includible in the decedent's gross estate in varying degrees under more than one of those sections.
(3) Sections 2039 through 2042 deal with special kinds of property and powers. Sections 2039 and 2040 concern annuities and jointly held property respectively. Section 2041 deals with powers held by the decedent over the beneficial enjoyment of property not originating with the decedent. Section 2042 concerns insurance under policies on the life of the decedent.
(4) Section 2043 concerns the sufficiency of consideration for transfers made by the decedent during his life. This has a bearing on the amount to be included in the decedent's gross estate under sections 2035 through 2038, and 2041. Section 2044 deals with retroactivity.
(b)
Valuation of property in general.
The value of every item of property includible in a decedent's gross estate under sections 2031 through 2044 is its fair market value at the time of the decedent's death, except that if the executor elects the alternate valuation method under section 2032, it is the fair market value thereof at the date, and with the adjustments, prescribed in that section. The fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell
and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property includible in the decedent's gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price. Nor is the fair market value of an item of property to be determined by the sale price of the item in a market other than that in which such item is most commonly sold to the public, taking into account the location of the item wherever appropriate. Thus, in the case of an item of property includible in the decedent's gross estate, which is generally obtained by the public in the retail market, the fair market value of such an item of property is the price at which the item or a comparable item would be sold at retail. For example, the fair market value of an automobile (an article generally obtained by the public in the retail market) includible in the decedent's gross estate is the price for which an automobile of the same or approximately the same description, make, model, age, condition, etc., could be purchased by a member of the general public and not the price for which the particular automobile of the decedent would be purchased by a dealer in used automobiles. Examples of items of property which are generally sold to the public at retail may be found in §§ 20.2031-6 and 20.2031-8. The value is generally to be determined by ascertaining as a basis the fair market value as of the applicable valuation date of each unit of property. For example, in the case of shares of stock or bonds, such unit of property is generally a share of stock or a bond. Livestock, farm machinery, harvested and growing crops must generally be itemized and the value of each item separately returned. Property shall not be returned at the value at which it is assessed for local tax purposes unless that value represents the fair market value as of the applicable valuation date. All relevant facts and elements of value as of the applicable valuation date shall be considered in every case. The value of items of property which were held by the decedent for sale in the course of a business generally should be reflected in the value of the business. For valuation of interests in businesses, see § 20.2031-3. See § 20.2031-2 and §§ 20.2031-4 through 20.2031-8 for further information concerning the valuation of other particular kinds of property. For certain circumstances under which the sale of an item of property at a price below its fair market value may result in a deduction for the estate, see paragraph (d)(2) of § 20.2053-3.
(c)
Real property situated outside the United States; gross estate of decedent dying after October 16, 1962, and before July 1, 1964
—(1)
In general.
In the case of decedent dying after October 16, 1962, and before July 1, 1964, the value of real property situated outside the United States (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of § 20.0-1) is not included in the gross estate of the decedent—
(i) Under section 2033, 2034, 2035(a), 2036(a), 2037(a), or 2038(a) to the extent the real property, or the decedent's interest in it, was acquired by the decedent before February 1, 1962;
(ii) Under section 2040 to the extent such property or interest was acquired by the decedent before February 1, 1962, or was held by the decedent and the survivor in a joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety before February 1, 1962; or
(iii) Under section 2041(a) to the extent that before February 1, 1962, such property or interest was subject to a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041) possessed by the decedent.
(2)
Certain property treated as acquired before February 1, 1962.
For purposes of this paragraph real property situated outside the United States (including property held by the decedent and the survivor in a joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety), or an interest in such property or a general power of appointment in respect of such property, which was acquired by the decedent after January 31, 1962, is treated as acquired by the decedent before February 1, 1962, if
(i) Such property, interest, or power was acquired by the decedent by gift within the meaning of section 2511, or from a prior decedent by devise or inheritance, or by reason of death, form of ownership, or other conditions (including the exercise or nonexercise of a power of appointment); and
(ii) Before February 1, 1962, the donor or prior decedent had acquired the
property or his interest therein or had possessed a power of appointment in respect thereof.
(3)
Certain property treated as acquired after January 31, 1962.
For purposes of this paragraph that portion of capital additions or improvements made after January 31, 1962, to real property situated outside the United States is, to the extent that it materially increases the value of the property, treated as real property acquired after January 31, 1962. Accordingly, the gross estate may include the value of improvements on unimproved real property, such as office buildings, factories, houses, fences, drainage ditches, and other capital items, and the value of capital additions and improvements to existing improvements, placed on real property after January 31, 1962, whether or not the value of such real property or existing improvements is included in the gross estate.
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 6684, 28 FR 11408, Oct. 24, 1963; T.D. 6826, 30 FR 7708, June 15, 1965]
§ 20.2031-2
Valuation of stocks and bonds.
(a)
In general.
The value of stocks and bonds is the fair market value per share or bond on the applicable valuation date.
(b)
Based on selling prices.
(1) In general, if there is a market for stocks or bonds, on a stock exchange, in an over-the-counter market, or otherwise, the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices on the valuation date is the fair market value per share or bond. If there were no sales on the valuation date but there were sales on dates within a reasonable period both before and after the valuation date, the fair market value is determined by taking a weighted average of the means between the highest and lowest sales on the nearest date before and the nearest date after the valuation date. The average is to be weighted inversely by the respective numbers of trading days between the selling dates and the valuation date. If the stocks or bonds are listed on more than one exchange, the records of the exchange where the stocks or bonds are principally dealt in should be employed if such records are available in a generally available listing or publication of general circulation. In the event that such records are not so available and such stocks or bonds are listed on a composite listing of combined exchanges available in a generally available listing or publication of general circulation, the records of such combined exchanges should be employed. In valuing listed securities, the executor should be careful to consult accurate records to obtain values as of the applicable valuation date. If quotations of unlisted securities are obtained from brokers, or evidence as to their sale is obtained from officers of the issuing companies, copies of the letters furnishing such quotations or evidence of sale should be attached to the return.
(2) If it is established with respect to bonds for which there is a market on a stock exchange, that the highest and lowest selling prices are not available for the valuation date in a generally available listing or publication of general circulation but that closing selling prices are so available, the fair market value per bond is the mean between the quoted closing selling price on the valuation date and the quoted closing selling price on the trading day before the valuation date. If there were no sales on the trading day before the valuation date but there were sales on a date within a reasonable period before the valuation date, the fair market value is determined by taking a weighted average of the quoted closing selling price on the valuation date and the quoted closing selling price on the nearest date before the valuation date. The closing selling price for the valuation date is to be weighted by the number of trading days between the previous selling date and the valuation date. If there were no sales within a reasonable period before the valuation date but there were sales on the valuation date, the fair market value is the closing selling price on such valuation date. If there were no sales on the valuation date but there were sales on dates within a reasonable period both before and after the valuation date, the fair market value is determined by taking a weighted average of the quoted closing selling prices on the nearest date before and the nearest
date after the valuation date. The average is to be weighted inversely by the respective numbers of trading days between the selling dates and the valuation date. If the bonds are listed on more than one exchange, the records of the exchange where the bonds are principally dealt in should be employed. In valuing listed securities, the executor should be careful to consult accurate records to obtain values as of the applicable valuation date.
(3) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
Assume that sales of X Company common stock nearest the valuation date (Friday, June 15) occurred two trading days before (Wednesday, June 13) and three trading days after (Wednesday, June 20) and on these days the mean sale prices per share were $10 and $15, respectively. The price of $12 is taken as representing the fair market value of a share of X Company common stock as of the valuation date
EC15NO91.217

# Example (2).
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the mean sale prices per share on June 13, and June 20 were $15 and $10, respectively. The price of $13 is taken as representing the fair market value of a share of X Company common stock as of the valuation date
ER13JA06.003

# Example (3).
Assume the decedent died on Sunday, October 7, and that Saturday and Sunday were not trading days. If sales of X Company common stock occurred on Friday, October 5, at mean sale prices per share of $20 and on Monday, October 8, at mean sale prices per share of $23, the price of $21.50 is taken as representing the fair market value of a share of X Company common stock as of the valuation date
EC16OC91.008

# Example (4).
Assume that on the valuation date (Tuesday, April 3, 1973) the closing selling price of a listed bond was $25 per bond and that the highest and lowest selling prices are not available in a generally available listing or publication of general circulation for that date. Assume further, that the closing selling price of the same listed bond was $21 per bond on the day before the valuation date (Monday, April 2, 1973). Thus, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section the price of $23 is taken as representing the fair market value per bond as of the valuation date
EC16OC91.009

# Example (5).
Assume the same facts as in example (4) except that there were no sales on the day before the valuation date. Assume further, that there were sales on Thursday, March 29, 1973, and that the closing selling price on that day was $23. The price of $24.50 is taken as representing the fair market value per bond as of the valuation date
EC16OC91.010

# Example (6).
Assume that no bonds were traded on the valuation date (Friday, April 20). Assume further, that sales of bonds nearest the valuation date occurred two trading days before (Wednesday, April 18) and three trading days after (Wednesday, April 25) the valuation date and that on these two days the closing selling prices per bond were $29 and $22, respectively. The highest and lowest selling prices are not available for these dates in a generally available listing or publication of general circulation. Thus, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the price of $26.20 is taken as representing the fair market value of a bond as of the valuation date
EC16OC91.011
(c)
Based on bid and asked prices.
If the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are inapplicable because actual sales are not available during a reasonable period beginning before and ending after the valuation date, the fair market value may be determined by taking the mean between the bona fide bid and asked prices on the valuation date, or if none, by taking a weighted average of the means between the bona fide bid and asked prices on the nearest trading date before and the nearest trading date after the valuation date, if both such nearest dates are within a reasonable period. The average is to be determined in the manner described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Based on incomplete selling prices or bid and asked prices.
If the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are inapplicable because no actual sale prices or bona fide bid and asked prices are available on a date within a reasonable period before the valuation date, but such prices are available on a date within a reasonable period after the valuation date, or vice versa, then the mean between the highest and lowest
available sale prices or bid and asked prices may be taken as the value.
(e)
Where selling prices or bid and asked prices do not reflect fair market value.
If it is established that the value of any bond or share of stock determined on the basis of selling or bid and asked prices as provided under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section does not reflect the fair market value thereof, then some reasonable modification of that basis or other relevant facts and elements of value are considered in determining the fair market value. Where sales at or near the date of death are few or of a sporadic nature, such sales alone may not indicate fair market value. In certain exceptional cases, the size of the block of stock to be valued in relation to the number of shares changing hands in sales may be relevant in determining whether selling prices reflect the fair market value of the block of stock to be valued. If the executor can show that the block of stock to be valued is so large in relation to the actual sales on the existing market that it could not be liquidated in a reasonable time without depressing the market, the price at which the block could be sold as such outside the usual market, as through an underwriter, may be a more accurate indication of value than market quotations. Complete data in support of any allowance claimed due to the size of the block of stock being valued shall be submitted with the return. On the other hand, if the block of stock to be valued represents a controlling interest, either actual or effective, in a going business, the price at which other lots change hands may have little relation to its true value.
(f)
Where selling prices or bid and asked prices are unavailable.
If the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section are inapplicable because actual sale prices and bona fide bid and asked prices are lacking, then the fair market value is to be determined by taking the following factors into consideration:
(1) In the case of corporate or other bonds, the soundness of the security, the interest yield, the date of maturity, and other relevant factors; and
(2) In the case of shares of stock, the company's net worth, prospective earning power and dividend-paying capacity, and other relevant factors.
Some of the “other relevant factors” referred to in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are: The good will of the business; the economic outlook in the particular industry; the company's position in the industry and its management; the degree of control of the business represented by the block of stock to be valued; and the values of securities of corporations engaged in the same or similar lines of business which are listed on a stock exchange. However, the weight to be accorded such comparisons or any other evidentiary factors considered in the determination of a value depends upon the facts of each case. In addition to the relevant factors described above, consideration shall also be given to nonoperating assets, including proceeds of life insurance policies payable to or for the benefit of the company, to the extent such nonoperating assets have not been taken into account in the determination of net worth, prospective earning power and dividend-earning capacity. Complete financial and other data upon which the valuation is based should be submitted with the return, including copies of reports of any examinations of the company made by accountants, engineers, or any technical experts as of or near the applicable valuation date.
(g)
Pledged securities.
The full value of securities pledged to secure an indebtedness of the decedent is included in the gross estate. If the decedent had a trading account with a broker, all securities belonging to the decedent and held by the broker at the date of death must be included at their fair market value as of the applicable valuation date. Securities purchased on margin for the decedent's account and held by a broker must also be returned at their fair market value as of the applicable valuation date. The amount of the decedent's indebtedness to a broker or other person with whom securities were pledged is allowed as a deduction from the gross estate in accordance with the provisions of § 20.2053-1 or § 20.2106-1 (for estates of nonresidents not citizens).
(h)
Securities subject to an option or contract to purchase.
Another person
may hold an option or a contract to purchase securities owned by a decedent at the time of his death. The effect, if any, that is given to the option or contract price in determining the value of the securities for estate tax purposes depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. Little weight will be accorded a price contained in an option or contract under which the decedent is free to dispose of the underlying securities at any price he chooses during his lifetime. Such is the effect, for example, of an agreement on the part of a shareholder to purchase whatever shares of stock the decedent may own at the time of his death. Even if the decedent is not free to dispose of the underlying securities at other than the option or contract price, such price will be disregarded in determining the value of the securities unless it is determined under the circumstances of the particular case that the agreement represents a bona fide business arrangement and not a device to pass the decedent's shares to the natural objects of his bounty for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. See section 2703 and the regulations at § 25.2703 of this chapter for special rules involving options and agreements (including contracts to purchase) entered into (or substantially modified after) October 8, 1990.
(i)
Stock sold “ex-dividend.”
In any case where a dividend is declared on a share of stock before the decedent's death but payable to stock holders of record on a date after his death and the stock is selling “ex-dividend” on the date of the decedent's death, the amount of the dividend is added to the ex-dividend quotation in determining the fair market value of the stock as of the date of the decedent's death.
(j)
Application of chapter 14.
See section 2701 and the regulations at § 25.2701 of this chapter for special rules for valuing the transfer of an interest in a corporation and for the treatment of unpaid qualified payments at the death of the transferor or an applicable family member. See section 2704(b) and the regulations at § 25.2704-2 of this chapter for special valuation rules involving certain restrictions on liquidation rights created after October 8, 1990.
[T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7312, 39 FR 14948, Apr. 29, 1974; T.D. 7327, 39 FR 35354, Oct. 1, 1974; T.D. 7432, 41 FR 38769, Sept. 13, 1976; T.D. 8395, 57 FR 4254, Feb. 4, 1992]
§ 20.2031-3
Valuation of interests in businesses.
The fair market value of any interest of a decedent in a business, whether a partnership or a proprietorship, is the net amount which a willing purchaser whether an individual or a corporation, would pay for the interest to a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The net value is determined on the basis of all relevant factors including—
(a) A fair appraisal as of the applicable valuation date of all the assets of the business, tangible and intangible, including good will;
(b) The demonstrated earning capacity of the business; and
(c) The other factors set forth in paragraphs (f) and (h) of § 20.2031-2 relating to the valuation of corporate stock, to the extent applicable.
Special attention should be given to determining an adequate value of the good will of the business in all cases in which the decedent has not agreed, for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth, that his interest passes at his death to, for example, his surviving partner or partners. Complete financial and other data upon which the valuation is based should be submitted with the return, including copies of reports of examinations of the business made by accountants, engineers, or any technical experts as of or near the applicable valuation date. See section 2701 and the regulations at § 25.2701 of this chapter for special rules for valuing the transfer of an interest in a partnership and for the treatment of unpaid qualified payments at the death of the transferor or an applicable family member. See section 2703 and the regulations at § 25.2703 of this chapter for special rules involving options and agreements (including contracts to purchase) entered into (or substantially modified after) October 8, 1990. See section 2704(b) and the regulations
at § 25.2704-2 of this chapter for special valuation rules involving certain restrictions on liquidation rights created after October 8, 1990.
[T.D. 8395, 57 FR 4254, Feb. 4, 1992]
§ 20.2031-4
Valuation of notes.
The fair market value of notes, secured or unsecured, is presumed to be the amount of unpaid principal, plus interest accrued to the date of death, unless the executor establishes that the value is lower or that the notes are worthless. However, items of interest shall be separately stated on the estate tax return. If not returned at face value, plus accrued interest, satisfactory evidence must be submitted that the note is worth less than the unpaid amount (because of the interest rate, date of maturity, or other cause), or that the note is uncollectible, either in whole or in part (by reason of the insolvency of the party or parties liable, or for other cause), and that any property pledged or mortgaged as security is insufficient to satisfy the obligation.
§ 20.2031-5
Valuation of cash on hand or on deposit.
The amount of cash belonging to the decedent at the date of his death, whether in his possession or in the possession of another, or deposited with a bank, is included in the decedent's gross estate. If bank checks outstanding at the time of the decedent's death and given in discharge of bona fide legal obligations of the decedent incurred for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth are subsequently honored by the bank and charged to the decedent's account, the balance remaining in the account may be returned, but only if the obligations are not claimed as deductions from the gross estate.
§ 20.2031-6
Valuation of household and personal effects.
(a)
General rule.
The fair market value of the decedent's household and personal effects is the price which a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. A room by room itemization of household and personal effects is desirable. All the articles should be named specifically, except that a number of articles contained in the same room, none of which has a value in excess of $100, may be grouped. A separate value should be given for each article named. In lieu of an itemized list, the executor may furnish a written statement, containing a declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury, setting forth the aggregate value as appraised by a competent appraiser or appraisers of recognized standing and ability, or by a dealer or dealers in the class of personalty involved.
(b)
Special rule in cases involving a substantial amount of valuable articles.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if there are included among the household and personal effects articles having marked artistic or intrinsic value of a total value in excess of $3,000 (e.g., jewelry, furs, silverware, paintings, etchings, engravings, antiques, books, statuary, vases, oriental rugs, coin or stamp collections), the appraisal of an expert or experts, under oath, shall be filed with the return. The appraisal shall be accompanied by a written statement of the executor containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury as to the completeness of the itemized list of such property and as to the disinterested character and the qualifications of the appraiser or appraisers.
(c)
Disposition of household effects prior to investigation.
If it is desired to effect distribution or sale of any portion of the household or personal effects of the decedent in advance of an investigation by an officer of the Internal Revenue Service, information to that effect shall be given to the district director. The statement to the district director shall be accompanied by an appraisal of such property, under oath, and by a written statement of the executor, containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, regarding the completeness of the list of such property and the qualifications of the appraiser, as heretofore described. If a personal inspection by an officer of the Internal Revenue Service is not deemed necessary, the executor will be so advised. This procedure is designed to facilitate disposition of such
property and to obviate future expense and inconvenience to the estate by affording the district director an opportunity to make an investigation should one be deemed necessary prior to sale or distribution.
(d)
Additional rules if an appraisal involved.
If, pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, expert appraisers are employed, care should be taken to see that they are reputable and of recognized competency to appraise the particular class of property involved. In the appraisal, books in sets by standard authors should be listed in separate groups. In listing paintings having artistic value, the size, subject, and artist's name should be stated. In the case of oriental rugs, the size, make, and general condition should be given. Sets of silverware should be listed in separate groups. Groups or individuals pieces of silverware should be weighed and the weights given in troy ounces. In arriving at the value of silverware, the appraisers should take into consideration its antiquity, utility, desirability, condition, and obsolescence.
§ 20.2031-7
Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and § 20.7520-3(b) (pertaining to certain limitations on the use of prescribed tables), the fair market value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversionary interests for estates of decedents is the present value of such interests, determined under paragraph (d) of this section. The regulations in this and in related sections provide tables with standard actuarial factors and examples that illustrate how to use the tables to compute the present value of ordinary annuity, life, and remainder interests in property. These sections also refer to standard and special actuarial factors that may be necessary to compute the present value of similar interests in more unusual fact situations.
(b)
Commercial annuities and insurance contracts.
The value of annuities issued by companies regularly engaged in their sale, and of insurance policies on the lives of persons other than the decedent, is determined under § 20.2031-8. See § 20.2042-1 with respect to insurance policies on the decedent's life.
(c)
Actuarial valuations.
The present value of annuities, interests for life or a term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is on or after June 1, 2023, is determined under paragraph (d) of this section. The present value of annuities, interests for life or a term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is before June 1, 2023, is determined (subject to paragraph (d)(3) of this section) under the following sections:

In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and § 20.7520-3(b) (pertaining to certain limitations on the use of prescribed tables), if the valuation date for the gross estate of the decedent is on or after June 1, 2023, the fair market value of annuities, interests for life or a term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests is the present value determined by using standard or special section 7520 actuarial factors. Many of these standard factors are derived by using the actuarial formulas provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the appropriate section 7520 interest rate, and, if applicable, the mortality component for the valuation date of the interest that is being valued. For purposes of the computations described in this section, the age of an individual is the age of that individual at the individual's nearest birthday. For the convenience of taxpayers, paragraph (d)(2) of this section
provides for published tables of factors for specific types of interests. These published tables provide factors for rates from 0.2 to 20 percent, inclusive, at intervals of two-tenths of one percent. In general, appropriate factors instead may be computed directly from the actuarial formulas provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In some cases, specific examples in this part and IRS publications illustrate approximation methods (for example, interpolation) for obtaining factors when the required valuation rate falls between two listed rates (such as in the case of a pooled income fund's rate of return or a unitrust's adjusted payout rate). Exact methods of obtaining the applicable actuarial factors are allowed, such as through software using the actual rate of return and the actuarial formulas provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, provided that the taxpayer uses at least the same number of decimal places as are provided in the published tables. The approximation method provided in this part, again using at least the same number of decimal places as provided in this part, must be used if more exact methods are not available. See §§ 20.7520-1 through 20.7520-4. The selected method must be applied consistently in valuing all interests in the same property.
(2)
Specific interests
—(i)
Pooled income funds and charitable remainder trusts.
The fair market value of a remainder interest in a pooled income fund, as defined in § 1.642(c)-5 of this chapter, is its value determined under § 1.642(c)-6(e) of this chapter. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder annuity trust, as defined in § 1.664-2(a) of this chapter, is the present value determined under § 1.664-2(c) of this chapter. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust, as defined in § 1.664-3 of this chapter, is its present value determined under § 1.664-4(e) of this chapter. The fair market value of a life interest or an interest for a term of years in a charitable remainder unitrust is the fair market value of the property as of the date of valuation less the fair market value of the remainder interest on that date determined under § 1.664-4(e)(4) and (5) of this chapter.
(ii)
Ordinary remainder and reversionary interests
—(A)
Remainder and reversionary interests for a term of years.
If the interest to be valued is a remainder or reversionary interest to take effect after a definite number of years, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the value of the property by the appropriate remainder factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the stated term). The factor for an ordinary remainder interest following a term certain may be found using the formula in Figure 1 to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) and computing the result to at least six decimal places. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in Table B. Table B can be found on the IRS website at
https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/actuarial-tables
(or a corresponding URL as may be updated from time to time). Table B is referenced and explained in IRS Publication 1457,
Actuarial Valuations Version 4A,
which will be available within a reasonable time after June 1, 2023. The remainder factors from Table B also can be found in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, but only for interest rates from 4.2 to 14 percent, inclusive. For information about obtaining special factors for other situations, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

(B)
Remainder and reversionary interests dependent on the life of one individual.
If the interest to be valued is a remainder or reversionary interest to take effect after the death of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the value of the property by the appropriate remainder factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the age of the measuring life of the life interest that precedes the remainder interest). The factor for an ordinary remainder interest following the death of one individual may be found using the formula in Figure 2 to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) and computing the result to at least five decimal places. The prescribed mortality table is Table 2010CM as set forth in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, or for periods before June 1, 2023, the appropriate table found in § 20.2031-7A. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in Table S. Table S currently is available, at no charge, electronically via the IRS website at
https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/actuarial-tables
(or a corresponding URL as may be updated from time to time). Table S is referenced and explained by IRS Publication 1457,

(iii)
Ordinary interests for a term of years and ordinary interests for life.
If the interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive the income of certain property, or to the use of certain property, for a term of years or for the life of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the value of the property by the appropriate actuarial factor for an interest for a term of years or for a life (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the durational period). The actuarial factor for an ordinary income interest for a term certain may be found by subtracting from 1.000000 the factor for an ordinary remainder interest following the same term certain that is determined under the formula in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in the “Income Interest” column of Table B which can be found on the IRS website at
https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/actuarial-tables
(or a corresponding URL as may be updated from time to time). The actuarial factor for an ordinary income interest for the life of one individual may be found by subtracting from 1.00000 the factor for an ordinary remainder interest following the life of the same individual that is determined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in the “Life Estate” column of Table S. Table S (applicable when the valuation date is on or after June 1, 2023) can be found on the IRS website at
https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/actuarial-tables
. Tables B and S are referenced and explained by IRS Publication 1457,
Actuarial Valuations Version 4A
. See § 20.2031-7A or earlier versions of Publication 1457 for valuation of interests before June 1, 2023. For information about obtaining special factors for other situations, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(iv)
Annuities.
(A) If the interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive an annuity that is payable at the end of each year for a term of years or for the life of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the aggregate amount payable annually by the appropriate annuity factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and annuity period). The appropriate annuity factor for an annuity payable for a term of years is computed by subtracting from 1.000000 the factor for an ordinary remainder interest following the same term certain that is determined under the formula in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and then dividing the result by the applicable section 7520 interest rate expressed to at least four decimal places. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in the “Annuity” column of Table B which can be found on the IRS website at
https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/actuarial-tables
(or a corresponding URL as may be updated from time to time). The appropriate annuity factor for an annuity payable for the life of one individual is computed by subtracting from 1.00000 the factor for an ordinary remainder interest following the life of the same individual that is determined under the formula in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section and then dividing the result by the applicable section 7520 interest rate expressed to at least four decimal places. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in the “Annuity” column of Table S. Table S (applicable when the valuation date is on or after June 1, 2023) can be found on the IRS website at
https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/actuarial-tables
. Tables B and S are referenced and explained in IRS Publication 1457,
Actuarial Valuations Version 4A
. See § 20.2031-7A or earlier versions of Publication 1457 for valuation of interests before June 1, 2023. For information about obtaining special factors for other situations, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(B) If the annuity is payable at the end of semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods, the product obtained by multiplying the annuity factor by the aggregate amount payable annually is then multiplied by the applicable adjustment factor at the appropriate interest rate component for payments made at the end of the specified periods. The applicable adjustment factor may be found using the formula
in Figure 3 to this paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) and calculating the result to at least four decimal places. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in Table K. Table K, which is referenced and explained by Publication 1457, can be found on the IRS website at
https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/actuarial-tables
. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) are illustrated by the example in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B)(

Example.
At the time of the decedent's death, the survivor/annuitant, age 75, is entitled to receive an annuity of $15,000 per year for life payable in equal monthly installments at the end of each month. The section 7520 rate for the month in which the decedent died is 3.2 percent. Under Table S, the annuity factor at 3.2 percent for an individual aged 75 is 9.4053. Under Table K, the adjustment factor under the column for payments made at the end of each monthly period at the rate of 3.2 percent is 1.0146. The aggregate annual amount, $15,000, is multiplied by the factor 9.4053 and the product then is multiplied by 1.0146. The present value of the annuity at the date of the decedent's death is, therefore, $143,139.26 ($15,000 × 9.4053 × 1.0146).
(C) If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for a term of years, the value of the annuity is computed by multiplying the aggregate amount payable annually by the annuity factor described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section; and the product so obtained then is multiplied by the applicable adjustment factor at the appropriate interest rate component for payments made at the beginning of specified periods. The applicable adjustment factor may be found using the formula in Figure 4 to this paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(C) and calculating
the result to at least four decimal places. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in Table J. Table J, which is referenced and explained by Publication 1457, can be found on the IRS website at
https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/actuarial-tables
. If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for one or more lives, the value of the annuity is the sum of the first payment plus the present value of a similar annuity, the first payment of which is not to be made until the end of the payment period, determined as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.

Annuity and unitrust interests for a term of years or until the prior death of an individual.
See § 25.2512-5(d)(2)(v) of this chapter for examples explaining how to compute the present value of an annuity or unitrust interest that is payable until the earlier of the lapse of a term of years or the death of an individual.
(3)
Transitional rule.
If a decedent dies after April 30, 2019, and on or before June 1, 2023, the fair market value of annuities, interests for life or a term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests based on one or more measuring lives included in the gross estate of the decedent is their present value determined under this section by using the section 7520 interest rate for the month in which the valuation date occurs (see §§ 20.7520-1(b) and 20.7520-2(a)(2)) and factors derived from the selected mortality table, either Table 2010CM in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section or Table 2000CM in § 20.2031-7A(g)(4), at the option of the donor or the decedent's executor, as the case may be. If any previously filed estate tax return is supplemented to use the actuarial factors based on Table 2010CM, the supplemental return must state at the top “AMENDED PURSUANT TO TD 9974.” For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors based on Table 2010CM appear in the current version of Table S, and actuarial factors based on Table 2000CM appear in the previous version of Table S. Both versions of Table S will be available as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The decedent's executor must consistently use the same mortality basis with respect to each interest (income, remainder, partial, etc.) in the same property, and with respect to all transfers occurring on the same valuation date. For example, gift and income tax charitable deductions with respect to the same transfer must be determined based on factors with the same mortality basis, and all assets includible in the gross estate and/or estate tax deductions claimed must be valued based on factors with the same mortality basis.

Publications and actuarial computations by the Internal Revenue Service.
The factor for determining the present value of a remainder interest that is dependent on the termination of the life of one individual may be computed by using the formula in paragraph
(d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to derive a remainder factor from the appropriate mortality table expressed to at least five decimal places. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in Table S. The remainder factor for determining the present value of a remainder interest following a term certain may be computed by using the formula in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section expressed to at least six decimal places. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in Table B. Adjustment factors for term certain annuities payable at the beginning of each interval may be computed by using the formula in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(C) of this section expressed to at least four decimal places. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in Table J. Adjustment factors for annuities payable at the end of each interval may be computed by using the formula in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section expressed to at least four decimal places. For the convenience of taxpayers, actuarial factors have been computed by the IRS and appear in Table K. These tables currently are available, at no charge, electronically via the IRS website at
https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/actuarial-tables
(or a corresponding URL as may be updated from time to time). IRS Publication 1457,
Actuarial Valuations Version 4A
(2023), references and explains the factors contained in the actuarial tables and also includes examples that illustrate how to compute many special factors for more unusual situations. This publication will be available within a reasonable time after June 1, 2023. Tables B, J, and K also can be found in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, but only for interest rates from 4.2 to 14 percent, inclusive. If a special factor is required in the case of an actual decedent, the special factor may be calculated by the executor using the actuarial formulas in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or the executor may request a ruling to obtain the factor from the Internal Revenue Service. The request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts including a statement of the date of birth for each measuring life, the date of the decedent's death, any other applicable dates, and a copy of the will, trust, or other relevant documents. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see §§ 601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) and must include payment of the required user fee.

Example 1: Remainder payable at an individual's death.
The decedent, or the decedent's estate, was entitled to receive certain property worth $50,000 upon the death of A, to whom the income was bequeathed for life. At the time of the decedent's death, A was 65 years and 5 months old. In the month in which the decedent died, the section 7520 rate was 4.6 percent. Under Table S, the remainder factor at 4.6 percent for determining the present value of the remainder interest due at the death of a person aged 65, A's age at A's nearest birthday to the date of the decedent's death, is 0.45862. The present value of the remainder interest at the date of the decedent's death is, therefore, $22,931 ($50,000 times 0.45862).
(ii)
Example 2: Income payable for an individual's life.
A's parent bequeathed an income interest in property to A for life, with the remainder interest passing to B at A's death. At the time of the parent's death, the value of the property was $50,000 and A was 30 years and 10 months old. The section 7520 rate at the time of the parent's death was 3.2 percent. Under Table S, the factor at 3.2 percent for determining the present value of the life estate given to a person aged 31, A's age at A's nearest birthday to the date of the decedent's death, is 0.76267. The present value of A's income interest at the time of the parent's death is, therefore, $38,133.50 ($50,000.00 × 0.76267).
(iii)
Example 3: Annuity payable for an individual's life.
A purchased an annuity for the benefit of both A and B. Under the terms of the annuity contract, at A's death, a survivor annuity of $10,000 per year, payable in equal semiannual installments made at the end of each interval is payable to B for life. At A's death, B was 45 years and 7 months old. Also, at A's death, the section 7520 rate was 3.2 percent. Under Table S, the factor at 3.2 percent for determining the present value of an annuity interest payable until the death of a person age 46 (B's age at B's nearest birthday to the date of A's death) is 20.0146. The adjustment factor from Table K at an interest rate of 3.2 percent for semiannual annuity payments made at the end of the period is 1.0079. The present value of the annuity at the date of A's death is, therefore, $201,727.15 ($10,000 × 20.0146 × 1.0079).
(iv)
Example 4: Annuity payable for a term of years.
The decedent, or the decedent's estate, was entitled to receive an annuity of $10,000 per year payable in equal quarterly installments at the end of each quarter throughout a term certain. At the time of the decedent's death, the section 7520 rate was 2.6 percent. A quarterly payment had been made immediately prior to the decedent's death and payments were to continue for 5 more years. Under Table B for the interest rate of 2.6 percent, the factor for the present value of an annuity with a term of 5 years is 4.6325. The adjustment factor from Table K at an interest rate of 2.6 percent for quarterly annuity payments made at the end of the quarter is 1.0097. The present value of the annuity is, therefore, $46,774.35 ($10,000 × 4.6325 × 1.0097).

§ 20.2031-8
Valuation of certain life insurance and annuity contracts; valuation of shares in an open-end investment company.
(a)
Valuation of certain life insurance and annuity contracts.
(1) The value of a contract for the payment of an annuity, or an insurance policy on the life of a person other than the decedent, issued by a company regularly engaged in the selling of contracts of that character is established through the sale by that company of comparable contracts. An annuity payable under a combination annuity contract and life insurance policy on the decedent's life (e.g., a “retirement income” policy with death benefit) under which there was no insurance element at the time of the decedent's death (see paragraph (d) of § 20.2039-1) is treated like a contract for the payment of an annuity for purposes of this section.
(2) As valuation of an insurance policy through sale of comparable contracts is not readily ascertainable when, at the date of the decedent's death, the contract has been in force for some time and further premium payments are to be made, the value may be approximated by adding to the interpolated terminal reserve at the date of the decedent's death the proportionate part of the gross premium last paid before the date of the decedent's death which covers the period extending beyond that date. If, however, because of the unusual nature of the contract such an approximation is not reasonably close to the full value of the contract, this method may not be used.
(3) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In each case involving an insurance contract, it is assumed that there are no accrued dividends or outstanding indebtedness on the contract.

# Example (1).
X purchased from a life insurance company a joint and survivor annuity contract under the terms of which X was to receive payments of $1,200 annually for his life and, upon X's death, his wife was to receive payments of $1,200 annually for her life. Five years after such purchase, when his wife was 50 years of age, X died. The value of the annuity contract at the date of X's death is the amount which the company would
charge for an annuity providing for the payment of $1,200 annually for the life of a female 50 years of age.

# Example (2).
Y died holding the incidents of ownership in a life insurance policy on the life of his wife. The policy was one on which no further payments were to be made to the company (e.g., a single premium policy or a paid-up policy). The value of the insurance policy at the date of Y's death is the amount which the company would charge for a single premium contract of the same specified amount on the life of a person of the age of the insured.

# Example (3).
Z died holding the incidents of ownership in a life insurance policy on the life of his wife. The policy was an ordinary life policy issued nine years and four months prior to Z's death and at a time when Z's wife was 35 years of age. The gross annual premium is $2,811 and the decedent died four months after the last premium due date. The value of the insurance policy at the date of Z's death is computed as follows:
Terminal reserve at end of tenth year
$14,601.00
Terminal reserve at end of ninth year
12,965.00
Increase
1,636.00
One-third of such increase (Z having died four months following the last preceding premium date) is
545.33
Terminal reserve at end of ninth year
12,965.00
Interpolated terminal reserve at date of Z's death
13,510.33
Two-thirds of gross premium (
2/3
× $2,811)
1,874.00
Value of the insurance policy
15,384.33
(b)
Valuation of shares in an open-end investment company.
(1) The fair market value of a share in an open-end investment company (commonly known as a “mutual fund”) is the public redemption price of a share. In the absence of an affirmative showing of the public redemption price in effect at the time of death, the last public redemption price quoted by the company for the date of death shall be presumed to be the applicable public redemption price. If the alternate valuation method under 2032 is elected, the last public redemption price quoted by the company for the alternate valuation date shall be the applicable redemption price. If there is no public redemption price quoted by the company for the applicable valuation date (e.g., the valuation date is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), the fair market value of the mutual fund share is the last public redemption price quoted by the company for the first day preceding the applicable valuation date for which there is a quotation. In any case where a dividend is declared on a share in an open-end investment company before the decedent's death but payable to shareholders of record on a date after his death and the share is quoted “exdividend” on the date of the decedent's death, the amount of the dividend is added to the ex-dividend quotation in determining the fair market value of the share as of the date of the decedent's death. As used in this paragraph, the term “open-end investment company” includes only a company which on the applicable valuation date was engaged in offering its shares to the public in the capacity of an open-end investment company.
(2) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply with respect to estates of decedents dying after August 16, 1954.
[T.D. 6680, 28 FR 10872, Oct. 10, 1963, as amended by T.D. 7319, 39 FR 26723, July 23, 1974]
§ 20.2031-9
Valuation of other property.
The valuation of any property not specifically described in §§ 20.2031-2 to 20.2031-8 is made in accordance with the general principles set forth in § 20.2031-1. For example, a future interest in property not subject to valuation in accordance with the actuarial principles set forth in § 20.2031-7 is to be valued in accordance with the general principles set forth in § 20.2031-1.
§ 20.2032-1
Alternate valuation.
(a)
In general.
In general, section 2032 provides for the valuation of a decedent's gross estate at a date other than the date of the decedent's death. More specifically, if an executor elects the alternate valuation method under section 2032, the property included in the decedent's gross estate on the date of his death is valued as of whichever of the following dates is applicable:
(1) Any property distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of within 6 months (1 year, if the decedent died on or before December 31, 1970) after the decedent's death is valued as of the date on which it is first distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of;
(2) Any property not distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed
of within 6 months (1 year, if the decedent died on or before December 31, 1970) after the decedent's death is valued as of the date 6 months (1 year, if the decedent died on or before December 31, 1970) after the date of the decedent's death;
(3) Any property, interest, or estate which is affected by mere lapse of time is valued as of the date of the decedent's death, but adjusted for any difference in its value not due to mere lapse of time as of the date 6 months (1 year, if the decedent died on or before December 31, 1970) after the decedent's death, or as of the date of its distribution, sale, exchange, or other disposition, whichever date first occurs.
(b)
Method and effect of election
—(1)
In general.
The election to use the alternate valuation method is made on the return of tax imposed by section 2001. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term
return of tax imposed by section 2001
means the last estate tax return filed by the executor on or before the due date of the return (including extensions of time to file actually granted) or, if a timely return is not filed, the first estate tax return filed by the executor after the due date, provided the return is filed no later than 1 year after the due date (including extensions of time to file actually granted). Once the election is made, it is irrevocable, provided that an election may be revoked on a subsequent return filed on or before the due date of the return (including extensions of time to file actually granted). The election may be made only if it will decrease both the value of the gross estate and the sum (reduced by allowable credits) of the estate tax and the generation-skipping transfer tax payable by reason of the decedent's death with respect to the property includible in the decedent's gross estate. If the election is made, the alternate valuation method applies to all property included in the gross estate and cannot be applied to only a portion of the property.
(2)
Protective election.
If, based on the return of tax as filed, use of the alternate valuation method would not result in a decrease in both the value of the gross estate and the sum (reduced by allowable credits) of the estate tax and the generation-skipping transfer tax liability payable by reason of the decedent's death with respect to the property includible in the decedent's gross estate, a protective election may be made to use the alternate valuation method if it is subsequently determined that such a decrease would occur. A protective election is made on the return of tax imposed by section 2001. The protective election is irrevocable as of the due date of the return (including extensions of time actually granted). The protective election becomes effective on the date on which it is determined that use of the alternate valuation method would result in a decrease in both the value of the gross estate and in the sum (reduced by allowable credits) of the estate tax and generation-skipping transfer tax liability payable by reason of the decedent's death with respect to the property includible in the decedent's gross estate.
(3)
Requests for extension of time to make the election.
A request for an extension of time to make the election or protective election pursuant to §§ 301.9100-1 and 301.9100-3 of this chapter will not be granted unless the return of tax imposed by section 2001 is filed no later than 1 year after the due date of the return (including extensions of time actually granted).
(c)
Meaning of “distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of”.
(1) The phrase “distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of” comprehends all possible ways by which property ceases to form a part of the gross estate. For example, money on hand at the date of the decedent's death which is thereafter used in the payment of funeral expenses, or which is thereafter invested, falls within the term “otherwise disposed of.” The term also includes the surrender of a stock certificate for corporate assets in complete or partial liquidation of a corporation pursuant to section 331. The term does not, however, extend to transactions which are mere changes in form. Thus, it does not include a transfer of assets to a corporation in exchange for its stock in a transaction with respect to which no gain or loss would be recognizable for income tax purposes under section 351. Nor does it
include an exchange of stock or securities in a corporation for stock or securities in the same corporation or another corporation in a transaction, such as a merger, recapitalization, reorganization or other transaction described in section 368 (a) or 355, with respect to which no gain or loss is recognizable for income tax purposes under section 354 or 355.
(2) Property may be “distributed” either by the executor, or by a trustee of property included in the gross estate under section 2035 through 2038, or section 2041. Property is considered as “distributed” upon the first to occur of the following:
(i) The entry of an order or decree of distribution, if the order or decree subsequently becomes final;
(ii) The segregation or separation of the property from the estate or trust so that it becomes unqualifiedly subject to the demand or disposition of the distributee; or
(iii) The actual paying over or delivery of the property to the distributee.
(3) Property may be “sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of” by:
(i) The executor;
(ii) A trustee or other donee to whom the decedent during his lifetime transferred property included in his gross estate under sections 2035 through 2038, or section 2041;
(iii) An heir or devisee to whom title to property passes directly under local law;
(iv) A surviving joint tenant or tenant by the entirety; or
(v) Any other person.
If a binding contract for the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property is entered into, the property is considered as sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of on the effective date of the contract, unless the contract is not subsequently carried out substantially in accordance with its terms. The effective date of a contract is normally the date it is entered into (and not the date it is consummated, or the date legal title to the property passes) unless the contract specifies a different effective date.
(d)
“Included property” and “excluded property”.
