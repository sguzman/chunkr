# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 400.51
Availability of actual production history program.
(a) This subpart is obsolete for the 2024 and succeeding crop years for crops with a contract change date on or after June 30, 2023, and for the 2025 and succeeding crop years for all crops with a contract change date prior to June 30, 2023.
(b) An Actual Production History (APH) Coverage Program is offered under the provisions contained in 7 CFR part 457 and all Special Provisions (as defined in 7 CFR 457.8) thereto unless specifically excluded by the Special Provisions.
(c) The APH program operates within limits prescribed by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501
et seq.
), only on those crops identified in this section in those areas where the actuarial documents provide coverage. Except when in conflict with this subpart, all provisions of the applicable crop insurance contract for these crops apply.
[88 FR 42018, June 29, 2023]
§ 400.52
Definitions.
In addition to the definitions contained in the crop insurance contract, the following definitions apply for the purposes of the APH Coverage Program:
(a)
APH.
Actual Production History.
(b)
Actual yield.
The yield per acre for a crop year calculated from the production records or claims for indemnities. The actual yield is determined by dividing total production (which includes harvested and appraised production) by planted acres for annual crops or by insurable acres for perennial crops.
(c)
Adjusted yield.
The transitional or determined yield reduced by the applicable percentage for lack of records. The adjusted yield will equal 65 percent of the transitional or determined yield, if no producer records are submitted; 80 percent, if records for one year are submitted; and 90 percent, if two years of records are submitted.
(d)
Appraised production.
Production determined by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the FCIC, or a company reinsured by the FCIC, that was unharvested but which reflected the crop's yield potential at the time of the appraisal. For the purpose of APH “appraised production” specifically excludes production lost due to uninsurable causes.
(e)
Approved APH yield.
A yield, calculated and approved by the verifier, used to determine the production guarantee and determined by the sum of the yearly actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted transitional or determined yields divided by the number of yields contained in the database. The database may contain up to 10 consecutive crop years of actual and or assigned yields. At least four yields will always exist in the database.
(f)
Assigned yield.
A yield assigned by FCIC in accordance with the crop insurance contract, if the insured does not file production reports as required by the crop insurance contract. Assigned yields are used in the same manner as actual yields when calculating APH yields except for purposes of the Nonstandard Classification System (NCS).
(g)
Base period.
Ten consecutive crop years (except peaches, which have a five-year base period) immediately preceding the crop year defined in the insurance contract for which the approved APH yield is being established (except for sugarcane, which begins the calendar year preceding the immediate previous crop year defined in the insurance contract).
(h)
Continuous production reports.
Reports submitted by a producer for each crop year that the unit was planted to the crop and for the most recent crop year in the base period.
(i)
Crop year.
Defined in the crop insurance contract, however, for APH purposes the term does not include any year when the crop was not planted or when the crop was prevented from being planted by an insurable cause. For example, if an insured plants acreage in a county to wheat one year, that year is a crop year in accordance with the policy definition. If the land is summerfallowed the next calendar year, that calendar year is not a crop year for the purpose of APH.
(j)
Database.
A minimum of four years up to a maximum of ten crop years of production data used to calculate the approved APH yield.
(k)
Determined yield (D-yield).
An estimated year for certain crops, which can be determined by multiplying an average yield for the crop (attained by using data available from The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) or comparable sources) by a percentage established by the FCIC for each county.
(l)
Master yields.
Approved APH yields, for certain crops and counties as initially designated by the FCIC, based on a minimum of four crop years of production records for a crop within a county.
(m)
New producer.
A person who has not been actively engaged in farming for a share of the production of the insured crop for more than two crop years.
(n)
Production report.
A written record showing the insured crop's annual production and used to determine the insured's yield for insurance purposes. The report contains yield history by unit, if applicable, including planted acreage for annual crops, insurable acreage for perennial crops, and harvested and appraised production for the previous crop years. This report must be supported by written verifiable records, measurement of farm stored production, or by other records of production approved by FCIC on an individual basis. Information
contained in a claim for indemnity is considered a production report for the crop year for which the claim was filed.
(o)
Production Reporting Date (PRD).
The PRD is contained in the crop insurance contract and is the last date production reports will be accepted for inclusion in the database for the current crop year.
(p)
Transitional yield (T-Yield).
An estimated yield, for certain crops, generally determined by multiplying the ASCS program yield by a percentage determined by the FCIC for each county and provided on the actuarial table to be used in the APH yield calculation process when less than four consecutive crop years of actual or assigned yields are available.
(q)
Verifiable records.
Contemporaneous records of acreage and production provided by the insured, which may be verified by FCIC through an independent source, and which are used to substantiate the acreage and production that have been reported on the production report.
(r)
Verifier.
A person authorized by the FCIC to calculate approved APH yields.
(s)
Yield variance tables.
Tables for certain crops that indicate unacceptable yield variations and yield trends which will require determination of the APH yield by the FCIC.
§ 400.53
Yield certification and acceptability.
(a) Production reports must be provided to the crop insurance agent no later than the production reporting date for the crop insured.
(1) Production reports must provide an accurate account of planted acreage for annual crops or insurable acres for perennial crops, as well as harvested and appraised production by unit.
(2) The insured must certify the accuracy of the information.
(3) Production reported for more than one crop year must be continuous. A year in which no acreage was planted to the crop on a unit or no acreage was planted to a practice, type, or variety requiring an APH yield will not be considered a break in continuity. Assigned yields, at the discretion of the FCIC, may be used to maintain continuity of yield data of file. Production on uninsured (for those years a crop insurance policy under the Federal Crop Insurance Act is in effect) or uninsurable acreage (for other years of the period) will not be used to determine APH yield unless production from such acreage is commingled with production from insured or insurable acreage.
(b) Production reports and supporting records are subject to audit or review to verify the accuracy of the information certified. Production and supporting records may be reviewed and verified if a claim for indemnity is submitted on the insured crop. The reported yield is subject to revision, if needed, so that the claim conforms to the records submitted at that time.
(1) Inaccurate production reports or failure to retain acceptable records shall result in the verifier combining optional farm units and recomputing the approved APH yield. These actions shall be taken at any time after reporting or record discrepancies are identified and may result in reduction of the approved APH yield for any calendar year.
(2) Records must be provided by the insured at the time of an audit, review, or as otherwise requested, to verify that the acreage and production certified are accurate. Records of any other person having shares in the insured crop, which are used by the insured to establish the approved APH yield, must also be provided upon request.
(3) In the event acreage or production data certified by two or more persons sharing in the crop on the same acreage is different, the verifier shall, at the verifier's discretion, determine which acreage and production data, if any, will be used to determine the approved APH yield. If the correct acreage and production cannot be determined, the data submitted will be considered unacceptable by the verifier for APH purposes.
(4) Failure of the producer to report acreage and production completely and accurately may result in voidance of the crop insurance contract, as well as criminal or civil false claims penalties pursuant to applicable Federal criminal or civil statutes.
§ 400.54
Submission and accuracy of production reports.
(a) The insured is solely responsible for the timely submission and certification of accurate, complete production reports to the agent. Production reports must be provided for all planted units.
(b) Records may be requested by the FCIC, or an insurance company reinsured by the FCIC, or by anyone acting on behalf of the FCIC or the insurance company. The insured must provide such records upon request.
(c) The agent will explain the APH Program to insureds and prospective insureds. When necessary, the agent will assist the insured in preparation of production reports. The agent will determine the adjusted or unadjusted transitional or determined yields in accordance with § 400.54(b). The agent will review the production reports and forward them to the verifier, along with any requested and required supporting records for determination of an approved APH yield.
(d) The verifier will determine if the certified production reports are acceptable and calculate the approved APH yield.
§ 400.55
Qualification for actual production history coverage program.
(a) The approved APH yield is calculated from a database containing a minimum of four yields and will be updated each subsequent crop year. The database may contain a maximum of the 10 most recent crop years and may include actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields. T or D-Yields, adjusted or unadjusted, will only occur in the database when there are less than four years of actual and/or assigned yields.
(b) The insured may be required to provide production records to determine the approved APH yield, if production records for the most recent crop year are available. If acceptable records of actual production are provided, the records must be continuous and contain at least the most recent crop year's actual yield.
(1) If no acceptable production records are available, the approved APH yield is the adjusted T or D-Yield (65 percent of T or D-Yield).
(2) If acceptable production records containing information for only the most recent crop year are provided, the three T or D-Yields adjusted by 80 percent will be used to complete the minimum database and calculate the approved APH yield.
(3) If acceptable production records containing information for only the two most recent crop years are provided, the two T or D-Yields adjusted by 90 percent and the two actual yields will be used to complete the database and calculate the approved APH yield.
(4) If acceptable production records containing information for only the three most recent crop years are provided, the three actual yields and one unadjusted T or D-Yield are used to complete the database and calculate the approved APH yield.
(5) When the database contains four or more (up to ten) continuous actual yields, the approved APH yield is a simple average of the actual yields.
(6) New producers may have their approved APH yields based on unadjusted T or D-Yields or a combination of actual and unadjusted T or D-Yields.
(7) Producers who add land or new practice, types and varieties to their farming operations and who do not have available records for the added land, practice, types or varieties may have approved APH yields for the added land, practice, types or varieties that are based on adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields as determined by FCIC.
(8) If the producer's crop is destroyed or if it produces a low actual yield due to insured causes of loss, the resulting average yield may qualify for catastrophic yield adjustment according to FCIC guidelines. APH yields qualifying for catastrophic yield adjustment may be adjusted to mitigate the effect of catastrophic years. Premium rates for approved APH yields, which are adjusted for catastrophic years, may be based on the producer's APH average yield prior to the catastrophic adjustment or such other basis as determined appropriate by FCIC.
(c) If no insurable acreage of the insured crop is planted for a year, a production report indicating zero planted acreage will maintain the continuity of
production reports for APH record purposes and that calendar year will not be included in the APH yield calculations.
(d) Actual yields calculated from the claim for indemnity will be entered in the database. The resulting average yield will be used to determine the premium rate and approved APH yield, at the discretion of FCIC.
(e) Optional units are not available to an insured who does not provide acceptable production reports for at least the most recent crop year with which to calculate an approved APH yield.
(f) FCIC may determine approved APH yields for designated crops in the following situations:
(1) If less than four years of yield history is certified and T or D-Yields are not provided in the actuarial documents,
(2) If actual yield exceed tolerances specified in yield variance tables, and
(3) For perennial crops:
(i) If significant upward or downward yield trends are indicated;
(ii) If tree or vine damage, or cultural practices will reduce the production level;
(iii) If more than two percent of the trees or vines have been removed within the last two years; or
(iv) If yield trends are evident and yields greater than the average yield are requested by the insured.
(g) APH yields will not be approved the first insurance year on perennial crops until an inspection acceptable to FCIC has been performed and the acreage is accepted for insurance purposes in accordance with the crop insurance contract.
(h) APH Master Yields may be established whenever crop rotation requirements and land leasing practices limit the yield history available. FCIC will establish crops and locations for which Master Yields are available. To qualify, the producer must have at least four recent continuous crop years' annual production reports and must certify the authenticity of the production reports of the insured crop. Master Yields are based on acreage and production history from all acreage of the insured crop in the county in which the operator has shared in the crop's production.
(i) FCIC may use any production report available under the provisions of any crop insurance contract, whether continuous or not, involving the interests of the person's insured crops in determining the approved APH yield.
§ 400.56
Administrative appeal exhaustion.
The insured may appeal the approved APH yield in accordance with the procedures contained in 7 CFR part 400, subpart J. Administrative remedies through the appeal process must be exhausted prior to any action for judicial review. The approved APH yield determined as a result of the appeal process will be the yield applicable to the crop year.

(d) An appellant will have any balance of the days remaining in the 30-day period to appeal to NAD if mediation is concluded without resolution. If a new adverse decision that raises new matters or relies on different grounds is issued as a result of mediation, the participant will have a new 30-day period for appeals to NAD.
(e) An appellant is responsible for contacting the Certified State Mediation Program in States where such mediation program exists. The State mediation program will make all arrangements for the mediation process. A list of Certified State Mediation Programs is available at
http://www.act.fcic.usda.gov.
(f) An appellant is responsible for making all necessary contacts to arrange for mediation in non-certified States or in certified States that are not currently offering mediation on the subject in dispute. An appellant needing mediation in States without a certified mediation program may request mediation by contacting the RSO, which will provide the participant with a list of acceptable mediators.
(g) An appellant may only mediate an adverse decision once.
(h) If the dispute is not completely resolved in mediation, the adverse decision that was the subject of the mediation remains in effect and becomes the adverse decision that is appealable to NAD.

(c) A participant with a contract of insurance reinsured by the Agency may bring suit against the Agency if the suit involves an adverse action in a United States district court after exhaustion of administrative remedies as provided in this section. Nothing in this section can be construed to create privity of contract between the Agency and a participant.

(3) Reconsideration of a good farming practice (GFP) determination will be limited to a closed review of the existing administrative record. The written request must state the basis upon which the insured relies to show that:
(i) The decision was not proper and not made in accordance with applicable program regulations and procedures; or
(ii) The previously provided material facts were not properly considered in such decision.

[62 FR 22876, Apr. 28, 1997]
§ 400.302
Definitions.
Act
means Federal Crop Insurance Act as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501
et seq.
).
Actively engaged in farming
means a person who, in return for a share of profits and losses, makes a contribution to the production of an insurable crop in the form of capital, equipment, land, personal labor, or personal management.
Actual yield
means total harvested production of a crop divided by the number of acres on which the crop was planted. For insured acres, actual yield is the total production to count as defined in the insurance policy, divided by insured acres.
Assigned yield
means units of crop production per acre administratively assigned by the Corporation for the
purpose of determining insurance coverage.
Corporation
means the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.
Cumulative earned premium rate
is the total premium earned for all years in the base period, divided by the total liability for all years in the base period with the result expressed as a percentage.
Cumulative loss ratio
means the ratio of total indemnities to total earned premiums during the base period expressed as a decimal.
Earned premium
means premium earned (both the amount subsidized and the amount paid by the producer, but excluding any amount of the subsidy attributed to the operating and administrative expenses of the insurance provider) for a crop under a policy insured or reinsured by the Corporation.
Earned premium rate
—means premium earned divided by liability and expressed as a percentage.
Entity
—means a person as defined in this subpart other than an individual.
Indemnified loss
means a loss applicable for the policy for any year during the NCS base period for which the total indemnity exceeds the total earned premium. If the person has insurance for the crop in more than one county for any crop year, indemnities and premiums will be accumulated for all counties for each crop year to determine an indemnified loss.
Insurance experience
means earned premiums, indemnities paid (but not including replant payments), and other data for the crop (after applicable adjustments), resulting from all of the insured's crop insurance policies insured or reinsured by the Corporation for one or more crop years and will include all information from all counties in which the person was insured.
Loss ratio
—means the ratio of indemnity to earned premium expressed as a decimal.
NCS
means nonstandard classification system.
NCS base period
means the 10 consecutive crop years (as defined in the crop policy) ending 2 crop years prior to the crop year in which the NCS classification becomes effective for all crops, except those specified on the Special Provisions. For these excepted crops, the NCS base period means the 10 consecutive crop years ending 3 crop years prior to the crop year in which the NCS classification becomes effective. For example: An NCS classification effective for the 1996 crop year against a producer of citrus production in Arizona, California, and Texas, or sugarcane would have a NCS base period that includes the 1984 through 1993 crop years. An NCS classification effective for the 1996 crop year against a producer of all other crops would have a NCS base period that includes the 1985 through 1994 crop years.
Person
—means an individual, partnership, association, corporation, estate, trust, or other legal entity, and whenever applicable, a State or a political subdivision, or agency of a state.
Substantial beneficial interest
—means an interest of 10 percent or more. In determining whether such an interest equals at least 10 percent, all interests which are owned directly or indirectly through such means as ownership of shares in a corporation which owns the interest will be taken into consideration.
[55 FR 32595, Aug. 10, 1990, as amended at 62 FR 22876, Apr. 28, 1997]
§ 400.303
Initial selection criteria.
(a) Nonstandard classification procedures in this subpart initially apply when all of the following insurance experience criteria (including any applicable adjustment in § 400.303(d)) for the crop have been met:
(1) Three (3) or more indemnified losses during the NCS base period;
(2) Cumulative indemnities in the NCS base period that exceed cumulative premiums during the same period by at least $500;
(3) The result of dividing the number of indemnified losses during the NCS base period by the number of years premium is earned for that period equals .30 or greater; and
(4) Either of the following apply:
(i) The natural logarithm of the cumulative earned premium rate multiplied by the square root of the cumulative loss ratio equals 2.00 or greater; or
(ii) Five (5) or more indemnified losses have occurred during the NCS
base period and the cumulative loss ratio equals or exceeds 1.50.
(b) The minimum standards provided in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this section may be increased in a specific county if that county's overall insurance experience for the crop is substantially different from the insurance experience for which the criteria was determined. The increased standard will apply until the conditions requiring the increase no longer apply. Any change in the standards will be contained in the Special Provisions for the crop.
(c) Selection criteria may be applied on the basis of insurance experience of a person, insured acreage, or the combination of both.
(1) Insurance experience of a person will include:
(i) Insurance experience of the person;
(ii) Insurance experience of other insured entities in which the person had substantial beneficial interest if the person was actively engaged in farming of the insured crop by virtue of the person's interest in those insured entities;
(iii) Insurance experience of a spouse and minor children if the person is an individual and the spouse and minor children are considered the same as the individual under § 400.306.
(2) Insurance experience of insured acreage includes all insurance experience during the base period resulting from the production of the insured crop on the acreage.
(3) Where insurance experience is based on a combination of person and insured acreage, the insurance experience will include the experience of the person as defined in paragraph (b) of this section (1) only on the specific insured acreage during the base period.
(d) Insurance experience for the crop will be adjusted, by county and crop year, to discount the effect of indemnities caused by widespread adverse growing conditions. Adjustments are determined as follows:
(1) Determine the average yield for the county using the annual county crop yields for the previous 20 crop years, unless such data is not available;
(2) Determine the normal variability in the average yield for the county, expressed as the standard deviation;
(3) Subtract the result of § 400.303(d)(2) from § 400.303(d)(1);
(4) Divide the annual crop yield for the county for each crop year in the NCS base period by the result of § 400.303(d)(3), the result of which may not exceed 1.0;
(5) Subtract the result of § 400.303(d)(4) for each crop year from 1.0;
(6) Multiply the result of § 400.303(d)(5) by the liability for the crop year; and
(7) Subtract the result of § 400.303(d)(6) from any indemnity for that crop year.
(e) FCIC may substitute the crop yields of a comparable crop in determining § 400.303(d) (1) and (2), or may adjust the average yield or the measurement of normal variability for the county crop, or any combination thereof, to account for trends or unusual variations in production of the county crop or if the availability of yield and loss data for the county crop is limited. Information about how these determinations are made is available by submitting a request to the FCIC Regional Service Office for the producer's area. Alternate methods of determining the effects of adverse growing conditions on insurance experience may be implemented by FCIC if allowed in the Special Provisions.
[55 FR 32595, Aug. 10, 1990, as amended at 62 FR 22876, Apr. 28, 1997]
§ 400.304
Nonstandard Classification determinations.
(a) Nonstandard Classification determinations can affect a change in assigned yields, premium rates, or both from those otherwise prescribed by the insurance actuarial tables.
(b) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of insured acreage (or of a person on specific insured acreage) will be based on the simple average of available actual yields from the insured acreage during the base period.
(c) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of a person without regard to any specific insured
acreage will be determined by an assigned yield factor calculated by multiplying excess loss cost ratio by loss frequency and subtracting that product from 1.00 where:
(1) Excess loss cost ratio is total indemnities divided by total liabilities for all years of insurance experience in the base period and the result of which is then reduced by the cumulative earned premium rate, expressed as a decimal, and
(2) Loss frequency is the number of crop years in which an indemnity was paid divided by the number of crop years in which premiums were earned during the base period.
(d) Changes of premium rates will be made to reflect premium rates that would have resulted in insurance experience during the base period with a loss ratio of 1.00 but:
(1) A higher loss ratio than 1.00 may be used for premium rate determinations provided that the higher loss ratio is applied uniformly in a county; and
(2) If a Nonstandard Classification change has been made to current assigned yields, insurance experience during the base period will be adjusted to reflect the affects of changed assigned yields before changes of premium rates are calculated based on that experience.
(e) Once selection criteria have been met in any year, Nonstandard Classification adjustments will be made from year to year until no further changes are necessary in assigned yields or premium rates under the conditions set forth in § 400.304(f). In determining whether further changes are necessary, the eligibility criteria will be recomputed each subsequent year using the premium rates and yields which would have been applicable had this part not been in effect.
(f) Nonstandard Classification changes will not be made that:
(1) Increase assigned yields or decrease premium rates from those otherwise assigned by the actuarial tables, or
(2) Result in less than a 10 percent decrease in assigned yields or less than a 10 percent increase in premium rates from those otherwise assigned by the actuarial tables.
§ 400.305
Assignment of Nonstandard Classifications.
(a) Assignment of a Nonstandard Classification of assigned yields, assigned yield factors, or premium rates shall be made on forms approved by the Corporation and included in the actuarial tables for the county.
(b) Nonstandard classification assignment will be made each year, for the year identified on the assignment forms, and are not subject to change under the provisions of this subpart by the Corporation for that year when included in the actuarial tables for the county, except as a result of a request for reconsideration as provided in section 400.309, or as the result of appeals under 7 CFR part 11.
(c) A nonstandard classification may be assigned to identified insurable acreage; a person; or to a combination of person and identified acreage for a crop or crop practice, type, variety, or crop option or amendment whereby:
(1) Classifications assigned to identified insurable acreage apply to all acres of the insured crop grown on the identified acreage;
(2) Classifications assigned to a person apply to all insurable acres of the insured crop on which the person and any entity in which the person has substantial beneficial interest is actively engaged in farming; and
(3) Classifications assigned to a combination of a person and identified insurable acreage will only apply to those acres of the insured crop grown on the identified acreage on which the named person is actively engaged in producing such crop.
[55 FR 32595, Aug. 10, 1990, as amended at 62 FR 22877, Apr. 28, 1997]
§ 400.306
Spouses and minor children.
(a) The spouse and minor children of an individual are considered to be the same as the individual for purposes of this subpart except that:
(1) The spouse who was actively engaged in farming in a separate farming operation prior to their marriage will be a separate person with respect to that separate farming operation so long as that operation remains separate and distinct from any farming operation conducted by the other spouse;
(2) A minor child who is actively engaged in farming in a separate farming operation will be a separate person with respect to that separate farming operation if:
(i) The parent or other entity in which the parent has a substantial beneficial interest does not have any interest in the minor's separate farming operation or in any production from such operation;
(ii) The minor has established and maintains a separate household from the parent;
(iii) The minor personally carries out the farming activities with respect to the minor's farming operation; and
(iv) The minor establishes separate accounting and recordkeeping for the minor's farming operation.
(b) An individual shall be considered to be a minor until the age of 18 is reached. Court proceedings conferring majority on an individual under 18 years of age will not change such individual's status as a minor.
§ 400.307
Discontinuance of participation.
If the person has discontinued participation in the crop insurance program, the person will still be included on the NCS list in the county until the person has discontinued participation as a policyholder or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in a policyholder for at least 10 consecutive crop years. The most recent nonstandard classification assigned will be continued from year to year until participation has been renewed for at least one crop year and at least three years of insurance experience have occurred in the current base period. A nonstandard classification will no longer be applicable to the person or the person on identified acreage if the Corporation determines the person is deceased.
[62 FR 22877, Apr. 28, 1997]
§ 400.308
Notice of Nonstandard Classification.
(a) The Corporation will give written notice to all persons to whom a Nonstandard Classification will be assigned. The notice will give the Nonstandard Classification and the person's rights and responsibilities according to this subpart.
(b) The person, upon receiving notice from the Corporation, will be responsible for giving notice of the Nonstandard Classification to any other person with an insurable interest affected by the classification. The person will give notice to any other affected person:
(1) Prior to the sales closing date if the other affected person has an established insurable interest at the time the classified person is notified by the Corporation; or
(2) Prior to the Classified person's establishing an insurable interest of another person that will be affected by the classification.
§ 400.309
Requests for reconsideration.
(a) Any person to be assigned a nonstandard classification under this subpart will be notified of and allowed not less that 30 days from the date notice is received to request reconsideration before the nonstandard classification becomes effective. The request will be considered to have been made when received, in writing, by the Corporation.
(b) Upon receipt of a timely request for reconsideration from the person to whom the classification will be assigned, the Corporation will:
(1) Review all information supplied by, and respond to all questions raised by the individual, or
(2) In the absence of information and questions, review insurance experience and determinations for compliance with this subpart and report review results to the individual requesting reconsideration.
(c) Upon review of a request for reconsideration, the classification to be assigned will be corrected for:
(1) Errors and omissions in insurance experience;
(2) Incorrect calculations under procedures in this subpart, and
(3) Typographical errors.
(d) If the review finds no cause for change, the classification will be assigned and placed on file in the actuarial tables for the county.
(e) Any person not satisfied by a determination of the Corporation upon
reconsideration may further appeal under the provisions of 7 CFR part 11.

(d) This rule is applicable to any violation occurring on and after January 20, 2009.
(e) The purpose of the remedial actions authorized in this subpart are for

However, if there is no monetary loss, disqualification will only be imposed if the violation is material in accordance with § 400.454(c).
(b) Disqualification and civil fines may be imposed on any participant or person who willfully and intentionally:
(1) Provides any false or inaccurate information to FCIC or to any approved insurance provider with respect to a policy or plan of insurance authorized under the Act either through action or omission to act when there is knowledge that false or inaccurate information is or will be provided; or
(2) Fails to comply with a requirement of FCIC.
(c) When imposing any disqualification or civil fine:
(1) The gravity of the violation must be considered when determining:

(ii) The amount of time that a participant or other person should be disqualified;
(iii) Whether to impose a civil fine; and

(iii) Whether and to what extent the person planned, initiated, or carried out the violation;
(iv) Whether the person has accepted responsibility for the violation and recognizes the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for disqualification or civil fine;
(v) Whether the person has paid all civil and administrative liabilities for the violation;

when such conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the violation is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.
(2) The conduct of any organization in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, knows, or had reason to know of such conduct.
(3) The conduct of one organization in violation of § 400.454(b) may be imputed to another organization when such conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct.

(iv) Continuing to make payments to a disqualified person to fulfill pre-existing contractual or statutory obligations after the business relationship is terminated will not be considered as doing business with a disqualified person unless such payment is used as a means to circumvent the disqualification process.
(f) With respect to civil fines:
(1) A civil fine may be imposed for each violation.
(2) The amount of such civil fine shall not exceed the maximum amount specified in 7 CFR 3.91 (b)(7).

Approved insurance provider.
A private insurance company, including its agents, that has been approved and reinsured by FCIC to provide insurance coverage to producers participating in the Federal crop insurance program.
Approved yield.
The actual production history (APH) yield, calculated and approved by the verifier, used to determine the production guarantee by summing the yearly actual, assigned, adjusted or unadjusted transitional yields and dividing the sum by the number of yields contained in the database, which will always contain at least four yields. The database may contain up to 10 consecutive crop years of actual or assigned yields. The approved yield may have yield adjustments elected under applicable policy provisions, or other limitations according to FCIC approved procedures applied when calculating the approved yield.
Catastrophic risk protection.
The minimum level of coverage offered by FCIC which is required before a person may qualify for certain other USDA program benefits unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop. For the 1995 through 1998 crop years, such coverage will offer protection equal to fifty percent (50%) of the approved yield indemnified at sixty percent (60%) of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage as established by FCIC. For the 1999 and subsequent crop years, such coverage will offer protection equal to fifty percent (50%) of the approved yield indemnified at fifty-five

Expected market price.
(price election) The price per unit of production (or other basis as determined by FCIC) anticipated during the period the insured crop normally is marketed by producers. This price will be set by FCIC before the sales closing date for the crop.

FCIC.
The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, a wholly owned Government Corporation within USDA.
FSA.
The Farm Service Agency, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture or any successor agency.
Insurable interest.
The value of the producer's interest in the crop that is at risk from an insurable cause of loss during the insurance period. The maximum indemnity payable to the producer may not exceed the indemnity due on the producer's insurable interest at the time of loss.
Intended crop.
A crop stated on the application as submitted on or before the sales closing date for the crop which the producer intended to plant in the crop year for which application is made.
Linkage requirement.
The legal requirement that a producer must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection coverage for any crop of economic significance as a condition of receiving benefits for such crop from certain other USDA programs in accordance with § 400.655, unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.

§ 400.652
Insurance availability.
(a) If sufficient actuarial data are available, FCIC will offer catastrophic risk protection, and additional coverage plans of insurance to indemnify persons for FCIC insured or reinsured crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if the crop loss or prevented planting is due to an insured cause of loss specified in the applicable crop insurance policy.
(b) Catastrophic risk protection coverage may be offered through approved insurance providers and through local offices of the Farm Service Agency specified by the Secretary. Additional coverage will only be offered through approved insurance providers unless there is not a sufficient number of approved insurance providers that offer such insurance within a service area.
(c) A person must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection for the crop on all insurable acreage in the county in which the person has a share on or before the sales closing date designated
by FCIC for the crop in the county in order to satisfy the linkage requirements unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.
(d) For additional coverage, in areas where insurance is not available for a particular agricultural commodity that is insurable elsewhere, FCIC may enter into a written agreement with a person to insure the commodity, provided that the person has actuarially sound data relating to the production of the commodity that is acceptable to FCIC and that such written agreement is specifically allowed by the crop insurance regulations applicable to the crop.
(e) Failure to comply with all provisions of the policy constitutes a breach of contract and may result in ineligibility for certain other farm program benefits for that crop year and any benefit already received must be refunded. If a producer breaches the insurance contract, the execution of a waiver of eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance will not be effective for the crop year in which the breech occurred.

§ 400.653
Determining crops of economic significance.
To be eligible for certain other program benefits under § 400.655 the following conditions will apply with respect to crops of economic significance if the producer does not execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.
(a) If a producer planted a crop of economic significance in the preceding crop year, and does not intend to plant the same crop in the present crop year, the producer does not have to obtain insurance coverage or execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop in the present crop year to comply with the linkage requirements. However, if the producer later decides to plant that crop, the producer will be unable to obtain insurance after the sales closing date and must execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop to be eligible for benefits as specified in § 400.655. Failure to execute such a waiver will require the producer to refund any benefits already received under a program specified in § 400.655.
(b) The producer is initially responsible to determine the crops of economic significance in the county. The insurance provider may assist the producer in making these initial determinations. However, these determinations will not be binding on the insurance provider. To determine the percentage value of each crop:
(1) Multiply the acres planted to the crop times the producer's share, times the approved yield, and times the price;
(2) Add the values of all crops grown by the producer (in the county); and
(3) Divide the value of the specific crop by the result of paragraph (b)(2).
(c) The producer may use the type of price, such as the current local market price, futures price, established price, highest amount of insurance, etc., for the price when calculating the value of each crop, provided that the producer uses the same type of price for all crops in the county.
(d) The producer may be required to justify the calculation and provide adequate records to enable the insurance provider to verify whether a crop is of economic significance.
[61 FR 42975, Aug. 20, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 40742, July 28, 1999]
§ 400.654
Application and acreage report.
(a) To participate in catastrophic risk protection, or additional coverage plans of insurance, a producer must submit an application for insurance on or before the applicable sales closing date.
(b) In order to remain eligible for certain farm programs, as specified in § 400.655, a producer must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection on all crops of economic significance, if catastrophic risk protection is available in the county, unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.
(c) Notwithstanding the requirements of § 400.654(a) that applications for insurance be submitted on or before
the applicable sales closing date, FCIC may permit a producer to insure crops other than those specified on the application under the following conditions:
(1) The producer must be unable to plant the intended crop or it is not practical to replant a failed crop before the final planting date. FCIC will take into consideration marketing windows when determining whether it was not practical to replant.
(2) Conditions must exist to warrant allowing a producer to insure crops other than the intended crop.
(3) The producer must submit an application for the substitute crop on or before the acreage reporting date for the substitute crop and pay any applicable administrative fee. A producer may not substitute a crop that the producer planted in the preceding crop year unless that crop was listed on a timely filed application for the current crop year.
(4) If the producer plants a substitute crop that is a crop of economic significance, the producer must obtain CAT coverage, if available, to comply with the linkage requirements specified in § 400.655. The producer may not substitute a crop under this provision if the producer has signed or intends to sign a waiver for emergency crop loss assistance for the crop year.
(5) The substitute crop must be planted on or before the final planting date or within the late planting period, if applicable, for the substitute crop.
(6) Under no circumstances may a producer submit an application for additional coverage after the sales closing date for the substitute crop.
(d) For all coverages, including catastrophic risk protection, and additional coverages, the producer must file a signed acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date. Any person may sign any document relative to crop insurance coverage on behalf of any other person covered by such a policy, provided that the person has a properly executed power of attorney or other legally sufficient document authorizing such person to sign.
(e) Under catastrophic risk protection, unless the other person with an insurable interest in the crop objects in writing prior to the acreage reporting date and provides a signed acreage report on their own behalf an operator may sign the acreage report for all other persons with an insurable interest in the crop without a power of attorney. All persons with an insurable interest in the crop, and for whom the operator purports to sign and represent, are bound by the information contained in that acreage report.
[61 FR 42975, Aug. 20, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 40742, July 28, 1999; 68 FR 37721, June 25, 2003]
§ 400.655
Eligibility for other program benefits.
The producer must obtain at least catastrophic coverage for each crop of economic significance in the county in which the producer has an insurable share, if insurance is available in the county for the crop, unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop, to be eligible for:
(a) Benefits under the Agricultural Market Transition Act;
(b) Loans or any other USDA provided farm credit, including: guaranteed and direct farm ownership loans, operating loans, and emergency loans under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act provided after October 13, 1994; and
(c) Benefits under the Conservation Reserve Program derived from any new or amended application or contract executed after October 13, 1994.

§ 400.680
Controlled substance.
(a) This section implements section 1764 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) and Chapter 13 of Title 21 requiring the denial of Federal Benefits, including crop insurance, to individuals convicted of controlled substance violations in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual will be ineligible to participate in any program authorized under the Act, as provided in § 400.683, if the individual is convicted under Federal or State law of planting, cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting, or storing a controlled substance in any crop year.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual may, as determined by the court, be ineligible to participate in any program authorized under the Act, as provided in § 400.683, if the person is convicted under Federal or State law of possession of or trafficking in a controlled substance.
§ 400.681
Written payment agreement.
(a) Written payment agreements shall:
(1) Require scheduled installment payments that will allow for full repayment of the debt within the time frame allotted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
(2) Not exceed two years in duration; and
(3) Not be modified, replaced, or consolidated after it has been executed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) To avoid being determined to be ineligible through the execution of a written payment agreement:
(1) For a debt arising from any unpaid premium, administrative fees, or catastrophic risk protection fees:
(i) Only one written payment agreement is permitted per termination date. A written payment agreement may cover multiple crops provided they all have the same termination date; and
(ii) The written payment agreement must be signed by both parties, the debtor and the insurance provider or FCIC, as applicable, on or before the termination date specified in the applicable policy to prevent an ineligible determination for a delinquent debt.
(2) For all other debts, the written payment agreement must be signed by both parties, the debtor and the insurance provider or FCIC, as applicable, on or before the due date specified in the notice to the person of the amount due to prevent an ineligible determination for a delinquent debt.
§ 400.682
Determination and notification.
(a) The insurance provider must send a written notice of the debt to the person, including the time frame in which the debt must be paid, and provide the person with a meaningful opportunity to contest the amount or existence of the debt. Once a debtor has filed bankruptcy and the insurance provider is
formally informed of such through the court or the debtor, no request for payment of the debt can be made, unless approved in writing by the Office of General Counsel. The debtor may be notified of the amount of debt and ineligibility for crop insurance.
(1) The insurance provider shall evaluate the person's response, if any, and determine if the debt is owed and delinquent.
(2) Upon request by FCIC, the insurance provider shall submit all documentation related to the debt to FCIC.
(b) If an insurance provider or any other person has evidence that a person meets criteria set forth in § 400.679(a), (b), (c), (e) or (f), they must immediately notify FCIC.
(c) After the insurance provider determines a person has met one or more of the criteria in § 400.679 and notifies FCIC, FCIC will issue and mail a Notice of Ineligibility to the person's last known address and to the insurance provider. Notices sent to such address will be conclusively presumed to have been received by that person.
(d) The Notice of Ineligibility will state the criteria upon which the determination of ineligibility has been based, a brief statement of the facts to support the determination, the time period of ineligibility, and the right to appeal the determination to be placed on the ITS in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(e) Within 30 days of receiving the Notice of Ineligibility, the ineligible person may appeal FCIC's determination to be placed on ITS to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR part 11. The existence and amount of the debt is determined by the insurance provider, not FCIC; therefore, those determinations are not appealable to the National Appeals Division.
(f) If the person appeals FCIC's determination to be placed on ITS to the National Appeals Division, the insurance provider will be notified and provided with an opportunity to participate in the proceeding, if permitted by 7 CFR part 11.
(g) No later than 60 days after the termination date, a missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of an overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in a notice to the person of an amount due, as applicable, such ineligible person may request consideration for reinstatement from the Administrator, Risk Management Agency, in accordance with section 2 of the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (7 CFR 457.8).
[79 FR 2079, Jan. 13, 2014, as amended at 79 FR 37161, July 1, 2014; 81 FR 42472, June 30, 2016]
§ 400.683
Period of ineligibility.
(a) The beginning of the period of ineligibility will be:
(1) For ineligibility as a result of a delinquent debt, beginning on the date stated in the applicable policy;

(4) For debarment under 7 U.S.C. 2209j, the beginning of the crop year in which the person is convicted.
(b) The duration of the period of ineligibility will be:
(1) For ineligibility as a result of a delinquent debt, until the debt has been paid in full discharged in bankruptcy, or the person has executed a written payment agreement.
(2) For ineligibility as a result of a conviction under Federal or State law of:
(i) Planting, cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting, or storing a controlled substance, four crop years succeeding the crop year in which the person was convicted; and

§ 400.684
Effect of ineligibility.
(a) The effect of ineligibility depends on the basis for the determination.
(1) Persons who are ineligible as a result of a delinquent debt are ineligible for crop insurance authorized under the Act for a certain time period in accordance with § 400.683. Filing for bankruptcy does not make the person eligible for crop insurance or preclude the ineligible person from being placed on the ITS in accordance with § 400.684(b)(1).

(i) Participating in all programs authorized under the Act, including but not limited to:

(4) Individuals who are ineligible because of a conviction of a violation of the controlled substance provisions or are not a United States citizen, United States non-citizen national, or a qualified alien are precluded from participating in any program authorized under the Act indicated in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(5) Persons who are ineligible as a result of a conviction falling under 7 U.S.C. 2209j, are precluded from participating in any program offered by USDA.
(b) Once a person has been determined to be ineligible:
(1) The ineligible person will be placed on the ITS and may be reported to other government agencies, unless the ineligible person is an individual and the sole reason for ineligibility is because the individual is not a United States citizen, United States non-citizen national, or qualified alien.
(2) If the ineligible person is an individual:
(i) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible person is the sole insured will terminate if the person is ineligible for any reason other than a controlled substance violation, or be void if the person is ineligible due to conviction of a controlled substance violation according to § 400.680, and the person will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683; and
(ii) The ineligible person must be reported on all policies in which the ineligible person has a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policy will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible person's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as the ineligible person remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683.
(3) If the ineligible person is a general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture and is ineligible as a result of:
(i) A delinquent debt:
(A) All partners or members of the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture will be ineligible;
(B) The ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture and all partners and members of the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683;
(C) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture is the sole insured will terminate;
(D) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible partner or member is the sole insured will terminate; and
(E) The ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture and all ineligible partners or members must be reported on any other policy in which they have a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policies will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture or the ineligible partners' or members' substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as they remain ineligible in accordance with § 400.683; or
(ii) Meeting the criteria specified in § 400.679(c), (e) or (f):
(A) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture is the sole insured will terminate, and the ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683; and
(B) The ineligible general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture must be reported on any other policy in which it has a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policies will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible general partnership's, limited partnership's, limited liability partnership's, limited liability company's, or joint venture's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as it remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683.
(4) If the ineligible person is an association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity, and is ineligible as a result of:
(i) A delinquent debt:
(A) Any partners, members, shareholders, administrators, executors, trustees, or grantors may be individually ineligible if the delinquent debt occurred as a result of their actions or inactions, as determined by the insurance provider or FCIC;
(B) All policies in which the ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity is the sole insured will terminate, and it will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683.
(C) The ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity must be reported on any other policy in which it has a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policies will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible entity's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as the person remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683;
(D) All policies in which a partner, member, shareholder, administrator, executor, trustee, or grantor determined ineligible according to § 400.684(b)(4)(i)(A) is the sole insured will terminate, and the person will remain ineligible for crop insurance for
the applicable period specified in § 400.683; and
(E) The ineligible partner, member, shareholder, administrator, executor, trustee, or grantor must be reported on any other policy in which they have a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, and the insured share under such policies will be reduced commensurate with the ineligible person's substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured for as long as the person remains ineligible in accordance with § 400.683; or
(ii) Meeting the criteria specified in § 400.679(c), (e) or (f):
(A) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity is the sole insured will terminate, and the ineligible association, estate, trust, corporation, or other similar entity will remain ineligible for crop insurance for the applicable period specified in § 400.683; and

(5) If an applicant or insured is a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, limited partnership, or other similar entity that was created to conceal the interest of an ineligible person or to evade the ineligibility determination of a person with a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured, the policy will be void.
(6) All crop insurance policies in which the ineligible person is insured as landlord/tenant will terminate on the next termination date. The other person(s) on such policy may submit a new application for crop insurance coverage on or before the applicable sales closing date to obtain insurance coverage for the crop, if they are otherwise eligible for such coverage.
(c) The spouse and minor child of an individual insured is considered to be the same as the individual for purposes of this subpart and subject to the same ineligibility, except when:
(1) The individual is ineligible due to a conviction of a controlled substance violation in accordance with § 400.680;
(2) The individual is ineligible as a result of a felony conviction for knowingly defrauding the United States in connection with any program administered by USDA;

(5) The spouse can prove they are legally separated or otherwise legally separate under the applicable State dissolution of marriage laws; or
(6) The minor child has a separate legal interest in such person or is engaged in a separate farming operation from the individual.
(d) Notwithstanding § 400.684(f), when a policy is voided in accordance with this subpart:
(1) No indemnities or payments will be paid for the voided policy;
(2) Any indemnities or payments already made for the voided policy will be declared overpayments and must be repaid in full; and
(3) No premiums will be due and any premium paid will be refunded except when the policy is void due to a conviction of a controlled substance violation according to § 400.680, in which case the insured will still be required to pay 20 percent of the premium the insured would otherwise be required to pay to offset costs in the servicing of the policy.
(e) When the insured share of a policy is reduced in accordance with this subpart:

ineligible under the provisions of this subpart is not eligible for reinsurance by FCIC. All premium subsidies, expenses, or other payments made by FCIC for insurance written for any person who is ineligible under the provisions of this subpart must be immediately refunded to FCIC. However, with regard to policies that would be void due to a conviction of a controlled substance violation according to § 400.680, if the insurance provider follows the procedures of FCIC and the requirements of the regulations, reinsurance will continue to be provided under the reinsurance agreement on the policy unless it is shown that the agent or insurance provider had knowledge of the facts which would indicate ineligibility on the part of the insured and failed to act on that knowledge.
§ 400.685
Criteria for regaining eligibility.
After the period of ineligibility as specified in § 400.683 has ended, the ineligible person is eligible to participate in programs authorized under the Act, provided the person meets all eligibility requirements.
(a) After a person regains eligibility for crop insurance when their policy was terminated or voided, the person must submit a new application for crop insurance coverage on or before the applicable sales closing date to obtain insurance coverage for the crop. If the date of regaining eligibility occurs after the applicable sales closing date for the crop, the person may not participate until the following year unless that crop policy allows for applications to be accepted after the sales closing date.
(b) If a person who was determined ineligible according to this subpart is subsequently determined to be an eligible person for crop insurance through reinstatement, mediation, arbitration, appeal, or judicial review, such person's policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which the producer was determined ineligible, and such person will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided the person meets all eligibility requirements and complies with the terms of the policy.

(3) If at any time prior to the cancellation date, FCIC discovers there is a mistake, error, or flaw in the policy, plan of insurance, their related materials, or the rates of premium, or any other reason for withdrawal of approval contained in § 400.706(k) exists, FCIC will withdraw reinsurance for such policy or plan of insurance to all AIPs for the subsequent crop year (If reinsurance is denied, a written notice will be provided on RMA's Web site at
www.rma.usda.gov
);
(4) If maintenance of the policy or plan of insurance is transferred to FCIC in accordance with § 400.712(l), FCIC will assume liability for the policy or plan of insurance for any mistake, error, or flaw that occur after the date the policy is transferred.
(c) If approval by the Board is withdrawn or reinsurance is denied for any 508(h) submission, RMA will provide such notice on its Web site and the approved insurance provider must cancel the policy or plan of insurance in accordance with its terms.

§ 400.712
Research and development reimbursement, maintenance reimbursement, advance payments for concept proposals, and user fees.
(a) For 508(h) submissions approved by the Board for reinsurance under section 508(h) of the Act:
(1) The 508(h) submission may be eligible for a one-time payment of research and development costs and reimbursement of maintenance costs for up to four reinsurance years, as determined by the Board;
(2) Reimbursement of research and development costs or maintenance costs will be considered as payment in full by FCIC for the 508(h) submission, and no additional amounts will be owed to the applicant if the 508(h) submission is transferred to FCIC in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section; and
(3) If the applicant elects at any time not to continue to maintain the 508(h) submission, it will automatically become the property of FCIC and the applicant will no longer have any property rights to the 508(h) submission and will not receive any user fees for the plan of insurance;
(b) The Board approved procedures and time-frames must be followed, or research and development costs and maintenance costs may not be reimbursed.
(1) After a 508(h) submission has been approved by the Board for reinsurance, to be considered for reimbursement of:
(i) Research and development costs, the applicant must submit the total amount requested and all supporting documentation to FCIC by electronic method or by hard copy and such information must be received by FCIC on or before August 1 immediately following the date the 508(h) submission was released to approved insurance providers through FCIC's issuance system; or
(ii) Maintenance costs, the applicant must submit the total amount requested and all supporting documentation to FCIC by electronic method or by hard copy and such information must be received by FCIC on or before August 1 of each year of the maintenance period.
(2) Given the limitation on funds, regardless of when the request is received, no payment will be made prior to September 15 of the applicable fiscal year.
(c) Applicants submitting a concept proposal may request an advance payment of up to 50 percent of the projected total research and development costs, and after the applicant has begun research and development activities, the Board may, at its sole discretion, provide up to an additional 25 percent advance payment of the estimated research and development costs, if the requirements in the definition of advance payment are met and the additional advance payment is requested in accordance with Procedures Handbook 17030—Approved Procedures for Submission of Concept Proposals Seeking Advance Payment of Research and Development Costs.
(1) If a concept proposal is approved by the Board for advance payment, the applicant is responsible for independently developing a 508(h) submission that is complete as specified in this subpart by the deadline set by the Board.
(i) If an applicant fails to fulfill the obligation to provide a 508(h) submission that is complete by the deadline set by the Board, the Board shall provide a notice of non-compliance to the applicant and allow not less than 30 days for the applicant to respond;
(ii) If the applicant fails to respond, to the satisfaction of the Board, with just cause as to why a 508(h) submission that is complete was not provided by the deadline set by the Board, the applicant shall return the amount of the advance payment plus interest at the rate of 1.25 percent simple interest per calendar month;
(iii) If the applicant responds, to the satisfaction of the Board, with just cause as to why a 508(h) submission that is complete was not provided by the deadline set by the Board, the applicant will be given a new deadline by which to provide a 508(h) submission that is complete; and
(iv) If the applicant fails to provide a 508(h) submission that is complete by the deadline, no additional extensions
will be approved by the Board and the applicant shall return the amount of the advance payment plus interest at the rate of 1.25 percent simple interest per calendar month.
(2) If an applicant receives an advance payment for a portion of the expected research and development costs for a concept proposal that is developed into a 508(h) submission and determined by the Board to be complete, but the 508(h) submission is not approved by the Board following expert review, the Board will not:
(i) Seek a refund of any advance payments for research and development costs; and
(ii) Make any further research and development cost reimbursements associated with the 508(h) submission.
(d) Under section 522 of the Act, there are limited funds available on an annual fiscal year basis to pay for reimbursements of research and development costs (including advance payments for concept proposals) and maintenance costs. Consistent with paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section if all applicants' requests for reimbursement of research and development costs (including advance payments for concept proposals) and maintenance costs in any fiscal year:
(1) Do not exceed the maximum amount authorized by law, the applicants may receive the full amount of reimbursement determined reasonable by the Board; or
(2) Exceed the amount authorized by law, each applicant's reimbursement determined reasonable by the Board will be determined by dividing the total amount of each individual applicant's reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section by the total amount of the aggregate of all applicants' reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (e) through (j) for the year and multiplying the result by the amount of reimbursement authorized under the Act.
(e) The amount of reimbursement for research and development costs and maintenance costs requested by the applicant may be reduced as necessary when the requested amount is not commensurate with the complexity or the size of the area proposed to be covered.
(f) Research and development costs and maintenance costs must be supported by itemized statements and supporting documentation (copies of contracts, billing statements, time sheets, travel vouchers, accounting ledgers, etc.).
(1) Actual costs submitted will be examined for reasonableness and may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the Board.
(2) Allowable research and development costs and maintenance costs (directly related to research and development or maintenance of the 508(h) submission only) may include the following:
(i) Wages and benefits, exclusive of bonuses, overtime pay, or shift differentials;
(A) One line per employee or contractor, include job title, total hours, and total dollars;
(B) The rates charged must be commensurate with the tasks performed (For example, a person performing the task of data entry should not be paid at the rate for performing data analysis);
(C) The wage rate and benefits shall not exceed two times the hourly wage rate plus benefits provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and
(D) The applicant must report any familial or business relationship that exists between the applicant and the contractor or employee (Reimbursement may be limited or denied if the contractor or employee is associated to the applicant and they may be considered as one and the same. This includes a separate entity being created by the applicant to conduct research and development. Reimbursement may be limited or denied if the contractor is paid a salary or other compensation);
(ii) Travel and transportation (One line per event, include the job title, destination, purpose of travel, lodging cost, mileage, air or other identified transportation costs, food and miscellaneous expenses, other costs, and the total cost);
(iii) Software and computer programming developed specifically to determine appropriate rates, prices, or coverage amounts (Identify the item, include the purpose, and provide receipts or contract or straight-time hourly
wage, hours, and total cost. Software developed to send or receive data between the producer, agent, approved insurance provider or RMA or such other similar software may not be included as an allowable cost);
(iv) Miscellaneous expenses such as postage, telephone, express mail, and printing (Identify the item, cost per unit, number of items, and total dollars); and
(v) Training costs expended to facilitate implementation of a new approved 508(h) submission (Include instructor(s) hourly rate, hours, and cost of materials and travel) conducted at a national level, directed to all approved insurance providers interested in selling the 508(h) submission, and approved prior to the training by RMA).
(3) The following expenses are specifically not eligible for research and development and maintenance cost reimbursement:
(i) Copyright fees, patent fees, or any other charges, costs or expenses related to the use of intellectual property;
(ii) Training costs, excluding training costs to facilitate implementation of the approved 508(h) submission in accordance with subsection (f)(2)(v);
(iii) State filing fees and expenses;
(iv) Normal ongoing administrative expenses or indirect overhead costs (for example, costs associated with the management or general functions of an organization, such as costs for internet service, telephone, utilities, and office supplies);
(v) Paid or incurred losses;
(vi) Loss adjustment expenses;
(vii) Sales commission;
(viii) Marketing costs;
(ix) Lobbying costs;
(x) Product or applicant liability resulting from the research, development, preparation or marketing of the policy;
(xi) Copyright infringement claims resulting from the research, development, preparation or marketing of the policy;
(xii) Costs of making program changes as a result of any mistakes, errors or flaws in the policy or plan of insurance;
(xiii) Costs associated with building rents or space allocation;
(xiv) Costs in paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section determined by the Board to be ineligible for reimbursement; and
(xv) Local, State, or Federal taxes.
(g) Requests for reimbursement of maintenance costs must be supported by itemized statements and supporting documentary evidence for each reinsurance year in the maintenance period.
(1) Actual costs submitted will be examined for reasonableness and may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the Board.
(2) Maintenance costs for the following activities may be reimbursed:
(i) Expansion of the original 508(h) submission into additional crops, counties or states;
(ii) Non-significant changes to the policy and any related material;
(iii) Non-significant or significant changes to the policy as necessary to protect program integrity or as required by Congress; and
(iv) Any other activity that qualifies as maintenance.
(h) Projected costs for research and development for concept proposals shall be based on a detailed estimate of the costs allowed in paragraph (f) of this section. Since costs are one measurement of the viability to develop an efficient policy, the Board may limit reimbursements for research and development to the estimated costs contained in the concept proposal, unless the submitter can justify a higher reimbursement in accordance with Board procedures.
(i) If a 508(h) submission is determined to be incomplete and is subsequently resubmitted and approved, the costs to perfect the 508(h) submission may not be considered reimbursable costs depending on the level of insufficiency or incompleteness of the 508(h) submission, as determined at the sole discretion of the Board.
(j) Reimbursement of costs associated with addressing issues raised by the Board, expert reviewers and RMA will be evaluated based on the substance of the issue and the amount of time reasonably necessary to address the specific issue. Delays and additional costs caused by the inability or refusal to adequately address issues may not be considered reimbursable, as
determined at the sole discretion of the Board.
(k) If the Board withdraws its approval for reinsurance at any time during the period that reimbursement for maintenance is being made or user fees are being collected, no maintenance reimbursement shall be made nor any user fee be owed after the date of such withdrawal.
(l) Not later than 180 days prior to the end of the last reinsurance year in which a maintenance reimbursement will be paid for the approved 508(h) submission, the applicant must notify FCIC in writing regarding its decision on future ownership and maintenance of the policy or plan of insurance.
(1) The applicant must notify FCIC in writing whether it intends to:
(i) Continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance and charge approved insurance providers a user fee to cover maintenance expenses for all policies earning premium; or
(ii) Transfer responsibility for maintenance to FCIC.
(2) If the applicant fails to notify FCIC in writing by the deadline, the policy or plan of insurance will automatically transfer to FCIC beginning with the next reinsurance year.
(3) If the applicant elects to:
(i) Continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance, the applicant must submit a request for approval of the user fee by the Board at the time of the election; or
(ii) Transfer the policy or plan of insurance to FCIC, FCIC may at its sole discretion, continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance or elect to withdraw the availability of the policy or plan of insurance.
(4) Requests for approval of the user fee must be accompanied by written documentation to support the amount requested will only cover direct costs to maintain the plan of insurance. Costs that are not eligible for research and development and maintenance reimbursements under this section are not eligible to be considered for determining the user fee.
(5) The Board will approve the amount of user fee, including the maximum amount of total maintenance that may be collected per year, that is payable to the applicant by approved insurance providers unless the Board determines that the user fee charged:
(i) Is unreasonable in relation to the maintenance costs associated with the policy or plan of insurance; or
(ii) Unnecessarily inhibits the use of the policy or plan of insurance by approved insurance providers.
(6) If the total user fee exceeds the maximum amount determined by the Board, the maximum amount determined by the Board will be divided by the number of policies earning premium to determine the amount to be paid by each approved insurance provider.
(7) Reasonableness of the initial request to charge a user fee will be determined by the Board based on a comparison of the amount of reimbursement for maintenance previously received, the number of policies, the number of approved insurance providers, and the expected total amount of user fees to be received in any reinsurance year.
(8) A user fee unnecessarily inhibits the use of a policy or plan of insurance if it is so high that approved insurance providers will not sell the policy, or the user fee represents an unreasonable portion of the A
O subsidy paid to the AIP such that it prevents the AIP from meeting its other obligations under the SRA.
(9) The user fee charged to each approved insurance provider will be considered payment in full for the use of such policy, plan of insurance or rate of premium for the reinsurance year in which payment is made.
(10) It is the sole responsibility of the applicant to collect such fees from an approved insurance provider and any indebtedness for such fees must be resolved by the applicant and approved insurance provider.
(i) Applicants may request that FCIC provide the number of policies sold by each approved insurance provider.
(ii) Such information will be provided not later than 90 days after such request is made or not later than 90 days after the requisite information has been provided to FCIC by the approved insurance provider, whichever is later.
(11) Every two years after approval of a user fee, or if the applicant has made a significant change to the approved
508(h) submission, applicants must submit documentation to the Board for review in determining if the user fee should be revised.
(12) The Board may review the amount of the user fee at any time at its sole discretion.
(m) The Board may consider information from the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Occupational Employment Statistics Survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Employment Cost Index, and any other information determined applicable by the Board, in making a determination whether to approve a 508(h) submission for reimbursement of research and development costs, maintenance costs, or user fees.
(n) For purposes of this section, rights to, or obligations of, research and development cost reimbursement, maintenance cost reimbursement, or user fees cannot be transferred from any individual or entity unless specifically approved in writing by the Board.
(o) Applicants requesting reimbursement for research and development costs, maintenance costs, or user fees, may present their request in person to the Board prior to consideration for approval.
(p) Index-based weather plans of insurance are not eligible for reimbursement from FCIC for maintenance costs or research and development costs. Submitters of approved index-based weather plans of insurance may collect user fees from other approved insurance providers in accordance with Procedures Handbook 17050—Approved Procedures for Submission of Index-based Weather Plans of Insurance.
§ 400.713
Non-reinsured supplemental (NRS) policy.
(a) Unless otherwise specified by FCIC, any NRS policy that covers the same agricultural commodity as any policy reinsured by FCIC under the Act must be provided to RMA to ensure it does not shift any loss or risk that does not exist under the FCIC reinsured policy. Failure to provide such NRS policy or endorsement to RMA prior to its issuance shall result in the denial of reinsurance, A
O subsidy, and risk subsidy on all underlying FCIC reinsured policies unless the underlying FCIC policy was sold by another AIP. If the underlying FCIC reinsured policy is sold by another AIP, the AIP that sold the NRS may be required to pay FCIC an amount equal to the reinsurance, A
O subsidy, and risk subsidy on the underlying FCIC policy.
(b) An electronic copy in Microsoft Office compatible format, of the new or revised NRS policy and related materials must be submitted at least 150 days prior to the first sales closing date applicable to the NRS policy. At a minimum, examples that demonstrate how liability and indemnities are calculated under differing scenarios must be included. Electronic copies of the NRS must be sent to the Deputy Administrator for Product Management (or successor) at
DeputyAdministrator@rma.usda.gov.
(c) RMA will review the NRS policy. If any of the conditions found in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section are found to occur, FCIC will notify the AIP that submitted the NRS policy that if they sell the NRS policy, it will result in denial of reinsurance, A
O subsidy, and risk subsidy on all underlying FCIC reinsured policies, unless the underlying FCIC policy was sold by another AIP. If the underlying FCIC reinsured policy is sold by another AIP, the AIP that sold the NRS may be required to pay FCIC an amount equal to the reinsurance, A
O subsidy, and risk subsidy on the underlying FCIC policy.
(1) If the NRS policy materially increases or shifts risk to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC.
(i) An NRS policy will be considered to materially increase or shift risk to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC if RMA determines it:
(A) Creates a moral hazard, such as a financial incentive for the policyholder to behave in a way that increases the number or size of losses;
(B) Results in the underlying FCIC policy either triggering a loss sooner, or paying a larger indemnity than would otherwise be allowed by the terms and conditions of the underlying reinsured policy; or
(C) Allows for combined indemnities between the underlying FCIC reinsured policy and the NRS that are in excess
of the value a producer would reasonably expect to receive for the insured commodity if a normal crop was produced and sold at a reasonable market price.
(ii) The NRS must include language that clearly states no indemnity will be paid in excess of the initial value of the insured commodity.
(2) The NRS reduces or limits the rights of the insured with respect to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC. An NRS policy will be considered to reduce or limit the rights of the insured with respect to the underlying policy or plan of insurance if RMA determines it affects, alters, preempts, or undermines the terms or conditions of the underlying policy or procedures issued by FCIC.
(3) The NRS disrupts the marketplace. An NRS policy will be considered to disrupt the marketplace if RMA determines it encourages planting more acres of the insured commodity in excess of normal market demand, adversely affects the sales or administration of reinsured policies, undermines producers' confidence in the Federal crop insurance program, or harms public perception of the Federal crop insurance program.
(4) The NRS is an impermissible rebate. An NRS may be considered to be an impermissible rebate if RMA determines that the premium rates charged are insufficient to cover the expected losses and a reasonable reserve or it offers other benefits that are generally provided at a cost.
(5) The NRS policy is conditioned upon or provides incentive for the purchase of the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by FCIC with a specific agent or approved insurance provider.
(d) RMA will respond not less than 75 days before the first sales closing date or provide notice why RMA is unable to respond within the time frame allotted.
(e) NRS policies reviewed by RMA will need to be submitted once every five years unless a change is made to the NRS or the underlying policy. Once any changes are made to either policy, or the five year period has concluded, the NRS must be resubmitted for review.

§ 400.766
Basis and applicability.
(a) The regulations contained in this part prescribe the rules and criteria for obtaining a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation.
(1) FCIC will provide a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation, as applicable, for statutory, regulatory, or other policy provisions or procedures that were in effect during the four most recent crop years from the crop year in which your request was submitted. For example, for a request received in the 2014 crop year, FCIC will consider requests for the 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011 crop years.
(2) If FCIC determines a request is outside the scope of crop years authorized in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you will be notified within 30 days of the date of receipt by FCIC.
(3) If the statutory, regulatory or other policy provisions or procedures have changed for the time period you seek an interpretation you must submit a separate request for each policy provision or procedure by year. For example, if you seek an interpretation of section 6(b) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions for the 2012 through 2015 crop years but the policy provisions were revised starting with the 2014 crop year, you must submit two requests, one for the 2012 and 2013 crop years and another for the 2014 and 2015 crop years.
(b) With respect to a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation:
(1) If there is a dispute between participants that involves a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation:
(i) The parties are required to seek an interpretation of the disputed provision from FCIC in accordance with this subpart (This may require that the parties seek a stay of the proceedings until an interpretation is provided, if such proceedings have been initiated); and
(ii) The final agency determination or FCIC interpretation may take the form of a written interpretation or, at the sole discretion of FCIC, may take the form of testimony from an employee of RMA expressly authorized in writing to provide interpretations of policy or procedure on behalf of FCIC.
(2) All written final agency determinations issued by FCIC are binding on all participants in the Federal crop insurance program for the crop years the policy provisions are in effect. All written FCIC interpretations and testimony from an employee of RMA are binding on the parties to the dispute, including the arbitrator, mediator, judge, or NAD.
(3) Failure to request a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation when required by this subpart or failure of NAD, arbitrator, mediator, or judge to adhere to the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation provided under this subpart will result in the nullification of any award or agreement in arbitration or mediation in accordance with the provisions in the “Mediation, Arbitration, Appeal, Reconsideration, and Administrative and Judicial Review” section or similar section in all crop insurance policies.
(4) If either party believes an award or decision was rendered by NAD, arbitrator, mediator, or judge based on a disputed provision in which there was a failure to request a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation or NAD, arbitrator, mediator, or judge's decision was not in accordance with the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation rendered with respect to the disputed provision, the party may request FCIC review the matter to determine if a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation should have been sought in accordance with § 400.767.
(i) Requests should be submitted through one of the methods contained in § 400.767(a)(1);
(ii) If FCIC determines that a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation should have been sought and it was not, or the decision was not in accordance with the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation rendered with respect to the disputed provision:
(A) The award is automatically nullified; and
(B) Either party may appeal FCIC's determination that a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation
should have been sought and it was not, or the decision was not in accordance with the final agency determination or FCIC interpretation rendered with respect to the disputed provision to NAD in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.
(5) All written final agency determinations that are published on RMA's website are considered matters of general applicability and are not appealable to NAD. Before obtaining judicial review of any final agency determination, you must obtain an Administrative Final Determination from the Director of NAD on the issue of whether the final agency determination is a matter of general applicability.
(6) With respect to an administrative review of a FCIC interpretation:
(i) If either party to the proceeding does not agree with the written FCIC interpretation, a request for administrative review may be filed in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart J. If you seek an administrative review from FCIC, such request must be submitted in accordance with § 400.767(a).
(ii) FCIC will not accept requests for administrative review from NAD, a mediator, or arbitrator.
(iii) The RMA Office of the Deputy Administrator for Product Management will make a determination on the request for administrative review not later than 30 days after receipt of the request.
(iv) Regardless of whether you have sought administrative review, you may appeal a FCIC interpretation under this subsection to NAD in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.

(b) You must advise FCIC if the request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation will be used in a judicial review, mediation, or arbitration.
(1) You must identify the type of proceeding (
e.g.,
mediation, arbitration, or litigation), if applicable, in which the interpretation will be used, and the date the proceeding is scheduled to begin, or the earliest possible date the proceeding would likely begin if a specific date has not been established;
(2) The name, address, telephone number, and if applicable, fax number, or email address of a contact person for both parties to the dispute;
(3) Unless the parties elect to use the expedited review process available under the AAA rules or the appeal is before NAD, requests must be submitted not later than 90 days before the date the mediation, arbitration, or litigation proceeding in which the interpretation will be used is scheduled to begin.
(i) If the rules of the court, mediation, or arbitration require the interpretation prior to the date the proceeding begins, add 90 days to the number of days required prior to the proceeding. For example, if a court requires the interpretation 20 days prior to the date the proceeding begins, you must submit the request 110 days before the proceeding is scheduled to begin.
(ii) Failure to timely submit a request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation may result in:
(A) FCIC issuing a determination that no interpretation could be made because the request was not timely submitted; and
(B) Nullification of any agreement or award in accordance with § 400.766 if no final agency determination or FCIC interpretation can be provided.
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, if during the mediation, arbitration, or litigation proceeding, an issue arises that requires a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation the mediator, arbitrator, judge, or magistrate must promptly request a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation in accordance with § 400.767(a).
(4) FCIC at its sole discretion may authorize personnel to provide an oral or written final agency determination or FCIC interpretation, as appropriate; and
(5) Any decision or settlement resulting from such mediation, arbitration, or litigation proceeding before FCIC provides its final agency determination or FCIC interpretation can be nullified in accordance with § 400.766.
(c) If multiple parties are involved and have opposing interpretations, a joint request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation including both requestor interpretations in one request is encouraged. If multiple insured persons are parties to the dispute, and the request for a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation applies to all parties, one request may be submitted for all insured persons instead of separate requests for each person. In this case, the information required in this section must be provided for each person.
§ 400.768
FCIC obligations.
(a) FCIC will not provide a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation for any request regarding, or that contains, specific factual information to situations or cases, such as acts or failures to act of any participant under the terms of a policy, procedure, or any reinsurance agreement.
(1) FCIC will not consider specific factual information to situations or cases in any final agency determination or FCIC interpretation.
(2) FCIC will not consider any examples or hypotheticals provided in your interpretation because those are fact-specific and could be construed as a finding of fact by FCIC. If an example or hypothetical is required to illustrate an interpretation, FCIC will provide the example in the interpretation.
(b) If, in the sole judgment of FCIC, the request is unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete, FCIC will not provide a final agency determination or FCIC interpretation, but will notify you within 30 days of the date of receipt by FCIC that the request is unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete.
(c) If FCIC notifies you that a request is unclear, ambiguous or incomplete under paragraph (b) of this section, the 90-day time period for FCIC to provide a response is stopped on the date FCIC notifies you. On the date FCIC receives a clear, complete, and unambiguous request, FCIC has the balance of the days remaining in the 90-day time period to provide a response to you. For example, FCIC receives a request for a final agency determination on January 10. On February 10, FCIC notifies you the request is unclear. On March 10, FCIC receives a clarified request that meets all requirements for FCIC to provide a final agency determination. FCIC has sixty days from March 10, the balance of the 90-day time period, to provide a response.
(d) FCIC reserves the right to modify the request if FCIC determines that a request for a final agency determination is really a request for a FCIC interpretation or vice versa.
(e) FCIC will provide you a written final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation within 90 days of the date of receipt for a request that meets all requirements in § 400.767.
(f) If FCIC does not provide a response within 90 days of receipt of a request, you may assume your interpretation is correct for the applicable crop year. However, your interpretation shall not be considered generally applicable and shall not be binding on any other program participants. Additionally, in the case of a joint request for a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation, if FCIC does not provide a response within 90 days, neither party may assume their interpretations are correct.
(g) FCIC will publish all final agency determinations as specially numbered documents on the RMA website because they are generally applicable to all program participants.
(h) FCIC will not publish any FCIC interpretation because it is only applicable to the parties in the dispute. You are responsible for providing copies of the FCIC interpretation to all other parties.
(i) When issuing a final agency determination or a FCIC interpretation, FCIC will not evaluate the insured, insurance provider, agent, or loss adjuster as it relates to their performance of following FCIC policy provisions or procedures. Interpretations will not include any analysis of whether the insured, insurance provider, agent, or loss adjuster was in compliance with the policy provision or procedure in question.

§ 402.1
General statement.
The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, requires the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to implement a catastrophic risk protection plan of insurance that provides a basic level of insurance coverage to protect producers in the event of a catastrophic crop loss due to loss of yield or prevented planting, if provided by the Corporation, provided the crop loss or prevented planting is due to an insured cause of loss specified in the crop insurance policy. This Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is a continuous endorsement that is effective in conjunction with a crop insurance policy for the insured crop. Catastrophic risk protection coverage will be offered through approved insurance providers if there are a sufficient number available to service the area. If there are an insufficient number available, as determined by the Secretary, local offices of the Farm Service Agency will provide catastrophic risk protection coverage.
§ 402.2
Applicability.
This Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is applicable to each crop for which catastrophic risk protection coverage is available and for which the producer elects such coverage.
§ 402.3

The information collection activity associated with this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) under OMB control number 0563-0053.

Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement Provisions.

# Department of Agriculture

# Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

# Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement
(This is a continuous endorsement)
If a conflict exists among the policy, the order of priority is: (1) This Endorsement; (2) Special Provisions; (3) actuarial documents; (4) the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions, if applicable; and (5) any of the policies specified in section 2, with (1) controlling (2), etc.

# Terms and Conditions

# 1. Definitions
Insurance provider.
A private insurance company that has been approved by FCIC to provide insurance coverage to producers participating in programs authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act.
Zero acreage report.
An acreage report filed by you that certifies you do not have a share in the crop for that crop year.

# 2. Eligibility, Life of Policy, Cancellation, and Termination
(a) You must have one of the following policies in force to elect this Endorsement:
(1) The Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (7 CFR 457.8) and applicable Crop Provisions (catastrophic risk protection coverage is not available under individual revenue plans of insurance such as Revenue Protection and Revenue Protection with Harvest Price Exclusion);
(2) The Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions (7 CFR 407.9) and applicable Crop Provisions (catastrophic risk protection coverage is not available under area revenue plans of insurance such as Area Revenue Protection or Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion); or
(3) Other crop policies only if catastrophic risk protection coverage is provided in the applicable crop policy.
(b) You must have made application for catastrophic risk protection on or before the sales closing date for the crop in the county.
(c) You must be a “person” as defined in the crop policy to be eligible for catastrophic risk protection coverage.

# 3. Unit Division
(a) This section is not applicable if you are insured under the Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions (7 CFR 407.9) and applicable Crop Provisions.
(b) This section is in lieu of the unit provisions specified in the applicable crop policy. For catastrophic risk protection coverage, a unit will be all insurable acreage of the insured crop in the county on the date coverage begins for the crop year:
(1) In which you have one hundred percent (100%) crop share; or
(2) Which is owned by one person and operated by another person on a share basis.
(Example: If, in addition to the land you own, you rent land from five landlords, three on a crop share basis and two on a cash basis, you would be entitled to four units; one for each crop share lease and one that combines the two cash leases and the land you own.)
(c) Further division of the units described in section 3(b) is not allowed under this Endorsement.

# 4. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities
(a) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, catastrophic risk protection coverage will offer protection equal to:
(1) Fifty percent (50%) of your approved yield indemnified at fifty-five percent (55%) of the price election or projected price, as applicable, if you are insured under the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (7 CFR 457.8) and applicable Crop Provisions;
(2) Sixty-five percent (65%) of the expected county yield indemnified at forty-five percent (45%) of the maximum protection per acre if you are insured under the Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions (7 CFR 407.9) and applicable Crop Provisions; or
(3) A comparable coverage as established by FCIC for other crop policies only if catastrophic risk protection coverage is provided in the applicable crop policy.
(b) If the crop policy denominates coverage in dollars per acre or other measure, or any other alternative method of coverage, such coverage will be converted to the amount of coverage that would be payable at fifty percent (50%) of your approved yield indemnified at fifty-five percent (55%) of the price election.
(c) You may elect catastrophic coverage for any crop insured or reinsured by FCIC on either an individual yield and loss basis or an area yield and loss basis, if both options are offered as set out in the Special Provisions.

# 5. Report of Acreage
(a) The report of crop acreage that you file in accordance with the crop policy must be signed on or before the acreage reporting date. For catastrophic risk protection, unless the other person with an insurable interest in the crop objects in writing prior to the acreage reporting date and provides a signed acreage report on their own behalf, the operator may sign the acreage report for all other persons with an insurable interest in the crop without a power of attorney. All persons with an insurable interest in the crop, and for whom the operator purports to sign and represent, are bound by the information contained in that acreage report.
(b) For the purpose of determining the amount of indemnity only, your share will not exceed your insurable interest at the earlier of the time of loss or the beginning of harvest. Unless the accepted application clearly indicates that insurance is requested for a partnership or joint venture, insurance
will only cover the crop share of the person completing the application. The share will not extend to any other person having an interest in the crop except as may otherwise be specifically allowed in this endorsement. Any acreage or interest reported by or for your spouse, child or any member of your household may be considered your share. A lease containing provisions for both a minimum payment (such as a specified amount of cash, bushels, pounds, etc.)
and
a crop share will be considered a crop share lease. A lease containing provisions for either a minimum payment (such as a specified amount of cash, bushels, pounds, etc.,)
or
a crop share will be considered a cash lease. Land rented for cash, a fixed commodity payment, or any consideration other than a share in the insured crop on such land will be considered as owned by the lessee.

# 6. Annual Premium and Administrative Fees
(a) Except as provided in sections 6(f) and (h) and notwithstanding any provision contained in any other policy document, you will not be responsible to pay a premium, nor will the policy be terminated because the premium has not been paid. FCIC will pay a premium subsidy equal to the premium established for the coverage provided under this endorsement.
(b) In return for catastrophic risk protection coverage, you must pay an administrative fee and premium as specified in section 6(f) to us within 30 days after you have been billed, unless otherwise authorized in the Federal Crop Insurance Act (You will be billed by the date stated in the actuarial documents);
(1) The administrative fee owed is $655 for each crop in the county unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.
(2) Payment of an administrative fee will not be required if you file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop (if you falsely file a zero acreage report you may be subject to criminal and administrative sanctions).
(c) The administrative fee provisions of section 6(b) do not apply if you are a “beginning farmer or “rancher,” “veteran farmer or rancher,” or “limited resource farmer” as defined in the applicable crop policy. The administrative fee will be waived if you request it and you meet the requirements contained in the annual premium provisions of the applicable crop policy.
(d) When a crop policy has provisions to allow you the option to separately insure individual crop types or varieties, you must pay a separate administrative fee in accordance with section 6(b) for each type or variety you elect to separately insure.
(e) If the administrative fee and premium as specified in section 6(f) is not paid when due, you, and all persons with an insurable interest in the crop under the same contract, may be ineligible for certain other USDA program benefits.
(f) You will be responsible for payment of the premium established for the coverage provided under this endorsement if:
(1) USDA determines you have committed a violation of the highly erodible land conservation or wetland conservation provisions of 7 CFR part 12 as amended by the Agricultural Act of 2014; or
(2) You have not filed form AD-1026 with FSA for the reinsurance year by the premium billing date.
(i) Notwithstanding section 6(f)(2), you may be eligible for premium subsidy without having a timely filed form AD-1026:
(A) For the initial reinsurance year if you certify by the premium billing date for your policy that you meet the qualifications as outlined in FCIC approved procedures for producers who are new to farming, new to crop insurance, a new entity, or have not previously been required to file form AD-1026; or
(B) If FSA approves relief for failure to timely file due to circumstances beyond your control or failure to timely provide adequate information to complete form AD-1026 in accordance with the provisions contained in 7 CFR part 12.
(ii) To be eligible for premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC, it is your responsibility to assure you meet all the requirements for:
(A) Compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 6(f)(1) of this section; and
(B) Filing form AD-1026 to be properly identified as in compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 6(f)(1) of this section.
(g) If the Act expressly authorizes an option or endorsement to be available in addition to the coverage available under this Endorsement (for example, the Supplemental Coverage Option) or any other additional coverage offered under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (for example, the Stacked Income Protection Plan), you will owe a separate annual premium and administrative fee for such option or endorsement if the option or endorsement has been made available in the actuarial documents and you elect to purchase such coverage.
(h) Failure to pay the premium specified in section 6(f) will result in the termination of the policy and all other policies in accordance with the termination provisions specified in the applicable Basic Provisions.

# 7. Insured Crop
The crop insured is specified in the applicable crop policy; however, for policies other
than those insured under the Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions, notwithstanding any other policy provision requiring the same insurance coverage on all insurable acreage of the crop in the county, if you purchase additional coverage for a crop, you may separately insure acreage designated as “high-risk” land by FCIC under catastrophic risk protection coverage, provided that you execute a High-Risk Land Exclusion Option and obtain a catastrophic risk protection coverage policy with the same insurance provider on or before the applicable sales closing date. You will be required to pay a separate administrative fee for both the additional coverage policy and the catastrophic risk protection coverage policy.

# 8. Replanting Payment
Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop insurance document, no replant payment will be paid whether or not replanting of the crop is required under the policy.

# 9. Claim for Indemnity
If two or more insured crop types, varieties, or classes are insured within the same unit, and multiple price elections, projected prices, or amounts of insurance are applicable, the dollar amount of insurance and the dollar amount of production to be counted will be determined separately for each type, variety, class, etc., that have separate price elections, projected prices, or amounts of insurance and then totaled to determine the total liability or dollar amount of production to be counted for the unit.

# 10. Concealment or Fraud
Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop insurance document, your CAT policy may be voided by us on all crops without waiving any of our rights, including the right to collect any amounts due:
(a) If at any time you conceal or misrepresent any material fact or commit fraud relating to this or any other contract issued under the authority of the Federal Crop Insurance Act with any insurance provider; and
(b) The voidance will be effective for the crop year during which any such act or omission occurred.

# 11. Exclusion of Coverage
(a) Options or endorsements that extend the coverage available under any crop policy offered by FCIC will not be available under this endorsement, except for the Supplemental Coverage Option and any other option or endorsement or other additional coverage expressly authorized in the Federal Crop Insurance Act and allowed in the actuarial documents (for example, the Stacked Income Protection Plan). Written agreements are not available for any crop insured under this endorsement.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop policy, hail and fire coverage and high-risk land may not be excluded under catastrophic risk protection.

§ 407.1
Applicability.
The provisions of this part are applicable only to those crops for which a Crop Provision is contained in this part and the crop years specified.
§ 407.2
Availability of Federal crop insurance.
(a) Insurance shall be offered under the provisions of this part on the insured crop in counties within the limits prescribed by and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) (Act). The crops and counties shall be designated by the Manager of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) from those approved by the Board of Directors of FCIC.
(b) The insurance is offered through insurance providers reinsured by the FCIC that offer contracts containing the same terms and conditions as the contract set out in this part. These contracts are clearly identified as being reinsured by FCIC. FCIC may offer the contract for coverage contained in this part and part 402 of this chapter directly to the insured through the Department of Agriculture if the Secretary determines that the availability of local agents is not adequate. Those contracts are specifically identified as being offered by FCIC.
(c) No person may have in force more than one insurance policy issued or reinsured by FCIC on the same crop for the same crop year, in the same county, unless specifically approved in writing by FCIC.
(d) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if a person has more than one contract authorized under the Act that provides coverage for the same loss on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county, all such contracts shall be voided for that crop year and the person will be liable for the premium on all contracts, unless the person can show to the satisfaction of the FCIC that the multiple contracts of insurance were without the fault of the person.
(1) If the multiple contracts of insurance are shown to be without the fault of the person and:
(i) One contract is an additional coverage policy and the other contract is a Catastrophic Risk Protection policy, the additional coverage policy will apply if both policies are with the same insurance provider, or if not, both insurance providers agree, and the Catastrophic Risk Protection policy will be canceled (If the insurance providers do not agree, the policy with the earliest date of application will be in force and the other contract will be canceled); or
(ii) Both contracts are additional coverage policies or both are Catastrophic Risk Protection policies, the contract with the earliest signature date on the application will be valid and the other contract on that crop in the county for that crop year will be canceled, unless both policies are with the same insurance provider and the insurance provider agrees otherwise or both policies are with different insurance providers and both insurance providers agree otherwise.
(2) No liability for indemnity or premium will attach to the contracts canceled as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(e) The person must repay all amounts received in violation of this section with interest at the rate contained in the contract (see § 407.9, section 22).
(f) A person whose contract with FCIC or with an insurance provider reinsured by FCIC under the Act has been terminated because of violation of the terms of the contract is not eligible to obtain crop insurance under the Act with FCIC or with an insurance provider reinsured by FCIC unless the person can show that the termination was improper and should not result in subsequent ineligibility.
(g) All applicants for insurance under the Act must advise the insurance provider, in writing at the time of application, of any previous applications for insurance or contracts of insurance under the Act within the last 5 years and the present status of any such applications or insurance.
§ 407.3
Premium rates, amounts of protection, and coverage levels.
(a) The Manager of FCIC shall establish premium rates, amounts of protection, and coverage levels for the insured crop that will be included in the actuarial documents on file in the agent's office. Premium rates, amounts of protection, and coverage levels may be changed from year to year in accordance with the terms of the policy.
(b) At the time the application for insurance is made, the person must elect
an amount of protection and a coverage level from among those contained in the actuarial documents for the crop year.
§ 407.4
OMB control numbers.
The information collection activity associated with this rule has been submitted to OMB for their review and approval.
§ 407.5
Creditors.
An interest of a person in an insured crop existing by virtue of a lien, mortgage, garnishment, levy, execution, bankruptcy, involuntary transfer or other similar interest shall not entitle the holder of the interest to any benefit under the contract.
§ 407.6
[Reserved]
§ 407.7
The contract.
(a) The insurance contract shall become effective upon the acceptance by FCIC or the insurance provider of a complete, duly executed application for insurance on a form prescribed or approved by FCIC.
(b) The contract shall consist of the accepted application, Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, Actuarial Documents, and any amendments, endorsements, or options thereto.
(c) Changes made in the contract shall not affect its continuity from year to year.
(d) No indemnity shall be paid unless the person complies with all terms and conditions of the contract.
(e) The forms required under this part and by the contract are available at the office of the insurance provider, or such other location as specified by FCIC, if applicable.
§ 407.8
The application and policy.
(a) Application for insurance, developed in accordance with standards established by FCIC, must be made by any person who wishes to participate in the program in order to cover such person's share in the insured crop as landlord, owner-operator, tenant, or other crop ownership interest.
(1) No other person's interest in the crop may be insured under the application.
(2) To obtain coverage, the application must be submitted to the insurance provider on or before the applicable sales closing date on file in the insurance provider's local office.
(b) FCIC or the insurance provider may reject, no longer accept applications, or cancel existing insurance contracts upon the FCIC's determination that the insurance risk is excessive. Such determination must be made not later than 15 days before the cancellation date for the crop and may be made on an area, county, state, or crop basis.

All provisions of the policy and rights and responsibilities of the parties are specifically subject to the Act. The provisions of the policy may not be waived or modified in any way by us, your insurance agent, or any employee of USDA. FCIC procedures (handbooks, underwriting rules, manuals, memoranda, and bulletins), and published on the Risk Management Agency's (RMA) website at
www.rma.usda.gov
or a successor website, will be used in the administration of this policy, including the adjustment of any loss or claim submitted under this policy.

AGREEMENT TO INSURE: In return for the commitment to pay a premium, and subject to all of the provisions of this policy, we
agree with you to provide the insurance as stated in this policy. If there is a conflict between the Act, the regulations in 7 CFR chapter IV, and FCIC procedures, the order of precedence is: (1) The Act; (2) the regulations; and (3) FCIC procedures.

[Reinsured policies]
Area Risk Protection Insurance (ARPI) provides protection against widespread loss of revenue or widespread loss of yield in a county. Individual farm revenues and yields are not considered under ARPI and it is possible that your individual farm may experience reduced revenue or reduced yield and not receive an indemnity under ARPI.
This insurance policy is reinsured by FCIC under the provisions of Subtitle A of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) (Act). All provisions of the policy and rights and responsibilities of the parties are specifically subject to the Act. The provisions of the policy may not be waived or varied in any way by us, our insurance agent or any other contractor or employee of ours, or any employee of USDA. We will use FCIC procedures (handbooks, underwriting rules, manuals, memoranda, and bulletins), published on the Risk Management Agency (RMA's) website at
www.rma.usda.gov
or a successor website, in the administration of this policy, including the adjustment of any loss or claim submitted under this policy. In the event that we cannot pay your loss because we are insolvent or are otherwise unable to perform our duties under our reinsurance agreement with FCIC, FCIC will become your insurer, make all decisions in accordance with the provisions of this policy, including any loss payments, and be responsible for any amounts owed. No state guarantee fund will be liable for your loss.
Throughout this policy, “you” and “your” refer to the insured shown on the accepted application and “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the insurance provider providing insurance. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the use of the plural form of a word includes the singular and the singular form of the word includes the plural.

(B) For a policy with other amounts due, including but not limited to, premium billed with a due date after the termination date for the crop year in which premium is earned, the termination date immediately following the date you have a delinquent debt (For policies for which the sales closing date is prior to the termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to
have attached for the crop year and no indemnity will be owed.);
(C) For all other policies that are issued by us under the authority of the Act, the termination date that coincides with the termination date for the policy with the delinquent debt, or if there is no coincidental termination date, the termination date immediately following the date you become ineligible; or
(D) For execution of a written payment agreement and failure to make any scheduled payment, the termination date for the crop year prior to the crop year in which you failed to make the scheduled payment (for this purpose only, the crop year will start the day after the termination date and end on the next termination date, e.g., if the termination date is November 30 and you fail to make a payment on November 15, 2019, your policy will terminate on November 30, 2018, for the 2019 crop year).
(ii) For all policies terminated under section 2(k)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (D), any indemnities paid subsequent to the termination date must be repaid.
(iii) Once the policy is terminated, it cannot be reinstated for the current crop year unless:
(A) The termination was in error;
(B) The Administrator of the Risk Management Agency, at his or her sole discretion, determines that the following conditions are met:
(
1
) In accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and FCIC procedures, you provide documentation that your inadvertent failure to pay your debt is due to an unforeseen or unavoidable event or other extenuating circumstances that created the inadvertent failure for you to make timely payment;
(
2
) You remit full payment of the delinquent debt owed to us or FCIC with your request submitted in accordance with section 2(k)(2)(iii)(B)(
3
); and
(
3
) You submit a written request for reinstatement of your policy to us no later than 60 days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in the notice to you of the amount due, if applicable.
(
i
) If authorization for reinstatement, as defined in 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, is granted, your policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which you were determined ineligible, and you will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided you meet all eligibility requirements and comply with the terms of the policy; and
(
ii
) There is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation; or
(C) We determine that, in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and FCIC procedures, the following are met:
(
1
) You can demonstrate:
(
i
) You made timely payment for the amount of premium owed but you inadvertently omitted some small amount, such as the most recent month's interest or a small administrative fee;
(
ii
) The amount of the payment was clearly transposed from the amount that was otherwise due (for example, you owed $892 but you paid $829);
(
iii
) You timely made the full payment of the amount owed but the delivery of that payment was delayed, and was postmarked no more than seven calendar days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in a notice to you of an amount due, as applicable; or
(
iv
) For previously executed written payment agreements, you made the full payment of the scheduled payment amount owed within 15 calendar days after the missed payment date.
(
2
) You remit full payment of the delinquent debt owed to us; and
(
3

(
4
) If authorization for reinstatement, as defined in 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, is granted, your policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which you were determined ineligible, and you will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided you meet all eligibility requirements and comply with the terms of the policy; and
(
5
) There is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation.
(iv) A determination made under:
(A) Section 2(k)(2)(iii)(B) may only be appealed to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR part 11; and
(B) Section 2(k)(2)(iii)(C) may only be appealed in accordance with section 23.
(3) To regain eligibility, you must:
(i) Repay the delinquent debt in full;
(ii) Execute a written payment agreement in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and make payments in accordance with the agreement; or
(iii) Have your debts discharged in bankruptcy.
(4) If you are determined to be ineligible under section 2(k), persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you may also be ineligible until you become eligible again.
(l) In cases where there has been a death, disappearance, judicially declared incompetence, or dissolution of any insured person:
(1) If any married insured dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent, the insured on the policy will automatically convert to the name of the spouse if:
(i) The spouse was included on the policy as having a substantial beneficial interest in the insured; and
(ii) The spouse has a share of the crop.
(2) The provisions in section 2(l)(3) will only be applicable if:
(i) Any partner, member, shareholder, etc., of an insured person dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent, and such event automatically dissolves the person; or
(ii) An individual whose estate is left to a beneficiary other than a spouse or left to the spouse and the criteria in section 2(l)(1) are not met, dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent.
(3) If the death, disappearance, or judicially declared incompetence occurred:
(i) More than 30 days before the cancellation date, the policy is automatically canceled as of the cancellation date and a new application must be submitted; or
(ii) Thirty days or less before the cancellation date, or on after the cancellation date, the policy will continue in effect through the crop year immediately following the cancellation date and be automatically canceled as of the cancellation date immediately following the end of the insurance period for the crop year, unless canceled by the cancellation date prior to the start of the insurance period:
(A) A new application for insurance must be submitted on or before the sales closing date for coverage for the subsequent crop year; and
(B) Any indemnity will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially entitled to the payment provided such person or persons comply with all policy provisions and timely pays the premium.
(4) If any insured person is dissolved for reasons other than death, disappearance, or judicially declared incompetence:
(i) Before the cancellation date, the policy is automatically canceled as of the cancellation date and a new application must be submitted; or
(ii) On or after the cancellation date, the policy will continue in effect through the crop year immediately following the cancellation date and be automatically canceled as of the cancellation date immediately following the end of the insurance period for the crop year, unless canceled by the cancellation date prior to the start of the insurance period.
(A) A new application for insurance must be submitted on or before the sales closing date for coverage for the subsequent crop year; and
(B) Any indemnity will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially entitled to the payment provided such person or persons comply with all policy provisions and timely pays the premium.
(5) If section 2(k)(2) or (4) applies, a remaining member of the insured person or the beneficiary is required to report to us the death, disappearance, judicial incompetence, or other event that causes dissolution of the person not later than the next cancellation date, except if section 2(k)(3)(ii) applies, notice must be provided by the cancellation date for the next crop year.
(m) We may cancel your policy if no premium is earned for 3 consecutive years.
(n) The cancellation and termination dates are contained in the Crop Provisions.
(o) Any person may sign any document relative to crop insurance coverage on behalf of any other person covered by such a policy, provided that the person has a properly executed power of attorney or such other legally sufficient document authorizing such person to sign. You are still responsible for the accuracy of all information provided on your behalf and may be subject to the consequences in section 8(g), and any other consequences, including administrative, criminal or civil sanctions, if any information has been misreported.
(p) If voidance, cancellation or termination of insurance coverage occurs for any reason, including but not limited to indebtedness, suspension, debarment, disqualification, cancellation by you or us or your policy is voided due to a conviction of the controlled substance provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 or Title 21, a new application must be filed for the crop.
(1) Insurance coverage will not be provided if you are ineligible under the contract or under any Federal statute or regulation.
(2) Since applications for crop insurance cannot be accepted after the sales closing date, if you make any payment, or you otherwise become eligible, after the sales closing date, you cannot apply for insurance until the next crop year. For example, for the 2018 crop year, if crop A, with a termination date of October 31, 2018, and crop B, with a termination date of March 15, 2019, are insured and you do not pay the premium for crop A by the termination date, you are ineligible for crop insurance as of October 31, 2018, and crop A's policy is terminated as of that date. Crop B's policy does not terminate until March 15, 2019, and an indemnity for the 2018 crop year may still be owed. You will not be eligible to apply for crop insurance for any crop until after the amounts owed are paid in full or you have your debts discharged in bankruptcy.

# 3. Contract Changes
(a) We may change the terms and conditions of this policy from year to year.
(b) Any changes in policy provisions, the CEPP, amounts of insurance, expected county yields, premium rates, and program dates can be viewed on RMA's website not later than the contract change date contained in the Crop Provisions. We may only revise this information after the contract change date to correct obvious errors (e.g., the expected county revenue for a county was announced at $2,500 per acre instead of $250 per acre).
(c) After the contract change date, all changes specified in section 3(b) will also be available upon request from your crop insurance agent.
(d) Not later than 30 days prior to the cancellation date for the insured crop you will be notified, in accordance with section 20, a copy of the changes to the Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, CEPP, if applicable, and Special Provisions.
(e) Acceptance of all the changes will be conclusively presumed in the absence of notice from you to change or cancel your insurance coverage.

# 4. Insured Crop
(a) The insured crop will be that shown on your accepted application and as specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, and must be grown on insurable acreage.
(b) A crop which will NOT be insured will include, but will not be limited to, any crop:
(1) That is not grown on planted acreage;
(2) That is a type not generally recognized for the area;
(3) For which the information necessary for insurance (projected price, expected county yield, premium rate, etc.) is not included in the actuarial documents;
(4) That is a volunteer crop;
(5) Planted following the same crop on the same acreage and the first planting of the crop has been harvested in the same crop year unless specifically permitted by the Crop Provisions or the Special Provisions (for example, the second planting of grain sorghum would not be insurable if grain sorghum had already been planted and harvested on the same acreage during the crop year);
(6) That is planted for experimental purposes;
(7) That is used solely for wildlife protection or management. If the lease states that specific acreage must remain unharvested, only that acreage is uninsurable. If the lease specifies that a percentage of the crop must be left unharvested, your share will be reduced by such percentage; or
(8) That is reported as a cover crop to a USDA agency.
(i) No indemnity will be paid for such acreage and any indemnity already received must be repaid.
(ii) You will still be required to pay 60 percent of the premium you would otherwise be required to pay on those acres.
(c) Although certain policy documents may state that a specific crop, type, or practice is not insurable, it does not mean all other crops, types, or practices are insurable. To be insurable, the use of such crop, type, or practice must be a good faming practice, have been widely used in the county, and meet all the conditions in the Basic Provisions, the Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, and the actuarial documents.

# 5. Insurable Acreage
The insurable acreage is all the acreage planted to the insured crop in the county in which you have a share, except as provided in section 5(d). New breaking acreage may be subject to a reduced protection factor in accordance with section 5(b) and native sod acreage may be subject to reduced premium subsidy and protection factor in accordance with section 5(c). The dollar amount of insurance per acre, amount of premium, and indemnity will be calculated separately for each crop, type, and practice shown on the actuarial documents.
(a) New breaking acreage consists of acreage which has not been planted and harvested, or insured, in at least 1 of the 4 previous crop years.
(1) For the purposes of determining new breaking acreage:
(i) Planted includes annual regrowth of a perennial crop;
(ii) Harvested does not include grazing; and
(iii) Insured only includes crops eligible for insurance under these Basic Provisions or the Common Crop Insurance Policy, Basic Provisions (7 CFR part 457).
(2) Acreage that was not planted in at least 3 of the 4 previous crop years to comply with any other USDA program will not be considered new breaking acreage.
(b) New breaking acreage reduction—New breaking acreage is insurable at a protection factor of at most 85 percent, unless that acreage:
(1) Is identified as native sod acreage in accordance with section 5(c), for which the native sod provisions in section 5(c) will apply;
(2) Is uninsurable acreage in accordance with section 5(d); or
(3) Constitutes 5 percent or less of the insured planted acreage in the unit, for which the new breaking limitation to an 85 percent protection factor will not apply.
(c) Native sod acreage reductions—Native sod acreage in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, or South Dakota may receive a reduced premium subsidy and reduced protection factor. These reductions are applicable during the first 4
crop years of planting on native sod acreage that has been tilled beginning on February 8, 2014, and ending on December 20, 2018, and during 4 cumulative crop years of insurance within the first 10 crop years after initial tillage on native sod acreage tilled after December 20, 2018. For such native sod acreage:
(1) Additional coverage policies receive a premium subsidy that is 50 percentage points less than would otherwise be provided on acreage not qualifying as native sod. If the premium subsidy applicable to these acres is less than 50 percent before the reduction, you will receive no premium subsidy.
(2) The protection factor will be reduced to 65 percent.
(3) Cumulative native sod acreage that is 5 acres or less in the county is not subject to the reduced premium subsidy in section 5(c)(1) or the reduced protection factor stated in section 5(c)(2).
(d) We will not insure any acreage (and any uninsured acreage and production from uninsured acreage will not be included for the purposes of establishing the final county yield):
(1) Where the crop was not planted on or before the final planting date or was not reported by the acreage reporting date;
(2) Where the crop was destroyed or put to another use during the crop year for the purpose of conforming with, or obtaining a payment under, any other program administered by the USDA;
(3) Where we determine you have failed to follow good farming practices for the insured crop;
(4) Where the conditions under which the crop is planted are not generally recognized for the area (for example, where agricultural experts determine that planting a non-irrigated corn crop after a failed small grain crop on the same acreage in the same crop year is not appropriate for the area);
(5) Of a second crop, if you elect not to insure such acreage when an indemnity for a first insured crop may be subject to reduction in accordance with the provisions of section 13 and you intend to collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop acreage. This election must be made for all first insured crop acreage that may be subject to an indemnity reduction if the first insured crop is insured under this policy, or on a first insured crop unit basis if the first insured crop is not insured under this policy (for example, if the first insured crop under this policy consists of 40 acres, or the first insured crop unit insured under another policy contains 40 planted acres, then no second crop can be insured on any of the 40 acres). In this case:
(i) If the first insured crop is insured under ARPI, you must provide written notice to us of your election not to insure acreage of a second crop by the acreage reporting date for the second crop if it is insured under ARPI, or before planting the second crop if it is insured under any other policy;
(ii) If the first insured crop is not insured under ARPI, at the time the first insured crop acreage is released by us or another insurance provider who insures the first insured crop (if no acreage in the first insured crop unit is released, this election must be made by the earlier of acreage reporting date for the second crop or when you sign the claim for the first insured crop);
(iii) If you fail to provide a notice as specified in section 5(d)(5)(i) or (ii), the second crop acreage will be insured in accordance with applicable policy provisions, and you must repay any overpaid indemnity for the first insured crop;
(iv) In the event a second crop is planted and insured with a different insurance provider, or planted and insured by a different person, you must provide written notice to each insurance provider that a second crop was planted on acreage on which you had a first insured crop; and
(v) You must report the crop acreage that will not be insured on the applicable acreage report; and
(6) Of a crop planted following a second crop or following an insured crop that is prevented from being planted after a first insured crop, unless it is a practice that is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts for the area to plant three or more crops for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year, and additional coverage insurance provided under the authority of the Act is offered for the third or subsequent crop in the same crop year. Insurance will only be provided for a third or subsequent crop as follows:
(i) You must provide records acceptable to us that show:
(A) You have produced and harvested the insured crop following 2 other crops harvested on the same acreage in the same crop year in at least 2 of the last 4 years in which you produced the insured crop; or
(B) The applicable acreage has had 3 or more crops produced and harvested on it in the same crop year in at least 2 of the last 4 years in which the insured crop was grown on the acreage; and
(ii) The amount of insurable acreage will not exceed 100 percent of the greatest number of acres for which you provide the records required in section 5(d)(6)(i).

# 6. Coverage, Coverage Levels, Protection Factor, and Policy Protection
(a) For all acreage of the insured crop in the county, you must select the same plan of insurance (e.g., all Area Revenue Protection, all Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion, or all Area Yield Protection), if such plans are available on the actuarial documents.
(b) You must choose a protection factor:
(1) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions from a range of 80 percent to 120 percent;
(2) As a whole percentage from amounts specified; and
(3) For each crop, type, and practice (you may choose a different protection factor for each crop, type, and practice).
(c) You may select any coverage level shown on the actuarial documents for each crop, type, and practice.
(1) For Area Revenue Protection and Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion:
(i) CAT level of coverage is not available; and
(ii) With respect to additional level of coverage, you may select any coverage level specified in the actuarial documents for each crop, type, and practice. For example: You may choose a 75 percent coverage level for one crop, type, and practice (such as corn irrigated practice) and a 90 percent coverage level for another crop, type, and practice (corn non-irrigated practice).
(2) For Area Yield Protection:
(i) CAT level of coverage is available, and you may select the CAT level of coverage for any crop, type, and practice;
(ii) With respect to additional level of coverage, you may select any coverage level specified in the actuarial documents for each crop, type, and practice. For example: You may choose a 75 percent coverage level for one crop, type, and practice (corn irrigated practice) and a 90 percent coverage level for another crop, type, and practice (corn non-irrigated practice); and
(iii) You may have CAT level of coverage on one type and practice shown on the actuarial documents for the crop, and additional coverage on another type and practice for the same crop. You may also have different additional levels of coverage by type and practice.
(d) You may change the plan of insurance, protection factor, or coverage level, for the following crop year by giving written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the insured crop.
(e) Since this is a continuous policy, if you do not select a new plan of insurance, protection factor, and coverage level on or before the sales closing date, we will assign the same plan of insurance, protection factor, and coverage level as the previous year.
(f) Policy protection for ARPI plans of insurance is calculated as follows:
(1) Multiply the dollar amount of insurance per acre for each crop, type, and practice by the number of acres insured for such crop, type and practice; and
(2) Multiply the result of paragraph (1) by your share.
(g) If the projected price cannot be calculated for the current crop year under the provisions contained in the CEPP and you previously chose Area Revenue Protection or Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion:
(1) Area Revenue Protection and Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion will not be provided and you will automatically be covered under the Area Yield Protection plan of insurance for the current crop year unless you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your plan of insurance by the sales closing date;
(2) Notice of availability of the projected price will be provided on RMA's website by the date specified in the applicable projected price definition contained in the CEPP;
(3) The projected price will be determined by FCIC and will be released by the date specified in the applicable projected price definition contained in the CEPP; and
(4) Your coverage will automatically revert back to Area Revenue Protection or Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion, whichever is applicable, for the next crop year that revenue protection is available unless you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your plan of insurance by the sales closing date.

# 7. Annual Premium and Administrative Fees
(a) The administrative fee:
(1) For CAT level of coverage will be an amount specified in the CAT Endorsement or the Special Provisions, as applicable;
(2) For additional levels of coverage is $30, or an amount specified in the Special Provisions, as applicable;
(3) Is payable to us on the premium billing date for the crop;
(4) Must be paid no later than the time premium is due or the amount will be considered a delinquent debt;
(5) If you select coverage in accordance with section 6(c)(2)(iii):
(i) Will be charged for both CAT and additional level of coverage if a producer elects both for the crop in the county; but
(ii) Will not be more than one additional and one CAT administrative fee no matter how many different coverage levels you choose for different type and practice combinations you insure for the crop in the county;
(6) Will be waived if you request it and:
(i) You qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher;
(ii) You qualify as a limited resource farmer; or
(iii) You were insured prior to the 2005 crop year or for the 2005 crop year and your administrative fee was waived for one or more of those crop years because you qualified as a limited resource farmer under a policy definition previously in effect, and you remain qualified as a limited resource farmer under
the definition that was in effect at the time the administrative fee was waived;
(7) Will not be required if you file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop. If you falsely file a zero acreage report you may be subject to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions; and
(8) If not paid when due, may make you ineligible for crop insurance and certain other USDA benefits.
(b) The premium is based on the policy protection calculated in section 6(f).
(c) The information needed to determine the premium rate and any premium adjustment percentages that may apply are contained in the actuarial documents.
(d) To calculate the premium and subsidy amounts for ARPI plans of insurance:
(1) Multiply your policy protection from section 6(f) by the applicable premium rate and any premium adjustment percentages that may apply;
(2) Multiply the result of paragraph (1) by the applicable subsidy factor (this is the amount of premium FCIC will pay); and
(3) Subtract the result of paragraph (2) from the result of paragraph (1) to calculate the amount of premium you will pay.
(e) The amount of premium calculated in accordance with section 7(d)(3) is earned and payable at the time coverage begins. You will be billed for such premium and applicable administrative fees not earlier than the premium billing date specified in the Special Provisions.
(f) If the amount of premium calculated in accordance with section 7(d)(3) and administrative fees you are required to pay for any acreage exceeds the amount of policy protection for the acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium or administrative fee will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage).
(g) Premium or administrative fees owed by you will be offset from an indemnity due you in accordance with section 2(j).
(h) If you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher, your premium subsidy will be 10 percentage points greater than the premium subsidy that you would otherwise receive, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.
(i) You will be ineligible for any premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC for any policy issued by us if:
(1) USDA determines you have committed a violation of the highly erodible land conservation or wetland conservation provisions of 7 CFR part 12 as amended by the Agricultural Act of 2014; or
(2) You have not filed form AD-1026 with FSA for the reinsurance year by the premium billing date.
(i) Notwithstanding section 7(i)(2), you may be eligible for premium subsidy without having a timely filed form AD-1026:
(A) For the initial reinsurance year if you certify by the premium billing date for your policy that you meet the qualifications as outlined in FCIC procedures for producers who are new to farming, new to crop insurance, a new person, or have not previously been required to file form AD-1026; or
(B) If FSA approves relief for failure to timely file due to circumstances beyond your control or failure to timely provide adequate information to complete form AD-1026 in accordance with the provisions contained in 7 CFR part 12.
(ii) To be eligible for premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC, it is your responsibility to assure you meet all the requirements for:
(A) Compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 7(i)(1); and
(B) Filing form AD-1026 to be properly identified as in compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 7(i)(1).

# 8. Report of Acreage and Production
(a) An annual acreage report must be submitted to us on our form for each insured crop (separate lines for each type and practice) in the county on or before the acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions.
(b) If you do not have a share in an insured crop in the county for the crop year, you must submit an acreage report, on or before the acreage reporting date, so indicating.
(c) Your acreage report must include the following information, if applicable:
(1) The amount of acreage of the crop in the county (insurable and not insurable) in which you have a share, the last date any acreage of the insured crop was planted, and the number of acres planted by such date (acreage initially planted after the final planting date must be reported as uninsurable);
(2) Your share at the time coverage begins;
(3) The practice;
(4) The type; and
(5) The land identifier for the crop acreage (e.g., legal description, FSA farm number or common land unit number if provided to you by FSA, etc.) as required on our form.
(d) We will not insure any acreage of the insured crop planted after the final planting date.
(e) Regarding the ability to revise an acreage report you have submitted to us:
(1) You cannot revise any information pertaining to the planted acreage after the acreage reporting date without our consent;
(2) Consent may only be provided:
(i) If the information on the acreage report is clearly transposed;
(ii) If you provide adequate evidence that we have or someone from USDA has committed an error regarding the information on your acreage report;
(iii) If allowed in the Crop Provisions; or
(iv) As otherwise provided in the Special Provisions; and
(3) The provisions in section 8(e)(1) and (2) also pertain to land acquired after the acreage reporting date, and we may choose to insure or not insure the acreage, provided the crop meets the requirements in section 5 and section 8. This requirement does not apply to any acreage acquired through a transfer of coverage in accordance with section 17.
(f) Except as provided in section 8(h), your premium and indemnity, if any, will be based on your insured acreage and share on your acreage report or section 8(e), if applicable.
(g) We may elect to determine all premiums and indemnities based on the information you submit on the acreage report or upon the factual circumstances we determine to have existed, subject to the provisions contained in section 8.
(h) You must provide all required reports and you are responsible for the accuracy of all information contained in those reports. You should verify the information on all such reports prior to submitting them to us.
(1) Except as provided in section 8(h)(2), if you submit information on any report that is different than what is determined to be correct and the information reported on the acreage report results in:
(i) A lower liability than the actual, correct liability determined, the policy protection will be reduced to an amount consistent with the information reported on the acreage report; or
(ii) A higher liability than the actual, correct liability determined, the information contained in the acreage report will be revised to be consistent with the correct information.
(2) If your share is misreported and the share is:
(i) Under-reported at the time of the acreage report, any claim will be determined using the share you reported; or
(ii) Over-reported at the time of the acreage report, any claim will be determined using the share we determine to be correct.
(i) If we discover you have incorrectly reported any information on the acreage report for any crop year, you may be required to provide documentation in subsequent crop years substantiating your report of acreage for those crop years, including, but not limited to, an acreage measurement service at your own expense. If the correction of any misreported information would affect an indemnity that was paid in a prior crop year, such claim will be adjusted and you will be required to repay any overpaid amounts.
(j) You may request an acreage measurement from FSA or a business that provides such measurement service prior to the acreage reporting date, submit documentation of such request and an acreage report with estimated acreage by the acreage reporting date, and if the acreage measurement shows the estimated acreage was incorrect, we will revise your acreage report to reflect the correct acreage:
(1) If an acreage measurement is only requested for a portion of the insured crop, type, and practice, you must separately designate the acreage for which an acreage measurement has been requested;
(2) If an acreage measurement is not provided to us by the time the final county revenue or final county yield, as applicable, is calculated, we may:
(i) Elect to measure the acreage, and finalize your claim in accordance with applicable policy provisions;
(ii) Defer finalization of the claim until the measurement is completed with the understanding that if you fail to provide the measurement prior to the termination date, your claim will not be paid; or
(iii) Finalize the claim in accordance with applicable policy provisions after you provide the acreage measurement to us; and
(3) Premium will still be due in accordance with sections 2(k) and 7 (if the acreage is not measured as specified in section 8(j) and the acreage measurement is not provided to us at least 15 days prior to the premium billing date, your premium will be based on the estimated acreage and will be revised, if necessary, when the acreage measurement is provided);
(4) If the acreage measurement is not provided by the termination date, you will be precluded from providing any estimated acreage for all subsequent crop years;
(5) If there is an irreconcilable difference between:
(i) The acreage measured by FSA or a measuring service and our on-farm measurement, our on-farm measurement will be used; or
(ii) The acreage measured by a measuring service, other than our on-farm measurement, and FSA, the FSA measurement will be used; and
(6) If the acreage report has been revised in accordance with sections 8(g) and 8(j), the information on the initial acreage report will not be considered misreported for the purposes of section 8(h).
(k) If you do not submit an acreage report by the acreage reporting date, or if you fail to report all acreage, we may elect to determine the insurable acreage, by crop, type, practice, and share, or to deny liability on such acreage. If we deny liability for the unreported acreage, no premium will be due on such acreage and no indemnity will be paid.
(l) An annual production report must be submitted, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, to us on our form for each insured crop (separate lines for each type and practice) in the county by the production reporting date specified in the actuarial documents.
(m) Unless otherwise authorized by FCIC, if you do not submit a production report to us by the production reporting date specified in the actuarial documents, your protection factor for your policy in the following crop year will be limited to the lowest protection factor available.
(n) You must certify to the accuracy of the information on your production report and if you fail to accurately report your production, you will be subject to the provisions in 8(m), unless the information is corrected:
(1) On or before the applicable production reporting date; or
(2) Because the incorrect information was the result of our error or the error of someone from USDA.
(o) If you do not have acceptable production records to support the information you certified on your production report, you will be subject to the provisions in 8(m).
(p) At any time we discover you have misreported any material information on your production report, you will be subject to the provisions in 8(m).
(q) If you do not submit a production report or you misreported your production report and you switch to another plan of insurance in the following crop year, you will be subject to having a yield assigned in accordance with FCIC procedures.
(r) Errors in reporting acreage, share, and other information required in this section, may be corrected by us at the time we become aware of such errors. However, the provisions regarding incorrect information in this section will apply.

# 9. Share Insured
(a) Insurance will attach:
(1) Only if the person completing the application has a share in the insured crop; and
(2) Only to that person's share, except that insurance may attach to another person's share of the insured crop if the other person has a share of the crop and:
(i) The application clearly states the insurance is requested for a person other than an individual (e.g., a partnership or a joint venture); or
(ii) The application clearly states you as a landlord will insure your tenant's share, or you as a tenant will insure your landlord's share. If you as a landlord will insure your tenant's share, or you as a tenant will insure your landlord's share, you must provide evidence of the other party's approval (lease, power of attorney, etc.) and such evidence will be retained by us:
(A) You also must clearly set forth the percentage shares of each person on the acreage report; and
(B) For each landlord or tenant, you must report the landlord's or tenant's SSN, EIN, or other identification number we assigned for the purposes of this policy, as applicable.
(b) With respect to your share:
(1) We will consider included in your share under your policy, any acreage or interest reported by or for:
(i) Your spouse, unless such spouse can prove he/she has a separate farming operation, which includes, but is not limited to, separate land (transfers of acreage from one spouse to another is not considered separate land), separate capital, separate inputs, separate accounting, and separate maintenance of proceeds; or
(ii) Your child who resides in your household or any other member of your household, unless such child or other member of the household can demonstrate such person has a separate share in the crop (children who do not reside in your household are not included in your share); and
(2) If it is determined that the spouse, child or other member of the household has a separate policy but does not have a separate farming operation or share of the crop, as applicable:
(i) The policy for the spouse or child or other member of the household will be void and the policy remaining in effect will be determined in accordance with section 18(c)(1) and (2);
(ii) The acreage or share reported under the policy that is voided will be included under the remaining policy; and
(iii) No premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for the voided policy.
(c) Acreage rented for a percentage of the crop, or a lease containing provisions for both a minimum payment (such as a specified amount of cash, bushels, pounds,
etc.
) and a crop share will be considered a crop share lease.
(d) Acreage rented for cash, or a lease containing provisions for either a minimum payment or a crop share (such as a 50/50 share or $100.00 per acre, whichever is greater) will be considered a cash lease.

# 10. Insurance Period
Unless specified otherwise in the Crop Provisions, coverage begins at the later of:
(a) The date we accept your application (for the purposes of this paragraph, the date of acceptance is the date that you submit a properly executed application in accordance with section 2); or
(b) The date the insured crop is planted.

# 11. Causes of Loss
(a) ARPI provides protection against loss of revenue or against loss of yield in a county resulting from natural causes of loss that cause the final county yield or the final county revenue to be less than the trigger yield or the trigger revenue.
(b) Failure to follow good farming practices, or planting or producing a crop using
a practice that has not been widely recognized as used to establish the expected county yield, is not an insurable cause of loss under ARPI.

# 12. Triggers, Final Policy Protection, Payment Factor, and Indemnity Calculations
(a) Individual farm revenues and yields are not considered when calculating losses under ARPI. It is possible that your individual farm may experience reduced revenue or reduced yield and you do not receive an indemnity under ARPI.
(b) To calculate the trigger revenue:
(1) For Area Revenue Protection, multiply the expected county yield by the greater of the projected or harvest price and by the coverage level.
(2) For Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion, multiply the expected county yield by the projected price and by the coverage level.
(c) To calculate the Trigger Yield for Area Yield Protection, multiply the expected county yield by the coverage level.
(d) If the harvest price cannot be calculated for the current crop year under the provisions contained in the CEPP:
(1) Revenue protection will continue to be available; and
(2) The harvest price will be determined and announced by FCIC.
(e) The final policy protection for:
(1) Area Revenue Protection is calculated by:
(i) Multiplying the expected county yield by the greater of the harvest price or the projected price;
(ii) Multiplying the result of subparagraph (i) by your protection factor; and
(iii) Multiplying the result of subparagraph (ii) by your acres and by your share.
(2) Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion and Area Yield Protection are equal to the policy protection and are calculated by:
(i) Multiplying the expected county yield by the projected price;
(ii) Multiplying the result of subparagraph (i) by your protection factor; and
(iii) Multiplying the result of subparagraph (ii) by your acres and by your share.
(f) An indemnity is due for:
(1) Area Revenue Protection and Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion if the final county revenue is less than the trigger revenue.
(2) Area Yield Protection if the final county yield is less than the trigger yield.
(g) The payment factor is calculated for:
(1) Area Revenue Protection by:
(i) Subtracting the final county revenue from the trigger revenue to determine the amount of loss;
(ii) Multiplying the expected county yield by the greater of the projected or harvest price and by the loss limit factor;
(iii) Subtracting the result of subparagraph (ii) from the trigger revenue; and
(iv) Dividing the result of subparagraph (i) by the result of subparagraph (iii) to obtain the payment factor.
(2) Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest Price Exclusion by:
(i) Subtracting the final county revenue from the trigger revenue to determine the amount of loss;
(ii) Multiplying the expected county yield by the projected price and by the loss limit factor;
(iii) Subtracting the result of subparagraph (ii) from the trigger revenue; and
(iv) Dividing the result of subparagraph (i) by the result of subparagraph (iii) to obtain the payment factor.
(3) Area Yield Protection by:
(i) Subtracting the final county yield from the trigger yield to determine the amount of loss;
(ii) Multiplying the expected county yield by the loss limit factor;
(iii) Subtracting the result of subparagraph (ii) from the trigger yield; and
(iv) Dividing the result of subparagraph (i) by the result of subparagraph (iii) to obtain the payment factor.
(h) Indemnities for all three ARPI plans of insurance are calculated by multiplying the final policy protection by the payment factor.
(i) Indemnities for all three ARPI plans of insurance are calculated following release of the final county yield and harvest price as specified in the Crop Provisions.

# 13. Indemnity and Premium Limitations
(a) With respect to acreage where you are due an indemnity for your first insured crop in the crop year, except in the case of double cropping described in section 13(c):
(1) You may elect to not plant or to plant and not insure a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year and collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop; or
(2) You may elect to plant and insure a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year (you will pay the full premium and if there is an insurable loss to the second crop, receive the full amount of indemnity that may be due for the second crop, regardless of whether there is a subsequent crop planted on the same acreage) and:
(i) Collect an indemnity payment that is 35 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop;
(ii) Be responsible for a premium that is 35 percent of the premium that you would otherwise owe for the first insured crop; and
(iii) If the second crop does not suffer an insurable loss:
(A) Collect an indemnity payment for the other 65 percent of insurable loss that was
not previously paid under section 13(a)(2)(i); and
(B) Be responsible for the remainder of the premium for the first insured crop that you did not pay under section 13(a)(2)(ii).
(b) In lieu of the priority contained in the Agreement to Insure section, which states that the Crop Provisions have priority over the Basic Provisions, the reduction in the amount of indemnity and premium specified in section 13(a) of these Basic Provisions, as applicable, will apply to any premium owed or indemnity paid in accordance with the Crop Provisions, and any applicable endorsement. This will apply:
(1) Even if another person plants the second crop on any acreage where the first insured crop was planted; or
(2) If you fail to provide any records we require to determine whether an insurable loss occurred for the second crop.
(c) You may receive a full indemnity for a first insured crop when a second crop is planted on the same acreage in the same crop year, regardless of whether or not the second crop is insured or sustains an insurable loss, if each of the following conditions are met:
(1) It is a practice that is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts for the area to plant two or more crops for harvest in the same crop year;
(2) The second or more crops are customarily planted after the first insured crop for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year in the area;
(3) Additional coverage insurance offered under the authority of the Act is available in the county on the two or more crops that are double cropped; and
(4) You provide records acceptable to us of acreage and production that show you have double cropped acreage in at least two of the last four crop years in which the first insured crop was planted, or that show the applicable acreage was double cropped in at least two of the last four crop years in which the first insured crop was grown on it;
(5) If you do not have records of acreage and production specific to the double cropped acreage, as required in section 13(c)(4), but instead have records that combine production from acreage you double cropped with records of production from acreage you did not double crop, we will allocate the first and second crop production to the specific acreage in proportion to the liability for the acreage that was and was not double cropped; and
(6) Coordination of Coverage—For double cropped acreage when one of the crops is insured under this policy and one of the crops is insured under other crop insurance authorized under the Act with less restrictive double crop history records requirements (for example, annual forage insured under the Rainfall Index Plan Common Policy, Basic Provisions, does not require records of acreage and production), the double cropping history requirements in sections 13(c)(4) and (5) do not apply. Instead:
(i) For the crop insured under this policy, you may receive a full indemnity if you meet each of the double cropping requirements in sections 13(c)(1) through (3), regardless of which crop was the first insured crop or the second crop; or
(ii) If you do not meet each of the double cropping requirements in sections 13(c)(1) through (3), the indemnity reductions in section 13(a)(2) apply.
(d) If you provided acceptable records in accordance with section 13(c), your double cropping history is limited to the highest number of acres double cropped within the applicable four-year period as determined in section 13(c)(4).
(1) If the records you provided are from acreage you double cropped in at least two of the last four crop years, you may apply your history of double cropping to any acreage of the insured crop in the county (for example, you have 100 cropland acres in the county and have double cropped wheat and soybeans on all 100 acres in the county and you acquire an additional 100 acres in the county, you can apply your history of 100 double cropped acres to any of the 200 acres in the county); or
(2) If the records you provided are from acreage that another producer double cropped in at least two of the last four crop years, you may only use the history of double cropping for the same physical acres from which double cropping records were provided (e.g., if a neighbor has double cropped 100 acres of wheat and soybeans in the county and you acquire your neighbor's 100 double cropped acres and an additional 100 acres in the county, you can only apply your neighbor's history of double cropped acreage to the same 100 acres that your neighbor double cropped).
(3) If you acquired additional land for the current crop year and the following calculation results in a greater number of double cropping acres than determined in section 13(c), you may apply the percentage of acres that you have previously double cropped to the total cropland acres that you are farming this year (if greater):
(i) Determine the number of acres of the first insured crop that were double cropped in each of the years for which double cropping records are provided (for example, records are provided showing: 100 acres of wheat planted in 2019 and 50 of those acres were double cropped with soybeans; and 100 acres of wheat planted in 2020 and 70 of those acres were double cropped with soybeans);
(ii) Divide each result of section 13(d)(3)(i) by the number of acres of the first insured crop that were planted in each respective
year (in the example in section 13(d)(3)(i), 50 divided by 100 equals 50 percent of the first insured crop acres that were double cropped in 2019 and 70 divided by 100 equals 70 percent of the first insured crop acres that were double cropped in 2020);
(iii) Add the results of section 13(d)(3)(ii) and divide by the number of years the first insured crop was double cropped (in the example in section 13(d)(3)(i), 50 plus 70 equals 120 divided by 2 equals 60 percent); and
(iv) Multiply the result of section 13(d)(3)(iii) by the number of insured acres of the first insured crop (in the example in section 13(d)(3)(i), 60 percent multiplied by the number of wheat acres insured in 2021);
(e) If any Federal or State agency requires destruction of any insured crop or crop production, as applicable, because it contains levels of a substance, or has a condition, that is injurious to human or animal health in excess of the maximum amounts allowed by the Food and Drug Administration, other public health organizations of the United States or an agency of the applicable State, you must destroy the insured crop or crop production, as applicable, and certify that such insured crop or crop production has been destroyed prior to receiving an indemnity payment. Failure to destroy the insured crop or crop production, as applicable, will result in you having to repay any indemnity paid and you may be subject to administrative sanctions in accordance with section 515(h) of the Act and 7 CFR part 400, subpart R, and any applicable civil or criminal sanctions.

# 14. Organic Farming Practices
(a) Insurance will be provided for a crop grown using an organic farming practice for only those acres of the crop that meet the requirements for an organic crop on the acreage reporting date.
(b) If an organic type or practice is shown on the actuarial documents, the projected price, dollar amount of insurance, policy protection, premium rate, etc., for such organic crop, type and practice will be used unless otherwise specified in the actuarial documents. If an organic type or practice is not shown on the actuarial documents, the projected price, dollar amount of insurance, policy protection, premium rate, etc., for the non-organic crop, type and practice will be used.
(c) If insurance is provided for an organic farming practice as specified in section 14(a) and (b), only the following acreage will be insured under such practice:
(1) Certified organic acreage;
(2) Transitional acreage being converted to certified organic acreage in accordance with an organic system plan; and
(3) Buffer zone acreage.
(d) On the date you report your acreage, you must have:
(1) For certified organic acreage, a written certification in effect directly from a certifying agent indicating the name of the person certified, effective date of certification, certificate number, types of commodities certified, and name and address of the certifying agent (a certificate issued to a tenant may be used to qualify a landlord or other similar arrangement). A certificate issued from the National Organic Program's Organic Integrity Database (or successor certificate reporting tool) is acceptable;
(2) For transitional acreage, an organic system plan documenting the use of practices that would result in certified organic status that includes the record information as described in section 14(d)(1), or written documentation from a certifying agent indicating an organic system plan is in effect for the acreage; and
(3) Records from the certifying agent showing the specific location of each field of certified organic, transitional, buffer zone, and acreage not maintained under organic management.

# 15. Yields
(a) The data source used for the county yields will be based on the best available data and will be specified in the actuarial documents.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the data source used to establish the expected county yield will be the data source used to establish the final county yield.
(c) If the data source used to establish the expected county yield is not able to provide credible data to establish the final county yield because the data is no longer available, credible, or reflect changes that may have occurred after the yield was established;
(1) FCIC will determine the final county yield based on the most accurate data available from subsection (g), as determined by FCIC; or
(2) To the extent that practices used during the crop year change from those upon which the expected county yield is based, the final county yield may be adjusted to reflect the yield that would have resulted but for the change in practice. For example, if the county is traditionally 90 percent irrigated and 10 percent non-irrigated, but this year the county is now 50 percent irrigated and 50 percent non-irrigated, the final county yield will be adjusted to an amount as if the county had 90 percent irrigated acreage.
(d) If the final county yield is established from a data source other than that used to establish the expected county yield, FCIC will provide notice of the data source and the reason for the change at the time the final county yield is published.
(e) The final county yield determined by FCIC is considered final for the purposes of establishing whether an indemnity is due and will not be revised for any reason.
(f) Yields used under this insurance program for a crop may be based on crop insurance data, other USDA data, or other data sources, if elected by FCIC.

# 16. Assignment of Indemnity
(a) You may assign your right to an indemnity for the crop year only to creditors or other persons to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation. You may be required to provide proof of the debt or other pecuniary obligation before we will accept the assignment of indemnity.
(b) All assignments must be on our form and must be provided to us. Each assignment form may contain more than one creditor or other person to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation.
(c) Unless you have provided us with a properly executed assignment of indemnity, we will not make any payment to a lienholder or other person to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation even if you may have a lien or other assignment recorded elsewhere. Under no circumstances will we be liable:
(1) To any lienholder or other person to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation where you have failed to include such lienholder or person on a properly executed assignment of indemnity provided to us; or
(2) To pay to all lienholders or other persons to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation any amount greater than the total amount of indemnity owed under the policy.
(d) If we have received the properly executed assignment of indemnity form, only one payment will be issued jointly in the names of all assignees and you, unless all assignees and you agree in writing for the payment to be issued to a single payee.

# 17. Transfer of Coverage and Right to Indemnity
If you transfer any part of your share during the crop year, you may transfer your coverage rights, if the transferee is eligible for crop insurance.
(a) We will not be liable for any more than the liability determined in accordance with your policy that existed before the transfer occurred.
(b) The transfer of coverage rights must be on our form and will not be effective until approved by us in writing.
(c) Both you and the transferee are jointly and severally liable for the payment of the premium and administrative fees.
(d) The transferee has all rights and responsibilities under this policy consistent with the transferee's interest.

# 18. Other Insurance
(a) Nothing in this section prevents you from obtaining other insurance not authorized under the Act. However, unless specifically required by policy provisions, you must not obtain any other crop insurance authorized under the Act on your share of the insured crop.
(b) You must demonstrate that you did not intend to have more than one policy in effect (for example, an application to transfer your policy or written notification to an insurance provider that states you want to purchase, or transfer, insurance and you want any other policies for the crop canceled would demonstrate you did not intend to have duplicate policies) and:
(1) One is an additional coverage policy, and the other is a CAT policy:
(i) If both policies are with the same insurance provider, the additional coverage policy will apply and the CAT policy will be void;
(ii) If both policies are with different insurance providers and both insurance providers agree, the additional coverage policy will apply and the CAT policy will be void; or
(iii) If both policies are with different insurance providers and both insurance providers do not agree, the policy with the earliest application date will be in force and the other policy will be void; or
(2) Both are additional coverage policies, or both are CAT policies, the policy with the earliest application date will be in force and the other policy will be void, unless both policies are with:
(i) The same insurance provider and the insurance provider agrees to void the policy with the earliest application date; or
(ii) Different insurance providers and both insurance providers agree to void the policy with the earliest application date.
(c) If you cannot demonstrate that you did not intend to have more than one policy in effect, you may be subject to the consequences authorized under this policy, the Act, or any other applicable statute.

# 19. Crops as Payment
You must not abandon any crop to us. We will not accept any crop as compensation for payments due us.

# 20. Notices
(a) All notices required to be given by you must be in writing and received by your crop insurance agent within the designated time unless otherwise provided by the notice requirement.
(1) Notices required to be given immediately may be by telephone or in person and confirmed in writing.
(2) The time the notice is provided will be determined by the time of our receipt of the written notice.
(3) If the date by which you are required to submit a report or notice falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, or if your agent's office is, for any reason, not open for business on the date you are required to submit such notice or report, such notice or report must be submitted on the next business day.
(b) All policy provisions, notices, and communications required to be sent by us to you will be:
(1) Provided by electronic means, unless:
(i) We do not have the ability to transmit such information to you by electronic means; or
(ii) You elect to receive a paper copy of such information;
(2) Sent to the location specified in your records with your crop insurance agent; and
(3) Conclusively presumed to have been received by you.

# 21. Access to Insured Crop and Records, and Record Retention
(a) We, and any employee of USDA authorized to investigate or review any matter relating to crop insurance (authorized employee of USDA), have the right to examine the insured crop and all records related to the insured crop and this policy, and any mediation, arbitration or litigation involving the insured crop as often as reasonably required during the record retention period.
(b) You must retain, and provide upon our request, or the request of any authorized employee of USDA, complete records pertaining to the planting, acres, share, replanting, inputs, production, harvesting and disposition of the insured crop for a period of three years after the end of the crop year or three years after the date of final payment of indemnity, whichever is later. This requirement also applies to all such records for acreage that is not insured.
(c) We, or any authorized employee of USDA, may extend the record retention period beyond three years by notifying you of such extension in writing.
(d) By signing the application for insurance authorized under the Act or by continuing insurance for which you have previously applied, you authorize us or USDA, or any person acting for us or USDA authorized to investigate or review any matter relating to crop insurance, to obtain records relating to the planting, acres, share, replanting, inputs, production, harvesting, and disposition of the insured crop from any person who may have custody of such records, including but not limited to, FSA offices, banks, warehouses, gins, cooperatives, marketing associations, and accountants. You must assist in obtaining all records we or any authorized employee of USDA request from third parties.
(e) Failure to provide access to the insured crop or the farm, authorize access to the records maintained by third parties, or assist in obtaining all such records will result in a determination that no indemnity is due for the crop year in which such failure occurred.

# [FCIC Policies]

# 22. Amounts Due Us

(d) Interest on any amount due us found to have been received by you because of fraud, misrepresentation or presentation by you of a false claim will start on the date you received the amount with the additional 6 percent penalty beginning on the 31st day after the notice of amount due is issued to you. This interest is in addition to any other amount found to be due under any other Federal criminal or civil statute.
(e) If we determine that it is necessary to contract with a collection agency, refer the debt to government collection centers, the Department of Treasury Offset Program, or to employ an attorney to assist in collection, you agree to pay all the expenses of collection.

# [FCIC Policies]

# 23. Appeal, Reconsideration, and Administrative and Judicial Review
(a) All determinations required by the policy will be made by us. All expected county yields and final county yields are calculated by us in accordance with section 15. However, calculations of expected county yields and final county yields are matters of general applicability.
(1) Any matter of general applicability is not subject to appeal under 7 CFR part 400, subpart J or 7 CFR part 11.
(2) Your only remedy is judicial review but if you want to seek judicial review of any determination by us that is a matter of general applicability, you must request a determination of non-appealability from the Director of the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR 11.6 before seeking judicial review.
(3) The timeframe to request a determination of non-appealability from the Director of the National Appeals Division is not later than 30 days after the date the yields are published on the RMA website.
(b) If you disagree with our determinations:

The descriptive headings of the various policy provisions are formulated for convenience only and are not intended to affect the construction or meaning of any of the policy provisions.

# 26. Conformity to Food Security Act
Although your violation of a number of Federal statutes, including the Act, may cause cancellation, termination, or voidance of your insurance contract, you should be specifically aware that your policy will be canceled if you are determined to be ineligible to receive benefits under the Act due to violation of the controlled substance provisions (title XVII) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) and the regulations promulgated under the Act by USDA.
(a) Your insurance policy will be canceled if you are determined, by the appropriate Agency, to be in violation of these provisions.
(b) We will recover any and all monies paid to you or received by you during your period of ineligibility, and your premium will be refunded, less an amount for expenses and handling equal to 20 percent of the premium paid or to be paid by you.

# 27. Applicability of State and Local Statutes
If the provisions of this policy conflict with statutes of the State or locality in which this policy is issued, the policy provisions will prevail. State and local laws and regulations in conflict with Federal statutes, this policy, and the applicable regulations do not apply to this policy.

# 28. Concealment, Misrepresentation, or Fraud
(a) If you have falsely or fraudulently concealed the fact that you are ineligible to receive benefits under the Act or if you or anyone assisting you has intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact relating to this policy:
(1) This policy will be voided; and
(2) You may be subject to remedial sanctions in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart R.
(b) Even though the policy is void, you will still be required to pay 20 percent of the premium that you would otherwise be required to pay to offset costs incurred by us in the service of this policy. If previously paid, the balance of the premium will be returned.
(c) Voidance of this policy will result in you having to reimburse all indemnities paid for the crop year in which the voidance was effective.

# 29. Multiple Benefits
(a) If you are eligible to receive an indemnity under an additional coverage plan of insurance and are also eligible to receive benefits for the same loss under any other USDA program, you may receive benefits under both programs, unless specifically limited by the crop insurance contract or by law.
(b) Any amount received for the same loss from any USDA program, in addition to the crop insurance payment, will not exceed the difference between the crop insurance payment and the amount of the loss, unless otherwise provided by law. The amount of loss is the difference between the total value of the insured crop before the loss and the total value of the insured crop after the loss.
(c) FSA or another USDA agency, as applicable, will determine and pay the additional amount due you for any applicable USDA program, after first considering the amount of any crop insurance indemnity.

# 30. Examples
The following are examples of the calculation of the premium, amount of insurance and indemnity for each of the three plans of insurance under ARPI. Your information will likely be different and you should consult the actuarial documents in your county and the policy information. The following facts are for illustration purposes only and apply to each of the examples.
Producer A farms 100 acres in county X and has a 100 percent share, or 1.000, in those acres. From the actuarial documents in county X, Producer A elects the 75 percent coverage level and a protection factor of 110 percent or 1.10. The actuarial documents in county X also show that the expected county yield is 141.4 bushels per acre, the projected price is $4.00, and the expected county revenue is $565.60. The subsidy factor for the 75 percent coverage level is .55 for revenue coverage and .59 for yield coverage. The loss limit factor is 18 percent or .18. At the end of the insurance period, for county X, FCIC releases a harvest price of $4.57 and a final county yield for county X of 75.0 bushels.
The premium rate is based on the published volatility factor and for this example is .0166 for Area Revenue Protection, .0146 for Area Revenue Protection with Harvest Price Exclusion, and .0116 for Area Yield Protection.
Area Revenue Protection example
:

# Step 1: Calculate the Dollar Amount of Insurance per Acre
Formula: Expected county yield times projected price times protection factor equals dollar amount of insurance
141.4 bushels × $4.00 × 1.1 = $622.16 dollar amount of insurance per acre

# Step 2: Calculate the Policy Protection
Formula: Dollar amount of insurance per acre times acres times share equals policy protection
$622.16 × 100.0 × 1.000 = $62,216 policy protection

# Step 3: Calculate the Total Premium
Formula: Policy protection times premium rate equals total premium
$62,216 × .0166 = $1,033 total premium

# Step 4: Calculate the Subsidy amount
Formula: Total premium times subsidy factor equals subsidy
$1,033 × .55 = $568 subsidy

# Step 5: Calculate the Producer Premium
Formula: Total premium minus subsidy equals producer premium
$1,033 − $568 = $465 producer premium

# Step 6: Calculate the Final Policy Protection
Formula: Expected county yield times (greater of projected price or harvest price) times protection factor times acres times share equals Final Policy Protection
141.4 bushels × $4.57 × 1.10 × 100.0 × 1.000 = $71,082 final policy protection

# Step 7: Calculate the Final County Revenue
Formula: Final county yield times harvest price equals final county revenue
75.0 bushels × $4.57 = $342.75 final county revenue

# Step 8: Calculate the Trigger Revenue
Formula: Expected county yield times (greater of projected price or harvest price) times coverage level equals trigger revenue
141.4 bushels × $4.57 × .75 = $484.65 trigger revenue

# Step 9: Calculate the Payment Factor
Formula: (Trigger revenue minus final county revenue) divided by (trigger revenue minus (expected county yield times the greater of projected or harvest price times loss limit factor)) equals payment factor
($484.65 − $342.75) ÷ ($484.65−(141.4 × $4.57 × .18)) = .385 payment factor

# Step 10: Calculate the Indemnity
Formula: Final policy protection times payment factor equals indemnity
$71,082 × .385 = $27,367 indemnity
Area Revenue Protection with Harvest Price Exclusion example:

# Step 1: Calculate the Dollar Amount of Insurance per Acre
Formula: Expected county yield times projected price times protection factor equals dollar amount of insurance
141.4 bushels × $4.00 × 1.10 = $622.16 dollar amount of insurance per acre

# Step 2: Calculate the Policy Protection
Formula: Dollar amount of insurance per acre times acres times share equals policy protection
$622.16 × 100.0 × 1.000 = $62,216 policy protection

# Step 3: Calculate the Total Premium
Formula: Policy protection times rate equals total premium
$62,216 × .0146 rate = $908 total premium

# Step 4: Calculate the Subsidy Amount
Formula: Total premium times subsidy factor equals subsidy
$908 × .55 = $499 subsidy

# Step 5: Calculate the Producer Premium
Formula: Total premium minus subsidy equals producer premium
$908 − $499 = $409 producer premium

# Step 6: Calculate the Final Policy Protection
Use the policy protection amount calculated at the beginning of the insurance period in Step 2
$62,216 policy protection

# Step 7: Calculate the Final County Revenue
Formula: Final county yield times harvest price equals final county revenue
75.0 bushels × $4.57 = $342.75 final county revenue

# Step 8: Calculate the Trigger Revenue
Formula: Expected county yield times projected price times coverage level equals trigger revenue
141.4 bushels × $4.00 × .75 = $424.20 trigger revenue

# Step 9: Calculate the Payment Factor
Formula: (Trigger revenue minus final county revenue) divided by (trigger revenue minus (expected county yield times projected price times loss limit factor)) equals payment factor
($424.20 − $342.75) ÷ ($424.20 − (141.4 × $4.00 × .18)) = .253

# Step 10: Calculate the Indemnity
Formula: Final policy protection times payment factor equals indemnity
$62,216 × .253 = $15741 indemnity

# Area Yield Protection example:

# Step 1: Calculate the Dollar Amount of Insurance per Acre
Formula: Expected county yield times projected price times protection factor equals dollar amount of insurance
141.4 bushels × $4.00 × 1.10 = $622.16 dollar amount of insurance per acre

# Step 2: Calculate the Policy Protection
Formula: Dollar amount of insurance per acre times acres times share = policy protection
$622.16 × 100.0 × 1.000 = $62,216 policy protection

# Step 3: Calculate the Total Premium
Formula: policy protection times premium rate equals total premium
$62,216 × .0116 rate = $722 total premium

# Step 4: Calculate the Subsidy amount
Formula: Total premium times subsidy factor equals subsidy
$722 × .59 subsidy factor = $426 subsidy

# Step 5: Calculate the Producer Premium
Formula: Total premium minus subsidy equals producer premium
$722 − $426 = $296 producer premium

# Step 6: Calculate the Final Policy Protection
Use the policy protection amount calculated at the beginning of the insurance period in Step 2
$62,216 policy protection

# Step 7: Calculate the Trigger Yield
Formula: Expected county yield times coverage level equals trigger yield
141.4 bushels times .75 = 106.1 bushels

# Step 8: Calculate the Payment Factor
Formula: (Trigger yield minus final county yield) divided by (trigger yield minus (expected county yield times loss limit factor)) equals payment factor
(106.1 bushels − 75.0 bushels) ÷ (106.1 bushels − (141.4 bushels × .18)) = .386

# Step 9: Calculate the Indemnity
Formula: Final policy protection times payment factor equals indemnity
$62,216 times .386 = $24,015 Indemnity

# 31. Correction of Errors.
(a) In addition to any other corrections allowed in your policy subject to section 31(b), we may correct:
(1) Within 60 days after the sales closing date, any incorrect information on your application or provided by the sales closing date, including identification numbers for you and any person with a substantial beneficial interest in you, to ensure that the eligibility information is correct and consistent with information reported by you to any USDA agency;
(2) Within 30 days after the acreage reporting date, information reported to reconcile errors in the information with correct information that has been determined by any USDA agency;
(3) Within 30 days of any subsequent correction of data by FSA, erroneous information corrected as a result of verification of information; and
(4) At any time, any incorrect information if the incorrect information was caused by electronic transmission errors by us or errors made by any agency within USDA in transmitting the information provided by you for purposes of other USDA programs.
(b) Corrections may be made but will not take effect for the current crop year if the correction would allow you to:
(1) Avoid ineligibility requirements for insurance or obtain a disproportionate benefit under the crop insurance program or any related program administered by the Secretary;
(2) Obtain, enhance, or increase an insurance guarantee or indemnity if a cause of loss exists or has occurred before any correction has been made, or avoid premium owed if no loss is likely to occur; or
(3) Avoid an obligation or requirement under any Federal or State law.

§ 412.1
General statement.
This part is issued in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture published at 7 CFR 1.1-1.23, and appendix A, implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). The Secretary's regulations, as implemented by this part, and the Risk Management Agency (RMA) govern availability of records of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) as administration of the crop insurance program for FCIC.
§ 412.2
Public inspection and copying.
(a) Members of the public may request access to the information specified in § 412.2(d) for inspection and copying.
(b) To obtain access to specified information, the public should submit a written request, in accordance with 7 CFR 1.6, to the Appeals, Litigation and Legal Liaison Staff, Risk Management Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW, STOP 0807, room 6618-S, Washington, DC 20250-0807, from 9:00 a.m.-4:00 pm., EDT Monday through Friday, except holidays.
(c) When the information requested is not located at the office of the Appeals, Litigation and Legal Liaison Staff, the Appeals, Litigation and Legal Liaison Staff will direct the request to the appropriate office where the information can be obtained. The requester will be informed that the request has been forwarded to the appropriate office.
(d) FCIC will make available for inspection and copying, unless otherwise exempt from publication under sections 552(a)(2)(C) and 552(b):
(1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions and orders made in the adjudication of cases; and
(2) Those statements of policy and interpretations that have been adopted by FCIC and RMA and are not published in the
Federal Register
; and
(3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.
§ 412.3
Index.
5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) requires that each agency publish, or otherwise make available, a current index of all materials available for public inspection and copying. RMA and FCIC will maintain a current index providing identifying information for the public as to any material issued, adopted, or promulgated by the Agency since July 4, 1967, and required by section 552(a)(2). Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act provisions, RMA and FCIC have determined that in view of the small number of public requests for such index, publication of such an index would be unnecessary and impracticable. Copies of the index will be available upon request in person or by mail at the address stated in § 412.2(b).
§ 412.4
Requests for records.
The Director of the Appeals, Litigation and Legal Liaison staff, RMA located at the above stated address, is the person authorized to receive Freedom of Information Act and to determine whether to grant or deny such requests in accordance with 7 CFR 1.8.

Appeals.
Any person whose request under § 412.4 is denied shall have the right to appeal such denial. This appeal shall be submitted in accordance with 7 CFR 1.13 and addressed to the Manager, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, United States Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., STOP 0807, room 6618-S, Washington, DC 20250-0807.
§ 412.6

§ 457.1
Applicability.
The provisions of this part are applicable only to crops for which a crop provision is published as a section to 7 CFR part 457 and then only for the crops and crop year designated by the application section.
§ 457.2
Availability of Federal crop insurance.
(a) Insurance shall be offered under the provisions of this section on the insured crop in counties within the limits prescribed by and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (the Act). The crops and counties shall be designated by the Manager of the Corporation from those approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
(b) The insurance is offered through companies reinsured by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) that offer contracts containing the same terms and conditions as the contract set out in this part. These contracts are clearly identified as being reinsured by FCIC. FCIC may offer the contract for the catastrophic level of coverage contained in this part and part 402 directly to the insured through local offices of the Department of Agriculture only if the Secretary determines that the availability of local agents is not adequate. Those contracts are specifically identified as being offered by FCIC.
(c) Except as specified in the Crop Provisions, the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement (part 402 of this chapter) and part 400, subpart T of this chapter, no person may have in force more than one contract on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county.
(d) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if a person has more than one contract authorized under the Act that provides coverage for the same loss on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county, all such contracts shall be voided for that crop year and the person will be liable for the premium on all contracts, unless the person can show to the satisfaction of the Corporation that the multiple contracts of insurance were without the fault of the person.
(1) If the multiple contracts of insurance are shown to be without the fault of the person and:
(i) One contract is an additional coverage policy and the other contract is a Catastrophic Risk Protection policy, the additional coverage policy will apply if both policies are with the same insurance provider, or if not, both insurance providers agree, and the Catastrophic Risk Protection policy will be canceled (If the insurance providers do not agree, the policy with the earliest date of application will be in force and the other contract will be canceled); or
(ii) Both contracts are additional coverage policies or both are Catastrophic Risk Protection policies, the contract with the earliest signature date on the application will be valid and the other contract on that crop in the county for that crop year will be canceled, unless both policies are with the same insurance provider and the insurance provider agrees otherwise or both policies are with different insurance providers and both insurance providers agree otherwise.
(2) No liability for any indemnity, prevented planting payment, replanting payment or premium will attach to the contracts canceled as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(e) The person must repay all amounts received in violation of this section with interest at the rate contained in the contract (see § 457.8, paragraph 24).
(f) An insured whose contract with the Corporation or with a company reinsured by the Corporation under the Act has been terminated because of violation of the terms of the contract is not eligible to obtain multiple peril crop insurance under the Act with the Corporation or with a company reinsured by the Corporation unless the insured can show that the default in the prior contract was cured prior to the sales closing date of the contract applied for or unless the insured can show that the termination was improper and should not result in subsequent ineligibility.
(g) All applicants for insurance under the Act must advise the agent, in writing, at the time of application, of any previous applications for insurance or
policies of insurance under the Act and the present status of any such applications or insurance.
[56 FR 1351, Jan. 14, 1991, as amended at 58 FR 58262, Nov. 1, 1993; 62 FR 65154, Dec. 10, 1997; 63 FR 66712, Dec. 3, 1998; 69 FR 48738, Aug. 10, 2004]
§ 457.3
Premium rates, production guarantees or amounts of insurance, coverage levels, and prices at which indemnities shall be computed.
(a) The Manager shall establish premium rates, production guarantees or amounts of insurance, coverage levels, and prices at which indemnities shall be computed for the insured crop which will be included in the actuarial table on file in the applicable agents' office for the county and which may be changed from year to year.
(b) At the time the application for insurance is made, the applicant will elect an amount of insurance or a coverage level and price from among those contained in the actuarial table for the crop year.
§ 457.4
OMB control numbers.
The information collection requirements contained in these regulations have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number 0563-0053.
[62 FR 65154, Dec. 10, 1997]
§ 457.5
Creditors.
An interest of a person in an insured crop existing by virtue of a lien, mortgage, garnishment, levy, execution, bankruptcy, involuntary transfer or other similar interest shall not entitle the holder of the interest to any benefit under the contract.
§ 457.6
[Reserved]
§ 457.7
The contract.
The insurance contract shall become effective upon the acceptance by the Corporation or the reinsured company of a duly executed application for insurance on a form prescribed by the Corporation. Changes made in the contract shall not affect its continuity from year to year. No indemnity shall be paid unless the insured complies with all terms and conditions of the contract, except as provided in the policy. The forms referred to in the contract are available at the offices of the crop insurance agent.
[56 FR 1351, Jan. 14, 1991, as amended at 69 FR 48739, Aug. 10, 2004]
§ 457.8
The application and policy.
(a) Application for insurance on a form prescribed by the Corporation, or approved by the Corporation, must be made by any person who wishes to participate in the program, to cover such person's share in the insured crop as landlord, owner-operator, crop ownership interest, or tenant. No other person's interest in the crop may be insured under an application unless that person's interest is clearly shown on the application and unless that other person's interest is insured in accordance with the procedures of the Corporation. The application must be submitted to the Corporation or the reinsured company through the crop insurance agent and must be submitted on or before the applicable sales closing date on file.
(b) FCIC or the reinsured company may reject or discontinue the acceptance of applications in any county or of any individual application upon FCIC's determination that the insurance risk is excessive.

there are two partnerships that
each have a 50 percent interest in you and each partnership is made up of two individuals, each with a 50 percent share in the partnership. In this case, each individual would be considered to have a 25 percent interest in you, and both the partnerships and the individuals would have a substantial beneficial interest in you. The spouses of the individuals would not be considered to have a substantial beneficial interest unless the spouse was one of the individuals that made up the partnership. However, if each partnership is made up of six individuals with equal interests, then each would only have an 8.33 percent interest in you and although the partnership would still have a substantial beneficial interest in you, the individuals would not for the purposes of reporting in section 2). The spouse of any individual applicant or individual insured will be presumed to have a substantial beneficial interest in the applicant or insured unless the spouses can prove they are legally separated or otherwise legally separate under the applicable State dissolution of marriage laws.

# 2. Life of Policy, Cancellation, and Termination
(a) This is a continuous policy and will remain in effect for each crop year following the acceptance of the original application until canceled by you in accordance with the terms of the policy or terminated by operation of the terms of the policy or by us. In accordance with section 4, FCIC may change the coverage provided from year to year.

(2) You must include your EIN if you are a person other than an individual;
(3) In addition to the requirements of section 2(b)(1) or (2), you must include the following for all persons who have a substantial beneficial interest in you:
(i) The SSN for individuals; or
(ii) The EIN for persons other than individuals and the SSNs for all individuals that comprise the person with the EIN if such individuals also have a substantial beneficial interest in you;
(4) You must include:
(i) Your election of revenue protection, yield protection, or other available plan of insurance; coverage level; percentage of price election or percentage of projected price, as applicable; crop, type, variety, or class; and any other material information required on the application to insure the crop; and
(ii) All the information required in section 2(b)(4)(i) or your application will not be accepted and no coverage will be provided;
(5) Your application will not be accepted and no insurance will be provided for the year of application if the application does not contain your SSN or EIN. If your application contains an incorrect SSN or EIN for you, your application will be considered not to have been accepted, no insurance will be provided for the year of application and for any subsequent crop years, as applicable, and such policies will be void if:
(i) Such number is not corrected by you; or
(ii) You correct the SSN or EIN but:
(A) You cannot prove that any error was inadvertent (simply stating the error was inadvertent is not sufficient to prove the error was inadvertent); or
(B) It is determined that the incorrect number would have allowed you to obtain disproportionate benefits under the crop insurance program, you are determined to be ineligible for insurance or you could avoid an obligation or requirement under any State or Federal law;
(6) With respect to persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you:
(i) The insurance coverage for all crops included on your application will be reduced proportionately by the percentage interest in you of persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you (presumed to be 50 percent for spouses of individuals) if the SSNs or EINs of such persons are included on your application, the SSNs or EINs are correct, and the persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you are ineligible for insurance;
(ii) Your policies for all crops included on your application, and for all applicable crop years, will be void if the SSN or EIN of any person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is incorrect or is not included on your application and:
(A) Such number is not corrected or provided by you, as applicable;
(B) You cannot prove that any error or omission was inadvertent (simply stating the error or omission was inadvertent is not sufficient to prove the error or omission was inadvertent); or
(C) Even after the correct SSN or EIN is provided by you, it is determined that the incorrect or omitted SSN or EIN would have allowed you to obtain disproportionate benefits under the crop insurance program, the person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is determined to be ineligible for insurance, or you or the person with a substantial beneficial interest in you could avoid an obligation or requirement under any State or Federal law; or
(iii) Except as provided in sections 2(b)(6)(ii)(B) and (C), your policies will not be voided if you subsequently provide the correct SSN or EIN for persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you and the persons are eligible for insurance;
(7) When any of your policies are void under sections 2(b)(5) or (6):
(i) You must repay any indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment that may have been paid for all applicable crops and crop years;
(ii) Even though the policies are void, you will still be required to pay an amount equal to 20 percent of the premium that you would otherwise be required to pay; and
(iii) If you previously paid premium or administrative fees, any amount in excess of the amount required in section 2(b)(7)(ii) will be returned to you;
(8) Notwithstanding any of the provisions in this section, if you certify to an incorrect SSN or EIN, or receive an indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment and the SSN or EIN was not correct, you may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions;
(9) If any of the information regarding persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you changes after the sales closing date for the previous crop year, you must revise your application by the sales closing date for the current crop year to reflect the correct information. However, if such information changed less than 30 days before the sales closing date for the current crop year, you must revise your application by the sales closing date for the next crop year. If you fail to provide the required revisions, the provisions in section 2(b)(6) will apply; and
(10) If you are, or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is, not eligible to obtain a SSN or EIN, whichever is required, you must request an assigned number for the purposes of this policy from us:
(i) A number will be provided only if you can demonstrate you are, or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in you is, eligible to receive Federal benefits;
(ii) If a number cannot be provided for you in accordance with section 2(b)(10)(i), your application will not be accepted; or
(iii) If a number cannot be provided for any person with a substantial beneficial interest in you in accordance with section 2(b)(10)(i), the amount of coverage for all crops on the application will be reduced proportionately by the percentage interest of such person in you.
(c) After acceptance of the application, you may not cancel this policy for the initial crop year. Thereafter, the policy will continue in force for each succeeding crop year unless canceled or terminated as provided below.
(d) You may cancel this policy after the initial crop year by providing written notice to us on or before the cancellation date shown in the Crop Provisions. We may cancel this policy with express written consent from FCIC.
(e) Any amount owed to us for any policy authorized under the Act will be offset from any indemnity or prevented planting payment due you for this or any other crop insured with us under the authority of the Act.
(1) Even if your claim has not yet been paid, you must still pay the premium and administrative fee on or before the termination date for you to remain eligible for insurance.
(2) If we offset any amount due us from an indemnity or prevented planting payment owed to you, the date of payment for the purpose of determining whether you have a delinquent debt will be the date that you submit the claim for indemnity in accordance with section 14(e) (Your Duties).
(3) For this agricultural commodity policy, your premium and administrative fees will be offset from any indemnity or prevented planting payment due to you even if it is prior to the premium billing date.
(4) For any other agricultural commodity policy insured with us and it is:
(i) Prior to the premium billing date, and you agree, your premium and administrative fees will be offset from any indemnity or prevented planting payment due to you; or
(ii) On or after the premium billing date, your premium and administrative fees will be offset from any indemnity or prevented planting payment due to you.
(f) A delinquent debt for any policy will make you ineligible to obtain crop insurance authorized under the Act for any subsequent crop year and result in termination of all policies in accordance with section 2(f)(2).
(1) With respect to ineligibility:
(i) Ineligibility for crop insurance will be effective on:
(A) The date that a policy was terminated in accordance with section 2(f)(2) for the crop for which you failed to pay premium, an administrative fee, or any related interest owed, as applicable;
(B) The payment due date contained in any notification of indebtedness for any overpaid indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment, if you fail to pay the amount owed, including any related interest owed, as applicable, by such due date; or
(C) The termination date for the crop year prior to the crop year in which a scheduled payment is due under a written payment agreement if you fail to pay the amount owed by any payment date in any agreement to pay the debt.
(ii) If you are ineligible and a policy has been terminated in accordance with section 2(f)(2), you will not receive any indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment, if applicable, and such ineligibility and termination of the policy may affect your eligibility for benefits under other USDA programs. Any indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment that may be owed for the policy before it has been terminated will remain owed to you, but may be offset in accordance with section
2(e), unless your policy was terminated in accordance with sections 2(f)(2)(i)(A), (B) or (D).
(2) With respect to termination:
(i) Termination will be effective on:
(A) For a policy with unpaid administrative fees or premiums, the termination date immediately subsequent to the billing date for the crop year (For policies for which the sales closing date is prior to the termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to have attached for the crop year and no indemnity, prevented planting or replanting payment will be owed.);
(B) For a policy with other amounts due, the termination date immediately following the date you have a delinquent debt (For policies for which the sales closing date is prior to the termination date, such policies will terminate for the current crop year even if insurance attached prior to the termination date. Such termination will be considered effective as of the sales closing date and no insurance will be considered to have attached for the crop year and no indemnity, prevented planting or replanting payment will be owed.);
(C) For all other policies that are issued by us under the authority of the Act, the termination date that coincides with the termination date for the policy with the delinquent debt or, if there is no coincidental termination date, the termination date immediately following the date you become ineligible; or
(D) For execution of a written payment agreement and failure to make any scheduled payment, the termination date for the crop year prior to the crop year in which you failed to make the scheduled payment (for this purpose only, the crop year will start the day after the termination date and end on the next termination date,
e.g.,
if the termination date is November 30 and you fail to make a payment on November 15, 2019, your policy will terminate on November 30, 2018, for the 2019 crop year).
(ii) For all policies terminated under sections 2(f)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (D), any indemnities, prevented planting payments or replanting payments paid subsequent to the termination date must be repaid.
(iii) Once the policy is terminated, it cannot be reinstated for the current crop year unless:
(A) The termination was in error;
(B) The Administrator of the Risk Management Agency, at his or her sole discretion, determines that the following are met:
(
1
) In accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and FCIC procedures, you provide documentation that your inadvertent failure to pay your debt is due to an unforeseen or unavoidable event or other extenuating circumstances that created the inadvertent failure for you to make timely payment;
(
2
) You remit full payment of the delinquent debt owed to us or FCIC with your request submitted in accordance with section 2(f)(2)(iii)(B)(
3
); and
(
3
) You submit a written request for reinstatement of your policy to us no later than 60 days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in the notice to you of the amount due, if applicable.
(
i
) If authorization for reinstatement, as defined in 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, is granted, your policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which you were determined ineligible, and you will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided you meet all eligibility requirements and comply with the terms of the policy; and
(
ii
) There is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation; or
(C) We determine that, in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and FCIC procedures, the following are met:
(
1
) You can demonstrate:
(
i
) You made timely payment for the amount of premium owed but you inadvertently omitted some small amount, such as the most recent month's interest or a small administrative fee;
(
ii
) The amount of the payment was clearly transposed from the amount that was otherwise due (for example, you owed $892 but you paid $829);
(
iii
) You timely made the full payment of the amount owed but the delivery of that payment was delayed, and was postmarked no more than seven calendar days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date specified in a notice to you of an amount due, as applicable; or
(
iv
) For previously executed written payment agreements, you made the full payment of the scheduled payment amount owed within 15 calendar days after the missed payment date.
(
2
) You remit full payment of the delinquent debt owed to us; and
(
3
) You submit a written request for reinstatement of your policy to us in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and applicable procedures no later than 30 days after the termination date or the missed payment date of a previously executed written payment agreement, or in the case of overpaid indemnity or any amount that became due after the termination date, the due date
specified in the notice to you of the amount due, if applicable; and
(
4
) If authorization for reinstatement, as defined in 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, is granted, your policies will be reinstated effective at the beginning of the crop year for which you were determined ineligible, and you will be entitled to all applicable benefits under such policies, provided you meet all eligibility requirements and comply with the terms of the policy; and
(
5
) There is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation.
(iv) A determination made under:
(A) Section 2(f)(2)(iii)(B) may only be appealed to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR part 11; and
(B) Section 2(f)(2)(iii)(C) may only be appealed in accordance with section 20.
(3) To regain eligibility, you must:
(i) Repay the delinquent debt in full;
(ii) Execute a written payment agreement, in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart U, and make payments in accordance with the agreement; or
(iii) Have your debts discharged in bankruptcy.
(4) After you become eligible for crop insurance, if you want to obtain coverage for your crops, you must submit a new application on or before the sales closing date for the crop (since applications for crop insurance cannot be accepted after the sales closing date, if you make any payment after the sales closing date, you cannot apply for insurance until the next crop year).
(5) For example, for the 2019 crop year, if crop A, with a termination date of October 31, 2018, and crop B, with a termination date of March 15, 2019, are insured and you do not pay the premium for crop A by the termination date, you are ineligible for crop insurance as of October 31, 2018, and crop A's policy is terminated as of that date. Crop B's policy does not terminate until March 15, 2019, and an indemnity for the 2018 crop year may still be owed. If you enter into a written payment agreement on September 25, 2019, the earliest date by which you can obtain crop insurance for crop A is to apply for crop insurance by the October 31, 2019, sales closing date and for crop B is to apply for crop insurance by the March 15, 2020, sales closing date. If you fail to make a payment that was scheduled to be made on April 1, 2020, your policy will terminate as of October 31, 2019, for crop A, and March 15, 2020, for crop B, and no indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment will be due for that crop year for either crop. You will not be eligible to apply for crop insurance for any crop until after the amounts owed are paid in full or you have your debts discharged in bankruptcy.
(6) If you are determined to be ineligible under section 2(f), persons with a substantial beneficial interest in you may also be ineligible until you become eligible again.
(g) In cases where there has been a death, disappearance, judicially declared incompetence, or dissolution of any insured person:
(1) If any married individual insured dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent, the named insured on the policy will automatically convert to the name of the spouse if:
(i) The spouse was included on the policy as having a substantial beneficial interest in the named insured; and
(ii) The spouse has a share of the crop.
(2) The provisions in section 2(g)(3) will be applicable if:
(i) Any partner, member, shareholder,
etc.,
of an insured person dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent, and such event automatically dissolves the person; or
(ii) An individual, whose estate is left to a beneficiary other than a spouse or left to the spouse and the criteria in section 2(g)(1) are not met, dies, disappears, or is judicially declared incompetent.
(3) If section 2(g)(2) applies and the death, disappearance, or judicially declared incompetence occurred:
(i) More than 30 days before the cancellation date, the policy is automatically canceled as of the cancellation date and a new application must be submitted; or
(ii) Thirty days or less before the cancellation date, or after the cancellation date, the policy will continue in effect through the crop year immediately following the cancellation date and be automatically canceled as of the cancellation date immediately following the end of the insurance period for the crop year, unless canceled by the cancellation date prior to the start of the insurance period:
(A) A new application for insurance must be submitted prior to the sales closing date for coverage for the subsequent crop year; and
(B) Any indemnity, replanting payment or prevented planting payment will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially entitled to the payment and such person or persons must comply with all policy provisions and pay the premium.
(4) If any insured person is dissolved for reasons other than death, disappearance, or judicially declared incompetence:
(i) Before the cancellation date, the policy is automatically canceled as of the cancellation date and a new application must be submitted; or
(ii) On or after the cancellation date, the policy will continue in effect through the crop year immediately following the cancellation date and be automatically canceled as of the cancellation date immediately following the end of the insurance period for
the crop year, unless canceled by the cancellation date prior to the start of the insurance period:
(A) A new application for insurance must be submitted prior to the sales closing date for coverage for the subsequent crop year; and
(B) Any indemnity, replanting payment or prevented planting payment will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially entitled to the payment and such person or persons must comply with all policy provisions and pay the premium.
(5) If section 2(g)(2) or (4) applies, a remaining member of the insured person or the beneficiary is required to report to us the death, disappearance, judicial incompetence, or other event that causes dissolution not later than the next cancellation date, except if section 2(g)(3)(ii) applies, notice must be provided by the cancellation date for the next crop year. If notice is not provided timely, the provisions of section 2(g)(2) or (4) will apply retroactive to the date such notice should have been provided and any payments made after the date the policy should have been canceled must be returned.
(h) We may cancel your policy if no premium is earned for 3 consecutive years.
(i) The cancellation and termination dates are contained in the Crop Provisions.
(j) Any person may sign any document relative to crop insurance coverage on behalf of any other person covered by such a policy, provided that the person has a properly executed power of attorney or such other legally sufficient document authorizing such person to sign. You are still responsible for the accuracy of all information provided on your behalf and may be subject to the consequences in section 6(g), and any other applicable consequences, if any information has been misreported.

# 3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices
(a) Unless adjusted or limited in accordance with your policy, the production guarantee or amount of insurance, coverage level, and price at which an indemnity will be determined for each unit will be those used to calculate your summary of coverage for each crop year.
(b) With respect to the insurance choices:
(1) For all acreage of the insured crop in the county, unless one of the conditions in section 3(b)(2) exists, you must select the same:
(i) Plan of insurance (
e.g.,
yield protection, revenue protection, actual production history, amount of insurance,
etc.
);
(ii) Level of coverage (all catastrophic risk protection or the same level of additional coverage); and
(iii) Percentage of the available price election, or projected price for yield protection. For revenue protection, the percentage of price is specified in section 3(c)(2). If different prices are provided by type or variety, insurance will be based on the price provided for each type or variety and the same price percentage will apply to all types or varieties.
(2) You do not have to select the same plan of insurance, level of coverage or percentage of available price election or projected price if:
(i) The applicable Crop Provisions allow you the option to separately insure individual crop types or varieties. In this case, each individual type or variety insured by you will be subject to separate administrative fees. For example, if two grape varieties in California are insured under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement and two varieties are insured under an additional coverage policy, a separate administrative fee will be charged for each of the four varieties; or
(ii) You have additional coverage for the crop in the county with acreage designated as high-risk by FCIC and you execute a High-Risk Land Exclusion Option on or before the applicable sales closing date with the same insurance provider from which your additional coverage was obtained. The High-Risk Land Exclusion Option allows you the following choices for your high-risk land:
(A) You may exclude coverage for high-risk land under the additional coverage policy and not insure it;
(B) You may insure high-risk land under a separate Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement; or
(C) If available in the actuarial documents, you may insure high-risk land on a separate additional coverage policy with coverage greater than provided by the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement but less than the coverage elected on the additional coverage policy insuring your non-high-risk land.
(iii) You have additional coverage for the crop in the county, and the actuarial documents provide for separate coverage by irrigated and non-irrigated practices for the crop.
(A) You may select one coverage level for all irrigated acreage and one coverage level for all non-irrigated acreage. For example: You may choose a 65 percent coverage level for all irrigated acreage (corn irrigated practice) and an 80 percent coverage level for all non-irrigated acreage (corn non-irrigated practice).
(B) If the Crop Provisions allow the option to separately insure individual crop types or varieties, and the actuarial documents provide for separate coverage, you may select coverage levels by irrigated and non-irrigated practice for each separate type or variety.
(c) With respect to revenue protection, if available for the crop:
(1) You may change to another plan of insurance and change your coverage level or elect the harvest price exclusion by giving written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the insured crop;
(2) Your projected price and harvest price will be 100 percent of the projected price and harvest price issued by FCIC;
(3) If the harvest price exclusion is:
(i) Not elected, your projected price is used to initially determine the revenue protection guarantee (per acre), and if the harvest price is greater than the projected price, the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) will be recomputed using your harvest price; or
(ii) Elected, your projected price is used to compute your revenue protection guarantee (per acre);
(4) Your projected price is used to calculate your premium, any replanting payment, and any prevented planting payment; and
(5) If the projected price or harvest price cannot be calculated for the current crop year under the provisions contained in the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions:
(i) For the projected price:
(A) Revenue protection will not be provided and you will automatically be covered under the yield protection plan of insurance for the current crop year unless you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your plan of insurance by the sales closing date;
(B) Notice will be provided on RMA's website by the date specified in the applicable projected price definition contained in the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions;
(C) The projected price will be determined by FCIC and will be released by the date specified in the applicable projected price definition contained in the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions; and
(D) Your coverage will automatically revert to revenue protection for the next crop year that revenue protection is available unless you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your coverage by the sales closing date; or
(ii) For the harvest price:
(A) Revenue protection will continue to be available; and
(B) The harvest price will be determined and announced by FCIC.
(d) With respect to yield protection, if available for the crop:
(1) You may change to another plan of insurance and change your percentage of price and your coverage level by giving written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the insured crop;
(2) The percentage of the projected price selected by you multiplied by the projected price issued by FCIC is your projected price that is used to compute the value of your production guarantee (per acre) and the value of the production to count; and
(3) Since the projected price may change each year, if you do not select a new percentage of the projected price on or before the sales closing date, we will assign a percentage which bears the same relationship to the percentage that was in effect for the preceding year (
e.g.,
if you selected 100 percent of the projected price for the previous crop year and you do not select a new percentage for the current crop year, we will assign 100 percent for the current crop year).
(e) With respect to all plans of insurance other than revenue protection and yield protection (
e.g.,
APH, dollar amount plans of insurance,
etc.
):
(1) In addition to the price election or amount of insurance available on the contract change date, we may provide an additional price election or amount of insurance no later than 15 days prior to the sales closing date.
(i) You must select the additional price election or amount of insurance on or before the sales closing date for the insured crop.
(ii) These additional price elections or amounts of insurance will not be less than those available on the contract change date.
(iii) If you elect the additional price election or amount of insurance, any claim settlement and amount of premium will be based on your additional price election or amount of insurance.
(2) You may change to another plan of insurance or change your coverage level, amount of insurance or percentage of the price election, as applicable, for the following crop year by giving written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the insured crop.
(3) Your amount of insurance will be the amount of insurance issued by FCIC multiplied by the coverage level percentage you elected. Your price election will be the price election issued by FCIC multiplied by the percentage of price you elected.
(4) Since the amount of insurance or price election may change each year, if you do not select a new amount of insurance or percentage of the price election on or before the sales closing date, we will assign an amount of insurance or percentage of the price election which bears the same relationship to the amount of insurance or percentage of the price election that was in effect for the preceding year (
e.g.,
if you selected 100 percent of the price election for the previous crop year and you do not select a new percentage of the price election for the current crop year, we will assign 100 percent of the price election for the current crop year).
(f) A production report(s) is required for all crops with a yield-based plan of insurance, and the information contained within the production report is used to establish your approved yield(s).
(1) You must report your current year's crop production on the same basis used to establish your approved yield(s), by the insured's production reporting date contained in the actuarial documents, or as otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions. This production report will be used to establish approved yield(s) for the following APH crop year. Failure to timely provide this production report will result in assigned yields being used to determine your approved yield(s) for the following APH crop year. In addition to this production report, you may have to provide an additional production report at the beginning of the crop year by the production reporting date contained in the actuarial documents, as follows:
(i) If you are a new insured who grew the crop the year prior to the current crop year, you may report actual production for that crop year and include additional crop years, if continuous production reports are provided. Failure to provide this production report will result in variable T-Yields being used to determine your approved yield(s) for the current crop year.
(ii) If you are an insured who transferred your policy to us for the current crop year, you may provide us with a copy of the completed and signed production report you submitted to your previous insurance provider for the prior APH crop year. This production report will be used to establish your approved yield(s) for the current crop year.
(iii) If we cannot establish your approved yield for any APH database for the current crop year as required by FCIC approved procedures, you must provide us a new production report containing the prior year's production on the basis of the current crop year's unit structure and by type, practice, map area, and other characteristics, if applicable, you are requesting.
(iv) You may certify actual production for any prior APH crop year if your certification meets the requirements of section 3(f)(3) to be used in an APH database(s) for the current crop year when:
(A) Reporting actual production for an APH crop year not previously certified;
(B) Replacing a yield determined in accordance with section 5(b); or
(C) Making a change or revision as authorized in FCIC approved procedures.
(2) Production must be reported by county, crop, type, practice, map area, other characteristics, unit structure elected (or level lower than unit structure elected), and land location in accordance with FCIC approved procedures. To be acceptable for an APH crop year, a production report must:
(i) Be provided annually by you;
(ii) Be certified as accurate by you;
(iii) Be submitted by the applicable production reporting date; and
(iv) Be supported by production records meeting the requirements in section 3(g)(3). Production records must substantiate all information provided on the production report.
(3) Your production report must contain all actual production of the insured crop, from all acreage of the insured crop, which includes insurable, uninsurable and uninsured acreage, for the APH crop year being reported and certified identifying:
(i) Gross and net actual production, with net actual production being gross actual production adjusted for standard deductions that apply under the terms of the policy including test weight, moisture, foreign material, or any other specified deduction, when such deductions are available in the production records;
(ii) Type of acceptable production records;
(iii) Disposition of the crop,
e.g.,
harvested or unharvested; and
(iv) Any other information required on the production report form in accordance with FCIC approved procedures.
(4) If you do not file an acceptable production report by the applicable production reporting date, the annual yield for the applicable APH crop year will be the assigned yield. The assigned yield will be used to calculate your approved yield for the purpose of determining your coverage for the current or following crop year, as applicable. Optional units will not be available the following crop year unless the reason for not filing an acceptable production report is one of the following:
(i) You are a new insured;
(ii) You are unable to provide an acceptable production report by the production reporting date due to the inability to finish harvest because of an insurable cause of loss; or
(iii) Production records are not yet available from a processor, marketing outlet, or similar point of crop distribution or production records are not yet available due to a delayed claim for indemnity.
(5) In the event certified acreage or actual production from two or more persons sharing in the crop on the same acreage for the same APH crop year is different, we or any other person authorized by FCIC shall, at our discretion, determine the acreage and actual production to be used to determine the approved yield. Upon determining the correct acreage and actual production, we will correct your, and any other insured's, production report and APH database, and notify any other insurance provider who may have an insured with a share in the crop for the same acreage. If the correct acreage and actual production cannot be determined, the production report will be considered unacceptable, and you will receive an assigned yield in accordance with section 3(f)(4).
(6) If you have filed a claim for any crop year, the documents signed by you which state the amount of production used to complete
the claim for indemnity will be the production report for that year unless otherwise specified by FCIC.
(7) Appraisals obtained from only a portion of the acreage in a field that remains unharvested after the remainder of the crop within the field has been destroyed or put to another use will not be used to establish your actual yield unless representative samples are required to be left by you in accordance with the Crop Provisions.
(8) If no insurable acreage of the insured crop is planted for a year, a production report indicating zero planted acreage will maintain the continuity of production reports for APH record purposes and that calendar year will not be included in the approved yield calculations.
(g) It is your responsibility to accurately report all information that is used to determine your approved yield.
(1) You must certify to the accuracy of this information on your production report.
(2) If you fail to accurately report any information or if you do not provide any required records, you will be subject to the provisions regarding misreporting contained in section 6(g), unless the information is corrected:
(i) On or before the applicable production reporting date;
(ii) Because the incorrect information was determined to be inadvertently reported by you (simply stating the error was inadvertent is not sufficient to prove the error was inadvertent); or
(iii) Because the incorrect information was the result of our error or the error of someone from USDA.
(3) Records must be available to substantiate production reports, within the tolerances provided in FCIC approved procedures, that document and verify the actual production between types, practices, map areas, unit structures and land locations as certified on the production report.
(4) Acceptable production record requirements for a crop are provided in FCIC approved procedures and identify crops requiring verifiable records or farm management records. These requirements must be met for production records to be acceptable.
(i) Verifiable records include, but are not limited to:
(A) Records of production commercially sold to, or stored by, a disinterested third party;
(B) Claim for indemnity determinations made by an insurance provider, or any other person authorized by FCIC, as applicable;
(C) Documents with actual production verified by another USDA agency;
(D) Appraisal of unharvested acreage performed by an insurance provider or any other person authorized by FCIC;
(E) Measurement of farm-stored production performed by an insurance provider, another USDA agency, or any other person authorized by FCIC;
(F) Pick records identifying the amount of actual production harvested daily by individuals;
(G) Contemporaneous daily sales records; and
(H) Records from recognized or approved precision farming technology systems.
(ii) Farm management records include, but are not limited to:
(A) Measurement of farm stored production performed by you;
(B) Automated yield monitoring systems;
(C) Contemporaneous livestock feeding records;
(D) Field harvest records; and
(E) Seed records.
(5) Acceptable production records must be adjusted for standard deductions that apply under the terms of the policy, including test weight, moisture, foreign material, and any other deductions in accordance with the applicable Crop Provisions or FCIC approved procedures when such deductions are available in the production records.
(6) Acceptable production records must be maintained for the record retention period as provided in section 21(b)(2).
(7) You are not required to maintain production records beyond the record retention period specified in section 21(b)(2); however, we or any other person authorized by FCIC may review any production records that are available from you, or any other sources who may have records of actual production applicable to an APH database, at any time.
(8) You must provide acceptable production records, as specified in section 3(g)(3) through (5):
(i) Upon request by us or any other person authorized by FCIC during the completion of a claim for indemnity; or
(ii) During any audit, review, or when otherwise requested by us or any other person authorized by FCIC to verify acreage, actual production, and all other information certified on the production report.
(9) If you do not have acceptable production records to support the information you certified on your production report you will receive an assigned yield in accordance with section 3(f)(4), for the applicable units, for any APH crop year that does not have such production records in accordance with FCIC approved procedures. If the conditions of section 34(b)(3) are not met, you will receive an assigned yield for the applicable basic unit.
(10) At any time we discover you have misreported any material information used to determine your approved yield or your approved yield is not correct, the following actions will be taken, as applicable:
(i) We will correct your approved yield, in accordance with FCIC procedure, by assigning a yield or by using the yield we determine to be correct, for the crop year such information is not correct, and all subsequent crop years;
(ii) We will correct the unit structure, if necessary;
(iii) Any overpaid indemnity must be repaid or any additional premium we determine to be owed must be paid; and
(iv) You will be subject to the provisions regarding misreporting contained in section 6(g)(1), unless the incorrect information was the result of our error or the error of someone from USDA.
(h) In addition to any consequences in section 3(g), at any time the circumstances described below are discovered, your approved yield will be adjusted:
(1) By including an assigned yield determined in accordance with section 3(f)(4), if the actual yield reported in the APH database is excessive for any crop year, as determined by FCIC under its approved procedures, and you do not provide verifiable records to support the yield in the APH database. If there are verifiable records for the yield in your APH database, but the yield is significantly different from other yields in the county or your other yields for the crop and you cannot prove there is a valid agronomic basis to support the differences in the yields, the yield will be the average of the yields for the crop or the applicable county transitional yield if you have no other yields for the crop;
(2) By reducing it to an amount consistent with the average of the approved yields for other APH databases for your farming operation with the same crop, type, and practice or the county transitional yield, as applicable, if:
(i) The approved APH yield is greater than 115 percent of the average of the approved yields of all applicable APH databases for your farming operation that have actual yields in them or it is greater than 115 percent of the county transitional yield if no applicable APH databases exist for comparison;
(ii) The current year's insurable acreage (including applicable prevented planting acreage) is greater than 400 percent of the average number of acres in the APH database or the acres contained in two or more individual years in the APH database are each less than 10 percent of the current year's insurable acreage in the unit (including applicable prevented planting acreage); and
(iii) We determine there is no valid agronomic basis to support the approved yield; or
(3) To an amount consistent with the production method actually carried out for the crop year if you use a different production method than was previously used and the production method actually carried out is likely to result in a yield lower than the average of your previous actual yields.
(i) The yield will be adjusted to the lower of the:
(A) Approved APH yield for the APH database;
(B) Average of approved APH yields based on your other APH databases where the production method was carried out; or
(C) Applicable county transitional yield for the production method if other such APH databases do not exist.
(ii) You must notify us of changes in your production method by the acreage reporting date. If you fail to notify us, in addition to the reduction of your approved yield described herein, you will be considered to have misreported information and you will be subject to the consequences in section 6(g). For example, for a non-irrigated APH database, your yield is based upon acreage of the crop that is watered once prior to planting, and the crop is not watered prior to planting for the current crop year. Your approved APH yield will be reduced to an amount consistent with the actual production history of your other non-irrigated APH database where the crop has not been watered prior to planting or limited to the non-irrigated transitional yield for the APH database if other such APH databases do not exist.
(i) Unless you meet the double cropping requirements contained in section 17(f)(4), if you elect to plant a second crop on acreage where the first insured crop was prevented from being planted, you will receive a yield equal to 60 percent of the approved yield for the first insured crop to calculate your average yield for subsequent crop years (not applicable) to crops if the APH is not the basis for the insurance guarantee). If the unit contains both prevented planting and planted acreage of the same crop, the yield for such acreage will be determined by:
(1) Multiplying the number of insured prevented planting acres by 60 percent of the approved yield for the first insured crop;
(2) Adding the totals from section 3(i)(1) to the amount of appraised or harvested production for all of the insured planted acreage; and
(3) Dividing the total in section 3(i)(2) by the total number of acres in the unit.
(j) Hail and fire coverage may be excluded from the covered causes of loss for an insured crop only if you select additional coverage of not less than 65 percent of the approved yield indemnified at the 100 percent price election, or an equivalent coverage as established by FCIC, and you have purchased the same or a higher dollar amount of coverage for hail and fire from us or any other source. If you elected a whole-farm unit, you may exclude hail and fire coverage only if allowed by the Special Provisions.
(k) The applicable premium rate, or formula to calculate the premium rate, and transitional yield will be those contained in the actuarial documents except, in the case of high-risk land, a written agreement may be requested to change such transitional yield or premium rate.
(l) Notwithstanding any other provision, if you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher, and were previously involved in a farming or ranching operation, including involvement in the decision-making or physical involvement in the production of the crop or livestock on the farm, for any acreage obtained by you, you may receive a yield that is the higher of:
(1) The actual production history of the previous producer of the crop or livestock on the new acreage; or
(2) Your actual production history.

# 4. Contract Changes
(a) We may change the terms of your coverage under this policy from year to year.
(b) Any changes in policy provisions, amounts of insurance, premium rates, program dates, price elections or the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions, if applicable, can be viewed on RMA's website not later than the contract change date contained in the Crop Provisions (except as allowed herein or as specified in section 3). We may only revise this information after the contract change date to correct clear errors (
e.g.,
the price for oats was announced at $25.00 per bushel instead of $2.50 per bushel or the final planting date should be May 10 but the final planting date in the Special Provisions states August 10).
(c) After the contract change date, all changes specified in section 4(b) will also be available upon request from your crop insurance agent.
(d) Not later than 30 days prior to the cancellation date for the insured crop you will be notified, in accordance with section 33, a copy of the changes to the Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, Commodity Exchange Price Provisions, if applicable, and Special Provisions.
(e) Acceptance of the changes will be conclusively presumed in the absence of notice from you to change or cancel your insurance coverage.

# 5. APH Database and Approved Yield Calculation
(a) With respect to your APH database:
(1) An APH database must be established to determine the approved yield and the average yield, established on the basis of:
(i) Crop;
(ii) Type;
(iii) Practice;
(iv) T-Yield map area;
(v) Unit, as applicable; and
(vi) Other requirements as specified by FCIC approved procedures.
(2) The APH database is established using consecutive annual yields, as determined in section 5(b), for each APH crop year in the APH database.
(b) Annual yields are determined by us, or any other person authorized by FCIC, in accordance with FCIC approved procedures. Annual yields are used in establishment of the APH database, and include the following types of yields:
(1) An actual yield, calculated by dividing the actual production by insurable acres from acceptable production reports, except as follows:
(i) For perennial crop acreage that was previously uninsurable due to underage requirements specified in the Crop Provisions, the actual yield may be calculated using production from the acreage prior to it becoming insurable, in accordance with FCIC approved procedures, when elected by you and you provide acceptable production reports;
(ii) For crop acreage that is damaged by unavoidable uninsured fire or a third party, insurable acreage and actual production from such acreage will not be included in the calculation of the actual yield when elected by you, and approved by us or any person authorized by FCIC, in accordance with FCIC approved procedures; and
(iii) For uninsurable crop acreage, acres and actual production from such acreage may be included in the calculation of the actual yield when actual production from such acreage is commingled with harvested production from insurable acreage;
(2) A temporary yield that is equal to the prior year's approved yield. In subsequent crop years, the temporary yield is replaced by an actual yield from an acceptable production report submitted by you or, in the absence of an acceptable production report, an assigned yield;
(3) An assigned yield if you:
(i) Did not provide an acceptable production report for the previous APH crop year in the APH database; or
(ii) Do not provide acceptable production records for any APH crop year within the record retention period specified in section 21(b)(2) to support, within tolerances established by FCIC approved procedures, information provided on the production report, when requested by us or any other person authorized by FCIC;
(4) A determined yield, designated by FCIC, or calculated and assigned by us, or any other person authorized by FCIC, in situations when the available actual production information and the approved yield is not reflective of the expected actual production for the area, in accordance with section 5(c) and FCIC approved procedures; or
(5) A T-Yield for any APH crop year when there is not a minimum of four years of annual yields in the APH database as outlined in section 5(b)(1) through (4).
(i) A variable percentage will apply to the T-Yield published in the actuarial documents, based on the number of years of actual yields provided for the crop, as follows:
(A) For three years or more, use 100 percent of the applicable T-Yield;
(B) For two years, use 90 percent of the applicable T-Yield;
(C) For one year, use 80 percent of the applicable T-Yield;
(D) For no years, use 65 percent of the applicable T-Yield; or
(E) For qualifying new producers, use 100 percent of the T-Yield published in the actuarial documents.
(ii) A T-Yield may be calculated in accordance with FCIC approved procedures when you add land or new types and practices to your farming operations.
(c) The average yield and approved yield are used to establish the insurance guarantee.
(1) Calculate the average yield and approved yield as follows:
(i) Establish the APH database using annual yields by APH crop year in accordance with section 5(b), prior to any adjustments authorized for annual yields from section 36(a);
(ii) Sum all the annual yields from section 5(c)(1)(i);
(iii) Divide the sum of section 5(c)(1)(ii) by the number of annual yields in the APH database. The result is the average yield;
(iv) Using the annual yields determined from section 5(c)(1)(i), apply any applicable adjustments authorized from section 36(a);
(v) Sum all the annual yields from section 5(c)(1)(iv); and
(vi) Divide the sum of section 5(c)(1)(v) by the number of annual yields in the APH database and apply any applicable adjustments from section 5(c)(2) or (3), section 9(e), or section 36(b). The result is the approved yield.
(2) Adjustment to the approved yield by us or any other person authorized by FCIC, in accordance with FCIC approved procedures, may be made in limited situations when the approved yield is not reflective of the expected actual production for the current crop year.
(3) Master yields may be established whenever crop rotation requirements and land leasing practices limit the yield history available. FCIC will establish crops and locations for which master yields are available. To qualify, you must have at least four most recent continuous crop years' annual production reports of the insured crop. Master yields are based on acreage and production history from all acreage of the insured crop in the county in which you have/had a share in the crop's production on the same basis as your approved yield. When applicable, your master yield will be your approved yield as authorized by approved FCIC procedures.
(4) For perennial crops, excluding forage, an approved yield may be adjusted if:
(i) A significant upward or downward yield trend over consecutive APH crop years is evident;
(ii) Tree or vine damage, or cultural practices performed will reduce the expected actual production for the current crop year from previous crop years' actual production; or
(iii) Other situations are determined to exist, in accordance with FCIC approved procedures, when the approved yield is not reflective of the expected actual production for the current crop year.
(5) An approved yield may be adjusted to reflect the degree of success of a systematic area-wide effort to detect, eradicate, suppress, control, or at a minimum prevent or retard, the spread of plant disease or plant pests, and which increases the yield of the insured crop on your farm when allowed under the terms of the policy.

# 6. Report of Acreage
(a) An annual acreage report must be submitted to us on our form for each insured crop in the county on or before the acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions, except as follows:
(1) If you insure multiple crops with us that have final planting dates on or after August 15 but before December 31, you must submit an acreage report for all such crops on or before the latest applicable acreage reporting date for such crops; and
(2) If you insure multiple crops with us that have final planting dates on or after December 31 but before August 15, you must submit an acreage report for all such crops on or before the latest applicable acreage reporting date for such crops.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions in sections 6(a) (1) and (2):
(i) If the Special Provisions designate separate planting periods for a crop, you must submit an acreage report for each planting period on or before the acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions for the planting period;
(ii) If planting of the insured crop continues after the final planting date or you are prevented from planting during the late planting period, the acreage reporting date will be the later of:
(A) The acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions;
(B) The date determined in accordance with sections (a)(1) or (2); or
(C) Five days after the end of the late planting period for the insured crop, if applicable; and
(iii) If you plant the insured crop on or within five days prior to the final planting date and the final planting date is five or fewer days prior to the acreage reporting date, you must submit an acreage report no later than five days after the acreage reporting date (for example, if the final planting date contained in the Special Provisions is July 10, the acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions is July 15 and you plant the insured crop on July 9, you have until July 20 to submit an acreage report for the insured crop).
(b) If you do not have a share in an insured crop in the county for the crop year, you must submit an acreage report, on or before the acreage reporting date, so indicating.
(c) Your acreage report must include the following information, if applicable:
(1) The amount of acreage of the crop in the county (insurable and not insurable) in which you have a share and the date the insured crop was planted on the unit as follows:
(i) The last date any timely planted acreage was planted and the number of acres planted by such date; and
(ii) The date of planting and the number of acres planted per day for acreage planted during the late planting period (if you fail to report the number of acres planted on a daily basis, all acreage planted in the late planting period will be presumed to have been planted on the last day planting took place in the late planting period for the purposes of section 16);
(2) Your share at the time coverage begins;
(3) The practice;
(4) The type;
(5) The land identifier for the crop acreage (
e.g.,
legal description, FSA farm number or common land unit number if provided to you by FSA,
etc.
) as required on our form; and
(6) Acknowledgement of your duty to notify us if you intend to direct market your crop or if acceptable verifiable records are required and will not be available. This acknowledgement must also include a signed marketing certification if required in section 38.
(d) Regarding the ability to revise an acreage report you have submitted to us:
(1) For planted acreage, you cannot revise any information pertaining to the planted acreage after the acreage reporting date without our consent (Consent may only be provided when no cause of loss has occurred; our appraisal has determined that the insured crop will produce at least 90 percent of the yield used to determine your guarantee or the amount of insurance for the unit (including reported and unreported acreage), except when there are unreported units (see section 6(f)); the information on the acreage report is clearly transposed; you provide adequate evidence that we or someone from USDA have committed an error regarding the information on your acreage report; or if expressly permitted by the policy);
(2) For prevented planting acreage:
(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, you can change any information on any initially submitted acreage report, except as provided in section 6(d)(2)(iii) (
e.g.,
you can correct the reported share, add acreage of the insured crop that was prevented from being planted,
etc.
);
(ii) After the acreage reporting date, you cannot revise any information on the acreage report (
e.g.,
if you have failed to report prevented planting acreage on or before the acreage reporting date, you cannot revise it after the acreage reporting date to include prevented planting acreage) but we will revise information that is clearly transposed or if you provide adequate evidence that we or someone from USDA have committed an error regarding the information on your acreage report; and
(iii) You cannot revise your initially submitted acreage report at any time to change the insured crop, or type, that was reported as prevented from being planted;
(3) You may request an acreage measurement from FSA or a business that provides such measurement service prior to the acreage reporting date, submit documentation of such request and an acreage report with estimated acreage by the acreage reporting date, and if the acreage measurement shows the estimated acreage was incorrect, we will revise your acreage report to reflect the correct acreage:
(i) If an acreage measurement is only requested for a portion of the acreage within a unit, you must separately designate the acreage for which an acreage measurement has been requested;
(ii) If an acreage measurement is not provided to us by the time we receive a notice of loss, we may:
(A) Defer finalization of the claim until the measurement is completed, and:
(
1
) Make all necessary loss determinations, except the acreage measurement; and
(
2
) Finalize the claim in accordance with applicable policy provisions after you provide the acreage measurement to us (if you fail to provide the measurement, your claim will not be paid); or
(B) Elect to measure the acreage, and:
(
1
) Finalize your claim in accordance with applicable policy provisions; and
(
2
) Estimated acreage under this section will not be accepted from you for any subsequent acreage report; and
(iii) Premium will still be due in accordance with sections 2(e) and 7. If the acreage is not measured as specified in section 6(d)(3)(ii) and the acreage measurement is not provided to us at least 15 days prior to the premium billing date, your premium will be based on the estimated acreage and will be revised, if necessary, when the acreage
measurement is provided. If the acreage measurement is not provided by the termination date, you will be precluded from providing any estimated acreage for all subsequent crop years.
(4) If there is an irreconcilable difference between:
(i) The acreage measured by FSA or a measuring service and our on-farm measurement, our on-farm measurement will be used; or
(ii) The acreage measured by a measuring service, other than our on-farm measurement, and FSA, the FSA measurement will be used; and
(5) If the acreage report has been revised in accordance with section 6(d)(1), (2), or (3), the information on the initial acreage report will not be considered misreported for the purposes of section 6(g).
(e) We may elect to determine all premiums and indemnities based on the information you submit on the acreage report or upon the factual circumstances we determine to have existed, subject to the provisions contained in section 6(g).
(f) If you do not submit an acreage report by the acreage reporting date, or if you fail to report all units, we may elect to determine by unit the insurable crop acreage, share, type and practice, or to deny liability on such units. If we deny liability for the unreported units, your share of any production from the unreported units will be allocated, for loss purposes only, as production to count to the reported units in proportion to the liability on each reported unit. However, such production will not be allocated to prevented planting acreage or otherwise affect any prevented planting payment.
(g) You must provide all required reports and you are responsible for the accuracy of all information contained in those reports. You should verify the information on all such reports prior to submitting them to us.
(1) Except as provided in section 6(g)(2), if you submit information on any report that is different than what is determined to be correct and such information results in:
(i) A lower liability than the actual liability determined, the production guarantee or amount of insurance on the unit will be reduced to an amount consistent with the reported information (in the event the insurable acreage is under-reported for any unit, all production or value from insurable acreage in that unit will be considered production or value to count in determining the indemnity); or
(ii) A higher liability than the actual liability determined, the information contained in the acreage report will be revised to be consistent with the correct information.
(2) If your share is misreported and the share is:
(i) Under-reported, any claim will be determined using the share you reported; or
(ii) Over-reported, any claim will be determined using the share we determine to be correct.
(h) If we discover you have incorrectly reported any information on the acreage report for any crop year, you may be required to provide documentation in subsequent crop years substantiating your report of acreage for those crop years, including, but not limited to, an acreage measurement service at your own expense. If the correction of any misreported information would affect an indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment that was paid in a prior crop year, such claim will be adjusted and you will be required to repay any overpaid amounts.
(i) Errors in reporting units may be corrected by us at the time of adjusting a loss to reduce our liability and to conform to applicable unit division guidelines.

# 7. Annual Premium and Administrative Fees
(a) The annual premium is earned and payable at the time coverage begins. You will be billed for the premium and administrative fee not earlier than the premium billing date specified in the Special Provisions.
(b) Premium or administrative fees owed by you will be offset from an indemnity or prevented planting payment due you in accordance with section 2(e).
(c) The annual premium amount is determined, as applicable, by either:
(1) Multiplying the production guarantee per acre times your price election or your projected price, as applicable, times the premium rate, times the insured acreage, times your share at the time coverage begins, and times any premium adjustment percentages that may apply; or
(2) Multiplying your amount of insurance per acre times the premium rate, times the insured acreage, times your share at the time coverage begins, and times any premium adjustment percentages that may apply.
(d) The information needed to determine the premium rate and any premium adjustment percentages that may apply are contained in the actuarial documents or an approved written agreement.
(e) In addition to the premium charged:
(1) You, unless otherwise authorized in 7 CFR part 400, must pay an administrative fee each crop year of $30 per crop per county for all levels of coverage in excess of catastrophic risk protection.
(2) The administrative fee must be paid no later than the time that premium is due.
(3) Payment of an administrative fee will not be required if you file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop. If you falsely file
a zero acreage report you may be subject to criminal and administrative sanctions.
(4) The administrative fee will be waived if you request it and:
(i) You qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher;
(ii) You qualify as a limited resource farmer; or
(iii) You were insured prior to the 2005 crop year or for the 2005 crop year and your administrative fee was waived for one or more of those crop years because you qualified as a limited resource farmer under a policy definition previously in effect, and you remain qualified as a limited resource farmer under the definition that was in effect at the time the administrative fee was waived.
(5) Failure to pay the administrative fees when due may make you ineligible for certain other USDA benefits.
(f) If the amount of premium (gross premium less premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC) and administrative fee you are required to pay for any acreage exceeds the liability for the acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium or administrative fee will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage).
(g) If you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher, your premium subsidy will be 10 percentage points greater than the premium subsidy that you would otherwise receive, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.
(h) You will be ineligible for any premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC for any policy issued by us if:
(1) USDA determines you have committed a violation of the highly erodible land conservation or wetland conservation provisions of 7 CFR part 12 as amended by the Agricultural Act of 2014; or
(2) You have not filed form AD-1026 with FSA for the reinsurance year by the premium billing date.
(i) Notwithstanding section 7(h)(2), you may be eligible for premium subsidy without having a timely filed form AD-1026:
(A) For the initial reinsurance year if you certify by the premium billing date for your policy that you meet the qualifications as outlined in FCIC procedures for producers who are new to farming, new to crop insurance, a new person, or have not previously been required to file form AD-1026; or
(B) If FSA approves relief for failure to timely file due to circumstances beyond your control or failure to timely provide adequate information to complete form AD-1026 in accordance with the provisions contained in 7 CFR part 12.
(ii) To be eligible for premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC, it is your responsibility to assure you meet all the requirements for:
(A) Compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 7(h)(1); and
(B) Filing form AD-1026 to be properly identified as in compliance with the conservation provisions specified in section 7(h)(1).

# 8. Insured Crop
(a) The insured crop will be that shown on your accepted application and as specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions and must be grown on insurable acreage.
(b) A crop which will NOT be insured will include, but will not be limited to, any crop:
(1) That is not grown on planted acreage (except for the purposes of prevented planting coverage), or that is a type, class or variety or where the conditions under which the crop is planted are not generally recognized for the area (for example, where agricultural experts determine that planting a non-irrigated corn crop after a failed small grain crop on the same acreage in the same crop year is not appropriate for the area);
(2) For which the information necessary for insurance (price election, amount of insurance, projected price and harvest price, as applicable, premium rate,
etc.
) is not included in the actuarial documents, unless such information is provided by a written agreement in accordance with section 18;
(3) That is a volunteer crop;
(4) Planted following the same crop on the same acreage and the first planting of the crop has been harvested in the same crop year unless specifically permitted by the Crop Provisions or the Special Provisions (for example, the second planting of grain sorghum would not be insurable if grain sorghum had already been planted and harvested on the same acreage during the crop year);
(5) That is planted for the development or production of hybrid seed or for experimental purposes, unless permitted by the Crop Provisions or by written agreement to insure such crop;
(6) That is used solely for wildlife protection or management. If the lease states that specific acreage must remain unharvested, only that acreage is uninsurable. If the lease specifies that a percentage of the crop must be left unharvested, your share will be reduced by such percentage; or
(7) That is reported as a cover crop to a USDA agency.
(i) No indemnity will be paid for such acreage and any indemnity already received must be repaid.
(ii) You will still be required to pay 60 percent of the premium you would otherwise be required to pay on those acres.
(c) Although certain policy documents may state that a crop type, class, variety or practice is not insurable, it does not mean all other crop types, classes, varieties or practices are insurable. To be insurable the crop type, class, variety or practice must meet all the conditions in this section.

# 9. Insurable Acreage
The insurable acreage is all the acreage planted to the insured crop in the county in which you have a share, except as provided in section 9(d). New breaking acreage may be subject to a reduced approved yield in accordance with section 9(b) and native sod acreage may be subject to reduced premium subsidy and approved yield in accordance with section 9(c).
(a) New breaking acreage consists of acreage which has not been planted and harvested, or insured, in any 1 of the 4 previous crop years.
(1) For the purposes of determining new breaking acreage:
(i) Planted includes annual regrowth of a perennial crop;
(ii) Harvested does not include grazing;
(iii) Insured includes insured prevented planting acreage; and
(iv) Only crops eligible for insurance under these Basic Provisions are considered when determining if the acreage has been planted, harvested, or insured.
(2) Acreage that was not planted in at least 3 of the 4 previous crop years to comply with any other USDA program will not be considered new breaking acreage.
(b) New breaking acreage reduction—New breaking acreage is insurable at 85 percent of the applicable T-Yield, unless that acreage:
(1) Is identified as native sod acreage in accordance with section 9(c), for which the native sod provisions in section 9(c) will apply;
(2) Is uninsurable acreage in accordance with section 9(d); or
(3) Constitutes 5 percent or less of the insured planted acreage in the unit, for which the new breaking reduction to 85 percent of the applicable T-Yield will not apply.
(c) Native sod acreage reductions—Native sod acreage in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, or South Dakota may receive reduced premium subsidy and reduced approved yield. These reductions are applicable during the first 4 crop years of planting on native sod acreage that has been tilled beginning on February 8, 2014, and ending on December 20, 2018, and during 4 cumulative crop years of insurance within the first 10 crop years after initial tillage on native sod acreage tilled after December 20, 2018. For such native sod acreage:
(1) Additional coverage policies receive a premium subsidy that is 50 percentage points less than would otherwise be provided on acreage not qualifying as native sod. If the premium subsidy applicable to these acres is less than 50 percent before the reduction, you will receive no premium subsidy.
(2) The approved yield is limited to 65 percent of the applicable T-Yield.
(3) Cumulative native sod acreage that is 5 acres or less in the county is not subject to the reduced premium subsidy in section 9(c)(1) or the reduced approved yield in section 9(c)(2).
(d) The acreage is not insurable if:
(1) The acreage has been strip-mined. However, such acreage may be insurable only if:
(i) An agricultural commodity, other than a cover, hay (except wheat harvested for hay), or forage crop (except insurable silage) has been harvested from the acreage for at least 5 crop years after the strip-mined land was reclaimed; or
(ii) A written agreement specifically allows insurance for such acreage;
(2) The actuarial documents do not provide the information necessary to determine the premium rate, unless insurance is allowed by a written agreement;
(3) The insured crop is damaged and it is practical to replant the insured crop, but the insured crop is not replanted;
(4) The acreage is interplanted, unless insurance is allowed by the Crop Provisions;
(5) The acreage is otherwise restricted by the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions;
(6) The acreage is planted in any manner other than as specified in the policy provisions for the crop unless a written agreement specifically allows insurance for such planting;
(7) The acreage is of a second crop, if you elect not to insure such acreage when an indemnity for a first insured crop may be subject to reduction in accordance with the provisions of section 15 and you intend to collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop acreage. This election must be made on a first insured crop unit basis (for example, if the first insured crop unit contains 40 planted acres that may be subject to an indemnity reduction, then no second crop can be insured on any of the 40 acres). In this case:
(i) If the first insured crop is insured under this policy, you must provide written notice to us of your election not to insure acreage of a second crop at the time the first insured crop acreage is released by us (if no acreage in the first insured crop unit is released, this election must be made by the earlier of the acreage reporting date for the second crop or when you sign the claim for indemnity for the first insured crop) or, if the first insured crop is insured under Area Risk Protection Insurance (7 CFR part 407), this election must be made before the second crop insured under this policy is planted, and if you fail to provide such notice, the second crop acreage will be insured in accordance with the applicable policy provisions and you must repay any overpaid indemnity for the first insured crop;
(ii) In the event a second crop is planted and insured with a different insurance provider, or planted and insured by a different person, you must provide written notice to each insurance provider that a second crop
was planted on acreage on which you had a first insured crop; and
(iii) You must report the crop acreage that will not be insured on the applicable acreage report; or
(8) The acreage is of a crop planted following a second crop or following an insured crop that is prevented from being planted after a first insured crop, unless it is a practice that is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts for the area to plant 3 or more crops for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year, and additional coverage insurance provided under the authority of the Act is offered for the third or subsequent crop in the same crop year. Insurance will only be provided for a third or subsequent crop as follows:
(i) You must provide records acceptable to us that show:
(A) You have produced and harvested the insured crop following 2 other crops harvested on the same acreage in the same crop year in at least 2 of the last 4 years in which you produced the insured crop; or
(B) The applicable acreage has had 3 or more crops produced and harvested on it in the same crop year in at least 2 of the last 4 years in which the insured crop was grown on the acreage; and
(ii) The amount of insurable acreage will not exceed 100 percent of the greatest number of acres for which you provide the records required in section 9(d)(8)(i).
(e) If insurance is provided for an irrigated practice, you must report as irrigated only that acreage for which you have adequate facilities and adequate water, or the reasonable expectation of receiving adequate water at the time coverage begins, to carry out a good irrigation practice. If you knew or had reason to know that your water may be reduced before coverage begins, no reasonable expectation exists.
(f) Notwithstanding the provisions in section 8(b)(2), if acreage is irrigated and a premium rate is not provided for an irrigated practice, you may either report and insure the irrigated acreage as “non-irrigated,” or report the irrigated acreage as not insured. (If you elect to insure such acreage under a non-irrigated practice, your irrigated yield will only be used to determine your approved yield if you continue to use a good irrigation practice. If you do not use a good irrigation practice, you will receive a yield determined in accordance with section 3(h)(3).)
(g) We may restrict the amount of acreage that we will insure to the amount allowed under any acreage limitation program established by USDA if we notify you of that restriction prior to the sales closing date.

# 10. Share Insured
(a) Insurance will attach:
(1) Only if the person completing the application has a share in the insured crop; and
(2) Only to that person's share, except that insurance may attach to another person's share of the insured crop if the other person has a share of the crop and:
(i) The application clearly states the insurance is requested for a person other than an individual (
e.g.,
a partnership or a joint venture); or
(ii) The application clearly states you as a landlord will insure your tenant's share, or you as a tenant will insure your landlord's share. If you as a landlord will insure your tenant's share, or you as a tenant will insure your landlord's share, you must provide evidence of the other party's approval (lease, power of attorney,
etc.
) and such evidence will be retained by us:
(A) You also must clearly set forth the percentage shares of each person on the acreage report; and
(B) For each landlord or tenant, you must report the landlord's or tenant's social security number, employer identification number, or other identification number we assigned for the purposes of this policy, as applicable.
(b) With respect to your share:
(1) We will consider to be included in your share under your policy, any acreage or interest reported by or for:
(i) Your spouse, unless such spouse can prove he/she has a separate farming operation, which includes, but is not limited to, separate land (transfers of acreage from one spouse to another is not considered separate land), separate capital, separate inputs, separate accounting, and separate maintenance of proceeds; or
(ii) Your child who resides in your household or any other member of your household, unless such child or other member of the household can demonstrate such person has a separate share in the crop (children who do not reside in your household are not included in your share); and
(2) If it is determined that the spouse, child or other member of the household has a separate policy but does not have a separate farming operation or share of the crop, as applicable:
(i) The policy for one spouse or child or other member of the household will be void and the policy remaining in effect will be determined in accordance with section 22(a)(1) and (2);
(ii) The acreage or share reported under the policy that is voided will be included under the remaining policy; and
(iii) No premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for the voided policy.
(c) Acreage rented for a percentage of the crop, or a lease containing provisions for
both
a minimum payment (such as a specified amount of cash, bushels, pounds, etc.,)
and
a crop share will be considered a crop share lease.
(d) Acreage rented for cash, or a lease containing provisions for
either
a minimum payment
or
a crop share (such as a 50/50 share or $100.00 per acre, whichever is greater) will be considered a cash lease.

# 11. Insurance Period
(a) Except for prevented planting coverage (see section 17), coverage begins on each unit or part of a unit at the later of:
(1) The date we accept your application (for the purposes of this paragraph, the date of acceptance is the date that you submit a properly executed application in accordance with section 2);
(2) The date the insured crop is planted; or
(3) The calendar date contained in the Crop Provisions for the beginning of the insurance period.
(b) Coverage ends on each unit or part of a unit at the earliest of:
(1) Total destruction of the insured crop;
(2) Harvest of the insured crop;
(3) Final adjustment of a loss on a unit;
(4) The calendar date contained in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions for the end of the insurance period;
(5) Abandonment of the insured crop; or
(6) As otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions.
(c) Except as provided in the Crop Provisions or applicable endorsement, in addition to the requirements of section 11(b), coverage ends on any acreage within a unit once any event specified in section 11(b) occurs on that acreage. Coverage only remains in effect on acreage that has not been affected by an event specified in section 11(b).

# 12. Causes of Loss
Insurance is provided only to protect against unavoidable, naturally occurring events. A list of the covered naturally occurring events is contained in the applicable Crop Provisions. All other causes of loss, including but not limited to the following, are not covered:
(a) Any act by any person that affects the yield, quality or price of the insured crop (
e.g.,
chemical drift, fire, terrorism,
etc.
);
(b) Failure to follow recognized good farming practices for the insured crop;
(c) Water that is contained by or within structures that are designed to contain a specific amount of water, such as dams, locks or reservoir projects, etc., on any acreage when such water stays within the designed limits (For example, a dam is designed to contain water to an elevation of 1,200 feet but you plant a crop on acreage at an elevation of 1,100 feet. A storm causes the water behind the dam to rise to an elevation of 1,200 feet. Under such circumstances, the resulting damage would not be caused by an insurable cause of loss. However, if you planted on acreage that was above 1,200 feet elevation, any damage caused by water that exceeded that elevation would be caused by an insurable cause of loss.);
(d) Failure or breakdown of the irrigation equipment or facilities, or the inability to prepare the land for irrigation using your established irrigation method (
e.g.,
furrow irrigation), unless the failure, breakdown or inability is due to a cause of loss specified in the Crop Provisions.
(1) You must make all reasonable efforts to restore the equipment or facilities to proper working order within a reasonable amount of time unless we determine it is not practical to do so.
(2) Cost will not be considered when determining whether it is practical to restore the equipment or facilities;
(e) Failure to carry out a good irrigation practice for the insured crop, if applicable; or
(f) Any cause of loss that results in damage that is not evident or would not have been evident during the insurance period, including, but not limited to, damage that only becomes evident after the end of the insurance period unless expressly authorized in the Crop Provisions. Even though we may not inspect the damaged crop until after the end of the insurance period, damage due to insured causes that would have been evident during the insurance period will be covered.

# 13. Replanting Payment
(a) If allowed by the Crop Provisions, a replanting payment may be made on an insured crop replanted after we have given consent and the acreage replanted is at least the lesser of 20 acres or 20 percent of the insured planted acreage for the unit (as determined on the final planting date or within the late planting period if a late planting period is applicable). If the crops to be replanted are in a whole-farm unit, the 20 acres or 20 percent requirement is to be applied separately to each crop to be replanted in the whole-farm unit.
(b) No replanting payment will be made on acreage:
(1) On which our appraisal establishes that production will exceed the level set by the Crop Provisions;
(2) Initially planted prior to the earliest planting date established by the Special Provisions; or
(3) On which one replanting payment has already been allowed for the crop year.
(c) The replanting payment per acre will be:
(1) The lesser of your actual cost for replanting or the amount specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions; or
(2) If the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions specify that your actual cost will not
be used to determine your replanting payment, the amount determined in accordance with the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions.
(d) No replanting payment will be paid if we determine it is not practical to replant.

# 14. Duties in the Event of Damage, Loss, Abandonment, Destruction, or Alternative Use of Crop or Acreage
Your Duties—
(a) In the case of damage or loss of production or revenue to any insured crop, you must protect the crop from further damage by providing sufficient care.
(b) You must provide a notice of loss in accordance with this section. Notice provisions:
(1) For a planted crop, when there is damage or loss of production, you must give us notice, by unit, within 72 hours of your initial discovery of damage or loss of production (but not later than 15 days after the end of the insurance period, even if you have not harvested the crop).
(2) For crops for which revenue protection is elected, if there is no damage or loss of production, you must give us notice not later than 45 days after the latest date the harvest price is released for any crop in the unit where there is a revenue loss.
(3) In the event you are prevented from planting an insured crop that has prevented planting coverage, you must notify us within 72 hours after:
(i) The final planting date, if you do not intend to plant the insured crop during the late planting period or if a late planting period is not applicable; or
(ii) You determine you will not be able to plant the insured crop within any applicable late planting period.
(4) All notices required in this section that must be received by us within 72 hours may be made by telephone or in person to your crop insurance agent but must be confirmed in writing within 15 days.
(5) If you fail to submit a notice of loss in accordance with these notice provisions, any loss or prevented planting claim will be considered solely due to an uninsured cause of loss for the acreage for which such failure occurred, unless we determine that we have the ability to accurately adjust the loss. If we determine that we do not have the ability to accurately adjust the loss:
(i) For any prevented planting claim, no prevented planting coverage will be provided and no premium will be owed or prevented planting payment will be paid; or
(ii) For any claim for indemnity, no indemnity will be paid but you will still be required to pay all premiums owed.
(6) You must give us notice in accordance with section 36(a)(3) to replace post-quality actual yields for previous crop years.
(c) Representative samples:
(1) If representative samples are required by the Crop Provisions, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop intact:
(i) If you report damage less than 15 days before the time you will begin harvest or during harvest of the damaged unit; or
(ii) At any time when required by us.
(2) The samples must be left intact until we inspect them or until 15 days after completion of harvest on the remainder of the unit, whichever is earlier.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, the samples of the crop in each field in the unit must be 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of the rows, if the crop is planted in rows, or if the crop is not planted in rows, the longest dimension of the field.
(4) The period to retain representative samples may be extended if it is necessary to accurately determine the loss. You will be notified in writing of any such extension.
(d) Consent:
(1) You must obtain consent from us before, and notify us after you:
(i) Destroy any of the insured crop that is not harvested;
(ii) Put the insured crop to an alternative use;
(iii) Put the acreage to another use; or
(iv) Abandon any portion of the insured crop.
(2) We will not give consent for any of the actions in section 14(d)(1)(i) through (iv) if it is practical to replant the crop or until we have made an appraisal of the potential production of the crop.
(3) Failure to obtain our consent will result in the assignment of an amount of production or value to count in accordance with the Settlement of Claim provisions of the applicable Crop Provisions.
(e) Claims:
(1) Except as otherwise provided in your policy, you must submit a claim declaring the amount of your loss by the dates shown in section 14(e)(3), unless you:
(i) Request an extension in writing by such date and we agree to such request (extensions will only be granted if the amount of the loss cannot be determined within such time period because the information needed to determine the amount of the loss is not available); or
(ii) Have harvested farm-stored production and elect, in writing, to delay measurement of your farm-stored production and settlement of any potential associated claim for indemnity as allowed by the Special Provisions (extensions will be granted for this purpose up to 180 days after the end of the insurance period).
(A) For policies that require APH, if such extension continues beyond the date you are required to submit your production report,
you will be assigned the previous year's approved yield as a temporary yield in accordance with applicable procedures.
(B) Any extension does not extend any date specified in the policy by which premiums, administrative fees, or other debts owed must be paid.
(C) Damage that occurs after the end of the insurance period (for example, while the harvested crop production is in storage) is not covered; and
(2) Failure to timely submit a claim or provide the required information necessary to determine the amount of the claim will result in no indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment:
(i) Even though no indemnity or replanting payment is due, you will still be required to pay the premium due under the policy for the unit; or
(ii) Failure to timely submit a prevented planting claim will result in no prevented planting coverage and no premium will be due.
(3) You must submit a claim not later than:
(i) For policies other than revenue protection, 60 days after the date the insurance period ends for all acreage in the unit (When there is acreage in the unit where the insurance period ended on different dates, it is the last date the insurance period ends on the unit. For example, if a unit has corn acreage that was put to another use on July 15 and corn acreage where harvest was completed on September 30, the claim must be submitted not later than 60 days after September 30.); or
(ii) For revenue protection, the later of:
(A) 60 days after the last date the harvest price is released for any crop in the unit; or
(B) The date determined in accordance with section 14(e)(3)(i).
(4) To receive any indemnity (or receive the rest of an indemnity in the case of acreage that is planted to a second crop), prevented planting payment or replanting payment, you must, if applicable:
(i) Provide:
(A) A complete harvesting, production, and marketing record of each insured crop by unit including separate records showing the same information for production from any acreage not insured.
(B) Records as indicated below if you insure any acreage that may be subject to an indemnity reduction as specified in section 15(e)(2):
(
1
) Separate records of production from such acreage for all insured crops planted on the acreage (
e.g.,
if you have an insurable loss on 10 acres of wheat and subsequently plant cotton on the same 10 acres, you must provide records of the wheat and cotton production on the 10 acres separate from any other wheat and cotton production that may be planted in the same unit). If you fail to provide separate records for such acreage, we will allocate the production of each crop to the acreage in proportion to our liability for the acreage; or
(
2
) If there is no loss on the unit that includes acreage of the second crop, no separate records need to be submitted for the second crop and you can receive the rest of the indemnity for the first insured crop.
(C) Any other information we may require to settle the claim.
(ii) Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim, and, as often as we reasonably require:
(A) Show us the damaged crop;
(B) Allow us to remove samples of the insured crop; and
(C) Provide us with records and documents we request and permit us to make copies.
(iii) Establish:
(A) The total production or value received for the insured crop on the unit;
(B) That any loss occurred during the insurance period;
(C) That the loss was caused by one or more of the insured causes specified in the Crop Provisions; and
(D) That you have complied with all provisions of this policy.
(iv) Upon our request, or that of any USDA employee authorized to conduct investigations of the crop insurance program, submit to an examination under oath.
(5) Failure to comply with any requirement contained in section 14(e)(4) will result in denial of the claim and any premium will still be owed, unless the claim denied is for prevented planting.
Our Duties—
(f) If you have complied with all the policy provisions, we will pay your loss within 30 days after the later of:
(1) We reach agreement with you;
(2) Completion of arbitration, reconsideration of determinations regarding good farming practices or any other appeal that results in an award in your favor, unless we exercise our right to appeal such decision;
(3) Completion of any investigation by USDA, if applicable, of your current or any past claim for indemnity if no evidence of wrongdoing has been found (if any evidence of wrongdoing has been discovered, the amount of any indemnity, prevented planting or replant overpayment as a result of such wrongdoing may be offset from any indemnity or prevented planting payment owed to you); or
(4) The entry of a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(g) In the event we are unable to pay your loss within 30 days, we will give you notice of our intentions within the 30-day period.
(h) We may defer the adjustment of a loss until the amount of loss can be accurately determined. We will not pay for additional
damage resulting from your failure to provide sufficient care for the crop during the deferral period.
(i) We recognize and apply the loss adjustment procedures established or approved by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.
(j) For revenue protection, we may make preliminary indemnity payments for crop production losses prior to the release of the harvest price if you have not elected the harvest price exclusion.
(1) First, we may pay an initial indemnity based upon your projected price, in accordance with the applicable Crop Provisions provided that your production to count and share have been established; and
(2) Second, after the harvest price is released, and if it is not equal to the projected price, we will recalculate the indemnity payment and pay any additional indemnity that may be due.

# 15. Production Included in Determining an Indemnity and Payment Reductions
(a) The total production to be counted for a unit will include all production determined in accordance with the policy.
(b) Appraised production will be used to calculate your claim if you are not going to harvest your acreage. Such appraisals may be conducted after the end of the insurance period. If you harvest the crop after the crop has been appraised:
(1) You must provide us with the amount of harvested production (if you fail to provide acceptable verifiable records or acceptable farm management records of harvested production, no indemnity will be paid and you will be required to return any previously paid indemnity for the unit that was based on an appraised amount of production); and
(2) If the harvested production exceeds the appraised production, claims will be adjusted using the harvested production, and you will be required to repay any overpaid indemnity; or
(3) If the harvested production is less than the appraised production, and:
(i) You harvest after the end of the insurance period, your appraised production will be used to adjust the loss unless you can prove that no additional causes of loss or deterioration of the crop occurred after the end of the insurance period; or
(ii) You harvest before the end of the insurance period, your harvested production will be used to adjust the loss, unless:
(A) The applicable crop provisions require an appraisal prior to harvest and you are unable to prove that additional insured causes of loss occurred after the appraisal or deterioration of the crop can be attributed to insurable causes after the appraisal was completed; then your appraised production will be used to adjust the loss; or
(B) You intend to direct market your crop or your production records will not be from a disinterested third party and we determine an appraisal prior to harvest was necessary and you are unable to prove that additional insured causes of loss occurred after the appraisal or deterioration of the crop can be attributed to insurable causes after the appraisal was completed; then your appraised production will be used to adjust the loss.
(c) If you elect to exclude hail and fire as insured causes of loss and the insured crop is damaged by hail or fire, appraisals will be made as described in our form used to exclude hail and fire.
(d) The amount of an indemnity that may be determined under the applicable provisions of your policy may be reduced by an amount, determined in accordance with the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, to reflect out-of-pocket expenses that were not incurred by you as a result of not planting, caring for, or harvesting the crop. Indemnities paid for acreage prevented from being planted will be based on a reduced guarantee as provided for in the policy and will not be further reduced to reflect expenses not incurred.
(e) With respect to acreage where you have suffered an insurable loss to planted acreage of your first insured crop in the crop year, except in the case of double cropping described in section 15(h):
(1) You may elect to not plant or to plant and not insure a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year and collect an indemnity payment that is equal to 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop; or
(2) You may elect to plant and insure a second crop on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year (you will pay the full premium and, if there is an insurable loss to the second crop, receive the full amount of indemnity that may be due for the second crop, regardless of whether there is a subsequent crop planted on the same acreage) and:
(i) Collect an indemnity payment that is 35 percent of the insurable loss for the first insured crop;
(ii) Be responsible for premium that is 35 percent of the premium that you would otherwise owe for the first insured crop; and
(iii) If the second crop does not suffer an insurable loss:
(A) Collect an indemnity payment for the other 65 percent of insurable loss that was not previously paid under section 15(e)(2)(i); and
(B) Be responsible for the remainder of the premium for the first insured crop that you did not pay under section 15(e)(2)(ii).
(f) With respect to acreage where you were prevented from planting the first insured crop in the crop year, except in the case of double cropping described in section 15(h):
(1) If a second crop is not planted on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year, you may collect a prevented planting
payment that is equal to 100 percent of the prevented planting payment for the acreage for the first insured crop; or
(2) If a second crop is planted on the same acreage for harvest in the same crop year (you will pay the full premium and, if there is an insurable loss to the second crop, receive the full amount of indemnity that may be due for the second crop, regardless of whether there is a subsequent crop planted on the same acreage) and:
(i) Provided the second crop is not planted on or before the final planting date or during the late planting period (as applicable) for the first insured crop, you may collect a prevented planting payment that is 35 percent of the prevented planting payment for the first insured crop; and
(ii) Be responsible for premium that is 35 percent of the premium that you would otherwise owe for the first insured crop.
(g) The reduction in the amount of indemnity or prevented planting payment and premium specified in sections 15(e) and 15(f), as applicable, will apply:
(1) Notwithstanding the priority contained in the Agreement to Insure section, which states that the Crop Provisions have priority over the Basic Provisions when a conflict exists, to any premium owed or indemnity or prevented planting payment made in accordance with the Crop Provisions, and any applicable endorsement.
(2) Even if another person plants the second crop on any acreage where the first insured crop was planted or was prevented from being planted, as applicable.
(3) To a prevented planting payment if a cover crop that is planted after the late planting period (or after the final planting date if a late planting period is not applicable) is harvested for grain or seed by you or another person, at any time.
(h) You may receive a full indemnity, or a full prevented planting payment for a first insured crop when a second crop is planted on the same acreage in the same crop year, if each of the following conditions are met, regardless of whether or not the second crop is insured or sustains an insurable loss:
(1) Planting two or more crops for harvest in the same crop year in the area is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts;
(2) The second or more crops are customarily planted after the first insured crop for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year in the area;
(3) Additional coverage insurance offered under the authority of the Act is available in the county on the two or more crops that are double cropped;
(4) In the case of prevented planting, the second crop is not planted on or prior to the final planting date or, if applicable, prior to the end of the late planting period for the first insured crop;
(5) You provide records, acceptable to us, of acreage and production specific to the double cropped acreage proving that:
(i) You have double cropped acreage in at least 2 of the last 4 crop years in which the first insured crop was grown; or
(ii) The applicable acreage was double cropped (by one or more other producers, and the producer(s) will allow you to use their records) for at least two of the last four crop years in which the first insured crop was grown on it; and
(6) If you do not have records of acreage and production specific to the double cropped acreage, as required in section 15(h)(5), but instead have records that combine production from acreage you double cropped with records of production from acreage you did not double crop, we will allocate the first and second crop production to the specific acreage in proportion to the liability for the acreage that was and was not double cropped.
(7) Coordination of Coverage—For double cropped acreage when one of the crops is insured under this policy and one of the crops is insured under other crop insurance authorized under the Act with less restrictive double crop history records requirements (for example, annual forage insured under the Rainfall Index Plan Common Policy, Basic Provisions, does not require records of acreage and production), the double cropping history requirements in sections 15(h)(5) and (6) do not apply. Instead:
(i) For the crop insured under this policy, you may receive a full indemnity if you meet each of the double cropping requirements in sections 15(h)(1) through (3), regardless of which crop was the first insured crop or the second crop. If you do not meet each of the double cropping requirements in sections 15(h)(1) through (3), the indemnity reductions in section 15(e)(2) apply.
(ii) Prevented Planting—For the crop insured under this policy, you may receive a full prevented planting payment if you:
(A) Meet the requirements in sections 15(h)(1) through (4) and sections 17(f)(4)(ii) and (iii); and
(B) Provide records, acceptable to us, proving that you have a history of insuring the crop under other crop insurance authorized under the Act.
(8) Dual Use—For a single crop that is insured both under this policy and under other crop insurance authorized under the Act for different end uses (for example, wheat insured for grain under the Small Grains Crop Provisions and wheat insured as annual forage under the Annual Forage Crop Provisions), that is then followed by a crop insured under this policy, the double cropping history requirements in sections 15(h)(1) through (6) apply to the crops insured under this policy.
(i) If you provided acceptable records in accordance with section 15(h), your double cropping history is limited to the highest number of acres double cropped within the applicable 4-year period as determined in section 15(h)(5):
(1) If the records you provided are from acreage you double cropped in at least two of the last four crop years, you may apply your history of double cropping to any acreage of the insured crop in the county (for example, you have 100 cropland acres in the county and have double cropped wheat and soybeans on all 100 acres in the county and you acquire an additional 100 acres in the county, you can apply your history of 100 double cropped acres to any of the 200 acres in the county); or
(2) If the records you provided are from acreage that one or more other producers double cropped in at least two of the last four crop years, you may only use the history of double cropping for the same physical acres from which double cropping records were provided (
e.g.,
if a neighbor has double cropped 100 acres of wheat and soybeans in the county and you acquire your neighbor's 100 double cropped acres and an additional 100 acres in the county, you can only apply your neighbor's history of double cropped acreage to the same 100 acres that your neighbor double cropped).
(3) If you acquired additional land for the current crop year and the following calculation results in a greater number of double cropping acres than determined in the introductory paragraph of section 15(i), you may apply the percentage of acres that you have previously double cropped to the total cropland acres that you are farming this year (if greater):
(i) Determine the number of acres of the first insured crop that were double cropped in each of the years for which double cropping records are provided (for example, records are provided showing: 100 acres of wheat planted in 2019 and 50 of those acres were double cropped with soybeans; and 100 acres of wheat planted in 2020 and 70 of those acres were double cropped with soybeans);
(ii) Divide each result of section 15(i)(3)(i) by the number of acres of the first insured crop that were planted in each respective year (in the example in section 15(i)(3)(i), 50 divided by 100 equals 50 percent of the first insured crop acres that were double cropped in 2019 and 70 divided by 100 equals 70 percent of the first insured crop acres that were double cropped in 2020);
(iii) Add the results of section 15(i)(3)(ii) and divide by the number of years the first insured crop was double cropped (in the example in section 15(i)(3)(i), 50 plus 70 equals 120 divided by 2 equals 60 percent); and
(iv) Multiply the result of section 15(i)(3)(iii) by the number of insured acres of the first insured crop (in the example in section 15(i)(3)(i), 60 percent multiplied by the number of wheat acres insured in 2021);
(j) If any Federal or State agency requires destruction of any insured crop or crop production, as applicable, because it contains levels of a substance, or has a condition, that is injurious to human or animal health in excess of the maximum amounts allowed by the Food and Drug Administration, other public health organizations of the United States or an agency of the applicable State, you must destroy the insured crop or crop production, as applicable, and certify that such insured crop or crop production has been destroyed prior to receiving an indemnity payment. Failure to destroy the insured crop or crop production, as applicable, will result in you having to repay any indemnity paid and you may be subject to administrative sanctions in accordance with section 515(h) of the Act and 7 CFR part 400, subpart R, and any applicable civil or criminal sanctions.

# 16. Late Planting
Unless limited by the Crop Provisions, insurance will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop after the final planting date in accordance with the following:
(a) The production guarantee or amount of insurance for each acre planted to the insured crop during the late planting period will be reduced by 1 percent per day for each day planted after the final planting date.
(b) Acreage planted after the late planting period (or after the final planting date for crops that do not have a late planting period) may be insured as follows:
(1) The production guarantee or amount of insurance for each acre planted as specified in this subsection will be determined by multiplying the production guarantee or amount of insurance that is provided for acreage of the insured crop that is timely planted by the prevented planting coverage level percentage you elected, or that is contained in the Crop Provisions if you did not elect a prevented planting coverage level percentage;
(2) Planting on such acreage must have been prevented by the final planting date (or during the late planting period, if applicable) by an insurable cause occurring within the insurance period for prevented planting coverage; and
(3) All production from insured acreage as specified in this section will be included as production to count for the unit.
(c) The premium amount for insurable acreage specified in this section will be the same as that for timely planted acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for such acreage exceeds the liability, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid).
(d) Any acreage on which an insured cause of loss is a material factor in preventing completion of planting, as specified in the definition of “planted acreage” (e.g., seed is broadcast on the soil surface but cannot be incorporated) will be considered as acreage planted after the final planting date and the production guarantee will be calculated in accordance with section 16(b)(1).

# 17. Prevented Planting
(a) Unless limited by the policy provisions, a prevented planting payment may be made to you for eligible acreage if:
(1) You are prevented from planting the insured crop on insurable acreage by an insured cause of loss that occurs:
(i) On or after the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions for the insured crop in the county for the crop year the application for insurance is accepted; or
(ii) For any subsequent crop year, on or after the sales closing date for the previous crop year for the insured crop in the county, provided insurance has been in force continuously since that date. Cancellation for the purpose of transferring the policy to a different insurance provider for the subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuity for the purpose of the preceding sentence;
(2) You include on your acreage report any insurable acreage of the insured crop that was prevented from being planted; and
(3) You did not plant the insured crop during or after the late planting period. Acreage planted to the insured crop during or after the late planting period is covered under the late planting provisions.
(b) The actuarial documents may contain additional levels of prevented planting coverage that you may purchase for the insured crop:
(1) Such purchase must be made on or before the sales closing date.
(2) If you do not purchase one of those additional levels by the sales closing date, you will receive the prevented planting coverage specified in the Crop Provisions.
(3) If you have a Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for any crop, the additional levels of prevented planting coverage will not be available for that crop.
(4) You cannot increase your elected or assigned prevented planting coverage level for any crop year if a cause of loss that could prevent planting (even though it is not known whether such cause will actually prevent planting) has occurred during the prevented planting insurance period specified in section 17(a)(1)(i) or (ii) and prior to your request to change your prevented planting coverage level.
(c) The premium amount for acreage that is prevented from being planted will be the same as that for timely planted acreage except as specified in section 15(f). If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less the subsidy) for acreage that is prevented from being planted exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage).
(d) Prevented planting coverage will be provided against:
(1) Drought, failure of the irrigation water supply; failure, breakdown, or destruction of irrigation equipment or facilities; or the inability to prepare the land for irrigation using your established irrigation method, due to an insured cause of loss only if, on the final planting date (or within the late planting period if you elect to try to plant the crop), you provide documentation acceptable to us to establish:
(i) For non-irrigated acreage, the area that is prevented from being planted has insufficient soil moisture for germination of seed or progress toward crop maturity due to a prolonged period of dry weather. The documentation for prolonged period of dry weather must be verifiable using information collected by sources whose business it is to record and study the weather, including, but not limited to, local weather reporting stations of the National Weather Service; or
(ii) For irrigated acreage:
(A) Due to an insured cause of loss, there is not a reasonable expectation of having adequate water to carry out an irrigated practice or you are unable to prepare the land for irrigation using your established irrigation method:
(
1
) If you knew or had reason to know on the final planting date or during the late planting period that your water will be reduced, no reasonable expectation exists; and
(
2
) Available water resources will be verified using information from State Departments of Water Resources, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Natural Resources Conservation Service or other sources whose business includes collection of water data or regulation of water resources; or
(B) The irrigation equipment or facilities have failed, broken down, or been destroyed if such failure, breakdown, or destruction is due to an insured cause of loss specified in section 12(d).
(2) Causes other than drought; failure of the irrigation water supply; failure, breakdown, or destruction of the irrigation equipment or facilities; or your inability to prepare the land for irrigation using your established irrigation method, provided the cause of loss is specified in the Crop Provisions. However, if it is possible for you to plant on or prior to the final planting date when other producers in the area are planting and you fail to plant, no prevented planting payment will be made.
(e) The maximum number of acres that may be eligible for a prevented planting payment for any crop will be determined as follows:
(1) The total number of acres eligible for prevented planting coverage for all crops cannot exceed the number of acres of cropland in your farming operation for the crop year, unless you are eligible for prevented planting coverage on double cropped acreage in accordance with section 17(f)(4). The eligible acres for each insured crop will be determined as follows:
(i) If you have planted any crop in the county for which prevented planting insurance was available (you will be considered to have planted if your APH database contains actual planted acres) or have received a prevented planting insurance guarantee in any one or more of the four most recent crop years, and the insured crop is not required to be contracted with a processor to be insured, unless you qualify for the exception in section 17(e)(1)(ii)(E):
(A) The number of eligible acres will be the maximum number of acres certified for APH purposes, or insured acres reported, for the crop in any one of the four most recent crop years (not including reported prevented planting acreage that was planted to a second crop unless you meet the double cropping requirements in section 17(f)(4)).
(B) If you acquire additional land for the current crop year, the number of eligible acres determined in section 17(e)(1)(i)(A) for a crop may be increased by multiplying it by the ratio of the total cropland acres available for planting that you are farming this year (if greater) to the total cropland acres available for planting that you farmed in the previous year, provided that:
(
1
) You submit proof to us that you acquired additional acreage for the current crop year by any of the methods specified in section 17(f)(12);
(
2
) The additional acreage was acquired in time to plant it for the current crop year using good farming practices; and
(
3
) No cause of loss has occurred at the time you acquire the acreage that may prevent planting (except acreage you leased the previous year and continue to lease in the current crop year).
(C) If you add adequate irrigation facilities to your existing non-irrigated acreage or if you acquire additional land for the current crop year that has adequate irrigation facilities, the number of eligible acres determined in section 17(e)(1)(i)(A) for irrigated acreage of a crop may be increased by multiplying it by the ratio of the total irrigated acres that you are farming this year (if greater) to the total irrigated acres that you farmed in the previous year, provided the conditions in sections 17(e)(1)(i)(B)(
1
), (
2
) and (
3
) are met. If there were no irrigated acres in the previous year, the eligible irrigated acres for a crop will be limited to the lesser of the number of eligible non-irrigated acres of the crop or the number of acres on which adequate irrigation facilities were added.
(ii) If you have not planted any crop in the county for which prevented planting insurance was available (you will be considered to have planted if your APH database contains actual planted acres) or have not received a prevented planting insurance guarantee in all of the four most recent crop years, and the insured crop is not required to be contracted with a processor to be insured:
(A) The number of eligible acres will be:
(
1
) The number of acres specified on your intended acreage report, which must be submitted to us by the sales closing date for all crops you insure for the crop year and that is accepted by us; or
(
2
) The number of acres specified on your intended acreage report, which must be submitted to us within 10 days of the time you acquire the acreage and that is accepted by us, if, on the sales closing date, you do not have any acreage in a county and you subsequently acquire acreage through a method described in section 17(f)(12) in time to plant it using good farming practices.
(B) The total number of acres listed on the intended acreage report may not exceed the number of acres of cropland in your farming operation at the time you submit the intended acreage report.
(C) If you acquire additional acreage after we accept your intended acreage report, the number of acres determined in section 17(e)(1)(ii)(A) may be increased in accordance with section 17(e)(1)(i)(B) and (C).
(D) Prevented planting coverage will not be provided for any acreage included on the intended acreage report or any increased amount of acreage determined in accordance with section 17(e)(1)(ii)(C) if a cause of loss that may prevent planting occurred before the acreage was acquired, as determined by us.
(E) If you were eligible to file an intended acreage report the first crop year, you may file an intended acreage report for the second crop year. If you choose to file an intended acreage report for the second crop year, the number of eligible acres will be the number of acres specified on your intended acreage report and not the number of eligible acres determined in accordance with section 17(e)(1)(i).
(F) You cannot file an intended acreage report more than 2 consecutive crop years.
(iii) For any crop that must be contracted with a processor to be insured:
(A) The number of eligible acres will be:
(
1
) The number of acres of the crop specified in the processor contract, if the contract specifies a number of acres contracted for the crop year;
(
2
) The result of dividing the quantity of production stated in the processor contract
by your approved yield, if the processor contract specifies a quantity of production that will be accepted (for the purposes of establishing the number of prevented planting acres, any reductions applied to the transitional yield for failure to certify acreage and production for four prior years will not be used); or
(
3
) Notwithstanding sections 17(e)(1)(iii)(A)(
1
) and (
2
), if a minimum number of acres or amount of production is specified in the processor contract, this amount will be used to determine the eligible acres.
(B) If a processor cancels or does not provide contracts, or reduces the contracted acreage or production from what would have otherwise been allowed, solely because the acreage was prevented from being planted due to an insured cause of loss, we will determine the number of eligible acres based on the number of acres or amount of production you had contracted in the county in the previous crop year. If the applicable Crop Provisions require that the price election be based on a contract price, and a contract is not in force for the current year, the price election will be based on the contract price in place for the previous crop year. If you did not have a processor contract in place for the previous crop year, you will not have any eligible prevented planting acreage for the applicable processor crop. The total eligible prevented planting acres in all counties cannot exceed the total number of acres or amount of production contracted in all counties in the previous crop year.
(C) In the event that your contracted acreage or production for the current crop year is reduced, for a reason not solely due to the acreage being prevented from being planted, or you have no contracted acreage for the current crop year, and the reduction or lack of contract results in no remaining eligible acres to use on your total cropland acres in the county:
(
1
) You must first exhaust all other eligible acres;
(
2
) The number of eligible acres for the contracted crop will be determined based on the number of acres or amount of production you contracted in the county in the previous crop year, less the current year's contracted acreage or production, if applicable;
(
3
) The prevented planting payment and premium will be calculated in accordance with section 17(h)(2);
(
4
) If you did not have a processor contract in place for the previous crop year, no eligible contracted acreage exists for this purpose.
(2) Any eligible acreage determined in accordance with section 17(e)(1) will be reduced by subtracting the number of acres of the crop (insured and uninsured) that are timely and late planted, including acreage specified in section 16(b), unless your first insured crop failed and you plant an uninsured second crop on the same acres within the same crop year, the acres for the uninsured second crop will not be subtracted from the eligible prevented planting acreage.
(f) Regardless of the number of eligible acres determined in section 17(e), prevented planting coverage will not be provided for any acreage:
(1) That does not constitute at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the insurable crop acreage in the unit, whichever is less (if the crop is in a whole-farm unit, the 20 acre or 20 percent requirement will be applied separately to each crop in the whole-farm unit). Any prevented planting acreage within a field that contains planted acreage will be considered acreage of the same crop, type, and practice that is planted in the field unless:
(i) The acreage that was prevented from being planted constitutes at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the total insurable acreage in the field and you produced both crops, crop types, or followed both practices in the same field in the same crop year within any one of the four most recent crop years;
(ii) You were prevented from planting a first insured crop and you planted a second crop in the field (there can only be one first insured crop in a field unless the requirements in section 17(f)(1)(i) or (iii) are met);
(iii) The insured crop planted in the field would not have been planted on the remaining prevented planting acreage (
e.g.,
where due to Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, or processor contract specifications rotation requirements would not be met, or you already planted the total number of acres specified in the processor contract); or
(iv) The acreage that was prevented from being planted constitutes at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the total insurable acreage in the field and you provide proof that you intended to plant another crop, crop type, or follow both practices on the acreage (including, but not limited to inputs purchased, applied or available to apply, or that acreage was part of a crop rotation).
(2) For which the actuarial documents do not provide the information needed to determine the premium rate, unless a written agreement designates such premium rate;
(3) Used for conservation purposes, intended to be left unplanted under any program administered by the USDA or other government agency, or required to be left unharvested under the terms of the lease or any other agreement (the number of acres eligible for prevented planting will be limited to the number of acres specified in the lease for which you are required to pay either cash or share rent);
(4) On which the insured crop is prevented from being planted, if you or any other person receives a prevented planting payment for any crop for the same acreage in the
same crop year, excluding share arrangements, unless:
(i) It is a practice that is generally recognized by agricultural experts or organic agricultural experts in the area to plant the insured crop for harvest following harvest of the first insured crop, and additional coverage insurance offered under the authority of the Act is available in the county for both crops in the same crop year;
(ii) For the insured crop that is prevented from being planted, you provide records acceptable to us of acreage and production that show (your double cropping history is limited to the highest number of acres double cropped within the applicable four-year period unless your double cropping history is determined in accordance with section 15(i)(3)):
(A) You have double cropped acreage in at least 2 of the last 4 crop years in which the insured crop that is prevented from being planted in the current crop year was grown (you may apply your history of double cropping to any acreage of the insured crop in the county (for example, you have 100 cropland acres in the county and have double cropped wheat and soybeans on all 100 acres and you acquire an additional 100 acres in the county, you can apply your history of 100 double cropped acres to any of the 200 acres in the county)); or
(B) The applicable acreage you are prevented from planting in the current crop year was double cropped for at least 2 of the last 4 crop years in which the insured crop that is prevented from being planted was grown. You may only use the history of double cropping for the same physical acres from which double cropping records were provided from one or more other producers (for example, if a neighbor has double cropped 100 acres of wheat and soybeans in the county and you acquire your neighbor's 100 double cropped acres and an additional 100 acres in the county, you can only apply your neighbor's history of double cropped acreage to the same 100 acres that your neighbor double cropped); and
(iii) The amount of acreage you are double cropping in the current crop year does not exceed the number of acres for which you provided the records required in section 17(f)(4)(ii);
(5) On which the insured crop is prevented from being planted, if:
(i) Any crop is planted within or prior to the late planting period or on or prior to the final planting date if no late planting period is applicable, unless:
(A) You meet the double cropping requirements in section 17(f)(4);
(B) The crop planted was a cover crop; or
(C) No benefit, including any benefit under any USDA program, was derived from the crop;
(ii) Any volunteer crop is harvested for grain or seed at any time;
(iii) The act of haying, grazing, or cutting for silage, haylage, or baleage a cover crop or volunteer crop contributed to the acreage being prevented from being planted;
(iv) A cover crop is planted within or prior to the late planting period or on or prior to the final planting date if no late planting period is applicable and is harvested for grain or seed at any time.
(6) For which planting history or conservation plans indicate the acreage would have remained fallow for crop rotation purposes or on which any pasture or forage crop is in place on the acreage during the time planting of the insured crop generally occurs in the area. Cover plants that are seeded, transplanted, or that volunteer:
(i) More than 12 months prior to the final planting date for the insured crop that was prevented from being planted will be considered pasture or a forage crop that is in place (
e.g.,
the cover crop is planted 15 months prior to the final planting date and remains in place during the time the insured crop would normally be planted); or
(ii) Less than 12 months prior to the final planting date for the insured crop that was prevented from being planted will not be considered pasture or a forage crop that is in place;
(7) That exceeds the number of acres eligible for a prevented planting payment;
(8) That exceeds the number of eligible acres physically available for planting.
(i) In order for acreage to be considered physically available for planting, the acreage must:
(A) Be free of trees, rocky outcroppings, or other factors that prevent proper and timely preparation of the seedbed for planting and harvest of the crop in the crop year;
(B) Not be enrolled in a USDA program that removes the acreage from crop production;
(C) Not be planted to a perennial crop (
i.e.,
trees or vines either planted on the acreage, or not removed from the acreage in a proper or timely manner, thus preventing the timely planting of a crop for the crop year);
(D) Not have pasture, rangeland or forage in place (see section 17(f)(6));
(E) Unless otherwise allowed in the Special Provisions, in at least 1 of the 4 most recent crop years immediately preceding the current crop year, have been planted to a crop (planted includes annual regrowth of a perennial forage or mint crop):
(
1
) Using recognized good farming practices;
(
2
) Insured under the authority of the Act or NAP; and
(
3
) That was harvested, or if not harvested, was adjusted for claim purposes under the authority of the Act or NAP due to an insured cause of loss (other than a cause of loss
related to flood, excess moisture, drought, or other cause of loss specified in the Special Provisions).
(ii) If you do not meet the requirements of section 17(f)(8)(i)(E) because a crop specific plan of insurance offered under the authority of the Act or NAP was not available for the crops planted on the acreage in the 4 most recent crop years, the acreage may be considered physically available for planting if you can prove the acreage was planted and harvested using good farming practices in at least 2 consecutive years out of the 4 most recent crop years immediately preceding the current crop year.
(iii) Once any acreage does not satisfy the requirements in section 17(f)(8)(i)(E) or 17(f)(8)(ii), such acreage will be considered physically unavailable for planting until the acreage has been planted to a crop in accordance with 17(f)(8)(i)(E) for 2 consecutive crop years, or until such acreage meets the requirements of 17(f)(8)(ii).
(9) For which you cannot provide proof that you had the inputs (including, but not limited to, sufficient equipment and labor) available to plant and produce a crop with the expectation of producing at least the yield used to determine your production guarantee or amount of insurance. Evidence that you previously had planted the crop on the unit will be considered adequate proof unless:
(i) There has been a change in the availability of inputs since the crop was last planted that could affect your ability to plant and produce the insured crop;
(ii) We determine you have insufficient inputs to plant the total number of insured crop acres (
e.g.,
you will not receive a prevented planting payment if you have sufficient inputs to plant only 80 acres but you have already planted 80 acres and are claiming prevented planting on an additional 100 acres); or
(iii) Your planting practices or rotational requirements show the acreage would have remained fallow or been planted to another crop;
(10) Based on an irrigated practice production guarantee or amount of insurance unless adequate irrigation facilities were in place to carry out an irrigated practice on the acreage prior to the insured cause of loss that prevented you from planting. Acreage with an irrigated practice production guarantee will be limited to the number of acres allowed for that practice under sections 17(e) and (f);
(11) Based on a crop type that you did not plant, or did not receive a prevented planting insurance guarantee for, in at least one of the four most recent crop years:
(i) Types for which separate projected prices or price elections, as applicable, amounts of insurance, or production guarantees are available must be included in your APH database in at least one of the four most recent crop years (crops for which the insurance guarantee is not based on APH must be reported on your acreage report in at least one of the four most recent crop years) except as allowed in section 17(e)(1)(ii) or (iii); and
(ii) We will limit prevented planting payments based on a specific crop type to the number of acres allowed for that crop type as specified in sections 17(e) and (f); or
(12) If after considerations of historical weather patterns, timing of the final planting date, your planting history, and other factors, we determine a cause of loss has occurred that may prevent planting at the time:
(i) You take possession of the leased acreage (except acreage you leased the previous crop year and continue to lease in the current crop year);
(ii) You take possession of the purchased acreage;
(iii) The acreage is released from a USDA program which prohibits harvest of a crop;
(iv) You request a written agreement to insure the acreage; or
(v) You acquire the acreage through means other than lease or purchase (such as inherited or gifted acreage).
(g) If you purchased an additional coverage policy for a crop, and you executed a High-Risk Land Exclusion Option and separately insured acreage which has been designated as high-risk land by FCIC in accordance with section 3(b)(2)(ii)(B) and (C), the maximum number of acres eligible for a prevented planting payment will be limited for each policy as specified in section 17(e) and (f).
(h) If you are prevented from planting a crop for which you do not have an adequate base of eligible prevented planting acreage, as determined in accordance with section 17(e)(1), we will use acreage from another crop insured by us for the current crop year for which you have remaining eligible prevented planting acreage.
(1) The crop first used for this purpose will be the insured crop that would have a prevented planting payment most similar to the payment for the crop that was prevented from being planted.
(i) If there are still insufficient eligible prevented planting acres, the next crop used will be the insured crop that would have the next closest prevented planting payment.
(ii) In the event payment amounts based on other crops are an equal amount above and below the payment amount for the crop that was prevented from being planted, eligible acres for the crop with the higher payment amount will be used first.
(2) The prevented planting payment and premium will be based on:
(i) The crop that was prevented from being planted if the insured crop with remaining eligible acreage would have resulted in a
higher prevented planting payment than would have been paid for the crop that was prevented from being planted; or
(ii) The crop from which eligible acres are being used if the insured crop with remaining eligible acreage will result in a lower prevented planting payment than would have been paid for the crop that was prevented from being planted.
(3) For example, assume you were prevented from planting 200 acres of corn and you have 100 acres eligible for a corn prevented planting guarantee that would result in a payment of $40 per acre. You also had 50 acres of potato eligibility that would result in a $100 per acre payment and 90 acres of grain sorghum eligibility that would result in a $30 per acre payment. Your prevented planting coverage will be based on 100 acres of corn ($40 per acre), 90 acres of grain sorghum ($30 per acre), and an additional 10 acres of corn (using potato eligible acres and paid as corn at $40 per acre). Your prevented planting payment would be $7,100 ($4,000 + $2,700 + $400).
(4) Prevented planting coverage will be allowed as specified in section 17(h) only if the crop that was prevented from being planted meets all policy provisions, except for having an adequate base of eligible prevented planting acreage. Payment may be made based on crops other than those that were prevented from being planted even though other policy provisions, including but not limited to, processor contract and rotation requirements, have not been met for the crop whose eligible acres are being used. When you have exhausted eligible acres to provide prevented planting coverage for all insured cropland acres in your farming operation, you may use remaining eligible acres as established in section 17(e)(1)(iii)(C).
(5) An additional administrative fee will not be due as a result of using eligible prevented planting acreage as specified in section 17(h).
(i) The prevented planting payment for any eligible acreage within a unit will be determined by:
(1) Multiplying the prevented planting coverage level percentage you elected, or that is contained in the Crop Provisions if you did not elect a prevented planting coverage level percentage, by:
(i) Your amount of insurance per acre; or
(ii) The amount determined by multiplying the production guarantee (per acre) for timely planted acreage of the insured crop (or type, if applicable) by your price election or your projected price, whichever is applicable;
(2) Multiplying the result of section 17(i)(1) by the number of eligible prevented planting acres in the unit; and
(3) Multiplying the result of section 17(i)(2) by your share.

# 18. Written Agreements
Terms of this policy which are specifically designated for the use of written agreements may be altered by written agreement in accordance with the following:
(a) You must apply in writing for each written agreement (including renewal of a written agreement) no later than the sales closing date, except as provided in section 18(e);
(b) The application for a written agreement must contain all variable terms of the contract between you and us that will be in effect if the written agreement is not approved;
(c) If approved by FCIC, the written agreement will include all variable terms of the contract, including, but not limited to, the crop; practice, type or variety; guarantee; premium rate; and projected price, harvest price, price election or amount of insurance, as applicable, or the information needed to determine such variable terms. If the written agreement is for a county:
(1) That has a price election or amount of insurance stated in the actuarial documents, for the crop, practice, type or variety, the written agreement will contain the price election or amount of insurance stated in the actuarial documents, for the crop, practice, type or variety;
(2) That does not have price elections or amounts of insurance stated in the actuarial documents, for the crop, practice, type or variety, the written agreement will contain a price election or amount of insurance that does not exceed the price election or amount of insurance contained in the actuarial documents, for the county that is used to establish the other terms of the written agreement, unless otherwise authorized by the Crop Provisions;
(3) For which revenue protection is not available for the crop, but revenue protection is available in the State for the crop, the written agreement will contain the information used to establish the projected price and harvest price, as applicable, for that State; or
(4) In a State for which revenue protection is not available for the crop, but revenue protection is available for the crop in another State, the written agreement is available for yield protection only, and will contain the information needed to determine the projected price for the crop from another State as determined by FCIC;
(d) Each written agreement will only be valid for the number of crop years specified in the written agreement, and a multi-year written agreement:
(1) Will only apply for any particular crop year designated in the written agreement if all terms and conditions in the written agreement are still applicable for the crop year and the conditions under which the
written agreement has been provided have not changed prior to the beginning of the insurance period (if conditions change during or prior to the crop year, the written agreement will not be effective for that crop year but may still be effective for a subsequent crop year if conditions under which the written agreement has been provided exist for such year);
(2) May be canceled in writing by:
(i) FCIC not less than 30 days before the cancellation date if it discovers that any term or condition of the written agreement, including the premium rate, is not appropriate for the crop; or
(ii) You or us on or before the cancellation date;
(3) That is not renewed in writing after it expires, is not applicable for a crop year, or is canceled, then insurance coverage will be in accordance with the terms and conditions stated in this policy, without regard to the written agreement; and
(4) Will be automatically canceled if you transfer your policy to another insurance provider (No notice will be provided to you and for any subsequent crop year, for a written agreement to be effective, you must timely request renewal of the written agreement in accordance with this section);
(e) A request for a written agreement may be submitted:
(1) After the sales closing date, but on or before the acreage reporting date, if you demonstrate your physical inability to submit the request on or before the sales closing date (
e.g.,
you have been hospitalized or a blizzard has made it impossible to submit the written agreement request in person or by mail); or
(2) For the first year the written agreement is requested:
(i) On or before the acreage reporting date to:
(A) Insure unrated land, or an unrated practice, type or variety of a crop; although, if required by FCIC, such written agreements may be approved only after appraisal of the acreage by us and:
(
1
) The crop's potential is equal to or exceeds 90 percent of the yield used to determine your production guarantee or amount of insurance; and
(
2
) You sign the written agreement no later than the date the first field is appraised or by the expiration date for you to accept the offer, whichever comes first; or
(B) Establish optional units in accordance with FCIC procedures that otherwise would not be allowed or change the premium rate or transitional yield for designated high-risk land;
(ii) On or before the cancellation date to insure a crop in a county that does not have actuarial documents for the crop (if the Crop Provisions do not provide a cancellation date for the county, the cancellation date for other insurable crops in the same State that have similar final planting and harvesting dates will be applicable); or
(iii) On or before the date specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions;
(f) A request for a written agreement must contain:
(1) For all written agreement requests:
(i) A completed “Request for Actuarial Change” form;

(B) Verifiable production records for at least the three most recent crop years in which the crop was planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop):
(
1
) The verifiable production records do not necessarily have to be from the same physical acreage for which you are requesting a written agreement;
(
2
) Verifiable production records do not have to be submitted for any year you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) have insured the crop in the county or area and have certified the yields on the applicable production reports or the yields

(
3
) FCIC will not consider any crop year in which the crop was planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) outside of the most recent ten crop years as a year of previously planting the crop (or having produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop), unless verifiable production records are provided, or the crop was insured for that crop year;

(A) A completed APH (only for crop policies that require APH) based on verifiable production records of actual yields for the similar crop;
(B) Verifiable production records for at least the three most recent crop years in which the similar crop was planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) in the county or area:
(
1
) The verifiable production records for the similar crop do not necessarily have to be from the same physical acreage for which you are requesting a written agreement;
(
2
) Verifiable production records do not have to be submitted for any crop year you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) have insured the similar crop in the county or area and have certified the yields on the applicable production reports or the yields are based on your insurance claim (although you are not required to submit production records, you still must maintain production records in accordance with section 21); and
(
3
) FCIC will not consider any crop year in which the similar crop was planted (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) outside of the most recent ten crop years as a year of previously planting the similar crop (or having produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop), unless verifiable production records are provided, or the similar crop was insured, for that crop year;
(C) If you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) have at least one year of production records, but less than three years of production records, for the crop in the county or area but have production records for a similar crop in the county or area such that the combination of both sets of records results in at least three years of production records, you must provide the information required in sections 18(f)(2)(i)(A) and (B) for the years you (or anyone with a substantial beneficial interest in you) planted the crop (or produced a crop if the crop is a perennial crop) in the county or area and the information required in sections 18(f)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) regarding the similar crop for the remaining years; and

(k) With respect to your and our ability to reject an offer for a written agreement:
(1) When a single Request for Actuarial Change form is submitted, regardless of how many requests for changes are contained on the form, you and we can only accept or reject the written agreement in its entirety (you cannot reject specific terms of the written agreement and accept others);
(2) When multiple Request for Actuarial Change forms are submitted, regardless of when the forms are submitted, for the same condition or for the same crop (
i.e.
, to insure corn on ten legal descriptions where there are no actuarial documents in the county or the request is to change the premium rates from the high-risk rates) all these forms may be treated as one request and you and we will only have the option of accepting or rejecting the written agreement in its entirety (you cannot reject specific terms of the written agreement and accept others);

# [For Reinsured Policies]

# 20. Mediation, Arbitration, Appeal, Reconsideration, and Administrative and Judicial Review
(a) If you do not agree with any determination made by us except those specified in section 20(d) or (e), the disagreement may be resolved through mediation in accordance with section 20(g). If the disagreement cannot be resolved through mediation, or you and we do not agree to mediation, you must timely seek resolution through arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), except as provided in sections 20(c) and (f), and unless rules are established by FCIC for this purpose. Any mediator or arbitrator with a familial, financial or other business relationship to you or us, or our agent or loss adjuster, is disqualified from hearing the dispute.
(1) All disputes involving determinations made by us, except those specified in section 20(d) or (e), are subject to mediation or arbitration. However, if the dispute in any way involves a policy or procedure interpretation, regarding whether a specific policy provision or procedure is applicable to the situation, how it is applicable, or the meaning of any policy provision or procedure, either you or we must obtain an interpretation from FCIC in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart X or such other procedures as established by FCIC.
(i) Any interpretation by FCIC will be binding in any mediation or arbitration.
(ii) Failure to obtain any required interpretation from FCIC will result in the nullification of any agreement or award.

(iv) An interpretation by FCIC of a procedure may be appealed to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.
(2) Unless the dispute is resolved through mediation, the arbitrator must provide to you and us a written statement describing the issues in dispute, the factual findings, the determinations and the amount and basis for any award and breakdown by claim for any award. The statement must also include any amounts awarded for interest. Failure of the arbitrator to provide such written statement will result in the nullification of all determinations of the arbitrator. All agreements reached through settlement, including those resulting from mediation, must be in writing and contain at a minimum a statement of the issues in dispute and the amount of the settlement.
(b) Regardless of whether mediation is elected:
(1) You must initiate arbitration proceedings within 1 year of the date we denied your claim or rendered the determination with which you disagree, whichever is later;
(2) If you fail to initiate arbitration in accordance with section 20(b)(1) and complete the process, you will not be able to resolve the dispute through judicial review;
(3) If arbitration has been initiated in accordance with section 20(b)(1) and completed, and judicial review is sought, suit must be filed not later than one year after the date the arbitration decision was rendered; and
(4) In any suit, if the dispute in any way involves a policy or procedure interpretation, regarding whether a specific policy provision or procedure is applicable to the situation, how it is applicable, or the meaning of any policy provision or procedure, an interpretation must be obtained from FCIC in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart X or such other procedures as established by FCIC. Such interpretation will be binding.
(c) Any decision rendered in arbitration is binding on you and us unless judicial review is sought in accordance with section 20(b)(3). Notwithstanding any provision in the rules of the AAA, you and we have the right to judicial review of any decision rendered in arbitration.
(d) With respect to good farming practices:
(1) We will make decisions regarding what constitutes a good farming practice and determinations of assigned production for uninsured causes for your failure to use good farming practices.
(i) If you disagree with our determination of the amount of assigned production, you must use the arbitration or mediation process contained in this section.
(ii) If you disagree with our decision of what constitutes a good farming practice
you may request through us that FCIC review our decision. Requests for FCIC review must be made within 30 days of the postmark date on the written notice of the determination regarding good farming practices.
(iii) You may not sue us for our decisions regarding whether good farming practices were used by you. You must request a determination from FCIC of what constitutes a good farming practice before filing any suit against FCIC.
(2) FCIC will make determinations regarding what constitutes a good farming practice. If you do not agree with any determination made by FCIC:
(i) You may request reconsideration by FCIC of this determination in accordance with the reconsideration process established for this purpose and published at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J; or
(ii) You may file suit against FCIC.
(A) You are not required to request reconsideration from FCIC before filing suit.
(B) Any suit must be brought against FCIC in the United States district court for the district in which the insured acreage is located.
(C) Suit must be filed against FCIC not later than one year after the date:
(
1

(
2
) Reconsideration is completed, if reconsideration was requested under section 20(d)(2)(i).
(e) Except as provided in sections 18(n) or (o), or 20(d) or (k), if you disagree with any other determination made by FCIC or any claim where FCIC is directly involved in the claims process or directs us in the resolution of the claim, you may obtain an administrative review in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, subpart J (administrative review) or appeal in accordance with 7 CFR part 11 (appeal).
(1) If you elect to bring suit after completion of any appeal, such suit must be filed against FCIC not later than one year after the date of the decision rendered in such appeal.
(2) Such suit must be brought in the United States district court for the district in which the insured acreage is located.
(3) Under no circumstances can you recover any attorney's fees or other expenses, or any punitive, compensatory or any other damages from FCIC.
(f) In any mediation, arbitration, appeal, administrative review, reconsideration or judicial process, the terms of this policy, the Act, and the regulations published at 7 CFR chapter IV, including the provisions of 7 CFR part 400, subpart P, are binding. Conflicts between this policy and any state or local laws will be resolved in accordance with section 31. If there are conflicts between any rules of the AAA and the provisions of your policy, the provisions of your policy will control.
(g) To resolve any dispute through mediation, you and we must both:
(1) Agree to mediate the dispute;
(2) Agree on a mediator; and
(3) Be present, or have a designated representative who has authority to settle the case present, at the mediation.
(h) Except as provided in section 20(i), no award or settlement in mediation, arbitration, appeal, administrative review or reconsideration process or judicial review can exceed the amount of liability established or which should have been established under the policy, except for interest awarded in accordance with section 26.
(i) In a judicial review only, you may recover attorney's fees or other expenses, or any punitive, compensatory or any other damages from us only if you obtain a determination from FCIC that we, our agent or loss adjuster failed to comply with the terms of this policy or procedures issued by FCIC and such failure resulted in you receiving a payment in an amount that is less than the amount to which you were entitled. Requests for such a determination should be addressed to the following: USDA/RMA/Deputy Administrator of Compliance/Stop 0806, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250-0806.
(j) If FCIC elects to participate in the adjustment of your claim, or modifies, revises or corrects your claim, prior to payment, you may not bring an arbitration, mediation or litigation action against us. You must request administrative review or appeal in accordance with section 20(e).
(k) Any determination made by FCIC that is a matter of general applicability is not subject to administrative review under 7 CFR part 400, subpart J or appeal under 7 CFR part 11. If you want to seek judicial review of any FCIC determination that is a matter of general applicability, you must request a determination of non-appealability from the Director of the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR 11.6 before seeking judicial review.

# 21. Access to Insured Crop and Records, and Record Retention
(a) We, and any employee of USDA authorized to investigate or review any matter relating to crop insurance, have the right to examine the insured crop and all records related to the insured crop and any mediation, arbitration or litigation involving the insured crop as often as reasonably required during the record retention period.
(b) You must retain, and provide upon our request, or the request of any employee of USDA authorized to investigate or review any matter relating to crop insurance:
(1) Complete records of the planting, replanting, inputs, production, harvesting, and disposition of the insured crop on each unit for three years after the end of the crop year
(this requirement also applies to all such records for acreage that is not insured);
(2) All records used to establish the amount of production you certified on your production reports used to compute your approved yield for three years after the calendar date for the end of the insurance period for the crop year for which you initially certified such records, unless such records have already been provided to us (
e.g.,
if you are a new insured and you certify 2015 through 2018 crop year production records in 2019 to determine your approved yield for the 2019 crop year, you must retain all records from the 2015 through 2018 crop years through the 2022 crop year. If you subsequently certify records of the 2019 crop year in 2020 to determine your approved yield for the 2020 crop year, you must retain the 2019 crop year records through the 2023 crop year and so forth for each subsequent year of production records certified); and
(3) While you are not required to maintain records beyond the record retention period specified in section 21(b)(2), at any time, if we or FCIC have evidence that you, or anyone assisting you, knowingly misreported any information related to any yield you have certified, we or FCIC will replace all yields in your APH database determined to be incorrect with the lesser of an assigned yield determined in accordance with section 3 or the yield determined to be correct:
(i) If an overpayment has been made to you, you will be required to repay the overpaid amount; and
(ii) Replacement of yields in accordance with section 21(b)(3) does not exempt you from other sanctions applicable under the terms of the policy or any applicable law.
(c) We, or any employee of USDA authorized to investigate or review any matter relating to crop insurance, may extend the record retention period beyond three years by notifying you of such extension in writing.
(d) By signing the application for insurance authorized under the Act or by continuing insurance for which you have previously applied, you authorize us or USDA, or any person acting for us or USDA authorized to investigate or review any matter relating to crop insurance, to obtain records relating to the planting, replanting, inputs, production, harvesting, and disposition of the insured crop from any person who may have custody of such records, including but not limited to, FSA offices, banks, warehouses, gins, cooperatives, marketing associations, and accountants. You must assist in obtaining all records we or any employee of USDA authorized to investigate or review any matter relating to crop insurance request from third parties.
(e) Failure to provide access to the insured crop or the farm, authorize access to the records maintained by third parties or assist in obtaining such records will result in a determination that no indemnity is due for the crop year in which such failure occurred.
(f) Failure to maintain or provide records will result in:
(1) The imposition of an assigned yield in accordance with section 3(f)(1) and section 5 for those crop years for which you do not have the required production records to support a certified yield;
(2) A determination that no indemnity is due if you fail to provide records necessary to determine your loss;
(3) Combination of the optional units into the applicable basic unit;
(4) Assignment of production to the units by us if you fail to maintain separate records:
(i) For your basic units; or
(ii) For any uninsurable acreage; and
(5) The imposition of consequences specified in section 6(g), as applicable.
(g) If the imposition of an assigned yield under section 21(f)(1) would affect an indemnity, prevented planting payment or replanting payment that was paid in a prior crop year, such claim will be adjusted and you will be required to repay any overpaid amounts.

# 22. Other Insurance
(a) Other Like Insurance—Nothing in this section prevents you from obtaining other insurance not authorized under the Act. However, unless specifically required by policy provisions, you must not obtain any other crop insurance authorized under the Act on your share of the insured crop.
(1) You must demonstrate that you did not intend to have more than one policy in effect (for example, an application to transfer your policy or written notification to an insurance provider that states you want to purchase, or transfer insurance and you want any other policies for the crop canceled would demonstrate you did not intend to have duplicate policies), and:
(i) One is an additional coverage policy and the other is a Catastrophic Risk Protection policy:
(A) If both policies are with the same insurance provider, the additional coverage policy will apply and the Catastrophic Risk Protection policy will be void;
(B) If both policies are with different insurance providers and both insurance providers agree, the additional coverage policy will apply and the Catastrophic Risk Protection policy will be void; or
(C) If both policies are with different insurance providers and both insurance providers do not agree, the policy with the earliest application date will be in force and the other policy will be void; or
(ii) Both are additional coverage policies, or both are Catastrophic Risk Protection
policies, the policy with the earliest application date will be in force and the other policy will be void, unless both policies are with:
(A) The same insurance provider and the insurance provider agrees to void the policy with the earliest application date; or
(B) Different insurance providers and both insurance providers agree to void the policy with the earliest application date.
(2) If you cannot demonstrate that you did not intend to have more than one policy in effect, you may be subject to the consequences authorized under this policy, the Act, or any other applicable statute.
(b)
Other Insurance Against Fire.
If you have other insurance, whether valid or not, against damage to the insured crop by fire during the insurance period, and you have not excluded coverage for fire from this policy, we will be liable for loss due to fire caused by a naturally occurring event only for the smaller of:
(1) The amount of indemnity determined pursuant to this policy without regard to such other insurance; or
(2) The amount by which the loss from fire is determined to exceed the indemnity paid or payable under such other insurance.
(c) For the purpose of section 22(b), the amount of loss from fire will be the difference between the total value of the insured crop before the fire and the total value of the insured crop after the fire. This amount will be determined in accordance with the provisions in section 35.

# 23. Conformity to Food Security Act
Although your violation of a number of Federal statutes, including the Act, may cause cancellation, termination, or voidance of your insurance contract, you should be specifically aware that your policy will be canceled if you are determined to be ineligible to receive benefits under the Act due to violation of the controlled substance provisions (title XVII) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) and the regulations promulgated under the Act by USDA. Your insurance policy will be canceled if you are determined, by the appropriate Agency, to be in violation of these provisions. We will recover any and all monies paid to you or received by you during your period of ineligibility, and your premium will be refunded, less an amount for expenses and handling equal to 20 percent of the premium paid or to be paid by you.

(1) Avoid ineligibility requirements for insurance or obtain a disproportionate benefit under the crop insurance program or any related program administered by the Secretary;
(2) Obtain, enhance, or increase an insurance guarantee or indemnity if a cause of loss exists or has occurred before any correction has been made, or avoid premium owed if no loss is likely to occur; or
(3) Avoid an obligation or requirement under any Federal or State law.

# 26. Interest Limitations
We will pay simple interest computed on the net indemnity ultimately found to be due by us or by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, from and including the 61st day after the date you sign, date, and submit to us the properly completed claim on our form. Interest will be paid only if the reason for our failure to timely pay is NOT due to your failure to provide information or other material necessary for the computation or payment of the indemnity. The interest rate will be that established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) and published in the

# 28. Transfer of Coverage and Right to Indemnity
If you transfer any part of your share during the crop year, you may transfer your coverage rights, if the transferee is eligible for crop insurance. We will not be liable for any more than the liability determined in accordance with your policy that existed before the transfer occurred. The transfer of coverage rights must be on our form and will not be effective until approved by us in writing. Both you and the transferee are jointly and severally liable for the payment of the premium and administrative fees. The transferee has all rights and responsibilities under this policy consistent with the transferee's interest.

# 29. Assignment of Indemnity
(a) You may assign your right to an indemnity for the crop year only to creditors or other persons to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation. You may be required to provide proof of the debt or other pecuniary obligation before we will accept the assignment of indemnity.
(b) All assignments must be on our form and must be provided to us. Each assignment form may contain more than one creditor or other person to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation.
(c) Unless you have provided us with a properly executed assignment of indemnity, we will not make any payment to a lienholder or other person to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation even if you may have a lien or other assignment recorded elsewhere. Under no circumstances will we be liable:
(1) To any lienholder or other person to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation where you have failed to include such lienholder or person on a properly executed assignment of indemnity provided to us; or
(2) To pay to all lienholders or other persons to whom you have a financial debt or other pecuniary obligation any amount greater than the total amount of indemnity owed under the policy.
(d) If we have received the properly executed assignment of indemnity form:
(1) Only one payment will be issued jointly in the names of all assignees and you, unless all assignees and you agree in writing for the payment to be issued to a single payee; and
(2) Any assignee will have the right to submit all loss notices and forms as required by the policy if you fail to do so. If you have suffered a loss from an insurable cause and fail to submit a claim for indemnity within the period specified in section 14(e):
(i) An assignee may submit the claim for indemnity not later than 30 days after the period for filing a claim has expired.
(ii) No indemnity will be paid if we determine that we do not have the ability to accurately adjust the loss for any claim for indemnity. You or any assignee may not dispute the determination.
(e) If an assignee submits a notice of loss or claim for indemnity because of your failure to timely do so, the assignee assumes any rights and responsibilities you may have under section 20 to dispute determinations related to the notice of loss or claim for indemnity, except for determinations made in accordance with section 29(d)(2)(ii).

# 34. Units
(a) Election of Enterprise Unit and Whole-Farm Unit—You may elect an enterprise unit or whole-farm unit as allowed by the actuarial documents.
(1) Election Date—You must make such election on or before the earliest sales closing date for the insured crops in the unit and report such unit structure on your acreage report:
(i) For counties in which the actuarial documents specify a fall or winter sales closing date and a spring sales closing date, you may change your unit election on or before the spring sales closing date (earliest spring sales closing date for crops in the unit if electing a whole-farm unit) if you do not have any insured fall planted acreage of the insured crop;
(ii) Your unit selection will remain in effect from year to year unless you notify us in writing by the earliest sales closing date for the crop year for which you wish to change this election; and
(iii) These units may not be further divided except as specified herein;
(2) Enterprise Units—For an enterprise unit:
(i) The acreage in an enterprise unit must be located in:
(A) Two or more sections, if sections are the basis for optional units where the insured acreage is located;
(B) Two or more section equivalents determined in accordance with FCIC procedures, if section equivalents are the basis for optional units where the insured acreage is located or are applicable to the insured acreage;
(C) Two or more FSA farm numbers, if FSA farm numbers are the basis for optional units where the insured acreage is located;
(D) Any combination of two or more sections, section equivalents, or FSA farm numbers, if more than one of these are the basis for optional units where the acreage is located or are applicable to the insured acreage (
e.g.,
if a portion of your acreage is located where sections are the basis for optional units and another portion of your acreage is located where FSA farm numbers are the basis for optional units, you may qualify for an enterprise unit based on a combination of these two parcels);
(E) One section, section equivalent, or FSA farm number that contains at least 660 planted acres of the insured crop. You may qualify under this paragraph based only on the type of parcel that is utilized to establish optional units where your insured acreage is located (
e.g.,
if having two or more sections is the basis for optional units where the insured acreage is located, you may qualify for an enterprise unit if you have at least 660 planted acres of the insured crop in one section);
(F) Two or more units established by written agreement;or
(G) Two or more non-contiguous parcels of land, if non-contiguous parcels of land are allowed by the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions as a basis for optional units where the insured acreage is located;
(ii) At least two of the sections, section equivalents, FSA farm numbers, units established by written agreement, or non-contiguous parcels of land in section 34(a)(2)(i)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F), or (G) must each have planted acreage that constitutes at least the lesser of 20 acres or 20 percent of the insured crop acreage in the enterprise unit. If there is planted acreage in more than two sections, section equivalents, FSA farm numbers, units established by written agreement, or non-contiguous parcels of land in section 34(a)(2)(i)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F), or (G), these can be aggregated to form at least two parcels to meet this requirement. For example, if sections are the basis for optional units where the insured acreage is located and you have 80 planted acres in section 1, 10 planted acres in section 2, and 10 planted acres in section 3, you may aggregate sections 2 and 3 to meet this requirement;
(iii) You must separately designate on the acreage report each section or other basis in section 34(a)(2)(i) you used to qualify for an enterprise unit;
(iv) You may elect an enterprise unit that contains all the insurable acreage of the
same insured crop if allowed by the actuarial documents.
(A) You must meet the requirement in sections 34(a)(2)(i) through (iii) to qualify.
(B) If we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit and such discovery is made:
(
1
) On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division will be based on the basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(
2
) At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure;
(v) You may elect separate enterprise units for irrigated or non-irrigated practices if allowed by the actuarial documents. If you make this election, you may not elect enterprise units by organic farming practice under section 34(a)(2)(vi).

(B) You must separately meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) for each enterprise unit.
(C) If you elected separate enterprise units for both irrigated and non-irrigated practices and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for the irrigated or non-irrigated practice and such discovery is made:
(
1
) On or before the acreage reporting date, you may elect to insure:
(
i
) One enterprise unit for all irrigated or non-irrigated practices provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2), and basic or optional units for the other practice, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for;
(
ii
) One enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2); or
(
iii
) Basic or optional units for all acreage of the crop in the county, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(
2
) At any time after the acreage reporting date, your unit structure will be one enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2). Otherwise, we will assign the basic unit structure.
(D) If you elected an enterprise unit on one practice (irrigated or non-irrigated) and a different unit structure on the other practice and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for the irrigated or non-irrigated practice and such discovery is made:
(
1
) On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(
2
) At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure;
(vi) You may elect separate enterprise units for acreage of the insured crop grown and insured under an organic farming practice and acreage of the insured crop not grown under an organic farming practice if allowed by the actuarial documents. If you make this election, you may not elect enterprise units by irrigation practice under section 34(a)(2)(v). Certified organic, transitional, and buffer zone acreages do not individually qualify as separate enterprise units. (See section 37 for additional provisions regarding acreage insured under an organic farming practice.)
(A) You may elect one enterprise unit for all acreage of the insured crop grown and insured under an organic farming practice or one enterprise unit for all acreage of the insured crop not grown under an organic farming practice or enterprise units for both.
(B) You must separately meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) for each enterprise unit.
(C) If you elected separate enterprise units for both acreage under an organic farming practice and acreage not under an organic farming practice and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for the acreage under an organic farming practice or acreage not grown under an organic farming practice and such discovery is made:
(
1
) On or before the acreage reporting date, you may elect to insure:
(
i
) One enterprise unit for all acreage under an organic farming practice or all acreage not under an organic farming practice provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2), and basic or optional units for the other acreage, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for;
(
ii
) One enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2); or
(
iii
) Basic or optional units for all acreage of the crop in the county, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(
2
) At any time after the acreage reporting date, your unit structure will be one enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2). Otherwise, we will assign the basic unit structure.
(D) If you elected an enterprise unit for acreage under an organic farming practice or acreage not under an organic farming practice and a different unit structure on the other acreage and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for the acreage under an organic farming practice or acreage not grown under an organic farming practice and such discovery is made:
(
1
) On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(
2
) At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure;
(vii) If you want to change your unit structure from enterprise units to basic or optional units in any subsequent crop year, you
must maintain separate records of acreage and production:
(A) For each basic unit, to be eligible to use records to establish the production guarantee for the basic unit; or
(B) For optional units, to qualify for optional units and to be eligible to use such records to establish the production guarantee for the optional units; and
(viii) If you do not comply with the production reporting provisions in section 3(f) for the enterprise unit, your yield for the enterprise unit will be determined in accordance with section 3(f)(1).
(3) For a whole-farm unit:
(i) To qualify:
(A) All crops in the whole-farm unit must be insured:
(
1
) Under revenue protection (if you elected the harvest price exclusion for any crop, you must elect it for all crops in the whole-farm unit), unless the actuarial documents allow whole-farm units for another plan of insurance and you insure all crops in the whole-farm unit under such plan (
e.g.,
if you plant corn and soybeans for which you have elected revenue protection and you plant canola for which you have elected yield protection, the corn, soybeans and canola would be assigned the unit structure in accordance with section 34(a)(3)(v));
(
2
) With us (
e.g.,
if you insure your corn and canola with us and your soybeans with a different insurance provider, the corn, soybeans and canola would be assigned the unit structure in accordance with section 34(a)(3)(v)); and
(
3
) At the same coverage level (e.g., if you elect to insure your corn and canola at the 65 percent coverage level and your soybeans at the 75 percent coverage level, the corn, soybeans and canola would be assigned the unit structure in accordance with section 34(a)(3)(v)) unless you can elect separate coverage levels for all irrigated and all non-irrigated crops in accordance with section 3(b)(2)(iii) (e.g., if you elect to insure your irrigated corn at the 65 percent coverage level you must insure your irrigated canola at the 65 percent coverage level. If you elect to insure your non-irrigated corn at the 70 percent coverage level you must insure your non-irrigated canola at the 70 percent coverage level. If you elect to insure your irrigated corn at the 65 percent coverage level and your irrigated canola at the 70 percent coverage level your unit structure will be assigned in accordance with section 34(a)(3)(v));
(B) A whole-farm unit must contain all of the insurable acreage of at least two crops; and
(C) At least two of the insured crops must each have planted acreage that constitutes 10 percent or more of the total planted acreage liability of all insured crops in the whole-farm unit (for crops for which revenue protection is available, liability will be based on the applicable projected price only for the purpose of section 34(a)(3)(i)(C));
(ii) You will be required to pay separate administrative fees for each crop included in the whole-farm unit;
(iii) You must separately designate on the acreage report each basic unit for each crop in the whole-farm unit;
(iv) If you want to change your unit structure from a whole-farm unit to basic or optional units in any subsequent crop year, you must maintain separate records of acreage and production:
(A) For each basic unit, to be eligible to use such records to establish the production guarantee for the basic units; or
(B) For optional units, to qualify for optional units and to be eligible to use such records to establish the production guarantee for the optional units; and
(v) If we discover you do not qualify for a whole-farm unit for at least one insured crop because:
(A) You do not meet all the other requirements in section 34(a)(3)(i), and such discovery is made:
(
1
) On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division for all crops for which you elected a whole-farm unit will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(
2
) At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure for all crops for which you elected a whole-farm unit; or
(B) It was not possible to establish a projected price for at least one of your crops, your unit division will be based on the unit structure you report on your acreage report and qualify for only for the crop for which a projected price could not be established, unless the remaining crops in the unit would no longer qualify for a whole-farm unit, in such case your unit division for the remaining crops will be based on the unit structure you report on your acreage report and qualify for.
(b) Unless limited by the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, a basic unit as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions may be divided into optional units if, for each optional unit, you meet the following:
(1) You must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of each optional unit;
(2) All optional units you select for the crop year are identified on the acreage report for that crop year (Units will be determined when the acreage is reported but may be adjusted or combined to reflect the actual unit structure when adjusting a loss. No further unit division may be made after the acreage reporting date for any reason.);
(3) You have records, that are acceptable to us, for at least the previous crop year for all optional units that you will report in the
current crop year (you may be required to produce the records for all optional units for the previous crop year); and
(4) You have records of marketed or stored production from each optional unit maintained in such a manner that permits us to verify the production from each optional unit, or the production from each optional unit is kept separate until loss adjustment is completed by us.
(c) Each optional unit must meet at least one of the following, unlessotherwise specified in the Crop Provisions or allowed by written agreement:
(1) Land location—
(i) Section—Optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate section where the boundaries are readily discernible.
(ii) Section equivalent—In the absence of sections, we may consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure, such as Spanish grants, provided the boundaries are readily discernible, if such parcels can be considered as the equivalent of sections for unit purposes in accordance with FCIC procedures; or
(iii) FSA farm number—In the absence of sections or section equivalents as described in section 34(c)(1)(i) and (ii), optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate FSA farm number in accordance with FCIC procedures;
(2) Irrigation practice—Separate optional units may be based on irrigated and non-irrigated acreage. To qualify as separate irrigated and non-irrigated optional units, the non-irrigated acreage may not continue into the irrigated acreage in the same rows or planting pattern. The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point at which the irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water needed to produce the yield on which the guarantee is based, except the corners of a field in which a center-pivot irrigation system is used may be considered as irrigated acreage if the corners of a field in which a center-pivot irrigation system is used do not qualify as a separate non-irrigated optional unit. In this case, production from both practices will be used to determine your approved yield;
(3) Organic farming practice—Separate optional units may be established for acreage of the insured crop grown and insured under an organic farming practice and acreage of the insured crop not grown under an organic farming practice. Certified organic, transitional, and buffer zone acreages do not individually qualify as separate optional units. (See section 37 for additional provisions regarding acreage insured under an organic farming practice.); or
(4) Combinations—Unless restricted otherwise by the Crop Provisions, each category within sections 34(c)(1), (2), and (3) may be independently applicable. Separate optional units based on combinations of categories between sections 34(c)(1) through (3) may be established if all acreage from the corresponding basic unit has the same optional unit structure. For example, you may choose to divide your entire basic unit into optional units by land location, irrigation practice, and organic farming practice, but you may not choose an optional unit by land location for one section and further divide a second section into optional units by irrigation practice, organic farming practice, or both.
(d) Optional units are not available for crops insured under a Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement.
(e) If you do not comply fully with the provisions in this section, we will combine all optional units that are not in compliance with these provisions into the basic unit from which they were formed. We will combine the optional units at any time we discover that you have failed to comply with these provisions. If failure to comply with these provisions is determined by us to be inadvertent, and the optional units are combined into a basic unit, that portion of the additional premium paid for the optional units that have been combined will be refunded to you for the units combined.

# 35. Multiple Benefits
(a) If you are eligible to receive an indemnity and are also eligible to receive benefits for the same loss under any other USDA program, you may receive benefits under both programs, unless specifically limited by the crop insurance contract or by law.
(b) Any amount received for the same loss from any USDA program, in addition to the crop insurance payment, will not exceed the difference between the crop insurance payment and the actual amount of the loss, unless otherwise provided by law. The amount of the actual loss is the difference between the total value of the insured crop before the loss and the total value of the insured crop after the loss.
(1) For crops for which revenue protection is not available:
(i) If you have an approved yield, the total value of the crop before the loss is your approved yield times the highest price election for the crop; and
(ii) If you have an approved yield, the total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the highest price election for the crop; or
(iii) If you have an amount of insurance, the total value of the crop before the loss is the highest amount of insurance available for the crop; and
(iv) If you have an amount of insurance, the total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the price contained in the Crop Provisions for valuing production to count.
(2) For crops for which revenue protection is available and:
(i) You elect yield protection:
(A) The total value of the crop before the loss is your approved yield times the applicable projected price (at the 100 percent price level) for the crop; and
(B) The total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the applicable projected price (at the 100 percent price level) for the crop; or
(ii) You elect revenue protection:
(A) The total value of the crop before the loss is your approved yield times the higher of the applicable projected price or harvest price for the crop (if you have elected the harvest price exclusion, the applicable projected price for the crop will be used); and
(B) The total value of the crop after the loss is your production to count times the harvest price for the crop.
(c) FSA or another USDA agency, as applicable, will determine and pay the additional amount due you for any applicable USDA program, after first considering the amount of any crop insurance indemnity.

# 36. Yield Options
If provided in the actuarial documents, you may elect the following measures to increase your approved yield:
(a) Adjustments to actual yields within an APH database:
(1) You may exclude and replace one or more actual yields, on an individual actual yield basis, that due to an insurable cause of loss, are less than 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield.
(i) Each election made in section 36(a)(1) must be made on or before the production reporting date for the insured crop and each such election will remain in effect for succeeding crop years unless canceled by the production reporting date for the succeeding crop year. If you cancel an election, the actual yield will be used in the APH database. For example, if you elected to substitute yields in your APH database for the 2020 and 2021 crop year, for any subsequent crop year, you can elect to cancel the substitution for either or both crop years.
(ii) Each excluded actual yield will be replaced with a yield equal to 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield for the crop year in which the yield is being replaced, unless you qualify as a beginning farmer or rancher, or veteran farmer or rancher, in which case the excluded actual yield will be replaced with a yield equal to 80 percent of the applicable transitional yield for the crop year in which the yield is being replaced. (For example, if you elect to exclude a 2020 crop year actual yield, the transitional yield in effect for the 2020 crop year in the county will be used. If you also elect to exclude a 2021 crop year actual yield, the transitional yield in effect for the 2021 crop year in the county will be used.) The replacement yields will be used in the same manner as actual yields for the purpose of calculating the approved yield.
(iii) Once you have elected to exclude an actual yield from the APH database, the replacement yield will remain in effect until such time as that crop year is no longer included in the APH database unless this election is canceled in accordance with section 36(a)(1)(i).
(iv) Although your approved yield will be used to determine your amount of premium owed, the premium rate will be increased to cover the additional risk associated with the substitution of higher yields.
(2) You may exclude any actual yield for any crop year when FCIC determines for a county, or its contiguous counties, the per planted acre yield was at least 50 percent below the simple average of the per planted acre yield for the crop in the county for the previous 10 consecutive crop years.
(3) You may replace actual yields determined using your post-quality production amounts with actual yields determined using your pre-quality production amounts for previous crop years on an individual actual yield basis.
(i) Each election made in section 36(a)(3) must be made on or before the sales closing date for the insured crop and will remain in effect, unless canceled by the sales closing date for the succeeding crop year.
(ii) In order to replace post-quality actual yields for previous crop years, you must have filed a notice of loss due to an insured cause of loss for the crop year to be eligible.
(iii) Once the pre-quality actual yield replaces the post-quality actual yield, the pre-quality actual yield will remain in effect until such time as that crop year is no longer included in the APH database, unless this election is canceled in accordance with section 36(a)(3)(i).
(iv) Although your approved yield will be used to determine your amount of premium owed, the premium rate will be increased to cover the additional risk associated with the replacement of higher pre-quality reduction based actual yields.
(b) You may make adjustments to your approved yield by limiting a reduction to the approved APH yield to a maximum decline of 10 percent of the previous crop year's approved APH yield when such reduction is due to a decline in production resulting from a natural disaster or other insurable loss, as provided in FCIC procedures.

# 37. Organic Farming Practices
(a) In accordance with section 8(b)(2), insurance will not be provided for any crop grown using an organic farming practice, unless the information needed to determine a
premium rate for an organic farming practice is specified on the actuarial table, or insurance is allowed by a written agreement.
(b) If insurance is provided for an organic farming practice as specified in section 37(a), only the following acreage will be insured under such practice:
(1) Certified organic acreage;
(2) Transitional acreage being converted to certified organic acreage in accordance with an organic system plan; and
(3) Buffer zone acreage.
(c) You must provide the following organic records, as applicable:
(1) By the acreage reporting date, except as allowed by section 37(c)(2), you must have:
(i) For certified organic acreage, a written certification in effect directly from a certifying agent indicating the name of the person certified, effective date of certification, certificate number, types of commodities certified, and name and address of the certifying agent (a certificate issued to a tenant may be used to qualify a landlord or other similar arrangement). A certificate issued from the National Organic Program's Organic Integrity Database (or successor certificate reporting tool) is acceptable.
(ii) For transitional acreage, an organic system plan documenting the use of practices that would result in certified organic status that includes the record information as described in section 37(c)(1)(i), or written documentation from a certifying agent indicating an organic system plan is in effect for the acreage.
(iii) For certified organic and transitional acreage, records from the certifying agent showing the specific location of each field of certified organic, transitional, buffer zone, and acreage not maintained under organic management.
(2) If you do not meet the requirements in section 37(c)(1)(i) or (ii), you must provide documentation that you have requested, in writing, your written certification or organic system plan by the acreage reporting date.
(i) Your certificate or organic system plan must be in effect prior to the earlier of the end of the insurance period or when coverage ends as provided in section 11(b).
(ii) Your acreage will remain insured under the practice you reported on the acreage reporting date unless you have a loss. If you have a loss and do not have a certificate or plan in place at the time the claim is finalized in accordance with the applicable policy provisions, then your acreage will be insured under the practice for which it qualifies.
(d) If you claim a loss on any acreage insured under an organic farming practice, you must provide us with copies of the records required in section 37(c).
(e) If any acreage qualifies as certified organic or transitional acreage on the date you report such acreage, and such certification is subsequently revoked or suspended by the certifying agent, or the certifying agent does not consider the acreage as transitional acreage for the remainder of the crop year, that acreage will remain insured under the reported practice for which it qualified at the time the acreage was reported. Any loss due to failure to comply with organic standards will be considered an uninsured cause of loss.
(f) Contamination by application or drift of prohibited substances onto land on which crops are grown using organic farming practices will not be an insured peril on any certified organic, transitional, or buffer zone acreage.
(g) In addition to the provisions contained in section 17(f), prevented planting coverage will not be provided for any acreage based on an organic farming practice in excess of the number of acres that will be grown under an organic farming practice and shown as such in the records required in section 37(c).
(h) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 17(f)(1) that specify prevented planting acreage within a field that contains planted acreage will be considered to be acreage of the same practice that is planted in the field, prevented planting acreage will be considered as organic farming practice acreage if it is identified as certified organic, transitional, or buffer zone acreage in the organic system plan.

# 38. Direct Marketing and Verifiable Records
(a) You must notify us and complete the marketing certification if you intend to direct market any portion of the crop, or if acceptable verifiable records are required and will not be available. It is your responsibility to assure you meet all the notification and completion requirements to be properly identified as in compliance with the provisions specified in this section.
(b) Notice and certification provisions:
(1) Provide us notice and complete a marketing certification by the acreage reporting date when any portion of the crop will be direct marketed, or if acceptable verifiable records are required and will not be available. If your marketing plans change after the acreage reporting date, then you must provide notice no later than 15 days prior to harvest of the crop. The notice may be made by telephone or in person. If a marketing certification is required, it must be completed in writing within 15 days of the initial notice.
(2) If you fail to notify us timely and complete the marketing certification in accordance with these provisions and if you do not have acceptable verifiable production records to support the information you certified on your production report, you will receive an assigned yield in accordance with section 3(g).
(3) We may determine that the marketing certification is not required for your crop based on FCIC procedures.
(4) Appraisals prior to harvest may be conducted for production reporting purposes to be used in conjunction with your acceptable production records.
(i) If we determine an appraisal is necessary, we must notify you.
(ii) If you request an appraisal, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to harvest.
(5) Appraisals conducted for production reporting purposes may not be applicable for establishing total production to count under section 15 when the appraisal was conducted prior to our receipt of a notice of loss.

Small grains crop insurance provisions.
The Small Grain Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2025 and succeeding crop years for crops with a contract change date on or after November 30, 2024, and for the 2026 and succeeding crop years with a contract change date prior to November 30, 2024, are as follows:

# United States Department of Agriculture

# Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

# Small Grain Crop Provisions
In return for your payment of premium and administrative fee for coverage, these Small Grains Crop Provisions and corresponding Commodity Exchange Price Provisions will be attached to and made part of the Common Crop Insurance Policy, Basic Provisions (Basic Provisions) subject to the terms and conditions in your policy.

# 1. Definitions
Adequate stand.
A population of live plants per unit of acreage which will produce at least the yield used to establish your production guarantee.
Harvest.
Combining or threshing the insured crop for grain or cutting for hay or silage on any acreage. A crop which is swathed prior to combining is not considered harvested.
Initially planted.
The first occurrence of planting the insured crop on insurable acreage for the crop year.
Khorasan.
The common name for a variety of wheat (
Triticum turanicum
) that is marketed under trademarks such as Kamut. Khorasan is considered spring wheat for the purposes of this policy.
Latest final planting date.
(1) The final planting date for the spring type in all counties for which the Special Provisions designate a spring type only;
(2) The final planting date for the winter type in all counties for which the Special Provisions designate a winter type only; or
(3) The final planting date for the spring type in all counties for which the Special Provisions designate both spring and winter types.
Local market price.
The cash grain price per bushel for the applicable quality level indicated below and offered by buyers in the area in which you normally market the insured crop. The local market price will reflect the maximum limits of quality deficiencies allowable for the applicable quality level indicated below. Factors not associated with the specified quality levels, including but not limited to protein, oil or moisture content, or milling quality will not be considered.
(1) U.S. No. 2 for Wheat (subclass hard amber durum for durum wheat and subclass northern spring for hard red spring wheat), except Khorasan; barley (including hull-less barley); oats (including hull-less oats); rye; and flax.
(2) The quality factor levels required for durum wheat to grade U.S. No. 2 for Khorasan.
(3) No. 2 grade buckwheat determined in accordance with the applicable state grading standards.
Nurse crop
(companion crop). A crop planted into the same acreage as another crop, that is intended to be harvested separately, and which is planted to improve growing conditions for the crop with which it is grown.
Planted acreage.
In addition to the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, except for flax, land on which seed is initially spread onto the soil surface by any method and subsequently is mechanically incorporated into the soil in a timely manner and at the proper depth will be considered planted. Flax seed must initially be planted in rows to be considered planted, unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.
Prevented planting.
As defined in the Basic Provisions, except that the references to “final planting date” contained in the definition in the Basic Provisions are replaced with the “latest final planting date.”
Small grains.
Wheat, including only common wheat (
Triticum aestivum
), club wheat (
T. compactum
), durum wheat (
T. durum
) and Khorasan (
T. turanicum
); barley (
Hordeum vulgare
), including hull-less barley and excluding black barley; oats (
Avena sativa,
and
A. byzantina
), and hull-less oats (
A. Nuda
); rye (
Secale cereale
); flax (
Linum usitatissimum
); and buckwheat (
Fagopyrum esculentum
) or as otherwise specified in the actuarial documents.
Swathed.
Severance of the stem and grain head from the ground without removal of the seed from the head and placing into a windrow.

# 2. Unit Division
(a) In addition to enterprise units provided in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions, for wheat only, you may elect separate enterprise units by type, as provided in this section, if allowed by the actuarial documents. If you elect enterprise units by type, you may not elect enterprise or optional units by any other practice or type.
(1) You may elect separate enterprise units by type unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. For example, if you have winter and spring types, you may elect one enterprise unit for the spring type or one enterprise unit for the winter type, or separate enterprise units for both types. Any acreage which is not reported and insured as an enterprise unit will be insured as basic or optional units, if requirements are met. For example, if you only have winter and spring types, you may have an enterprise unit for the winter type acreage and basic or optional units for the spring type acreage.
(2) You must separately meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions for each enterprise unit.
(3) If you elected separate enterprise units for multiple types and we discover enterprise unit qualifications are not separately met for all types in which you elected an enterprise unit and such discovery is made:
(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, you may elect to insure:
(A) All types in which you elected an enterprise unit for meeting the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions as separate enterprise units, and basic or optional units for any acreage that is not reported and insured as an enterprise unit, whichever you report on your acreage report and for which you qualify;
(B) One enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions; or
(C) Basic or optional units for all acreage of the crop in the county, whichever you report on your acreage report and for which you qualify; or
(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, your unit structure will be one enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions. Otherwise, we will assign the basic unit structure for all acreage of the crop in the county.
(4) If you elected an enterprise unit for only one type and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for that type and such discovery is made:
(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division for all acreage of the crop in the county will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and for which you qualify; or
(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure for all acreage of the crop in the county.
(b) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units as provided in section 34(c) of the Basic Provisions, for wheat only, separate optional units may be established for each wheat type (designated in actuarial documents and including any type insured by written agreement) if each optional unit contains only initially planted acreage of the type.

# 3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices
In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:
(a) Revenue protection is not available for your buckwheat. Therefore, if you elect to insure such crop by the sales closing date, it will only be protected against a loss in yield.
(b) Revenue protection is available for barley, flax, oats, rye, and wheat. Therefore, if you elect to insure your barley, flax, oats, rye, or wheat:
(1) You must elect to insure your barley, flax, oats, rye, or wheat with either revenue protection or yield protection by the sales closing date; and
(2) In counties with both winter and spring sales closing dates for the insured crop (excluding counties that have a spring sales closing date and a winter sales closing date only applicable to the Winter Coverage Endorsement):
(i) If you do not have any insurable winter-planted acreage of the insured crop, you may change your coverage level, or your percentage of projected price (if you have yield protection), or elect revenue protection or yield protection, until the spring sales closing date; or
(ii) If you have any insurable winter-planted acreage of the insured crop, you may not
change your coverage level, or your percentage of projected price (if you have yield protection), or elect revenue protection or yield protection, after the winter sales closing date. Winter-planted acreage of the insured crop must be reported and insured if it meets the requirements in section 6.

# 4. Contract Changes
In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date for counties with a March 15 cancellation date and June 30 preceding the cancellation date for all other counties.

# 6. Insured Crop
(a) The crop insured will be each small grain you elect to insure, that is grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which premium rates are provided by the actuarial documents:
(1) In which you have a share;
(2) That is planted for harvest as grain (a grain mixture in which barley or oats is the predominate grain may also be insured if allowed by the Barley or Oat Special Provisions, or if a written agreement allows insurance for such mixture. The production from such mixture will be considered as the predominate grain on a weight basis); and
(3) That is not, unless insurance is allowed by a written agreement:
(i) Interplanted with another crop except as allowed in section 6(a)(2);
(ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or
(iii) Planted as a nurse crop, unless planted as a nurse crop for new forage seeding, but only if seeded at a normal rate and intended for harvest as grain.
(b) Buckwheat will be insured only if it is produced under a contract with a business enterprise equipped with facilities appropriate to handle and store buckwheat production. The contract must be executed by you and the business enterprise, in effect for the crop year, and a copy provided to us no later than the acreage reporting date. To be considered a contract, the executed document must contain:
(1) A requirement that you plant, grow and deliver buckwheat to the business enterprise;
(2) The amount of production that will be accepted or a statement that all production from a specified number of acres will be accepted;
(3) The price to be paid for the contracted production or a method to determine such price; and
(4) Other such terms that establish the obligations of each party to the contract.
(c) If you anticipate destroying any acreage prior to harvest you:
(1) May report all planted acreage when you report your acreage for the crop year and specify any acreage to be destroyed as uninsurable acreage (By doing so, no coverage will be considered to have attached on the specified acreage and no premium will be due for such acreage. If you do not destroy such acreage, you will be subject to the under-reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions); or
(2) May report all planted acreage as insurable when you report your acreage for the crop year. Premium will be due on all the acreage except as described in these Crop
Provisions. If the Special Provisions allow a reduced premium amount for acreage intentionally destroyed prior to harvest, you may qualify for such reduction only if you notify us in writing on or before the date designated in the Special Provisions of the intended destruction, and do not claim an indemnity on the acreage. No premium reduction will be allowed if the required notice is not given or if you claim an indemnity for the acreage. Upon receiving timely notice, insurance coverage on the acreage you do not intend to harvest will cease and we will revise your acreage report to indicate the applicable reduction in premium. If you do not destroy the crop as intended, you will be subject to the under-reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions.
(d) In counties for which the actuarial documents provide premium rates for the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement (7 CFR 457.102), coverage is available for wheat or barley damaged between the time coverage begins and the spring final planting date. Coverage under the endorsement is effective only if you qualify under the terms of the endorsement and you execute the endorsement by the sales closing date.

# 7. Insurance Period
In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions, and subject to any provisions provided by the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement (if elected by you):
(a) Insurance attaches on each unit or part of a unit on the later of the date we accept your application or the date the insured crop is planted.
(1) For rye, flax, and buckwheat, the following limitations apply:
(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the insured crop except as allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 of the Basic Provisions.
(ii) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that producers in the surrounding area would not normally further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant.
(2) For barley, oat, and wheat, the following limitations apply:
(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the type (winter or spring) except as allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 of the Basic Provisions.
(ii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a winter type, any acreage of winter barley, oats, or wheat damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that producers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.
(iii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate both winter and spring types:
(A) Any winter barley, oat, or wheat acreage that is damaged before the spring final planting date, to the extent that producers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop to maintain insurance based on the winter type unless we agree that replanting is not practical. If it is not practical to replant to the winter type of barley, oats, or wheat, but is practical to replant to a spring type, you must replant to a spring type to keep your insurance based on the winter type in force.
(B) Any winter barley, oat, or wheat acreage that is replanted to a spring type of the same crop when it was practical to replant the winter type will be insured as the spring type and the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price applicable to the spring type will be used. In this case, the acreage will be considered to be initially planted to the spring type.
(C) Notwithstanding sections 7(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), if you have elected coverage under a barley or wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement (if available in the county), insurance will be in accordance with the endorsement.
(D) Any winter barley, oat, or wheat acreage planted after the end of the late planting period will not be insured unless you request such coverage on or before the spring sales closing date, and we inspect and determine that the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee. However, if we fail to inspect the acreage by the spring final planting date, insurance will attach as specified in section 7(a)(2)(iii)(D)(
3
).
(
1
) Your request for coverage must include the location and number of acres of winter barley, oats, or wheat.
(
2
) The winter barley, oats, or wheat will be insured as a spring type for the purpose of the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price, if applicable.
(
3
) Insurance will attach to such acreage on the date we determine an adequate stand exists or on the spring final planting date if we do not determine adequacy of the stand by the spring final planting date.
(iv) Whenever the Special Provisions designate a spring type, any spring barley, oat, or wheat acreage damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that producers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.
(v) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a spring type, any winter barley, oat, or wheat acreage will not be insured unless you request such coverage on or before the spring sales closing date, and we inspect
and give written confirmation that the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee. However, if we fail to inspect the acreage by the spring final planting date, insurance will attach as specified in section 7(a)(2)(v)(C).
(A) Your request for coverage must include the location and number of acres of winter barley, oats, or wheat.
(B) The winter barley, oats, or wheat will be insured as a spring type for the purpose of the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price, if applicable.
(C) Insurance will attach to such acreage on the date we determine an adequate stand exists or on the spring final planting date if we do not determine adequacy of the stand by the spring final planting date.
(D) Any such winter barley, oats, or wheat acreage that is damaged after it is accepted for insurance but before the spring final planting date, to the extent that producers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree it is not practical to replant.
(E) If winter-planted acreage is not to be insured it must be recorded on the acreage report as uninsured winter-planted acreage.
(b) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the following applicable date:
(1) September 25 in Alaska;
(2) July 31 in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee; or
(3) October 31 in all other states.

# 8. Causes of Loss
In addition to the provisions under section 12 of the Basic Provisions, any loss covered by this policy must occur within the insurance period. The specific causes of loss for small grains are:
(a) Adverse weather conditions;
(b) Fire;
(c) Insects, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
(d) Plant disease, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;
(e) Wildlife;
(f) Earthquake;
(g) Volcanic eruption;
(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply due to a cause of loss specified in sections 8(a) through (g) that also occurs during the insurance period; or
(i) For revenue protection, a change in the harvest price from the projected price, unless FCIC can prove the price change was the direct result of an uninsured cause of loss specified in section 12(a) of the Basic Provisions.

# 9. Replanting Payments
(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:
(1) In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these crop provisions;
(2) You must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions (except as allowed in section 9(a)(1)) and in any Winter Coverage Endorsement for which you are eligible and which you have elected;
(3) The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage;
(4) The acreage must have been initially planted to a spring type of the insured crop in those counties with only a spring type;
(5) Damage must occur after the winter final planting date in those counties where both a winter and spring final planting date are designated (If the Special Provisions provide more than one winter final planting date, the winter final planting date applicable to policies with the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement will be used for this purpose, regardless of whether or not the endorsement is actually in effect.); and
(6) The replanted crop must be seeded at a rate sufficient to achieve a total (undamaged and new seeding) plant population that is considered appropriate by agricultural experts for the insured crop, type and practice.
(b) No replanting payment will be made for acreage initially planted to a winter type of the insured crop (including rye) in any county for which the Special Provisions contain only a winter type.
(c) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount of the replanting payment per acre will be:
(1) The lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or the number of bushels for the applicable crop specified below:
(i) Two bushels for flax or buckwheat;
(ii) Four bushels for wheat; or
(iii) Five bushels for barley or oats;
(2) Multiplied by:
(i) Your price election for buckwheat; or
(ii) Your projected price for barley, flax, oats, or wheat; and
(3) Multiplied by your share.
(d) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.
(e) Replanting payments will be calculated using your price election or your projected price, as applicable, and your production guarantee for the type that is replanted and insured. For example, if damaged spring wheat is replanted to durum wheat, your projected price applicable to durum wheat will be used to calculate any replanting payment that may be due. A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, the following will have a replanting payment based on your production guarantee and your price election or your projected price, as applicable, for the type initially planted:
(1) Any damaged winter type that is replanted to a spring type, but that retains insurance based on the winter type; and
(2) Any acreage replanted at a reduced seeding rate into a partially damaged stand of the insured crop.

# 10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.

# 11. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:
(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or for any
(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:
(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres of each insured crop or type, as applicable by your respective:
(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection for barley, flax, oats, rye, or wheat;
(ii) Production guarantee (per acre) and your price election for buckwheat; or
(iii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection for barley, flax, oats, rye, or wheat;
(2) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii), whichever is applicable;
(3) Multiplying the production to count of each insured crop or type, as applicable, by your respective:
(i) Projected price for barley, flax, oats, rye, or wheat if you elected yield protection;
(ii) Price election for buckwheat; or
(iii) Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;
(4) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii), whichever is applicable;
(5) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(4) from the result of section 11(b)(2); and
(6) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(5) by your share.
For example:
You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of wheat in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 45 bushels, your projected price is $7.10, your harvest price is $10.90, and your production to count is 2,000 bushels.
If you elected yield protection:
(1) 50 acres × (45-bushel production guarantee × $7.10 projected price) = $15,975.00 value of the production guarantee;
(2) Not applicable;
(3) 2,000-bushel production to count × $7.10 projected price = $14,200.00 value of the production to count;
(4) Not applicable;
(5) $15,975.00−$14,200.00 = $1,775.00; and
(6) $1,775.00 × 1.000 share = $1,775.00 indemnity; or
If you elected revenue protection:
(1) 50 acres × (45-bushel production guarantee × $10.90 harvest price) = $24,525.00 revenue protection guarantee;
(2) Not applicable;
(3) 2,000-bushel production to count × $10.90 harvest price = $21,800.00 value of the production to count;
(4) Not applicable;
(5) $24,525.00−$21,800.00 = $2,725.00; and
(6) $2,725.00 × 1.000 share = $2,725.00 indemnity.
(c) The total production to count (in bushels) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) For buckwheat, and for barley, flax, oats, rye, or wheat under yield protection, not less than the production guarantee (per acre), and for barley, flax, oats, rye, or wheat under revenue protection, not less than the amount of production that when multiplied by the harvest price equals the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) for acreage:
(A) Which is abandoned;
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us;
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 11(d));
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to
another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
(d) Mature wheat, barley, oat, rye, and buckwheat production may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. Flax production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies only. If a moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.
(1) Production will be reduced by .12 percent for each .1 percentage point of moisture in excess of:
(i) 13.5 percent for wheat;
(ii) 14.5 percent for barley;
(iii) 14.0 percent for oats;
(iv) 16.0 percent for rye and buckwheat; or
(v) As otherwise provided in the Special Provisions.
We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.
(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain including the definition of terms used in section 11(d), result in:
(A) Wheat, except Khorasan, not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight; total damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); shrunken or broken kernels; defects (foreign material and heat damage will not be considered to be defects); a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut odor); or grading garlicky, light smutty, smutty, or ergoty;
(B) Barley, except hull-less barley, not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight; percentage of sound barley (heat-damaged kernels will be considered to be sound barley); damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); thin barley; black barley; a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading blighted, smutty, garlicky, or ergoty;
(C) Oats, except hull-less oats, not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grade U.S. sample grade) because of test weight; percentage of sound oats (heat-damaged kernels will be considered to be sound oats); a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading smutty, thin, garlicky, or ergoty;
(D) Rye not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 3 (grades U.S. No. 4 or worse) because of test weight; percent damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); thin rye; a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading light smutty, smutty, light garlicky, garlicky, or ergoty;
(E) Flax not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 2 (grades U.S. sample grade) due to test weight; damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); or a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor);
(ii) Deficiencies in the quality of buckwheat, determined in accordance with applicable state grading standards, result in it not meeting No. 3 grade requirements due to test weight; a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading garlicky, smutty, or ergoty if such grades are provided for by the applicable state grading standards;
(iii) Quality factors for Khorasan fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause durum wheat to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if durum wheat grades less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 54.0 pounds per bushel, Khorasan would be eligible for quality adjustment if its test weight falls below 54.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of durum wheat will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of Khorasan seed. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to Khorasan at the same levels applicable to durum wheat;
(iv) Quality factors for hull-less barley fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause barley to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if barley grades less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 40.0 pounds per bushel, hull-less barley would be eligible for quality adjustment if its test
weight falls below 40.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of barley will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less barley. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less barley at the same levels applicable to barley;
(v) Quality factors for hull-less oats fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause oats to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if oats grade less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 27.0 pounds per bushel, hull-less oats would be eligible for quality adjustment if the test weight falls below 27.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of oats will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less oats. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less oats at the same levels applicable to oats; or
(vi) Substances or conditions are present, including mycotoxins, that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions;
(ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;
(iii) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjustor), the samples are analyzed by:
(A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
(B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or
(C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and
(iv) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
(4) Small grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 11(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced by the quality adjustment factor calculated in accordance with the Special Provisions.
(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

# 12. Late Planting
A late planting period is applicable to small grains, except to any barley or wheat acreage covered under the terms of the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement. Barley or wheat covered under the terms of the Winter Coverage Endorsement must be planted on or prior to the applicable final planting date specified in the Special Provisions. In counties having one winter final planting date for acreage covered under the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement and another winter final planting date for acreage not covered under the endorsement, the winter late planting period will begin after the final planting date for acreage not covered under the endorsement.

# 13. Prevented Planting
Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents. In counties for which the Special Provisions designate a spring type, your prevented planting production guarantee will be based on your approved yield for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop.

§ 457.102
Wheat or barley winter coverage endorsement.

# United States Department of Agriculture

# Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

# Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement
(This is a continuous endorsement)
1. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part of the Small Grains Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions described herein.
2. This endorsement is available only in counties for which the Special Provisions for the insured crop designate both a fall final planting date and a spring final planting date, and for which the actuarial documents provide a premium rate for this coverage.
3. You must have a Small Grains Crop Insurance Policy in force and elect to insure barley or wheat under that policy.
4. You must select this coverage, by crop, on your application for insurance. Failure to do so means you have rejected this coverage for both wheat and barley and this endorsement is void.
5. In addition to the requirements of section 34(b) of the Basic Provisions and section 2 of the Small Grains Crop Provisions, optional units may be established for barley if each optional unit contains only initially planted winter barley or only initially planted spring barley.
6. If you elect this endorsement for winter barley, the contract change, cancellation, and termination dates applicable to wheat in the county will be applicable to all your spring and winter barley.
7. Coverage under this endorsement begins on the later of the date we accept your application for coverage or on the fall final planting date designated in the Special Provisions. Coverage ends on the spring final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.
8. The provisions of section 14 of the Basic Provisions are amended to require that all notices of damage be provided to us by the spring final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.
9. All eligible acreage of each crop covered under this endorsement must be insured.
10. The amount of any indemnity paid under the terms of this endorsement will be subject to any reduction specified in the Basic Provisions for multiple crop benefits in the same crop year.
11. Whenever any winter wheat or barley is damaged during the insurance period and at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the insured planted acreage in the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage, you may, at your option, take one of the following actions:
(a) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Basic Provisions, the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions and this endorsement.
(b) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of the insured crop, if it is practical, and receive a replanting payment in accordance with the terms of section 9 (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Basic Provisions, the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions and this endorsement, and the production guarantee for winter wheat or barley will remain in effect.
(c) Destroy the remaining crop on such acreage. By doing so, you agree to accept an appraised amount of production determined in accordance with section 11(c)(1) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions to count against the unit production guarantee. This amount will be considered production to count in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in section 11 (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions. You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop if such insurance is available. If you elect to plant and elect to insure a spring type of the same crop (you must elect whether or not you want insurance on the spring type of the same crop at the time we release the winter type acreage), you must pay additional premium for the insurance. Such acreage will be insured in accordance with the policy provisions that are applicable to acreage that is initially planted to a spring type of the insured crop, and you must:
(1) Plant the spring type in a manner which results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundary between it and any remaining acreage of the winter type; and
(2) Store or market the production in a manner which permits us to verify the amount of spring type production separately from any winter type production. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring type acreage will be considered to be a part of the original winter type unit.

# Option A (30 Percent Coverage and Acreage Release)
Whenever any winter wheat is damaged during the insurance period (see section 3, above), and at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the acreage in the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage, you may take any one of the following actions:
(a) Destroy the remaining crop on such acreage. By doing so, you agree to accept an amount of production to count against the unit production guarantee equal to 70 percent of the production guarantee for the damaged acreage, or an appraisal determined in accordance with paragraph 11.(c)(1) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101) if such an appraisal results in a greater amount of production. This amount will be considered production to count in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in the provisions under section 11. (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101). You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop. If you elect to utilize such acreage for the production of spring wheat, you must:
(1) Plant the spring wheat in a manner which results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundary between it and any remaining winter wheat; and
(2) Store or market the production from such acreage in a manner which permits us to verify the amount of spring wheat production separately from any winter wheat production.
In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring wheat acreage will be considered to be a part of the original winter wheat unit. If you elected to insure the spring wheat acreage as a separate optional unit, any premium amount for such acreage will be considered earned and payable to us.
(b) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (§ 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101), and this Option.
(c) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of wheat, if it is practical, and receive a replanting payment in accordance with the terms of section 9. (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions (§ 457.101). By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (§ 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101), and this Option, and the production guarantee for winter wheat will remain in effect.

# Option B (With Full Winter Damage Coverage)
Whenever any winter wheat is damaged during the insurance period and at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the acreage in the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage, you may, at your option, take one of the following actions:
(a) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (§ 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101), and this Option.
(b) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of wheat, if it is practical, and receive a replanting payment in accordance with the terms of section 9. (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions (§ 457.101). By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (§ 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101), and this Option, and the production guarantee for winter wheat will remain in effect.
(c) Accept our appraisal of the crop on the damaged acreage as production to count against the production guarantee for the damaged acreage, destroy the remaining crop on such acreage, and be eligible for any indemnity due under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (§ 457.8) and the Small Grains Crop Provisions (§ 457.101). The appraisal will be considered production to count in determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as described in the provisions of section 11. (Settlement of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (§ 457.101). You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any other crop. If you elect to utilize such acreage for the production of spring wheat, you must:
(1) Plant the spring wheat in a manner which results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundary between it and any remaining winter wheat; and
(2) Store or market the production from such acreage in a manner which permits us to verify the amount of spring wheat production separately from any winter wheat production.
In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring wheat acreage will be considered to be a part of the original winter wheat unit. If you elected to insure the spring wheat acreage as a separate optional unit, any premium amount for such acreage will be considered earned and payable to us.

In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss which occur within the insurance period:
(a) Adverse weather conditions;
(b) Fire;
(c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
(d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control meaures;
(e) Wildlife;
(f) Earthquake;
(g) Volcanic eruption;
(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply due to a cause of loss specified in sections 8(a) through (g) that also occurs during the insurance period; or
(i) For revenue protection, a change in the harvest price from the projected price, unless FCIC can prove the price change was the direct result of an uninsured cause of loss specified in section 12(a) of the Basic Provisions.

# 9. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
(a) In addition to your duties under section 14 of the Basic Provisions, in the event of damage or loss, at our option or if required by FCIC in the Special Provisions, you may be required to leave the cotton stalks intact for our inspection. If applicable, the stalks must not be destroyed, and required samples must not be harvested, until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed and written notice of probable loss given to us.
(b) Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.

# 10. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:
(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:
(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres by your respective:
(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection; or
(ii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection;
(2) Totaling the results of section 10(b)(1)(i) or 10(b)(1)(ii), whichever is applicable;
(3) Multiplying the production to count by your:
(i) Projected price if you elected yield protection; or
(ii) Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;
(4) Totaling the results of section 10(b)(3)(i) or 10(b)(3)(ii), whichever is applicable;
(5) Subtracting the result of section 10(b)(4) from the result of section 10(b)(2); and
(6) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(5) by your share.
For example:
You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of cotton in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 525 pounds, your projected price is $.65, your harvest price is $.70, and your production to count is 25,000 pounds.
If you elected yield protection:
(1) 50 acres × (525 pound production guarantee × $.65 projected price) = $17,062.50 value of the production guarantee
(3) 25,000 pound production to count × $.65 projected price = $16,250.00 value of production to count
(5) $17,062.50−$16,250.00 = $812.50
(6) $812.50 × 1.000 share = $813.00 indemnity; or
If you elected revenue protection:
(1) 50 acres × (525 pound production guarantee × $.70 harvest price) = $18,375.00 revenue protection guarantee
(3) 25,000 pound production to count × $.70 harvest price = $17,500.00 value of the production to count
(5) $18,375.00−$17,500.00 = $875.00
(6) $875.00 × 1.000 share = $875.00 indemnity.
(c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) For yield protection, not less than the production guarantee and for revenue protection, not less than the amount of production that when multiplied by the harvest price equals the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;
(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us; or
(E) If applicable, on which the cotton stalks are destroyed, in violation of section 9.
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production of white cotton may be adjusted for quality deficiencies in accordance with subsection 10(d)); and
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including any mature cotton retrieved from the ground.
(d) Mature white cotton may be adjusted for quality when production has been damaged by insured causes. Such production to count will be reduced if the price quotation for cotton of like quality (price quotation “A”) for the applicable growth area is less than 85 percent of price quotation “B.”
(1) Price B is defined as the Upland Cotton National Average Loan Rate determined by FSA, or as specified in the Special Provisions.
(2) Price A is defined as the loan value per pound for the bale determined in accordance with the FSA Schedule of Premiums and Discounts for the applicable crop year, or as specified in the Special Provisions.
(3) If eligible for adjustment, the amount of production to count will be determined by multiplying the number of pounds of such production by the factor derived from dividing price quotation “A” by 85 percent of price quotation “B.”
(e) Colored cotton lint will not be eligible for quality adjustment.

# 11. Prevented Planting
(a) In addition to the provisions contained in section 17 of the Basic Provisions, your prevented planting production guarantee will be based on your approved yield without adjustment for skip-row planting patterns.
(b) Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.

(b) Sections 34(b) (1), (3), and (4) of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.
(c) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.
(d) Instead of establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number optional units may be established if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land.

# 3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities
(a) In lieu of the requirement of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), that prohibits you from selecting more than one coverage level for each insured crop, you may select a different coverage level for each crop designated in the Special Provisions that you elect to insure.
(b) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):
(1) If you insure trees within a crop which are either of a different variety or are planted at a different population density, the per acre amount of insurance for each variety or population density for the crop must bear the same relationship to the maximum amount of insurance available for each variety and population density of the crop as specified in the Actuarial documents. For example, if you elect 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for a variety within a population density for the crop, you must select 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for that variety for all population densities for the crop. The amount of insurance for each variety and population density must be multiplied by any applicable factor contained in section 3(b)(2).
(2) The amount of insurance per acre will be the product obtained by multiplying the
reference maximum dollar amount of insurance that is shown in the actuarial documents for the applicable population density by the percentage for the level of coverage you select and by:
(i) Thirty-three percent (0.33) for the year of set out, the year following dehorning, or the year following grafting of a set out tree. (Insurance will be limited to this amount until trees that are set out are one year of age or older on the first day of the crop year);
(ii) Sixty percent (0.60) for the first growing season after being set out, the second year following dehorning, or the second year following grafting of a set out tree;
(iii) Eighty percent (0.80) for the second growing season after being set out, the third year following dehorning, or the third year following grafting of a set out tree; or
(iv) Ninety percent (0.90) for the third growing season after being set out, the fourth year following dehorning, or the fourth year following grafting of a set out tree.
(3) The amount of insurance per acre for each population density, or factor as appropriate, will be multiplied by the applicable number of insured acres. These results will then be added together to determine the amount of insurance for the unit.
(4) The amount of insurance will be reduced proportionately for any unit on which the stand is less than 90 percent, based on the original planting pattern. For example, if the amount of insurance you selected is $2,000 and the remaining stand is 85 percent of the original stand, the amount of insurance on which the premium and any indemnity will be based is $1,700 ($2,000 multiplied by 0.85).
(5) If any insurable acreage of trees is set out after the first day of the crop year, and you elect to insure such acreage during that crop year, you must report the acreage, practice, crop, number of trees, date set out is completed, and your share to us within 72 hours after set out is completed for the unit.
(6) Production reporting requirements contained in section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), are not applicable.
(7) You must report, by the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions, by type if applicable:
(i) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the amount of insurance, and the number of affected acres;
(ii) The number of trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;
(iii) The date of original set out and the planting pattern;
(iv) The date of replacement or dehorning, if more than 10 percent of the trees on any unit have been replaced or dehorned in the previous 5 years; and
(v) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:
(A) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;
(B) The planting pattern; and
(C) Any other information that we request in order to establish your amount of insurance.
We will reduce the amount of insurance as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of interplanting a perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in practices and any other circumstance on the potential of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce the potential for the insured crop, we will reduce your amount of insurance as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.

# 4. Contract Changes
In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date.

# 5. Cancellation and Termination Dates
In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and Termination) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the cancellation and termination dates are November 20.

# 6. Annual Premium
In addition to the provisions of section 7 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), for the 1998 crop year, the premium amount otherwise payable for the 1998 crop year will be increased by 46 percent as a result of the additional six months of coverage for that crop year.

# 7. Insured Crop
(a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the crop insured will be all of each citrus tree crop designated in the Special Provisions in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents and that you elect to insure:
(1) In which you have an ownership share;
(2) That is adapted to the area;
(3) That is set out for the purpose of growing fruit to be harvested for the commercial production of fresh fruit or for juice;
(4) That is irrigated; and
(5) That have the potential to produce at least 70 percent of the county average yield for the crop and age, unless a written agreement is approved to insure the trees with lesser potential.
(b) In addition to section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we do not insure any citrus trees:
(1) During the crop year the application for insurance is filed, unless we inspect the acreage and consider it acceptable; or
(2) That have been grafted onto existing root stock or nursery stock within the one-year period prior to the date insurance attaches.
(c) We may exclude from insurance or limit the amount of insurance on any acreage that was not insured the previous year.

# 8. Insurable Acreage
In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, citrus trees interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable, unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

# 9. Insurance Period
In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):
(a) The insurance period is as follows:
(1) For the 1998 crop year only, coverage will begin on June 1, 1997, and will end on November 20, 1998.
(2) For all subsequent crop years, coverage begins on November 21 of the calendar year prior to the year the insured crop normally blooms, except that for the year of application, if your application is received after November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine that it does not meet the requirements for insurability contained in your policy. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the grove.
(3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is November 20.
(b) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
(c) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of citrus trees on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to and no premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:
(1) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
(2) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
(3) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

# 10. Causes of Loss
In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
(a) Excess precipitation;
(b) Excess wind;
(c) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;
(d) Freeze;
(e) Hail;
(f) Tornado; or
(g) Failure of the irrigation water supply if caused by an insured peril or drought that occurs during the insurance period.

# 11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), in case of damage or probable loss, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must allow us to inspect all insured acreage before pruning, dehorning, or removal of any damaged trees.

# 12. Settlement of Claim
(a) In the event of damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on a unit basis by:
(1) Determining the actual percent of damage for the unit in accordance with sections 12 (b), (c), and (d);
(2) Subtracting your deductible from the percent of damage for the unit (this result must be greater than zero to receive an indemnity);
(3) Dividing the result of section 12(a)(2) by your coverage level percentage;
(4) Multiplying the result of section 12(a)(3) by the amount of insurance per acre determined in accordance with section 3(b)(2);
(5) Multiplying the result of section 12(a)(4) by the number of insured acres; and
(6) Multiplying the result of section 12(a)(5) by your share.
(b) The percent of damage for any tree will be determined as follows:
(1) For damage occurring during the year of set out (trees that have not been set out for at least one year at the time insurance attaches):
(i) One-hundred percent (100%) whenever there is no live wood above the bud union;
(ii) Ninety percent (90%) whenever there is less than 12 inches of live wood above the bud union; or
(iii) The tree will be considered undamaged whenever there is more than 12 inches of live wood above the bud union; or
(2) For damage occurring in any year following the year of set out:
(i) The percentage of damage will be determined by dividing the number of scaffold limbs damaged in an area from the trunk to a length equal to one-fourth (
1/4
) the height of the tree, by the total number of scaffold limbs before damage occurred. Whenever this percentage exceeds 80 percent, the tree will be considered as 100 percent damaged.
(ii) The percent of damage for the unit will be determined by computing the average of the determinations made for the individual trees. If this percent of damage exceeds 80 percent, the unit will be considered 100 percent damaged.
(c) The percent of damage on the unit will be reduced by the percentage of damage due to uninsured causes.

(c) You must report, by the acreage reporting date designated in the actuarial documents:
(1) Any event or action that could reduce the yield per acre of the insured citrus fruit commodity (including but not limited to removal of trees, any damage, disease, change in cultural practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the productive capacity of the trees) and the number of affected acres;
(2) The number of trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage, including interplanted trees;
(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
(4) Any other information we request in order to establish your amount of insurance.
(d) We will reduce insurable acreage or the amount of insurance or both, as necessary:
(1) Based on our estimate of the effect of the interplanted trees on the insured commodity type;
(2) Following a decrease in plant stand;
(3) If cultural practices are performed that may reduce the productive capacity of the trees;

(5) Any other circumstance that may reduce the productive capacity of the trees or that may reduce the yield per acre from previous levels.
(e) If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce the acreage, the productive capacity of the trees, or the yield per acre from previous levels, we will reduce the acreage or amount of insurance or both as necessary any time we become aware of the circumstance.
(f) For carryover policies:
(1) Any changes to your coverage must be requested on or before the sales closing date;
(2) Requested changes will take effect on May 1, the first day of the crop year, unless we reject the requested increase based on our inspection, or because a loss occurs on or before April 30 (Rejection can occur at any time we discover loss has occurred on or before April 30); and
(3) If the increase is rejected, coverage will remain at the same level as the previous crop year.

# 4. Contract Changes
In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is January 31 preceding the cancellation date.

# 5. Cancellation and Termination Dates
In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are April 30.

# 6. Insured Crop
(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the insured crop will be all acreage of each citrus fruit group that you elect to insure, in which you have a share, that is grown in the county shown on the application, and for which a premium rate is quoted in the actuarial documents.
(b) In addition to the citrus fruit not insurable in section 8 of the Basic Provisions, we do not insure any citrus fruit:
(1) That cannot be expected to mature each crop year within the normal maturity period for the commodity type;
(2) Produced by citrus trees that have not reached the fifth growing season after being set out, unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions or by a written agreement to insure such citrus fruit (In order for the year of set out to be considered as a growing season, citrus trees must be set out on or before April 15 of the calendar year);
(3) Of “Meyer Lemons,” “Sour Oranges,” or “Clementines”;
(4) Of the Robinson tangerine variety, for any crop year in which you have elected to exclude such tangerines from insurance (You must elect this exclusion prior to the crop year for which the exclusion is to be effective, except that for the first crop year you must elect this exclusion by the later of the sales closing date or the time you submit the application for insurance);
(5) That is produced on citrus trees that have been topworked until the third crop year after topworking. The Special Provisions will specify the appropriate rate class for trees insurable following topworking, but that have not reached full production; or
(6) Of any commodity type not specified as insurable in the Special Provisions.
(c) Prior to the date insurance attaches, and upon our approval, you may elect to insure or exclude from insurance any insurable citrus acreage that has a potential production of less than 100 boxes per acre. If you elect to:
(1) Insure such acreage, we will consider the potential production to be 100 boxes per acre when determining the amount of loss; or
(2) Exclude such acreage, we will disregard the acreage for all purposes related to this policy.
(d) In addition to the provisions in section 6 of the Basic Provisions, if you fail to notify us of your election to insure or exclude citrus acreage, and the potential production from such acreage is 100 or more boxes per acre, we will determine the percent of damage on all of the insurable acreage for the unit, but will not allow the percent of damage for the unit to be increased by including such acreage.
(e) Potential production will be determined during loss adjustment.
(f) For citrus fruit for which fresh fruit coverage is available as designated in the actuarial documents:
(1) Management records must be available upon request to verify good fresh citrus fruit production practices were followed from the beginning of bloom stage until harvest; and
(2) Unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions:
(i) Acceptable fresh fruit sales records must be provided upon request from at least one of the previous three crop years; or
(ii) For fresh fruit acreage new to the operation or for acreage in the initial year of fresh fruit production, a current year fresh fruit marketing contract must be provided to us upon request.

# 7. Insurable Acreage
(a) In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance attaching to interplanted acreage:
(1) Citrus fruit from trees interplanted with another commodity type or another agricultural commodity is insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.
(2) If the citrus fruit is from trees interplanted with another commodity type or another agricultural commodity, acreage will be prorated according to the percentage of the acres occupied by each of the interplanted commodity types or agricultural commodities. For example, if grapefruit have been interplanted with oranges on 100 acres and the grapefruit trees are on 50 percent of the acreage, grapefruit will be considered planted on 50 acres and oranges will be considered planted on 50 acres.
(3) The combination of the citrus fruit acreage and the interplanted acreage cannot exceed the physical amount of acreage.
(b) In addition to section 9 of the Basic Provisions, any acreage of citrus fruit that has been abandoned is not insurable.

# 8. Insurance Period
(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:
(1) Coverage begins on May 1 of each crop year, unless:
(i) For new or carryover policies, as applicable, we inspect the acreage and determine it does not meet the requirements for insurability contained in your policy (You must provide any information we require, so we may determine the condition of the acreage to be insured); or
(ii) For carryover policies, you report additional citrus acreage, or a greater share, such that the amount of insurance will increase by more than 10 percent and we notify you all or a part of your citrus acreage is not insurable.
(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year, unless specified otherwise in the Special Provisions, is:
(i) February 7 for navel oranges, Orlando tangelos and tangerines;
(ii) February 28 for early-season oranges and all other tangelos;
(iii) March 31 for mid-season oranges and temples;
(iv) April 30 for lemons and limes;
(v) May 15 for murcotts; and
(vi) June 30 for grapefruit and late-season oranges.
(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:
(1) Acreage acquired after the acreage reporting date for the crop year is not insurable unless a transfer of coverage and right to indemnity is executed in accordance with section 28 of the Basic Provisions.
(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of citrus fruit on or before the acreage reporting date of the crop year, insurance will not attach, no premium will be due, and no indemnity payable, for such acreage for that crop year.

# 9. Causes of Loss
(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss to citrus fruit that occur within the insurance period:
(1) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;
(2) Freeze;
(3) Hail;
(4) Hurricane;
(5) Tornado;
(6) Excess wind; or
(7) Diseases, but only if specified in the Special Provisions.
(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:
(1) Damage to the blossoms or trees; or
(2) Inability to market the citrus fruit for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.

# 10. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or
(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.
(b) If any citrus fruit within a unit is damaged by an insurable cause of loss, we will settle your claim by:
(1) Calculating the amount of insurance for the unit by multiplying the number of acres by the respective dollar amount of insurance per acre for each applicable combination of commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees in the unit and multiplying that result by your share;
(2) Calculating the average percent of damage to the fruit within each respective combination of commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent (0.1%) (To determine the percent of damage, the amount of citrus fruit damaged from an insured cause must be converted to boxes and divided by the potential production);
(3) Subtracting the deductible from the result of section 10(b)(2);
(4) If the result of section 10(b)(3) is positive, dividing this result by the coverage level percentage (If the result of section 10(b)(3) is negative, no indemnity will be due);
(5) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(4) by the amount of insurance for the unit for the respective combination of commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees, to determine the value of all damage; and
(6) Totaling all such results of section 10(b)(5) for all applicable combinations of commodity types, intended uses, and age classes of trees in the unit and subtracting any indemnities paid for the current crop year to determine the amount payable for the unit. For example, assume a 55-acre unit sustains late season damage. No previous damage has occurred on the unit during the crop year and no fruit has been harvested. The producer elected the 75 percent coverage level and has a 100 percent share. The amount of insurance is $1,180 per acre, based on the 75 percent coverage level, for the commodity type, intended use, and age class of trees. The amount of potential production is 24,530 boxes and the amount of damaged production is 17,171 boxes. The loss would be calculated as follows:
1. 55 acres × $1,180 = $64,900 amount of insurance for the unit;
2. 17,171 ÷ 24,530 = 70 percent average percent of damage;
3. 70 percent damage −25 percent deductible (100 percent −75 percent) = 45 percent;
4. 45 percent ÷ 75 percent = 60 percent adjusted damage; and
5. 60 percent × $64,900 = $38,940 indemnity.
(c) Any individual citrus fruit will be considered 100 percent damaged, if due to an insurable cause of loss it is:
(1) On the ground and unmarketable; or
(2) Unmarketable because it is immature, unwholesome, decomposed, adulterated, or otherwise unfit for human consumption.
(d) Any citrus fruit that can be processed into products for human consumption will be considered marketable. The percent of damage for the marketable citrus fruit (excluding citrus fruit sold as fresh or damaged due to uninsured causes) will be determined by:
(1) Subtracting the juice content of the marketable citrus fruit (excluding citrus
fruit sold as fresh or damaged due to uninsured causes) from:
(i) The average juice content of the fruit produced on the unit for the three previous crop years based on your records, if they are acceptable to us; or
(ii) The default juice content provided in the Special Provisions, if at least three years of acceptable juice records are not furnished or the citrus fruit is insured as fresh;
(2) Subtracting the juice content of the marketable citrus fruit (excluding citrus fruit sold as fresh or damaged due to uninsured causes) from the official weight per box for the applicable commodity type provided in the Special Provisions;
(3) Dividing the result of section 10(d)(1) by the result of 10(d)(2);
(4) Dividing the official weight per box for the applicable commodity type provided in the Special Provisions by:
(i) The average juice content of the fruit produced on the unit for the three previous crop years based on your records, if they are acceptable to us; or
(ii) The default juice content provided in the Special Provisions, if at least three years of acceptable juice records are not furnished or the citrus fruit is insured as fresh; and
(5) Multiplying the result of section 10(d)(3) by the result of 10(d)(4); and
(6) For citrus fruit insured as fresh that has a Fresh Fruit Factor listed in the Special Provisions, making an additional adjustment to the percent of damage by:
(i) Subtracting the result of section 10(d)(5) from 1;
(ii) Multiplying the result of section 10(d)(6)(i) by the applicable Fresh Fruit Factor located in the Special Provisions; and
(iii) Adding the result of section 10(d)(6)(ii) to the result of section 10(d)(5).
(e) Notwithstanding section 10(d), for citrus fruit insured as fresh, unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions, any individual citrus fruit not meeting the applicable United States Standards for packing as fresh fruit due to an insured cause of loss will be considered 100 percent damaged, except that the percent of damage for any production sold for an alternative use will be adjusted in accordance with section 10(d).

# 11. Late and Prevented Planting
The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.
[73 FR 7196, Feb. 7, 2008; 73 FR 10973, Feb. 29, 2008, as amended at 77 FR 75519, Dec. 21, 2012; 78 FR 4305, Jan. 22, 2013; 78 FR 22411, Apr. 16, 2013]

The local market price for oil type sunflower seed will reflect the maximum limits of quality deficiencies allowable for the U.S. No. 2 grade of sunflower seed. Factors not associated with grading of sunflower seed under the Official United States Standards for Grain including, but not limited to, oil or moisture content will not be considered.
Planted acreage.
In addition to the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, sunflower seed must initially be planted in rows far enough apart to permit mechanical cultivation, unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.

# 2. Unit Division
(a) In addition to enterprise units provided in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions, you may elect separate enterprise units for confectionery or oil types if these types are allowed by the actuarial documents. If you elect enterprise units for these types, you may not elect enterprise or optional units by any other practice or type.
(1) You may elect one enterprise unit for the confectionery type or one enterprise unit for the oil type, or separate enterprise units for both types, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. For example, you may choose one enterprise unit for the confectionery type acreage and basic or optional units for the oil type acreage.
(2) You must separately meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions for each enterprise unit.
(3) If you elected separate enterprise units for both types and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for one or the other type and such discovery is made:
(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, you may elect to insure:
(A) One enterprise unit for the confectionery type or oil type provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions, and basic or optional units for the other type, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for;
(B) One enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions; or
(C) Basic or optional units for all acreage of the crop in the county, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, your unit structure will be one enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions. Otherwise, we will assign the basic unit structure.
(4) If you elected an enterprise unit for one type and a different unit structure on the other type and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for the type and such discovery is made:
(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure.
(b) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units as provided in section 34(c) in the Basic Provisions, a separate optional unit may be established for each sunflower type (designated in the actuarial documents and including any type insured by written agreement).

(a) In which you have a share;
(b) That is planted for harvest as sunflower seed; and
(c) That is not (unless a written agreement allows otherwise):
(1) Interplanted with another crop; or
(2) Planted into an established grass or legume.

# 7. Insurable Acreage
In addition to section 9 of the Basic Provisions:
(a) We will not insure any acreage which does not meet the rotation requirements shown in the Special Provisions; and
(b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that a majority of producers in the area would not normally further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant.

# 8. Insurance Period

# In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is November 30, immediately following planting, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.

# 9. Causes of Loss
In accordance with section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss which occur within the insurance period:
(a) Adverse weather conditions;
(b) Fire;
(c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
(d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;

(i) For revenue protection, a change in the harvest price from the projected price, unless FCIC can prove the price change was the
direct result of an uninsured cause of loss specified in section 12(a) of the Basic Provisions.

# 10. Replanting Payments
(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:
(1) In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these Crop Provisions;
(2) Except as specified in section 10(a)(1), you must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions; and
(3) The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage.
(b) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or 175 pounds, multiplied by your projected price, multiplied by your share.
(c) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.
(d) If the acreage is replanted to an insured crop type that is different than the insured crop type originally planted on the acreage:
(1) The production guarantee, premium, and projected price and harvest price, as applicable, will be adjusted based on the replanted type;
(2) Replanting payments will be calculated using your projected price and production guarantee for the crop type that is replanted and insured; and
(3) A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type, as applicable.

# 11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.

# 12. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:
(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:
(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres by your respective:
(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection; or
(ii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection;
(2) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(1)(i) or 12(b)(1)(ii), whichever is applicable;
(3) Multiplying the production to count by your:
(i) Projected price if you elected yield protection; or
(ii) Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;
(4) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(3)(i) or 12(b)(3)(ii), whichever is applicable;
(5) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(4) from the result of section 12(b)(2); and
(6) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(5) by your share.

# Example for Section 12(b)
You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of sunflowers in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 1,550 pounds, your projected price is $.28, your harvest price is $.29, and your production to count is 65,000 pounds.
If you elected yield protection:
(1) 50 acres × (1,550 pound production guarantee × $.28 projected price) = $21,700.00 value of the production guarantee;
(2) Not applicable;
(3) 65,000 pound production to count × $.28 projected price = $18,200.00 value of production to count;
(4) Not applicable;
(5) $21,700.00−$18,200.00 = $3,500.00;
(6) $3,500.00 × 1.000 share = $3,500.00 indemnity; or
If you elected revenue protection:
(1) 50 acres × (1,550 pound production guarantee × $.29 harvest price) = $22,475.00 revenue protection guarantee;
(2) Not applicable;
(3) 65,000 pound production to count × $.29 harvest price = $18,850.00 value of the production to count;
(4) Not applicable;
(5) $22,475.00−$18,850.00 = $3,625.00;
(6) $3,625.00 × 1.000 share = $3,625.00 indemnity.
End of Example.
(c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) For yield protection, not less than the production guarantee, and for revenue protection, not less than the amount of production that when multiplied by the harvest price equals the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us;
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 12(d)); and
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count.); or
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
(d) Mature sunflower seed production may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.
(1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of ten percent (10%). We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.
(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
(i) Deficiencies in quality result in:
(A) Oil type sunflower seed not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 2 (grades U.S. sample grade) because of test weight, kernel damage (excluding heat damage), or a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor; or
(B) Non-oil type sunflower seed having a test weight below 22 pounds per bushel or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) in excess of five percent (5%) or a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor; or
(ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions and within the insurance period;
(ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;
(iii) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjustor), the samples are analyzed by:
(A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
(B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or
(C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and
(iv) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
(4) Sunflower seed production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 12(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced in accordance with quality adjustment factor provisions contained in the Special Provisions.
(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

# 13. Prevented Planting
Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented
planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.

§ 457.109
Sugar Beet Crop Insurance Provisions.
The Sugar Beet Crop Insurance Provisions effective for the 2024 and succeeding crop years in states with a November 30 contract change date and for the 2025 and succeeding crop years in all other states, are as follows:
FCIC Policies

# United States Department of Agriculture

# Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

# Reinsured policies

# (Appropriate title for insurance provider)
Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

# Sugar Beet Crop Provisions

# 1. Definitions
Crop year.
The period within which the sugar beets are normally grown, which is designated by the calendar year in which the sugar beets are normally harvested.
Early harvest.
Harvest of sugar beets prior to full maturity.
Full maturity (date of).
The date the sugar beets would have reached full maturity is 45 days prior to the calendar date for the end of the insurance period, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.
Harvest.
Topping and lifting of sugar beets in the field.
Percentage of raw sugar.
Quantity of sugar determined from analytical tests of samples performed by the processor or other laboratories approved by us.
Planted acreage.
In addition to the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, sugar beets must initially be planted in rows, unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.
Pound.
Sixteen (16) ounces avoirdupois.
Practical to replant.
In addition to the definition in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, it will not be considered practical to replant if production from the replanted acreage cannot be delivered under the terms of the production agreement, or 30 days after the initial planting date for all counties where a late planting period is not applicable, unless replanting is generally occurring in the area.
Processor.
Any business enterprise regularly engaged in processing sugar beets for sugar that possesses all licenses and permits for processing sugar beets required by the State in which it operates, and that possesses facilities, or has contractual access to such facilities, with enough equipment to accept and process the contracted sugar beets within a reasonable amount of time after harvest.
Production agreement.
A written contract between you and the processor, executed on or before the acreage reporting date, which is in effect for the crop year, containing at a minimum:
(1) Your commitment to plant, grow, and deliver the sugar beet production to the processor; and
(2) The processor's commitment to purchase the production stated in the contract.
Production guarantee (per acre):
(1) First stage production guarantee—The final stage production guarantee multiplied by 60 percent.
(2) Final stage production guarantee—The number of pounds of raw sugar determined by multiplying the approved yield per acre by the coverage level percentage you elect.
Raw sugar.
Sugar that has not been extracted from the sugar beet.
Ton.
Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.

# 2. Unit Division
In addition to the requirements of section 34 of the Basic Provisions, basic units may be divided into optional units only if you have a production agreement that requires the processor to accept all production from a number of acres specified in the production agreement. Acreage insured to fulfill a production agreement which provides that the processor will accept a designated amount of production or a combination of acreage and production will not be eligible for optional units.

# 3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices
(a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions, you may select only one price election for all the sugar beets in the county insured under this policy.
(b) The production guarantees are progressive by stages and increase at specified intervals to the final stage. The stages are:
(1) First stage, with a guarantee of 60 percent (60%) of the final stage production guarantee, extends from planting until:
(i) The earlier of thinning or 90 days after planting in California; and
(ii) July 1 in all other States.
(2) Final stage, with a guarantee of 100 percent (100%) of the final stage production guarantee, applies to all insured sugar beets that complete the first stage.
(c) The production guarantee will be expressed in pounds of raw sugar.
(d) Any acreage of sugar beets damaged in the first stage to the extent that growers in the area would not normally further care for the sugar beets will be deemed to have been destroyed, even though you may continue to care for it. The production guarantee for such acreage will not exceed the first stage production guarantee.

# 4. Contract Changes
In accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is April 30 preceding the cancellation date for California and November 30 preceding the cancellation date for all other states.

# 5. Cancellation and Termination Dates
In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are August 31 for California and March 15 for all other states.

# 6. Report of Acreage
In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, you must provide a copy of all production agreements to us on or before the acreage reporting date.

# 7. Annual Premium
In lieu of the premium computation method contained in section 7 of the Basic Provisions, the annual premium amount is computed by multiplying the final stage production guarantee by the price election, the premium rate, the insured acreage, your share at the time of planting, and any applicable premium adjustment factors contained in the actuarial documents.

# 8. Insured Crop
(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the crop insured will be all the sugar beets in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
(1) In which you have a share;
(2) That are planted for harvest as sugar beets;
(3) That are grown under a production agreement and are not excluded from the production agreement at any time during the crop year; and
(4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement):
(i) Interplanted with another crop;
(ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or
(iii) Planted prior to submitting a properly completed application.
(b) Sugar beet growers who are also processors may establish an insurable interest if they meet the following requirements:
(1) The processor must meet the definition of a “processor” in section 1 of these Crop Provisions and have a valid insurable interest in the sugar beet crop;
(2) The Board of Directors or officers of the processor must have adopted and executed a corporate resolution that contains essentially the same terms as a production agreement. Such corporate resolution will be considered a production agreement under the terms of the sugar beet crop insurance policy;
(3) The sales records of the processor showing the amount of sugar produced the previous year must be supplied to us to confirm the processor has produced and sold sugar in the past; and
(4) Our inspection of the processing facilities determines that they conform to the definition of “processor” contained in section 1 of these Crop Provisions.

# 9. Insurable Acreage
In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):
(a) We will not insure any acreage planted to sugar beets:
(1) The preceding crop year, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions for the county;
(2) In any crop year following the discovery of rhizomania on the acreage, unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement; or
(3) That does not meet the rotation requirements shown in the Special Provisions;
(b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that replanting is not practical.

# 10. Insurance Period
In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions, the dates for the end of insurance period are contained in the Special Provisions.

# 11. Causes of Loss
In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
(a) Adverse weather conditions;
(b) Fire;
(c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
(d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;
(e) Wildlife;
(f) Earthquake;
(g) Volcanic eruption; or
(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period.

# 12. Replanting Payments
(a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if the crop is damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent (90%) of the final stage production guarantee for the acreage and it is practical to replant.
(b) The dollar amount of the replant payment is specified in the Special Provisions.
(c) When sugar beets are replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, our liability on the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.

# 13. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.

# 14. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable production records were not provided; or
(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;
(2) Subtracting the total production to count from the result in paragraph (b)(1);
(3) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(2) by your price election; and
(4) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(3) by your share.
(c) The total production to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records that are acceptable to us;
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production;
(iv) Only appraised production in excess of the difference between the first and final stage production guarantee for acreage that does not qualify for the final stage guarantee will be counted, except that all production from acreage subject to paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section will be counted; and
(v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
(d) Harvested production or unharvested production that is appraised after the earliest delivery date that the processor accepts harvested production and that meets the minimum acceptable standards contained in the production agreement or corporate resolution will be converted to pounds of raw sugar by multiplying the tons of such production by 2,000 and by the average percentage of raw sugar to determine the production to count. The average percentage of raw sugar will be determined from tests performed by the processor or other laboratories approved by us at the time of delivery or sample acquisition (appraisal).
(1) If individual tests of raw sugar content are not made at the time of delivery, the average percent of raw sugar may be based on the results of your previous tests performed
by the processor or other laboratories approved by us during the crop year if it is determined that such results are representative of the total production.
(2) If not representative, the average percent of raw sugar will equal the raw sugar content percent shown in the Special Provisions.
(e) Harvested production or unharvested production that is appraised after the earliest delivery date that the processor accepts harvested production and that does not meet the minimum acceptable standards contained in the production agreement or corporate resolution due to an insured peril will be converted to pounds of raw sugar by multiplying the tons of such damaged production by 2,000 and by the average percent of raw sugar contained in such production. The average percentage of raw sugar will be determined from tests performed by the processor or other laboratories approved by us at the time of crop delivery or sample acquisition (appraisal).
(1) If individual tests of raw sugar content are not made at the time of delivery, the average percent of raw sugar may be based on the results of your previous tests performed by the processor or other laboratories approved by us during the crop year if it is determined that such results are representative of the total production.
(2) If not representative, the average percent of raw sugar will equal the raw sugar content percent shown in the Special Provisions.
(f) If harvested production is damaged due to an insurable cause of loss and is rejected by the processor but is sold to a salvage buyer at a reduced price: Compute the pounds of raw sugar of the sold production by dividing the gross dollar amount paid by the salvage buyer by the established price.
(g) If production is damaged due to an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the processor will not accept the production, such as the production did not meet the standards contained in the production agreement; and there are no salvage markets for the production, then there would be no value for production and there would be no production to count provided the production is destroyed in a manner acceptable to us.

# 15. [Reserved]

# 16. Prevented Planting
Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.

# 17. Stage Removal Option
(a) Applicability:
(1) If provided in the actuarial documents, you may elect the Stage Removal Option.
(2) You must have an additional coverage policy to elect this option.
(3) You must elect this option in writing on or before the sales closing date for the first year it is in effect.
(4) This election is continuous, in accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, unless canceled by the cancellation date. Your election of the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for your sugar beets in any crop year will be deemed to be cancellation of this option by you.
(5) All insurable acreage of sugar beets in the county will be included under this option unless any acreage is specifically excluded by the Special Provisions.
(b) Insurance Guarantees:
(1) The production guarantee (per acre) will be the final stage guarantee.
(2) The terms and conditions contained in sections 3(b) and 3(d) do not apply under this option.
(c) Premium Adjustment Factor: The premium adjustment factor in the actuarial documents for the stage removal option will apply to the premium computation method in section 7.
(d) Settlement of Claim:
(1) The “respective production guarantee” referenced in section 14(b) will be the final stage guarantee.
(2) The terms and conditions of section 14(c)(1)(iv) do not apply under this option.

# 18. Early Harvest Adjustment Option
(a) Applicability:
(1) If provided in the actuarial documents, you may elect the Early Harvest Adjustment Option to adjust your actual yield(s) for early harvested production.
(2) You must have additional coverage to elect this option.
(3) You must elect this option in writing on or before the sales closing date.
(4) This election is continuous, in accordance with section 2 of the Basic
Provisions, unless canceled by the cancellation date. Your election of the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for your sugar beets will cancel this option.
(b) Insurance Guarantees:
(1) APH database—On or before the production reporting date, you may replace actual yields with early harvest adjusted yields in your APH database, if this option is elected.
(i) The early harvest adjusted yields will be used in the same manner as actual yields for the purpose of calculating the approved yield.
(ii) Once an early harvest adjusted yield replaces an actual yield, the early harvest adjusted yield will remain in effect until such time as that crop year is no longer included in the APH database, this option is canceled in accordance with section 18(a)(4), or the insured chooses to no longer replace that actual yield(s) by the production reporting date.
(iii) If you cancel the option, the actual yield will be used in the APH database.
(2) Premium—Your approved yield will be used to determine your amount of premium owed. The premium will be increased to cover the additional risk associated with the resulting higher yields.
(3) Adjustment—The adjustment will equal an increase of your actual yield by 1 percent per day for each day the sugar beets were harvested prior to full maturity.
(4) Threshold—The adjustment will only be made if the early harvested percentage of insured acreage in the unit meets or exceeds 15 percent, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.
(5) Cap—The adjustment cannot result in a yield greater than the higher of:
(i) Your approved yield from the unit;
(ii) The actual yield of the acreage harvested after full maturity from the unit; or
(iii) The unadjusted actual yield of the early harvested acreage from the unit.
(6) Processor requirement—The adjustment will only be made if:
(i) Early harvest is required in the production agreement; or
(ii) The processor requests early harvest.
(c) Settlement of Claim—If this option is elected, production to count from the unit will be determined by:
(1) The adjustment will be made for any early harvested production if the threshold is exceeded for the unit.
(2) The adjustment will not be made if the sugar beets are damaged by an insurable cause of loss and leaving the crop in the field would reduce production.
(3) If the production agreement does not require early harvest and the processor has not requested early harvest, and the processor:
(i) Accepts the early harvested production, the early harvested production will be counted but no adjustment will apply.
(ii) Does not accept the early harvested production, the production to count will be the production guarantee for the acreage harvested early.

§ 457.110
Fig crop insurance provisions.
The Fig Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2025 and succeeding crop years are as follows:

# United States Department of Agriculture

# Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

# Fig Crop Provisions
In return for your payment of premium and administrative fee for the coverage, these Fig Crop Provisions will be attached to and made part of the Common Crop Insurance Policy, Basic Provisions (Basic Provisions) subject to the terms and conditions in your policy.

# 1. Definitions
Harvest.
The picking of the figs from the trees or ground by hand or machine for the purpose of removal from the orchard.
Interplanted.
In lieu of the definition in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any form of alternating or mixed pattern.
Manufacturing grade production.
Production that meets the United States Standards for Grades of Dried Figs, Grade B, as amended,
which is in effect on the date insurance attaches.
Marketable figs.
Figs that grade manufacturing grade or better in accordance with the Marketing Order for Dried Figs, as amended, which is in effect on the date insurance attaches.
Substandard production.
Production that does not meet minimum grade standards and is defined as “substandard” by the Marketing Order for Dried Figs, as amended, which is in effect on the date insurance attaches.

# 2. Unit Division
(a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, will be divided into additional basic units by each fig type designated in the Special Provisions.
(b) Optional units may be established by:
(1) Organic and non-organic farming practices as provided in section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions; or
(2) Non-contiguous land.
(c) Optional units by land location as provided in section 34(c)(1) of the Basic Provisions and by irrigation practice as provided in section 34(c)(2) of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.

# 3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices
(a) In addition to the requirements under section 3 of the Basic Provisions, you may select only one price election for each fig type designated in the Special Provisions and insured in the county under this policy.
(b) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop has occurred prior to the time you request the increase.
(c) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by type if applicable:
(1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected acres;
(2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;
(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern;
(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage is changed, the age of the crop that is interplanted with the figs, and type if applicable, and the planting pattern; and
(5) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.
(d) We will reduce the approved yield, as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of any circumstance listed in section 3(c) that may reduce your yields from previous levels. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your approved yield at any time we become aware of the circumstance. If the circumstance occurred:
(1) Before the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the approved yield will be reduced for the current crop year regardless of whether the circumstance was due to an insured or uninsured cause of loss;
(2) After the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the approved yield will be reduced for the current crop year only if the potential reduction in the approved yield is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or
(3) Before or after the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, an amount equal to the reduction in the approved yield will be added to the production to count calculated in section 11(c)(3) due to uninsured causes. We will reduce your approved yield for the subsequent crop year to reflect any reduction in the productive capacity of the trees or in the yield potential of the insured acreage.

# 4. Contract Changes
In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is October 31 preceding the cancellation date.

# 5. Cancellation and Termination Dates
The cancellation and termination dates are February 28.

# 6. Report of Acreage
By applying for fig crop insurance, you authorize us to have access to and to determine or verify your production and acreage from records maintained by the California Fig Advisory Board and the fig packer.

# 7. Insured Crop
The crop insured will be all the commercially grown dried figs that are grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
(a) In which you have a share;
(b) That are grown for harvest as dried figs;
(c) That are irrigated;
(d) That have reached the seventh leaf year after being set out; and
(e) For which acceptable production records for at least the previous crop year are provided;
(f) That are not figs:
(1) Grown on acreage with less than 90 percent of a stand based on the original planting pattern, unless otherwise allowed by the Special Provisions;
(2) Which we inspect and consider not acceptable;
(3) Grown for the crop year the application is filed unless inspected and accepted by us; or
(4) Grown on acreage acquired for the crop year unless such acreage has been inspected and accepted by us.

# 8. Insurable Acreage
In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, figs interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

# 9. Insurance Period
(a) In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions:
(1) Coverage begins on March 1, except that for the year of application, if your application is received after February 19 but prior to March 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard.
(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is October 31 or the date harvest of the figs (by type) should have started on any acreage that will not be harvested (exceptions, if any, for specific counties or varieties or varietal group are contained in the Special Provisions).
(b) Notwithstanding section 9(a)(1), for each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.
(c) If your fig policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.

# 10. Causes of Loss
(a) In addition to section 12 of the Basic Provisions, any loss covered by this policy must occur within the insurance period. The specific causes of loss for figs are:
(1) Adverse weather conditions;
(2) Earthquake;
(3) Fire;
(4) Volcanic eruption;
(5) Wildlife; or
(6) Failure of the irrigation water supply.
(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:
(1) Any loss of production due to fire, where weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or tree pruning debris has not been removed from the grove; or
(2) The inability to market the fruit as a direct result of quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any entity to accept production.

# 11. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:
(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
(2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
(3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and
(4) Multiplying this result by your share.
(c) The total production (pounds) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include all harvested and appraised marketable figs.
(1) Figs, which due to insurable causes, grade manufacturing grade will be adjusted by:
(i) Dividing the value per pound of the manufacturing grade production by the highest price election available for the insured type; and
(ii) Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1) by the number of pounds of such manufacturing grade production.
(2) Figs, which due to insurable causes, grade substandard and are delivered to the substandard pool will not be considered production to count, provided all the insured's substandard production is inspected by us and we give written consent to such delivery prior to delivery. If we do not give written consent prior to the delivery to the substandard pool, all production will be counted as undamaged marketable production. Substandard production for which we give written consent to you prior to delivery to the
substandard pool, which is not delivered to the substandard pool, and is sold by you, will be considered production to count and adjusted as follows:
(i) Dividing the value per pound received for such substandard production by the highest price election available for the insured type; and
(ii) Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1) by the number of pounds of such substandard production.
(3) Appraised production to be counted will include:
(i) Potential production lost due to uninsured causes and failure to follow recognized good fig farming practices;
(ii) Not less than the production guarantee for the figs on any acreage:
(A) That is abandoned without our consent;
(B) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;
(C) If the figs are destroyed by you without our consent; or
(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us;
(iii) Unharvested production which would be marketable if harvested; and
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you want to abandon and no longer care for if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
(A) We may require you to continue to care for the crop so that a subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine actual production. You must notify us within three days of the date harvest should have started if the crop is not harvested; or
(B) You may elect to continue to care for the crop. We will determine the amount of production to count for the acreage using the harvested production or our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested.

# 12. Late and Prevented Planting
The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.
[59 FR 9615, Mar. 1, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 65167, Dec. 10, 1997; 65 FR 47836, Aug. 4, 2000; 89 FR 53835, June 27, 2024]
§ 457.111
Pear crop insurance provisions.
The Pear Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2023 and succeeding crop years are as follows:
FCIC Policies

# Department of Agriculture

# Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

# Reinsured Policies

# (Appropriate title for insurance provider)
Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

# Pear Crop Provisions

# 1. Definitions
Harvest.
The picking of mature pears from the trees or the collecting of marketable pears from the ground.
Interplanted.
In lieu of the definition contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any form of alternating or mixed pattern.
Marketable.
Pear production that grades U.S. Number 2 processing or better, unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions, or that is sold (even if failing to meet any U.S. or applicable state grading standard).
Ton.
Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.

# 2. Unit Division
(a) Optional units may either be established in accordance with section 34(c) of the Basic Provisions or by non-contiguous land, but not both.
(b) In addition to establishing optional units in accordance with section 2(a), optional units may be established by type if allowed by the Special Provisions. The requirements of section 34 of the Basic Provisions that require the crop to be planted in a manner that results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of each optional unit are not applicable for optional units by type.

# 3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices
In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):
(a) You may select different coverage levels and percent of price elections for each type in the county as specified in the Special Provisions, unless you elect Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) on any type.
(1) For example, if you choose 75 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you may choose 65 percent coverage level and 75 percent of the maximum price election for another type. However, if you elect the CAT level of coverage for any pear type, the CAT level of coverage will be applicable to all insured pear acreage for all types in the county.
(2) Notwithstanding section 3(b)(2) of the Basic Provisions, pear types will not be considered as separate crops and will not be subject to separate administrative fees.
(b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), by type:
(1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected acres;
(2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;
(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:
(i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;
(ii) The planting pattern; and
(iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.
(c) We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee, as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of any situation listed in sections 3(b)(1) through (b)(4). If the situation occurred:
(1) Before the beginning of the insurance period, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year regardless of whether the situation was due to an insured or uninsured cause of loss (If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee at any time we become aware of the circumstance);
(2) After the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year only if the potential reduction in the yield used to establish your production guarantee is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or
(3) After the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, production lost due to uninsured causes equal to the amount of the reduction in yield used to establish your production guarantee will be applied in determining any indemnity (see section 11(c)(1)(ii)). We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee for the subsequent crop year to reflect any reduction in the productive capacity of the trees.
(d) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.

# 4. Contract Changes
In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the contract change date is October 31 preceding the cancellation date for states with a January 31 cancellation date and August 31 preceding the cancellation date for all other states.

# 5. Cancellation and Termination Dates
In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the cancellation and termination dates are:
States
Cancellation and termination dates
California
January 31.
All other states
November 20.

# 6. Insured Crop
In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the crop insured will be all the pears in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
(a) In which you have a share;
(b) That are of varieties adapted to the area;
(c) That are grown on trees that have produced an average of at least five (5) tons of pears per acre in at least one of the four previous crop years, unless otherwise allowed by the Special Provisions; and
(d) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered acceptable by us.

# 7. Insurable Acreage
In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, pears interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

# 8. Insurance Period
(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:
(1) For the year of application, coverage begins:
(i) In California, on February 1, except that if your application is received after January 22 but prior to February 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements (You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard); or
(ii) In all other states, on November 21, except that if your application is received after November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and determine
that it does not meet insurability requirements (You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard).
(2) For each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring an existing policy to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.
(3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is:
(i) September 15 for all types of summer or fall pears;
(ii) October 15 for all types of winter pears; or
(iii) As otherwise provided for specific types in the Special Provisions.
(4) If your pear policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.
(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):
(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
(2) If you relinquish your insurable interest on any insurable acreage of pears on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium will be due, and no indemnity paid, for such acreage for that crop year unless:
(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

# 9. Causes of Loss
(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
(1) Adverse weather conditions;
(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;
(3) Earthquake;
(4) Volcanic eruption;
(5) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period;
(6) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures; or
(7) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures.
(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:
(1) Failure of the fruit to color properly; or
(2) Inability to market the pears for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.

# 10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples in accordance with our procedures.
(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the following will apply:
(1) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.
(2) If any portion of your crop will be direct marketed, you must notify us at least 15 calendar days before any production will be harvested. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be harvested for direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
(3) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), so that we may inspect the damaged production. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.

# 11. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:
(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or
(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type if applicable, by its respective production guarantee;
(2) Multiplying the results of section 11(b)(1) by your price election for each type, if applicable;
(3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);
(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if applicable, by your price election;
(5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);
(6) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of section 11(b)(3); and
(7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.
Basic Coverage Example:
You have a 100 percent share of a 20-acre pear orchard located in a state other than California. You elect 100 percent of the $500/ton price election. You have a production guarantee of 15 tons/acre; you are only able to produce 10 tons of pears per acre. Your indemnity will be calculated as follows:
(1) 20 acres × 15 tons/acre = 300-ton production guarantee;
(2) $500/ton (100 percent of the price election) × 300-ton production guarantee;
(3) = $150,000 value of production guarantee;
(4) 20 acres × 10 tons = 200-ton production to count;
(5) $500/ton (100 percent of the price election) × 200-ton production to count = $100,000 value of production to count;
(6) $150,000 value of production guarantee—$100,000 value of production to count = $50,000 loss; and
(7) $50,000 × 100 percent share = $50,000 indemnity payment.

# [End of Example]
(c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 10;
(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production; and
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and
(2) For all states except California, all harvested and appraised marketable pear production from the insurable acreage.
(3) For California, all harvested and appraised production that:
(i) Meets the standards for first grade canning as defined by the California Pear Advisory Board or for U.S. Number 1 as defined by the United States Standards for Grades of Summer and Fall Pears, or Pears for Processing, or for U.S. Extra Number 1 or U.S. Number 1 as defined by the United States Standards for Grades of Winter Pears;
(ii) Is accepted by a processor for canning or packing; or
(iii) Is marketable for any purpose. However, if the pears are damaged by an insured cause, the production to count will be reduced by the greater of the following amounts:
(A) The excess over ten percent (10%) of pears that are size 165 or smaller for varieties other than Forelle, Seckel or Winter Nelis; or
(B) The result of dividing the value per ton of such pears by the highest price election for the insured type, subtracting this result from 1.000, and multiplying this difference (if positive) by the number of tons of such pears.
(d) Any pear production not graded or appraised prior to the earlier of the time pears are placed in storage or the date the pears are delivered to a packer, processor, or other handler will not be considered damaged pear production and will be considered production to count.

# 12. Late and Prevented Planting
The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.

# 13. Fresh Pear Quality Adjustment Endorsement
In the event of a conflict between the Pear Crop Insurance Provisions and this option, this option will control. If you select this option, you cannot receive less than the indemnity due under section 11.
(a) This endorsement applies to any crop year, provided:
(1) The insured pears are located in a State designated for such coverage on the actuarial documents and for which there is designated a premium rate for this endorsement;
(2) All the pear trees in the unit are managed for the production of fresh market pears (Units that are not managed for the production of fresh market pears do not qualify for this endorsement);
(3) You have not elected to insure your pears under the CAT Endorsement;
(4) You elected it on your application or other form approved by us, and did so on or before the sales closing date for the initial crop year for which you wish it to be effective (By doing so, you agree to pay the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents for this optional coverage); and
(5) You or we do not cancel it in writing on or before the cancellation date. Your election of CAT coverage for any crop year after this endorsement is effective will be considered as notice of cancellation of this endorsement by you.
(b) If the fresh pear production is damaged by an insured cause of loss, and if eleven percent (11%) or more of the harvested and appraised production does not grade at least U.S. Number 1 in accordance with the United States Standards for Grades of Summer and Fall Pears or the United States Standards for Grades of Winter Pears, as applicable, the amount of production to count will be reduced as follows:
(1) By two percent (2%) for each full one percent (1%) in excess of ten percent (10%), when eleven percent (11%) through sixty percent (60%) of the pears fail the grade standard; or
(2) By one hundred percent (100%) when more than sixty percent (60%) of the pears fail the grade standard.
(3) If you sell more of your fresh pear production as U.S. Number 1 or better than the quantity of pears determined to grade U.S. Number 1 or better in the appraisal, the quantity of such sold production exceeding the amount determined to grade U.S. Number 1 or better in the appraisal will be included as production to count under this option.
(c) Marketable production that grades less than U.S. Number 1 due to uninsurable causes not covered by this endorsement will not be reduced.
(d) Any adjustments that reduce your production to count under this option will not be applicable when determining production to count for Actual Production History purposes.
Fresh Pear Quality Adjustment Example:
You have a 100 percent share of a 20-acre pear orchard. You have a production guarantee of 15 tons/acre. You elect 100 percent of the $500/ton price election. You are only able to produce 10 tons/acre and only 7.5 tons/acre grade U.S. Number 1 or better (7.5 × 20 = 150 tons). Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
(1) 20 acres × 15 tons per acre = 300 tons production guarantee;
(2) 300 tons production guarantee × $500/ton = $150,000 value of production guarantee;
(3) The value of fresh pear production to count is determined as follows:
(i) 200 tons harvested production minus 150 tons that graded U.S. Number 1 or better = 50 tons failing to make grade;
(ii) 50 tons failing grade/200 tons of production = 25 percent of production failing to grade U.S. Number 1;
(iii) 25 percent minus 10 percent = 15 percent in excess of 10 percent allowance failing to make grade;
(iv) 15 percent × 2 = 30 percent total quality adjustment for pears failing to grade U.S. Number 1;
(v) 200 tons production × 30 percent quality adjustment = 60 tons of pears failing to make grade;
(vi) 200 tons production minus 60 tons failing to make grade = 140 tons of quality adjusted fresh pear production to count;
(vii) 140 tons of quality adjusted fresh pear production to count × $500/ton price election = $70,000 value of fresh pear production to count;
(4) $150,000 value of production guarantee minus $70,000 value of fresh pear production to count = $80,000 value of loss;
(5) $80,000 value of loss × 100 percent share = $80,000 indemnity payment.

§ 457.112
Hybrid sorghum seed crop insurance provisions.
The Hybrid Sorghum Seed Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2017 and succeeding crop years are as follows:
FCIC policies:

# United States Department of Agriculture

# Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

# Reinsured Policies

# (Appropriate title for insurance provider)
Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

# Hybrid Sorghum Seed Crop Provisions
If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of priority is as follows:
(1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions, (§ 457.8) with (1) controlling (2), etc.

# 1. Definitions
Adjusted yield.
An amount determined by multiplying the county yield by the coverage level factor.
Amount of insurance per acre.
A dollar amount determined by multiplying the adjusted yield by the price election you select and subtracting any minimum guaranteed payment, not to exceed the total compensation specified in the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract. If your hybrid sorghum seed processor contract contains a minimum guaranteed payment that is stated in bushels, we will convert that value to dollars by multiplying it by the price election you selected.
Approved yield.
In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, an amount FCIC determines to be representative of the yield that the female parent plants are expected to produce when grown under a specific production practice. FCIC will establish the approved yield based upon records provided by the seed company and other information it deems appropriate.
Bushel.
Fifty-six pounds avoirdupois of the insured crop.
Certified seed test.
A warm germination test performed on clean seed according to specifications of the “Rules for Testing Seeds” of the Association of Official Seed Analysts.
Commercial hybrid sorghum seed.
The offspring produced by crossing a male and female parent plant, each having a different genetic character. This offspring is the product intended for use by an agricultural producer to produce a commercial field sorghum crop for grain or forage.
County yield.
An amount contained in the actuarial documents that is established by FCIC to represent the yield that a producer of hybrid sorghum seed would be expected to produce if the acreage had been planted to commercial field sorghum.
Coverage level factor.
A factor contained in the Special Provisions to adjust the county yield for commercial field sorghum to reflect the higher value of hybrid sorghum seed.
Dollar value per bushel.
An amount that determines the value of any seed production to count. It is determined by dividing the amount of insurance per acre by the result of multiplying the approved yield by the coverage level percentage, expressed as a decimal.
Female parent plants.
Sorghum plants that are grown for the purpose of producing commercial hybrid sorghum seed and are male sterile.
Field run.
Commercial hybrid sorghum seed production before it has been processed or screened.
Good farming practices.
In addition to the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, good farming practices include those practices required by the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract.
Harvest.
Combining, threshing or picking of the female parent plants to obtain commercial hybrid sorghum seed.
Hybrid sorghum seed processor contract.
An agreement executed in writing between the hybrid sorghum seed crop producer and a seed company containing, at a minimum:
(a) The producer's promise to plant and grow male and female parent plants, and to deliver all commercial hybrid sorghum seed produced from such plants to the seed company;
(b) The seed company's promise to purchase the commercial hybrid sorghum seed produced by the producer; and
(c) Either a fixed price per unit of measure (bushels, hundredweight, etc.) of the commercial hybrid sorghum seed or a formula to determine the value of such seed. Any formula for establishing the value must be based on data provided by a public third party that establishes or provides pricing information to the general public, based on prices paid in the open market (
e.g.,
commodity futures exchanges), to be acceptable for the purpose of this policy.
Inadequate germination.
Germination of less than 80 percent of the commercial hybrid sorghum seed as determined by using a certified seed test.
Insurable interest.
Your share of the financial loss that occurs in the event seed production is damaged by a cause of loss specified in section 10.
Local market price.
The cash price offered by buyers for any production from the female parent plants that is not considered commercial hybrid sorghum seed under the terms of this policy.
Male parent plants.
Sorghum plants grown for the purpose of pollinating female parent plants.
Minimum guaranteed payment.
A minimum amount (usually stated in dollars or bushels) specified in your hybrid sorghum seed processor contract that will be paid or credited to you by the seed company regardless of the quantity of seed produced.
Non-seed production.
Production that does not qualify as seed production because of inadequate germination.
Planted acreage.
In addition to the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, the insured crop must be planted in rows wide enough to permit mechanical cultivation, unless provided by the Special Provisions or by written agreement.
Planting pattern.
The arrangement of the rows of the male and female parent plants in a field. An example of a planting pattern is four consecutive rows of female parent plants followed by two consecutive rows of male parent plants.
Practical to replant.
In addition to the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, practical to replant applies to either the female or male parent plant. It will not be considered practical to replant unless production from the replanted acreage can be delivered under the terms of the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract, or the seed company agrees that it will accept the production from the replanted acreage.
Prevented planting.
In addition to the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, prevented planting applies to the female and male parent plants. The male parent plants must be planted in accordance with the requirements of the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract to be considered planted.
Sample.
For the purpose of the certified seed test, at least 3 pounds of randomly selected field run sorghum seed for each type or variety of commercial hybrid sorghum seed grown on the unit.
Seed company.
A business enterprise that possesses all licenses for marketing commercial hybrid sorghum seed required by the state in which it is domiciled or operates, and which possesses facilities with enough storage and drying capacity to accept and process the insured crop within a reasonable amount of time after harvest. If the seed company is the insured, it must also be a corporation.
Seed production.
All seed produced by female parent plants with a germination rate of at least 80 percent as determined by a certified seed test.
Type.
Grain sorghum, forage sorghum, or sorghum sudan parent plants.
Variety.
The name, number or code assigned to a specific genetic cross by the seed company or the Special Provisions for the insured crop in the county.

# 2. Unit Division
(a) For any processor contract that stipulates the amount of production to be delivered:
(1) In lieu of the definition of “basic unit” contained in the Basic Provisions, a basic unit will consist of all acreage planted to the insured crop in the county that will be used to fulfill a hybrid sorghum seed processor contract;
(2) There will be no more than one basic unit for all production contracted with each processor contract;
(3) In accordance with section 12, all production from any basic unit in excess of the amount under contract will be included as production to count if such production is applied to any other basic unit for which the contracted amount has not been fulfilled; and
(4) Optional units will not be established.
(b) For any processor contract that stipulates a number of acres to be planted, the provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.

# 3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities
(a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions, you may select only one price election for all the hybrid sorghum seed in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by type or variety, in which case you may elect one price election for each hybrid sorghum seed type or variety designated in the Special Provisions. The price election you choose for each type or variety must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type or variety. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one specific type or variety, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types or varieties.
(b) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 of the Basic Provisions are not applicable to this contract.

# 4. Contract Changes
In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

# 5. Cancellation and Termination Dates
In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are March 15.

# 6. Report of Acreage
In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, you must:
(a) Report by type and variety, the location and insurable acreage of the insured crop;
(b) Report any acreage that is uninsured, including that portion of the total acreage occupied by male parent plants; and
(c) Certify that you have a hybrid sorghum seed processor contract and report the amount, if any, of any minimum guaranteed payment.

# 7. Insured Crop
(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the female parent plants in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
(1) In which you have a share;
(2) That are grown under a hybrid sorghum seed processor contract executed before the acreage reporting date;
(3) That are planted for harvest as commercial hybrid sorghum seed in accordance with the requirements of the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract and the production management practices of the seed company; and
(4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement):
(i) Planted with a mixture of female and male parent seed in the same row;
(ii) Planted for any purpose other than for commercial hybrid sorghum seed;
(iii) Interplanted with another crop; or
(iv) Planted into an established grass or legume.
(b) An instrument in the form of a “lease” under which you retain control of the acreage on which the insured crop is grown and that provides for delivery of the crop under substantially the same terms as a hybrid sorghum seed processor contract will be treated as a contract under which you have an insurable interest in the crop.
(c) A commercial hybrid sorghum seed producer who is also a commercial hybrid sorghum seed company may be able to insure the hybrid sorghum seed crop if the following requirements are met:
(1) The seed company has an insurable interest in the hybrid sorghum seed crop;
(2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors of the seed company has executed and adopted a corporate resolution containing the same terms as an acceptable hybrid sorghum seed processor contract. This corporate resolution will be considered a contract under the terms of this policy;
(3) Sales records for at least the previous years' seed production must be provided to confirm that the seed company has produced and sold seed. If such records are not available, the crop may be insured under the Coarse Grains Crop Provisions with a written agreement; and
(4) Our inspection reveals that the storage and drying facilities satisfy the definition of a seed company.
(d) Any of the insured crop that is under contract with different seed companies may be insured under separate policies with different insurance providers provided all acreage of the insured crop in the county is insured. If you elect to insure the insured crop with different insurance providers, you agree to pay separate administrative fees for each insurance policy.

# 8. Insurable Acreage
In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure any acreage of the insured crop:
(a) Planted and occupied exclusively by male parent plants;
(b) Not in compliance with the rotation requirements contained in the Special Provisions or, if applicable, required by the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract; or
(c) If either the female or male parent plants are damaged before the final planting date and we determine that insured crop is practical to replant but it is not replanted.

# 9. Insurance Period
(a) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions, insurance attaches upon completion of planting of:
(1) The female parent plant seed on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions, except as allowed in section 16 of the Basic Provisions; and
(2) The male parent plant seed.
(b) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the November 30 immediately following planting.

# 10. Causes of Loss
(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
(1) Adverse weather conditions;
(2) Fire;
(3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;
(5) Wildlife;
(6) Earthquake;
(7) Volcanic eruption; or
(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of loss contained in section 10(a) (1) through (7) that occurs during the insurance period.
(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due to:
(1) The use of unadapted, incompatible, or genetically deficient male or female parent plant seed;
(2) Frost or freeze after the date set by the Special Provisions;
(3) Failure to follow the requirements stated in the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract and production management practices of the seed company;
(4) Inadequate germination, even if resulting from an insured cause of loss, unless you
have provided adequate notice as required by section 11(b)(1); or
(5) Failure to plant the male parent plant seed at a time or in a manner sufficient to assure adequate pollination of the female parent plants, unless you are prevented from planting the male parent plant seed by an insured cause of loss.

# 11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples of at least one complete planting pattern of the male and female parent plant rows that extend the entire length of each field in the unit. If you are going to destroy any acreage of the insured crop that will not be harvested, the samples must not be destroyed until after our inspection.
(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions:
(1) You must give us notice of probable loss at least 15 days before the beginning of harvest if you anticipate inadequate germination on any unit; and
(2) You must provide a completed copy of your hybrid sorghum seed processor contract unless we have determined it has already been provided by the seed company, and the seed company certifies that such contract is used for all its producers without any waivers or amendments.

# 12. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or
(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.
(b) You will not receive an indemnity payment on a unit if the seed company refuses to provide us with records we require to determine the dollar value per bushel of production for each variety.
(c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective amount of insurance per acre, by type and variety if applicable;
(2) Totaling the results of section 12(c)(1) if there are more than one type or variety;
(3) Multiplying the total seed production to count (see section 12(d)) for each type and variety of commercial hybrid sorghum seed by the applicable dollar value per bushel for that type or variety;
(4) Multiplying the total non-seed production to count (see section 12(e)) for each type and variety by the applicable local market price determined on the earlier of the date the non-seed production is sold or the date of final inspection;
(5) Totaling the results of sections 12(c)(3) and 12(c)(4) by type and variety;
(6) Subtracting the result of section 12(c)(5) from the result of section 12(c)(1) if there is only one type or variety, or subtracting the result of 12(c)(5) from the result of section 12(c)(2) if there are more than one type or variety; and
(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(c)(6) by your share.
For example:
You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the development of type “A” hybrid sorghum seed in the unit, with an amount of insurance per acre guarantee of $361 (county yield of 170 bushels times a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent coverage level, times a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the minimum guaranteed payment of zero). Your seed production was 1,400 bushels and the dollar value per bushel was $3.47. Your non-seed production was 100 bushels with a local market value of $2.00 per bushel. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
(1) 50 acres × $361 = $18,050 amount of insurance guarantee;
(3) 1,400 bushels × $3.47 = $4,858 value of seed production;
(4) 100 bushels of non-seed × $2.00 = $200 of non-seed production;
(5) $4,858 + $200 = $5,058;
(6) $18,050 − $5,058 = $12,992; and
(7) $12,992 × 100 percent share = $12,992 indemnity payment.
You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the development of type “B” hybrid sorghum seed in the unit, with an amount of insurance per acre guarantee of $340 (county yield of 160 bushels times a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent coverage level, times a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the minimum guaranteed payment of zero). You harvested 1,200 bushels and the dollar value per bushel for the harvested amount was $4.63. You also harvested 200 bushels of non-seed with a market value of $2.00 per bushel. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
(1) 50 acres × $361 = $18,050 amount of insurance guarantee for type “A” and 50 acres × $340 = $17,000 amount of insurance guarantee for type “B”;
(2) $18,050 + $17,000 = $35,050 amount of insurance guarantee;
(3) 1,400 bushels × $3.47 = $4,858 value of seed production for type “A” and 1,200 bushels × $4.63 = $5,556 value of seed production for type “B”;
(4) 100 bushels of non-seed × $2.00 = $200 of non-seed production for type “A” and 200 bushels of non-seed × $2.00 = $400 of non-seed production for type “B”
(5) $4,858 + $200 + $5,556 + $400 = $11,014 value of production to count;
(6) $35,050 − $11,014 = $24,036; and
(7) $24,036 × 100 percent share = $24,036 indemnity payment.
(d) Production to be counted as seed production will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) Not less than the amount of insurance per acre for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Mature unharvested production with a germination rate of at least 80 percent of the commercial hybrid sorghum seed as determined by a certified seed test. Any such production may be adjusted in accordance with section 12(f);
(iv) Immature appraised production;
(v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
(2) Harvested production that you deliver as commercial hybrid sorghum seed to the seed company stated in your hybrid sorghum seed processor contract, regardless of quality, unless the production has inadequate germination.
(e) Production to be counted as non-seed production will include all harvested or mature appraised production that does not qualify as seed production to count as specified in section 12(d). Any such production may be adjusted in accordance with section 12(f).
(f) For the purpose of determining the quantity of mature production:
(1) Commercial hybrid sorghum seed production will be:
(i) Increased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture below 13.0 percent; or
(ii) Decreased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of 13.0 percent.
(2) When records of commercial hybrid sorghum seed production provided by the seed company have been adjusted to a basis of 13.0 percent moisture and 56 pound avoirdupois bushels, section 12(f)(1) above will not apply to harvested production. In such cases, records of the seed company will be used to determine the amount of production to count, provided that the moisture and weight of such production are calculated on the same basis as that used to determine the approved yield.

# 13. Prevented Planting
Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your amount of insurance for timely planted acreage. If you have additional levels of coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.
[62 FR 65318, Dec. 12, 1997, as amended at 81 FR 84399, Nov. 23, 2016]
§ 457.113
Coarse grains crop insurance provisions.
The Coarse Grains Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2025 and succeeding crop years are as follows:

# United States Department of Agriculture

# Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

# Coarse Grains Crop Provisions
In return for your payment of premium and administrative fee for coverage, these Coarse Grains Crop Provisions and corresponding Commodity Exchange Price Provisions will be attached to and made part of the Common Crop Insurance Policy, Basic Provisions (Basic Provisions) subject to the terms and conditions in your policy.

# 1. Definitions
Coarse grains.

The cash grain price per bushel for the U.S. No. 2 yellow corn, U.S. No. 2 grain sorghum, or U.S. No. 1 soybeans, offered by buyers in the area in which you normally market the insured crop. The local market price will reflect the maximum limits of quality deficiencies allowable for the U.S. No. 2 grade for yellow corn and grain sorghum, or U.S. No. 1 grade for soybeans. Factors not associated with grading under the Official United States Standards for Grain, including but not limited to protein and oil, will not be considered.
Not following another crop (NFAC
). A cropping practice, as specified in the Special Provisions, in which a crop is planted not following another crop.
Planted acreage.
In addition to the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, coarse grains must initially be planted in rows, unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.
Production guarantee (per acre).
In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, the number of bushels (tons for corn insured as silage) determined by multiplying the approved yield per acre by the coverage level percentage you elect.
Silage.
A product that results from severing the plant from the land and chopping it for the purpose of livestock feed.
Ton.
Two thousand (2000) pounds avoirdupois.

# 2. Unit Division
(a) In addition to enterprise units provided in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions, you may elect separate enterprise units for FAC or NFAC cropping practices if the FAC and NFAC cropping practices are allowed by the actuarial documents. If you elect enterprise units for FAC and NFAC cropping practices, you may not elect enterprise or optional units by any other practice or type.
(1) You may elect one enterprise unit for all FAC cropping practices or one enterprise unit for all NFAC cropping practices, or separate enterprise units for both practices, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. For example: You may choose an enterprise unit for all FAC acreage (soybeans irrigated practice and non-irrigated practice) and an enterprise unit for all NFAC acreage (soybeans irrigated practice and non-irrigated practice).
(2) You are only eligible if both FAC and NFAC cropping practices are allowed by the actuarial documents for each irrigation practice you use. If FAC and NFAC cropping practices are only allowed for the non-irrigated practice, separate enterprise units for FAC and NFAC cropping practices are not available if you use the irrigated practice; but if you use only non-irrigated FAC and NFAC cropping practices, separate enterprise units for non-irrigated FAC and NFAC cropping practices are available.
(3) You must separately meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions for each enterprise unit.
(4) If you elected separate enterprise units for both cropping practices and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for one or the other cropping practice and such discovery is made:
(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, you may elect to insure:
(A) One enterprise unit for all FAC or NFAC cropping practices provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions, and basic or optional units for the other cropping practice, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for;
(B) One enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions; or
(C) Basic or optional units for all acreage of the crop in the county, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, your unit structure will be one enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions. Otherwise, we will assign the basic unit structure.
(5) If you elected an enterprise unit on one cropping practice for FAC or NFAC and a different unit structure on the other cropping practice and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for the FAC or NFAC cropping practice and such discovery is made:
(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and qualify for; or
(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure.
(b) Instead of establishing optional units as provided in section 34(c) of the Basic Provisions, if allowed by the actuarial documents, you may have separate optional units for the FAC cropping practice and the NFAC cropping practice. These optional units will be by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm number and by the FAC cropping practice and the NFAC cropping practice. These optional units cannot be further divided by irrigated and non-irrigated acreage or by acreage insured under an organic farming practice.
(c) If FAC or NFAC cropping practices are only available by written agreement, separate enterprise units or optional units for FAC or NFAC cropping practices are not available.

# 3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices
In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions, you must elect to insure your corn, grain sorghum, or soybeans with either revenue protection or yield protection by the sales closing date.

# 10. Replanting Payments
(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:
(1) In lieu of section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these Crop Provisions;
(2) Except as specified in section 10(a)(1), you must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions; and
(3) The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage.
(b) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or the number of bushels (tons for corn insured as silage) for the applicable crop specified below, multiplied by your projected price, multiplied by your share:
(1) 8 bushels for corn grain;
(2) 1 ton for corn silage;
(3) 7 bushels for grain sorghum; and
(4) 3 bushels for soybeans.
(c) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced
by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.
(d) If the acreage is replanted to an insured crop type that is different than the insured crop type originally planted on the acreage:
(1) The production guarantee, premium, and projected price and harvest price, as applicable, will be adjusted based on the replanted type;
(2) Replanting payments will be calculated using your projected price and production guarantee for the crop type that is replanted and insured; and
(3) A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type, as applicable.

# 11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
(a) Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.
(b) For any corn unit that has separate dates for the end of the insurance period (grain and silage), in lieu of the requirement contained in section 14 of the Basic Provisions to provide notice within 72 hours of your initial discovery of damage (but not later than 15 days after the end of the insurance period), you must provide notice within 72 hours of your initial discovery of damage (but not later than 15 days after the latest end of the insurance period applicable to the unit).
(c) If you will harvest any acreage in a manner other than as you reported on your acreage report (
e.g.,
you reported planting it to harvest as grain but will harvest the acreage for hay, silage, earlage, snaplage, or fodder, or you reported planting it to harvest as silage but will harvest the acreage for grain, hay, earlage, snaplage, or fodder), you must notify us before harvest begins so the acreage can be appraised as the type reported on your acreage report to determine production to count that is used for claim purposes. Failure to timely provide notice will result in production to count determined in accordance with section 12(c)(1)(i)(E).

# 12. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:
(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:
(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres of each insured crop or type, as applicable, by your respective:
(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection; or
(ii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection;
(2) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(1)(i) or 12(b)(1)(ii), whichever is applicable;
(3) Multiplying the production to count of each insured crop or type, as applicable, by your respective:
(i) Projected price if you elected yield protection; or
(ii) Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;
(4) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(3)(i) or 12(b)(3)(ii), whichever is applicable;
(5) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(4) from the result of section 12(b)(2); and
(6) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(5) by your share.

# Example for Section 12(b)
You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of corn in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 115 bushels, your projected price is $4.75, your harvest price is $4.68, and your production to count is 5,000 bushels.
If you elected yield protection:
(1) 50 acres × (115 bushel production guarantee × $4.75 projected price) = $27,312.50 value of the production guarantee;
(2) Not applicable;
(3) 5,000 bushel production to count × $4.75 projected price = $23,750.00 value of the production to count;
(4) Not applicable;
(5) $27,312.50−$23,750.00 = $3,562.50;
(6) $3,562.50 × 1.000 share = $3,562.50 indemnity; or
If you elected revenue protection:
(1) 50 acres × (115 bushel production guarantee × $4.75 projected price) = $27,312.50 revenue protection guarantee;
(2) Not applicable;
(3) 5,000 bushel production to count × $4.68 harvest price = $23,400.00 value of the production to count;
(4) Not applicable;
(5) $27,312.50−$23,400.00 = $3,912.50;
(6) $3,912.50 × 1.000 share = $3,912.50 indemnity.
End of Example.
(c) The total production to count (in bushels for corn insured as grain or in tons for corn insured as silage) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) For yield protection, not less than the production guarantee, or for revenue protection, not less than the amount of production that when multiplied by the harvest price equals the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;
(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us; or
(E) For which you fail to give us notice before harvest begins if you report planting the corn to harvest as grain but harvest it as silage or you report planting the corn to harvest as silage but harvest it as grain.
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 12(d)); and
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you will put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count.); or
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
(d) Mature coarse grain production (excluding corn insured as silage) may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality. Corn insured as silage will be adjusted for excess moisture and quality only as specified in section 12(e).
(1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of:
(i) 15 percent for corn (If moisture exceeds 30 percent, production will be reduced 0.2 percent for each 0.1 percentage point above 30 percent);
(ii) 14 percent for grain sorghum; and
(iii) 13 percent for soybeans.
We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.
(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain, result in:
(A) Corn not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor;
(B) Grain sorghum not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut odor), or meets the special grade requirements for smutty grain sorghum; or
(C) Soybeans not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except garlic odor), or which meet the special grade requirements for garlicky soybeans; or
(ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions;
(ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;
(iii) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed by:
(A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
(B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or
(C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and
(iv) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
(4) Coarse grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 12(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced by the quality adjustment factor calculated in accordance with the Special Provisions.
(e) For corn insured as silage:
(1) Whenever our appraisal of grain content is less than 4.5 bushels of grain per ton of silage, the silage production will be reduced by 1 percentage point for each 0.1 of a bushel less than 4.5 bushels per ton (If we cannot make a grain appraisal before harvest and you do not leave a representative unharvested sample, in accordance with the policy no reduction for grain-deficient silage will be made.); and
(2) If the normal silage harvesting period has ended, or for any acreage harvested as silage or appraised as silage after the calendar date for the end of the insurance period as specified in section 8(b), we will increase the silage production to count to a 65 percent moisture equivalent to reflect the normal moisture content of silage harvested during the normal silage harvesting period.
(f) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

# 13. Prevented Planting
Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents.

(b) Instead of reporting your sugarcane production for the previous crop year as required by subsection 3(f) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), there is a lag period of one year and you are required to report production from two crop years previously, e.g., 1994 crop year production must be reported by the required date for the 1996 crop year.

# 3. Contract Changes
In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the contract change date is June 30 preceding the cancellation date.

# 4. Cancellation and Termination Dates
In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the cancellation and termination dates are September 30.

# 5. Insured Crop
(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the crop insured will be all the sugarcane in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
(1) In which you have a share;
(2) That is grown for processing for sugar or for seed; and
(3) That is not interplanted with another crop, unless allowed by a written agreement.
(b) In addition to the crop listed as not insured in section 8(b) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), we will not insure any sugarcane:
(1) That was damaged the previous crop year to the extent the sugarcane is unable to produce the yield used to establish the production guarantee for the unit for the current crop year; or
(2) That exceeds the age limitations (by variety, if applicable) contained in the Special Provisions , unless we agree in writing to insure such acreage. An agreement in writing will not be provided unless, after an appraisal, we determine that the crop is able to produce at least the yield used to establish the production guarantee for the unit for the current crop year.

# 6. Insurable Acreage
Section 9(a)(2)(iv) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), is not applicable to the Sugarcane Crop Insurance Provisions.

# 7. Insurance Period
(a) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance attaches:
(1) On the later of the day we accept your application or at the time of planting for plant cane;
(2) On the first day following harvest of the previous crop for stubble cane except as contained in sections 7(a)(3) and (4);
(3) On the later of April 15 or 30 days following harvest of the previous crop for stubble cane damaged during the previous crop year in all states (except Louisiana); and
(4) On the later of April 30 or 30 days following harvest of the previous crop for stubble cane damaged during the previous crop year in Louisiana.
(b) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is:
(1) January 31 in Louisiana; and
(2) April 30 in all other states.

# 8. Causes of Loss

(a) Adverse weather conditions;
(b) Fire;
(c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
(d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;
(e) Wildlife;
(f) Earthquake;
(g) Volcanic eruption; or
(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if applicable, due to an unavoidable cause of loss occurring within the insurance period.

# 9. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss or Cutting the Sugarcane for Seed
(a) In addition to your duties under section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), in the event of damage or loss:
(1) All sugarcane stubble must remain intact for our inspection; and
(2) You must give us notice at least 15 days before you begin cutting any sugarcane for seed. Your notice must include the unit number and the number of acres you intend to harvest as seed. Failure to give us timely notice will cause the acreage cut for seed to be considered as put to another use without consent. The production to count for such acreage will not be less than the production guarantee.
(3) You must request an appraisal if any time during the crop year sugarcane acreage cut for seed will not produce at least the production guarantee so we can determine the production to count. If you do not request an appraisal, the production to count for such acreage will be the production guarantee.
(b) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), if you initially discover damage to any insured crop within 15 days of, or during harvest, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The stubble must not be destroyed and the required samples must not be harvested until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.

# 10. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production:
(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on any unit by:
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
(2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
(3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and
(4) Multiplying this result by your share.

# Example 1:
Assume you have a 100 percent share in a unit of 100 acres of sugarcane, an approved yield of 6,000 pounds of raw sugar per acre, a coverage election of 65 percent, and a price election of $0.12 a pound. The production guarantee would be 3,900 pounds of raw sugar per acre (6,000 × 65%). Further assume that you are only able to harvest 200,000 pounds of raw sugar because the unit was damaged by an insurable cause of loss.
Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
(1) 100 acres × 3,900 pound production guarantee = 390,000 pound production guarantee;
(2) 390,000 pound production guarantee−200,000 pounds harvested production = 190,000 pound production loss;
(3) 190,000 pound production loss × $0.12 price election = $22,800 loss; and
(4) $22,800 loss × 100 percent share = $22,800 indemnity payment.

# Example 2:
Assume the same set of facts. Also, assume that you cut 20 acres of this unit for seed without giving notice that you were cutting this acreage for seed and that you are only able to harvest 200,000 pounds from the remaining 80 acres. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
(1) 100 acres × 3,900 pound production guarantee = 390,000 pound production guarantee;
(2) 390,000 pound production guarantee−278,000 (200,000 pounds harvested production + 78,000 pounds production for putting acreage to another use without consent, (20 acres × 3,900 pound production guarantee per acre)) = 112,000 pound production loss;
(3) 112,000 pound production loss × $0.12 price election = $13,440 loss; and
(4) $13,440 loss × 100 percent share = $13,440 indemnity payment.
(c) The total production (pounds of sugar) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;
(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us; or
(E) On which the sugarcane stubble is destroyed within 15 days after harvest is completed without our consent;
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production;
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage harvested for seed (see section 9(a)(3));
(v) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us. (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count.); or
(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
(2) All harvested production from insurable acreage. Final records of sugar production will be used to determine the amount of production to count. Preliminary mill estimates will not be used.
(d) Harvested sugarcane may be adjusted for low quality if it is damaged by one or more freezes occurring within the insurance period to the extent that it cannot be processed for sugar by the boiling house operation. The amount of production to count for such sugarcane will be determined by dividing the dollar value of the damaged production by the local market price per pound for raw sugar. The prices used for this adjustment will be determined on the earlier of the date such quality-adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit.

# 11. Late and Prevented Planting
The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.
[60 FR 25602, May 12, 1995, as amended at 62 FR 65169, Dec. 10, 1997; 67 FR 46095, July 12, 2002; 67 FR 52841, Aug. 14, 2002; 75 FR 15883, Mar. 30, 20100]

# 5. Report of Acreage
In lieu of the provisions of section 6(a) of the Basic Provisions, a report of all insured acreage of forage production must be submitted on or before each forage production acreage reporting date specified in the Special Provisions.

# 6. Insured Crop
(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be all the forage in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
(1) In which you have a share;
(2) That is not grown with the intent to be grazed, or grazed at any time during the insurance period; and
(3) That follows a year of establishment that results in an adequate stand as shown in the Special Provisions.
(b) In addition to the crops listed as not insured in section 8 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure any forage that:
(1) Does not have an adequate stand at the beginning of the insurance period;
(2) Is grown with a non-forage crop; or

(3) Final adjustment of a loss;
(4) The date grazing commences on the forage crop;
(5) Abandonment of the forage crop; or
(6) The end of the insurance period date shown in the actuarial documents.

# 8. Causes of Loss
(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
(1) Adverse weather conditions;
(2) Fire;
(3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;
(5) Wildlife;
(6) Earthquake;
(7) Volcanic eruption; or
(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period.
(b) In addition to the causes of loss specifically excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage of loss of production that occurs after harvest.

# 9. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:
(a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date cutting should have started if the insured crop will not be harvested;
(b) If any portion of your crop will be direct marketed, you must notify us at least 15 calendar days before any production will be harvested. Failure to give timely notice that production will be harvested for direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal;
(c) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions so that we may inspect the damaged production. You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, and such failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and will be included as production to count; and
(d) You must notify us at least 5 days before grazing of insured forage begins so we can conduct an appraisal to determine production to count. Failure to give timely notice that the acreage will be grazed will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre.

# 10. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
(1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or
(2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for the units.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, by its respective production guarantee;
(2) Multiplying each result in section 10(b)(1) by the respective price election you selected;
(3) Totaling the results of each crop type in section 10(b)(2);
(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if applicable, (see section 10(c)) by the respective price election you selected;
(5) Totaling the results of each crop type in section 10(b)(4);
(6) Subtracting the result in section 10(b)(5) from the result in section 10(b)(3); and
(7) Multiplying the result in section 10(b)(6) by your share.

# Example 1
Assume you have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type A forage in the unit, with a guarantee of 3.0 tons per acre and a price election of $100 per ton. Due to adverse weather you were only able to harvest 50.0 tons. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
1. 100 acres type A × 3 tons = 300-ton guarantee;
2
3. 300 tons × $100 price election = $30,000 total value guarantee;
4
5. 50 tons production to count × $100 price election = $5,000 total value of production to count;
6. $30,000 value guarantee − $5,000 = $25,000 loss; and
7. $25,000 × 100 percent share = $25,000 indemnity payment.

# Example 2
Assume you also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type B forage in the same unit, with a guarantee of 1.0 ton per acre and a price election of $90 per ton. Due to adverse weather you were only able to harvest 5.0
tons. Your total indemnity for forage production for both types A and B in the same unit would be calculated as follows:
1. 100 acres × 3 tons = 300-ton guarantee for type A and 100 acres × 1 ton = 100-ton guarantee for type B;
2. 300-ton guarantee × $100 price election = $30,000 total value of the guarantee for type A and 100-ton guarantee × $90 price election = $9,000 total value of the guarantee for type B;
3. $30,000 + $9,000 = $39,000 total value of the guarantee;
4. 50 tons × $100 price election = $5,000 total value of production to count for type A; and 5 tons × $90 price election = $450 total value of production to count for type B;
5. $5,000 + $450 = $5,450 total value of production to count for types A and B;
6. $39,000 − $5,450 = $33,550 loss; and
7. $33,550 loss × 100 percent share = $33,550 indemnity payment.
(c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) Put to another use without our consent;
(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
(D) For which you fail to provide production records that are acceptable to us;
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production;
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached and:
(A) You do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or
(B) You elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
(d) When forage is harvested as other than air-dry forage, the production to count will be adjusted to the equivalent of air-dry forage.
(e) Any harvested production from plants growing in the forage will be counted as forage on a weight basis.
(f) In addition to the provisions of section 15 of the Basic Provisions, we may determine the amount of production of any unharvested forage on the basis of our field appraisals conducted after the normal time for each cutting for the area.

# United States Department of Agriculture

# Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

# Texas Citrus Fruit Crop Provisions

# 1. Definitions
Citrus fruit commodity.
Includes the following:
(a) Oranges;
(b) Grapefruit; and
(c) Any other citrus fruit designated as a “citrus fruit commodity” in the actuarial documents.
Citrus fruit group.
A designation in the Special Provisions used to identify combinations of citrus fruit commodity types and intended uses within a citrus fruit commodity that may be grouped together for the purposes of electing coverage levels and identifying the insured crop.
Commodity type.
A specific subcategory of a citrus fruit commodity having a characteristic or set of characteristics distinguishable from other subcategories of the same citrus fruit commodity.
Crop year.
The period beginning with the date insurance attaches to the insured crop and extending through the normal harvest time. It is designated by the calendar year following the year in which the bloom is normally set.
Excess rain.
An amount of precipitation that damages the insured crop.
Excess wind.
A natural movement of air that has sustained speeds exceeding 58 miles per hour (50 knots) recorded at the weather reporting station (U.S. National Weather Service reporting station or any other weather reporting station identified in the Special Provisions) operating nearest to the insured acreage at the time of damage.
Freeze.
The formation of ice in the cells of the tree, its blossoms, or its fruit caused by low air temperatures.
Harvest.
The severance of mature citrus fruit from the tree by pulling, picking, or any other means, or by collecting marketable fruit from the ground.
Hedged.
A process of trimming the sides of the citrus trees for better or more fruitful growth of the citrus fruit.
Intended use.
The insured's expected end use or disposition of the commodity at the time the commodity is reported. Insurable intended uses will be specified in the Special Provisions.
Interplanted.
In lieu of the definition contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, acreage on which two or more agricultural commodities are planted in any form of alternating or mixed pattern and at least one of these agricultural commodities constitutes an insured crop under these Crop Provisions.
Production guarantee (per acre).
In lieu of the definition contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, the production guarantee will be determined by stage as follows:
(a) First stage production guarantee—The second stage production guarantee multiplied by forty percent (40%).
(b) Second stage production guarantee. The quantity of citrus (in tons) determined by multiplying the yield determined in accordance with section 3(e) of these Crop Provisions by the coverage level percentage you elect.
Ton.
Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.
Topped.
A process of trimming the uppermost portion of the citrus trees for better and more fruitful growth of the citrus fruit.

# 2. Unit Division
(a) Basic units will be established for each insured crop (citrus fruit group) in accordance with section 1 of the Basic Provisions.
(b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.
(c) Optional units may be established by either of the following, but not both:
(1) In accordance with section 34(c) of the Basic Provisions, except as provided in section 2(b) of these Crop Provisions; or
(2) If each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land.

# 3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices
In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):
(a) You may select only one price election and coverage level for each insured crop (citrus fruit group designated in the Special Provisions) that you elect to insure.
(1) The price election you choose for each insured crop (citrus fruit group) need not bear the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each insured crop (citrus fruit group). For example, if you choose one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum price election for one insured crop (citrus fruit group) (
e.g.,
the citrus fruit group for early and midseason oranges), you may choose seventy-five percent (75%) of the maximum price election for another insured crop (citrus fruit group) (
e.g.,
the citrus fruit group for late oranges).
(2) If separate price elections are available by commodity type or intended use within an insured crop (citrus fruit group), the price elections you choose within the insured crop (citrus fruit group) must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each other commodity type or intended use within the insured crop (citrus fruit group). For example, if separate price elections are available for commodity type ruby red grapefruit with an intended use of fresh, and commodity type ruby red grapefruit with an intended use of juice, and you choose one hundred percent (100%) of the price election for commodity type ruby red grapefruit with an intended use of fresh, you must also choose one hundred percent (100%) of the price election for commodity type ruby red grapefruit with an intended use of juice.
(b) The production guarantee per acre is progressive by stage and increases from the first stage production guarantee to the second stage production guarantee. The stages are as follows:
(1) The first stage extends from the date insurance attaches through April 30 of the calendar year of normal bloom.
(2) The second stage extends from May 1 of the calendar year of normal bloom until the end of the insurance period.
(c) Any acreage of citrus damaged in the first stage to the extent that the majority of producers in the area would not further maintain it will be limited to the first stage production guarantee even though you may continue to maintain it.
(d) In addition to the reported production, each crop year you must report by commodity type and intended use:
(1) The number of trees damaged, topped, hedged, pruned or removed; any change in practices or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the
yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based; and the number of affected acres;
(2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;
(3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another agricultural commodity and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:
(i) The age of the interplanted agricultural commodity and commodity type, if applicable;
(ii) The planting pattern; and
(iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.
(e) We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee, as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels. Examples of these circumstances that may reduce yield may include, but are not limited to: Interplanted agricultural commodities; removal, topping, hedging, or pruning of trees; damage; and change in practices. If the circumstance occurred:
(1) Before the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year regardless of whether the circumstance was due to an insured or uninsured cause of loss;
(2) After the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year only if the potential reduction in the yield used to establish your production guarantee is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or
(3) Before or after the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, an amount equal to the reduction in the yield will be added to the production to count calculated in section 12(c) of these Crop Provisions due to uninsured causes. We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee for the subsequent crop year to reflect any reduction in the productive capacity of the trees or in the yield potential of the insured acreage.
(f) Your approved yield will be determined in accordance with sections 3 and 5 of the Basic Provisions.
(g) Instead of reporting your production for the current crop year, as required by section 3(f)(1) of the Basic Provisions, there is a lag year and you are required to report production from two crop years ago by the production reporting date,
e.g.,
2023 crop year production must be reported by the production reporting date for the 2025 crop year.

# 4. Contract Changes
In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date.

# 5. Cancellation and Termination Dates
In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the cancellation and termination dates are November 20.

# 6. Annual Premium
In lieu of the premium computation method in section 7 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the annual premium amount is computed by multiplying the second stage production guarantee per acre by the price election, the premium rate, the insured acreage, your share at the time coverage begins, and by any applicable premium adjustment percentages contained in the Special Provisions.

# 7. Insured Crop
(a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the insured crop will be each citrus fruit group you elect to insure and for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
(1) In which you have a share;
(2) That is grown on trees adapted to the area;
(3) That is irrigated;
(4) That has produced an average yield of at least three tons per acre the crop year from two years prior reported in accordance with section 3(g), or we have appraised the yield potential of at least three tons per acre;
(5) That is grown in a grove that, if inspected, is considered acceptable by us; and
(6) That is not sold by direct marketing, unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement.
(b) For each insured crop (citrus fruit group), administrative fees will be assessed in accordance with section 6 of the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement and section 7 of the Basic Provisions.

# 8. Insurable Acreage
In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance attaching to an insured crop interplanted with another agricultural commodity, interplanted acreage is uninsurable, except a citrus fruit group interplanted with another perennial agricultural commodity is insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

# 9. Insurance Period
(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):
(1) Coverage begins on November 21 of each crop year, except that for the year of application, if your application is received after November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period that begins when the application is received by us and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the insured crop (citrus fruit group) or to determine the condition of the grove.
(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is the second May 31st of the crop year.
(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8):
(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of citrus on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium will be due, and no indemnity paid for such acreage for that crop year unless:
(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

# 10. Causes of Loss
(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
(1) Excess rain;
(2) Excess wind;
(3) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;
(4) Freeze;
(5) Hail;
(6) Tornado;
(7) Wildlife;
(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply if caused by an insured peril or drought that occurs during the insurance period; or
(9) Insects and plant disease, unless excluded or otherwise restricted through the Special Provisions, provided the loss of production is not due to damage resulting from insufficient or improper application of control measures as recommended by agricultural experts.
(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to the inability to market the citrus for any reason other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause of loss specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.

# 11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss
(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must leave representative samples. In lieu of the requirements of section 14(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions, we will determine which trees must remain unharvested so that we may inspect them in accordance with FCIC procedures.
(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions (§ 457.8), the following will apply:
(1) If the Special Provisions permit or a written agreement authorizing direct marketing exists, you must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be harvested for direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be harvested for direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
(2) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or within 24 hours if damage is discovered during harvest, so we may have an opportunity to inspect the unit. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.

# 12. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide acceptable production records:
(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or
(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim on a unit basis by:
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each combination of commodity type and intended use by its respective production guarantee;
(2) Multiplying the results of section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election for each combination of commodity type and intended use;
(3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2);
(4) Multiplying the total production to count of each combination of commodity type and intended use (see section 12(c)) by the respective price election;
(5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4);
(6) Subtracting this result of section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3); and
(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.
(c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
(D) From which production is sold by direct marketing, if direct marketing is specifically permitted by the Special Provisions or a written agreement, and you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 11;
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production; and
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the insured crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the insured crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the insured crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and
(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
(d) Any citrus fruit insured with an intended use of juice that is not marketed as fresh fruit and, due to insurable causes, does not contain 120 or more gallons of juice per ton, will be adjusted by:
(1) Dividing the gallons of juice per ton obtained from the damaged citrus by 120; and
(2) Multiplying the result by the number of tons of such citrus.
If individual records of juice content are not available, an average juice content from the nearest juice plant will be used, if available. If not available, a field appraisal will be made to determine the average juice content.
(e) Any citrus fruit insured with an intended use of fresh that is not marketable as fresh fruit due to insurable causes will be adjusted by multiplying the number of tons of such citrus fruit by the applicable Fresh Fruit Factor contained in the actuarial documents.
(f) Any production will be considered marketed or marketable as fresh fruit unless, due solely to insured causes, such production was not marketed as fresh fruit.
(g) In the absence of acceptable records of disposition of harvested citrus fruit, the disposition and amount of production to count for the unit will be the guarantee on the unit.
(h) Any citrus fruit on the ground that is not harvested will be considered totally lost if damaged by an insured cause.

# 13. Late and Prevented Planting
The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.

(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial agricultural commodity and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:
(i) The age of the interplanted agricultural commodity and commodity type, if applicable;
(ii) The planting pattern; and
(iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.
(d) We will reduce the approved yield, as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of any circumstance listed in section 3(c) that may reduce your yields from previous levels. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your approved yield at any time we become aware of the circumstance. If the circumstance occurred:
(1) Before the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the approved yield will be reduced for the current crop year regardless of whether the circumstance was due to an insured or uninsured cause of loss;
(2) After the beginning of the insurance period and you notify us by the production reporting date, the approved yield will be reduced for the current crop year only if the potential reduction in the approved yield is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or
(3) Before or after the beginning of the insurance period and you fail to notify us by the production reporting date, an amount equal to the reduction in the approved yield will be added to the production to count calculated in section 11(c)(1)(ii) due to uninsured causes. We will reduce your approved yield for the subsequent crop year to reflect any reduction in the productive capacity of the trees or in the yield potential of the insured acreage.

# 4. Contract Changes
In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date.

# 5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

(b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:
(1) If the Special Provisions permit or a written agreement authorizing direct marketing exists, you must notify us at least 15 days before any production from any unit will be harvested for direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be harvested for direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
(2) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest or immediately if damage is discovered during harvest so that we may have an opportunity to inspect unharvested trees. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged insured crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.

# 11. Settlement of Claim
(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide acceptable production records:
(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or
(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:
(1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each commodity type by its respective production guarantee;
(2) Multiplying the results of section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election for each commodity type;
(3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);
(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each commodity type (see section 11(c)), by the respective price election;
(5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);
(6) Subtracting this result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of section 11(b)(3); and
(7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share;
(c) The total production to count (in cartons) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
(1) All appraised production as follows:
(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
(A) That is abandoned;
(B) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
(D) From which production is sold by direct marketing, if direct marketing is specifically permitted by the Special Provisions or a written agreement, and you fail to meet the requirements contained in section 10;
(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
(iii) Unharvested production determined to be marketable as fresh packed fruit; and
(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the insured crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the insured crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the insured crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count;
(2) All harvested production marketed as fresh packed fruit from the insurable acreage; and
(3) All citrus that was disposed of or sold without an inspection or written consent.
(d) Any production will be considered marketed or marketable as fresh packed fruit unless, due solely to insured causes, such production was not marketed or marketable as fresh packed fruit.
(e) Citrus that cannot be marketed as fresh packed fruit due to insurable causes will not be considered production to count.
(f) If you elect the frost protection option and we determine that frost protection equipment, as specified in the Special Provisions, was not properly utilized or not properly reported, the indemnity for the unit will be reduced by the percentage of premium reduction allowed for frost protection equipment. You must, at our request, provide us records showing the start-stop times by date for each period the frost protection equipment was used.
