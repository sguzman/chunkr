refers to title 40, part 63, section 600.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# INQUIRIES
For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd-numbered pages.

§ 63.601
Definitions.
Terms used in this subpart are defined in § 63.2 of the Clean Air Act and in this section as follows:
Active gypsum dewatering stack
means a gypsum dewatering stack that is currently receiving gypsum, received gypsum within the last year, or is part of the facility's water management system. A gypsum dewatering stack that is considered closed by a state authority is not considered an active gypsum dewatering stack.
Breakthrough
means the point in time when the level of mercury detected at the outlet of an adsorber system is 90 percent of the highest concentration allowed to be discharged consistent with the applicable emission limit.
Cooling pond
means a natural or artificial open reservoir that is primarily used to collect and cool water that comes into direct contact with raw materials, intermediate products, by-products, waste products, or finished products from a phosphoric acid manufacturing plant. The water in the cooling pond is often used at phosphoric acid manufacturing plants as filter wash water, absorber water for air pollution control absorbers, and/or to transport phosphogypsum as slurry to a gypsum dewatering stack(s).
Equivalent P
2
O
5
feed
means the quantity of phosphorus, expressed as phosphorus pentoxide (P
2
O
5
), fed to the process.
Evaporative cooling tower
means an open-water, re-circulating device that uses fans or natural draft to draw or force ambient air through the device to remove heat from process water by direct contact.
Exceedance
means a departure from an indicator range established for monitoring under this subpart, consistent with any averaging period specified for averaging the results of the monitoring.
Existing source
depends on the date that construction or reconstruction of an affected source commenced. A wet-process phosphoric acid process line, superphosphoric acid process line, phosphate rock dryer, phosphate rock calciner, evaporative cooling tower, or purified acid process line is an existing source if construction or reconstruction of the affected source commenced on or before December 27, 1996. A gypsum dewatering stack or cooling pond is an existing source if it meets one of two criteria:
(1) It was constructed or reconstructed on or before August 19, 2015; or
(2) It was constructed or reconstructed after August 19, 2015 and it was not required to obtain a permit by a state authority for the construction or reconstruction.
Gypsum dewatering stack
means any defined geographic area associated with a phosphoric acid manufacturing plant in which gypsum is disposed of or stored, other than within a fully enclosed building, container, or tank.
Gypsum dewatering stack system
means the gypsum dewatering stack, together with all pumps, piping, ditches, drainage conveyances, water control structures, collection pools, cooling ponds, surge ponds, auxiliary holding ponds, regional holding ponds and any other collection or conveyance system associated with the transport of gypsum from the plant to the gypsum dewatering stack, its management at the gypsum dewatering stack, and the process wastewater return to the phosphoric acid production or other process.
HAP metals
mean those metals and their compounds (in particulate or volatile form) that are included on the list of hazardous air pollutants in section 112 of the Clean Air Act. HAP metals include, but are not limited to: Antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, nickel, and selenium expressed as particulate matter as measured by the methods and procedures in this subpart or an approved alternative method. For the purposes of this subpart, HAP metals (except mercury) are expressed as particulate matter as measured by Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3.
New source
depends on the date that construction or reconstruction of an affected source commences. A wet-process phosphoric acid process line, superphosphoric acid process line, phosphate rock dryer, phosphate rock calciner, evaporative cooling tower, or
purified acid process line is a new source if construction or reconstruction of the affected source commenced after December 27, 1996. A gypsum dewatering stack or cooling pond is a new source if it meets two criteria:
(1) It was constructed or reconstructed after August 19, 2015; and
(2) It was required to obtain a permit by a state authority for the construction or reconstruction.
Oxidation reactor
means any equipment or step that uses an oxidizing agent (
e.g.,
nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, or potassium permanganate) to treat superphosphoric acid.
Phosphate rock calciner
means the equipment used to remove moisture and organic matter from phosphate rock through direct or indirect heating.
Phosphate rock dryer
means the equipment used to reduce the moisture content of phosphate rock through direct or indirect heating.
Phosphate rock feed
means all material entering any phosphate rock dryer or phosphate rock calciner including moisture and extraneous material as well as the following ore materials: Fluorapatite, hydroxylapatite, chlorapatite, and carbonateapatite.
Purified phosphoric acid process line
means any process line that uses a HAP as a solvent in the separation of impurities from the product acid for the purposes of rendering that product suitable for industrial, manufacturing, or food grade uses. A purified phosphoric acid process line includes: solvent extraction process equipment, solvent stripping and recovery equipment, seal tanks, carbon treatment equipment, cooling towers, storage tanks, pumps, and process piping.
Raffinate stream
means the aqueous stream containing the impurities that are removed during the purification of wet-process phosphoric acid using solvent extraction.
Research and development facility
means research or laboratory operations whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products, where the operations are under the close supervision of technically trained personnel, and where the facility is not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce or other off-site distribution, except in a de minimis manner.
Rim ditch (cell) building technique
means a gypsum dewatering stack construction technique that utilizes inner and outer dikes to direct gypsum slurry flow around the perimeter of the stack before directing the flow and allowing settling of finer materials into the settling compartment. For the purpose of this definition, the rim ditch (cell) building technique includes the compartment startup phase when gypsum is deposited directly into the settling compartment in preparation for ditch construction as well as the step-in or terminal phases when most solids must be directed to the settling compartment prior to stack closure. Decant return ditches are not rim ditches.
Shutdown
commences when feed materials cease to be added to an affected source and ends when the affected source is deactivated, regardless of whether feed material is present in the affected source.
Startup
commences when any feed material is first introduced into an affected source and ends when feed material is fully loaded into the affected source.
Superphosphoric acid process line
means any process line that concentrates wet-process phosphoric acid to 66 percent or greater P
2
O
5
content by weight. A superphosphoric acid process line includes: evaporators, hot wells, acid sumps, oxidation reactors, and cooling tanks.

feed by determining the total mass rate, in metric ton/hour of phosphorus bearing feed, using the monitoring system specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the procedures specified in § 63.606(f)(3).
(b) For each phosphate rock dryer or phosphate rock calciner subject to the
provisions of this subpart, you must comply with the monitoring requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CMS according to your site-specific monitoring plan specified in § 63.608(c). The CMS must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over its operating range and must determine and permanently record either:
(i) The mass flow of phosphorus-bearing feed material to the phosphate rock dryer or calciner, or
(ii) The mass flow of product from the phosphate rock dryer or calciner.
(2) Maintain the records specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) If you monitor the mass flow of phosphorus-bearing feed material to the phosphate rock dryer or calciner as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, maintain a daily record of phosphate rock feed by determining the total mass rate in metric tons/hour of phosphorus-bearing feed.
(ii) If you monitor the mass flow of product from the phosphate rock dryer or calciner as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, maintain a daily record of product by determining the total mass rate in metric ton/hour of product.

(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CMS according to your site-specific monitoring plan specified in § 63.608(c). The CMS must continuously measure and permanently record the stack gas exit temperature for each chiller stack.
(2) Measure and record the concentration of methyl isobutyl ketone in each product acid stream and each raffinate stream once each day.
(d) If you use a control device(s) to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart, you must install a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You must monitor the operating parameter(s) applicable to the control device that you use as specified in Table 3 to this subpart and establish the applicable limit or range for the operating parameter limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, determine the value(s) as the arithmetic average of operating parameter measurements recorded during the three test runs conducted for the most recent performance test.
(ii) If you use an absorber or a wet electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and you monitor pressure drop across the absorber or secondary voltage for a wet electrostatic precipitator, you must establish allowable ranges using the methodology specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
(A) The allowable range for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber and of the flow rate of the absorber liquid to each absorber in the process absorbing system, or secondary voltage for a wet electrostatic precipitator, is ±20 percent of the baseline average value determined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. The Administrator retains the right to reduce the ±20 percent adjustment to the baseline average values of operating ranges in those instances where performance test results indicate that a source's level of emissions is near the value of an applicable emissions standard. However, the adjustment must not be reduced to less than ±10 percent under any instance.
(B) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, you may establish allowable ranges for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber, or secondary voltage for an electrostatic precipitator, for the purpose of assuring compliance with this subpart using the procedures described in this paragraph. You must establish the allowable ranges based on the baseline average values recorded during previous performance tests, or the results of performance tests conducted specifically for the purposes of this paragraph. You must conduct all performance tests using the methods specified in § 63.606. You must certify that the control devices and processes have
not been modified since the date of the performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph is retested, you must determine new allowable ranges of baseline average values unless the retest indicates no change in the operating parameters outside the previously established ranges.
(2) You must monitor, record, and demonstrate continuous compliance using the minimum frequencies specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
(3) You must comply with the calibration and quality control requirements that are applicable to the operating parameter(s) you monitor as specified in Table 5 to this subpart.

(5) If you use a sorbent injection system to achieve the mercury emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and you use a fabric filter to collect the associated particulate matter, the system must meet the requirements for fabric filters specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
(e) If you use a non-regenerative adsorption system to achieve the mercury emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) Determine the adsorber bed life (
i.e.,
the expected life of the sorbent in the adsorption system) using the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) If the adsorber bed is expected (designed) to have a life of less than 2 years, determine the outlet concentration of mercury on a quarterly basis until breakthrough occurs for the first three adsorber bed change-outs. The adsorber bed life shall equal the average length of time between each of the three change-outs.
(ii) If the adsorber bed is expected (designed) to have a life of 2 years or greater, determine the outlet concentration of mercury on a semi-annual basis until breakthrough occurs for the first two adsorber bed change-outs. The adsorber bed life must equal the average length of time between each of the two change-outs.
(iii) If more than one adsorber is operated in parallel, or there are several identical operating lines controlled by adsorbers, you may determine the adsorber bed life by measuring the outlet concentration of mercury from one of the adsorbers or adsorber systems rather than determining the bed life for each adsorber.
(iv) The adsorber or adsorber system you select for the adsorber bed life test must have the highest expected inlet gas mercury concentration and the highest operating rate of any adsorber in operation at the affected source. During the test to determine adsorber bed life, you must use the fuel that contains the highest level of mercury in any fuel-burning unit associated with the adsorption system being tested.
(2) You must replace the sorbent in each adsorber on or before the end of the adsorbent bed life, calculated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(3) You must re-establish the adsorber bed life if the sorbent is replaced with a different brand or type, or if any process changes are made that would lead to a shorter bed lifetime.
(f) Beginning August 19, 2016, if you use a fabric filter system to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, then the fabric filter must be equipped with a bag leak detection system that is installed, calibrated, maintained, and continuously operated according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (10) of this section.
(1) Install a bag leak detection sensor(s) in a position(s) that will be representative of the relative or absolute particulate matter loadings for each exhaust stack, roof vent, or compartment (
e.g.,
for a positive-pressure fabric filter) of the fabric filter.
(2) Use a bag leak detection system certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic feet) or less.
(3) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the system sensor.
(4) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a system that will trigger an alarm when an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located such that the alert is observed readily by plant operating personnel.
(5) Install a bag leak detection system in each compartment or cell for positive-pressure fabric filter systems that do not duct all compartments or cells to a common stack. Install a bag leak detector downstream of the fabric filter if a negative-pressure or induced-air filter system is used. If multiple bag leak detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
(6) Calibration of the bag leak detection system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output level by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.
(7) After initial adjustment, you must not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time except as established in your site-specific monitoring plan required in § 63.608(c). In no event may the sensitivity be increased more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete inspection of the fabric filter system that demonstrates that the system is in good operating condition.
(8) Operate and maintain each fabric filter and bag leak detection system such that the alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. If the alarm sounds more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period, it is considered an operating parameter exceedance. Calculate the alarm time (
i.e.,
time that the alarm sounds) as specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that corrective action is not required, the alarm duration is not counted in the alarm time calculation.
(ii) If corrective action is required, each alarm time is counted as a minimum of 1 hour.
(iii) If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, each alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.
(9) If the alarm on a bag leak detection system is triggered, you must initiate procedures within 1 hour of an alarm to identify the cause of the alarm and then initiate corrective action, as specified in § 63.608(d)(2), no later than 48 hours after an alarm. Failure to take these actions within the prescribed time periods is considered a violation.
(10) Retain records of any bag leak detection system alarm, including the date, time, duration, and the percent of the total operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm sounds, with a brief explanation of the cause of the alarm, the corrective action taken, and the schedule and duration of the corrective action.
(g) If you choose to directly monitor mercury emissions instead of using CPMS as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, then you must install and operate a mercury CEMS in accordance with Performance Specification 12A of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, or a sorbent trap-based integrated monitoring system in accordance with Performance Specification 12B of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. You must continuously monitor mercury emissions as specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) The span value for any mercury CEMS must include the intended upper limit of the mercury concentration measurement range during normal operation, which may be exceeded during other short-term conditions lasting less than 24 consecutive operating hours. However, the span should be at least equivalent to approximately two times the emissions standard. You may round the span value to the nearest multiple of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of total mercury.
(2) You must operate and maintain each mercury CEMS or sorbent trap-based integrated monitoring system
according to the quality assurance requirements specified in Procedure 5 of appendix F to part 60 of this chapter.
(3) You must conduct relative accuracy testing of mercury monitoring systems, as specified in Performance Specification 12A, Performance Specification 12B, or Procedure 5 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, at normal operating conditions.
(4) If you use a mercury CEMS, you must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the exhaust gas flow rate to the atmosphere according to your site-specific monitoring plan specified in § 63.608(c).

Where:
E = Emission rate of particulate matter, kilogram/megagram (pound/ton) of phosphate rock feed.
C = Concentration of particulate matter, gram/dry standard cubic meter (gram/dry standard cubic feet).
Q = Volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dry standard cubic meter/hour (dry standard cubic feet/hour).
P = Phosphate rock feed rate, megagram/hour (ton/hour).

(2) Use Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 to determine the particulate matter concentration (C) and volumetric flow rate (Q) of the effluent gas. Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this section, the sampling time and sample volume for each run must be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dry standard cubic meter (30 dry standard cubic feet).
(3) Use the CMS described in § 63.605(b) to determine the phosphate rock feed rate (P) for each run.
(h) To demonstrate compliance with the particulate matter standards for phosphate rock calciners specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart, you must use Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 to determine the particulate matter concentration. The sampling volume for each test run must be at least 1.70 dry standard cubic meter.
(i) To demonstrate compliance with the mercury emission standards for phosphate rock calciners specified in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart, you must use Method 30B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8 to determine the mercury concentration, unless you use a CEMS to demonstrate compliance. If you use a non-regenerative adsorber to control mercury emissions, you must use this test method to determine the expected bed life as specified in § 63.605(e)(1).
(j) If you choose to monitor the mass flow of product from the phosphate rock dryer or calciner as specified in § 63.605(b)(1)(ii), you must either:
(1) Simultaneously monitor the feed rate and output rate of the phosphate rock dryer or calciner during the performance test, or
(2) Monitor the output rate and the input and output moisture contents of the phosphate rock dryer or calciner during the performance test and calculate the corresponding phosphate rock dryer or calciner input rate.
(k) For sorbent injection systems, you must conduct the performance test at the outlet of the fabric filter used for sorbent collection. You must monitor and record operating parameter values for the fabric filter during the performance test. If the sorbent is replaced with a different brand or type of sorbent than was used during the performance test, you must conduct a new performance test.
(l) If you use a mercury CEMS as specified in § 63.605(g), or paragraph (i) of this section, you must demonstrate initial compliance based on the first 30 operating days during which you operate the affected source using a CEMS. You must obtain hourly mercury concentration and stack gas volumetric flow rate data.
(m) If you use a CMS, you must conduct a performance evaluation, as specified in § 63.8(e), in accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan in § 63.608(c).

In the notification of compliance status, you must also:
(i) Certify to the Administrator annually that you have complied with the evaporative cooling tower requirements specified in § 63.602(c).
(ii) Submit analyses and supporting documentation demonstrating conformance with the Office Of Air Quality Planning And Standards (OAQPS), Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and specifications for bag leak detection systems as part of the notification of compliance status report.
(iii) Submit the gypsum dewatering stack and cooling pond management plan specified in § 63.602(e).
(iv) If you elect to demonstrate compliance by following the procedures in § 63.605(d)(1)(ii)(B), certify to the Administrator annually that the control devices and processes have not been modified since the date of the performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges.
(v) Each time a gypsum dewatering stack is closed, certify to the Administrator within 90 days of closure, that the final cover of the closed gypsum dewatering stack is a drought resistant vegetative cover that includes a barrier soil layer that will sustain vegetation.
(3) As required by § 63.10(e)(3), you must submit an excess emissions report for any exceedance of an emission limit, work practice standard, or operating parameter limit if the total duration of the exceedances for the reporting period is 1 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period or greater. The report must contain the information specified in § 63.10 and paragraph (b)(4) of this section. When exceedances of an emission limit or operating parameter have not occurred, you must include such information in the report. You must submit the report semiannually and the report must be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of the calendar half. If you report exceedances, you must submit the excess emissions report quarterly until a request to reduce reporting frequency is approved as described in § 63.10(e)(3)(ii).
(4) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record and report the following information for each failure:
(i) The date, time and duration of the failure.
(ii) A list of the affected sources or equipment for which a failure occurred.
(iii) An estimate of the volume of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit.
(iv) A description of the method used to estimate the emissions.
(v) A record of actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.608(b), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.
(5) You must submit a summary report containing the information specified in § 63.10(e)(3)(vi). You must submit the summary report semiannually and the report must be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of the calendar half.
(c) Your records must be in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review. You must keep each record for 5 years following the date of each recorded action. You must keep each record on site, or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that instantly provides access at the site, for at least 2 years
after the date of each recorded action. You may keep the records off site for the remaining 3 years.
(d) In computing averages to determine compliance with this subpart, you must exclude the monitoring data specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Periods of non-operation of the process unit;
(2) Periods of no flow to a control device; and any monitoring data recorded during CEMS or continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) breakdowns, out-of-control periods, repairs, maintenance periods, instrument adjustments or checks to maintain precision and accuracy, calibration checks, and zero (low-level), mid-level (if applicable), and high-level adjustments.
(e) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 63.2) required by this subpart, you must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, following the procedure specified in either paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) For data collected using test methods supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed on the EPA's ERT Web site (
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html
), you must submit the results of the performance test to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). CEDRI can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
http://cdx.epa.gov/epa_home.asp
). Performance test data must be submitted in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT. Alternatively, you may submit performance test data in an electronic file format consistent with the extensible markup language (XML) schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site once the XML schema is available. If you claim that some of the performance test information being submitted is confidential business information (CBI), you must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703.

§ 63.608
General requirements and applicability of general provisions of this part.
(a) You must comply with the general provisions in subpart A of this part as specified in appendix A to this subpart.
(b) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by this standard have been achieved. Determination by the Administrator of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(c) For each CMS (including CEMS or CPMS) used to demonstrate compliance with any applicable emission limit or work practice, you must develop, and submit to the Administrator for approval upon request, a site-specific monitoring plan according to the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. You must submit the site-specific monitoring plan, if requested by the Administrator, at least 60 days before the initial performance evaluation of the CMS. The requirements of this paragraph also apply if a petition is made to the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters under § 63.8(f).
(1) You must include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section in the site-specific monitoring plan.
(i) Location of the CMS sampling probe or other interface. You must include a justification demonstrating that the sampling probe or other interface is at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (
e.g.,
on or downstream of the last control device).
(ii) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction systems.
(iii) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (
e.g.,
calibrations).
(iv) Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(c)(1)(ii), (c)(3), (c)(4)(ii), and Table 4 to this subpart.
(v) Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(d)(1) and (2) and Table 5 to this subpart.
(vi) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).
(2) You must include a schedule for conducting initial and subsequent performance evaluations in the site-specific monitoring plan.
(3) You must keep the site-specific monitoring plan on site for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If you revise the site-specific monitoring plan, you must keep previous (
i.e.,
superseded) versions of the plan on site to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. You must include the program of corrective action required under § 63.8(d)(2) in the plan.
(d) For each bag leak detection system installed to comply with the requirements specified in § 63.605(f), you must include the information specified
in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(1) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (
e.g.,
calibrations), including how the alarm set point will be established.
(2) A corrective action plan describing corrective actions to be taken and the timing of those actions when the bag leak detection alarm sounds. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the actions specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(i) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other conditions that may cause an increase in regulated material emissions.
(ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
(iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device.
(iv) Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment.
(v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system.
(vi) Shutting down the process controlled by the fabric filter.
(e) If you use blower design capacity to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section calculations showing how you determined the maximum possible gas flow rate through the absorber based on the blower's specifications (including any adjustments you made for pressure drop).
(f) If you use a regression model to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section the calculations that were used to develop the regression model, including the calculations you use to convert amperage of the blower to brake horsepower. You must describe any constants included in the equations (e.g., efficiency, power factor), and describe how these constants were determined. If you want to change a constant in your calculation, then you must conduct a regression model verification to confirm the new value of the constant. In addition, the site-specific monitoring plan must be updated annually to reflect the data used in the annual regression model verification that is described in Table 3 to this subpart.

Absorbers (Wet Scrubbers)
Install a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) for liquid flow at the inlet of the absorber
Your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or more; and you choose to monitor only the influent liquid flow, rather than the liquid-to-gas ratio
Influent liquid flow
Install CPMS for liquid and gas flow at the inlet of the absorber
b
Your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less; or
Your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or more, and you choose to monitor the liquid-to-gas ratio, rather than only the influent liquid flow, and you want the ability to lower liquid flow with changes in gas flow
Liquid-to-gas ratio as determined by dividing the influent liquid flow rate by the gas flow rate through the absorber. The units of measure must be consistent with those used to calculate this ratio during the performance test
You must determine the gas flow rate through the absorber by:
Measuring the gas flow rate at the absorber inlet or outlet;
Using the blower design capacity, with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop;
c
or
Using a regression model.
d
Install CPMS for pressure at the gas stream inlet and outlet of the absorber
Your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or more
Pressure drop through the absorber
You may measure the pressure of the inlet gas using amperage on the blower if a correlation between pressure and amperage is established
Sorbent Injection
Install a CPMS for flow rate
Sorbent injection rate
Install a CPMS for flow rate
Sorbent injection carrier gas flow rate

To monitor an operating parameter that is not specified in this table (including process-specific techniques not specified in this table to determine gas flow rate through an absorber), you must request, on a site-specific basis, an alternative monitoring method under the provisions of 40 CFR 63.8(f).
b
For new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after August 19, 2015, the compliance date is immediately upon startup. For existing sources, and new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996, and on or before August 19, 2015, if your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less, then the compliance date is August 19, 2018. In the interim, for existing sources, and new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996, and on or before August 19, 2015, with an absorber designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less, you must comply with one of the following: (i) The monitoring requirements in this Table 3 for absorbers designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less; (ii) the applicable monitoring provisions included in a permit issued under 40 CFR part 70 to assure compliance with subpart AA; (iii) the applicable monitoring provisions of an Alternative Monitoring Plan approved pursuant to § 63.8(f); or (iv) install CPMS for pressure at the gas stream inlet and outlet of the absorber, and monitor pressure drop through the absorber.
c
If you select this option, then you must comply with § 63.608(e). The option to use blower design capacity is intended to establish the maximum possible gas flow through the absorber; and is available regardless of the location of the blower (influent or effluent), as long as the gas flow rate through the absorber can be established. Establish the minimum liquid-to-gas ratio operating limit by dividing the minimum liquid flow rate to the absorber (determined during a performance test) by the maximum possible gas flow rate through the absorber (determined using blower design capacity).
d
If you select this option, then you must comply with § 63.608(f). The regression model must be developed using direct measurements of gas flow rate, and design fan curves that correlate gas flow rate to static pressure (
i.e.,
fan suction pressure) and brake horsepower of the blower. You must conduct an annual regression model verification using direct measurements of gas flow rate to ensure the correlation remains accurate. Direct measurements of gas flow rate used to develop or verify regression models may be collected during, or separately from, the annual performance testing that is required in § 63.606(b).

§ 63.624
[Reserved]
§ 63.625
Operating and monitoring requirements.
(a) For each phosphate fertilizer process line (
e.g.,
diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line), or granular triple superphosphate process line subject to the provisions of this subpart, you must comply with the monitoring requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system (CMS) according to your site-specific monitoring plan specified in § 63.628(c). The CMS must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over its operating range and must determine and permanently record the mass flow of phosphorus-bearing material fed to the process.
(2) Maintain a daily record of equivalent P
2
O
5
feed. Calculate the equivalent P
2
O
5
feed by determining the total mass rate in metric ton/hour of phosphorus bearing feed using the procedures specified in § 63.626(f)(3).
(b) For each granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart, you must maintain an accurate record of the mass of granular triple superphosphate in storage to permit the determination of the amount of equivalent P
2
O
5
stored.
(c) For each granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Maintain a daily record of total equivalent P
2
O
5
stored by multiplying the percentage P
2
O
5
content, as determined by § 63.626(f)(3)(ii), by the total mass of granular triple superphosphate stored as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) Develop for approval by the Administrator a site-specific methodology including sufficient recordkeeping for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with § 63.622(b).
(d) If you use a control device(s) to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart, you must install a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) You must monitor the operating parameter(s) applicable to the control device that you use as specified in Table 3 to this subpart and establish the applicable limit or range for the operating parameter limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, determine the value(s) as the arithmetic average of operating parameter measurements recorded during the three test runs conducted for the most recent performance test.
(ii) If you use an absorber to comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and you monitor pressure drop across the absorber, you must establish allowable ranges using the methodology specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
(A) The allowable range for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber and of the flow rate of the absorber liquid to each absorber in the process absorbing system, or secondary voltage for a wet electrostatic precipitator, is ±20 percent of the baseline average value determined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. The Administrator retains the right to reduce the ±20 percent adjustment to the baseline average values of operating ranges in those instances where performance test results indicate that a source's level of emissions is near the value of an applicable emissions standard. However, the
adjustment must not be reduced to less than ±10 percent under any instance.
(B) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, you may establish allowable ranges for the daily averages of the pressure drop across an absorber for the purpose of assuring compliance with this subpart using the procedures described in this paragraph. You must establish the allowable ranges based on the baseline average values recorded during previous performance tests or the results of performance tests conducted specifically for the purposes of this paragraph. You must conduct all performance tests using the methods specified in § 63.626. You must certify that the control devices and processes have not been modified since the date of the performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph is retested, you must determine new allowable ranges of baseline average values unless the retest indicates no change in the operating parameters outside the previously established ranges.
(2) You must monitor, record, and demonstrate continuous compliance using the minimum frequencies specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
(3) You must comply with the calibration and quality control requirements that are applicable to the operating parameter(s) you monitor as specified in Table 5 to this subpart.
(4) If you use a fabric filter system to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, the system must meet the requirements for fabric filters specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
(e) Beginning August 19, 2016, if you use a fabric filter system to comply with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, then the fabric filter must be equipped with a bag leak detection system that is installed, calibrated, maintained and continuously operated according to the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (10) of this section.
(1) Install a bag leak detection sensor(s) in a position(s) that will be representative of the relative or absolute particulate matter loadings for each exhaust stack, roof vent, or compartment (
e.g.,
for a positive-pressure fabric filter) of the fabric filter.
(2) Use a bag leak detection system certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic feet) or less.
(3) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the system sensor.
(4) Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a system that will trigger an alarm when an increase in relative particulate material emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located such that the alert is observed readily by plant operating personnel.
(5) Install a bag leak detection system in each compartment or cell for positive-pressure fabric filter systems that do not duct all compartments or cells to a common stack. Install a bag leak detector downstream of the fabric filter if a negative-pressure or induced-air filter is used. If multiple bag leak detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
(6) Calibration of the bag leak detection system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output level by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.
(7) After initial adjustment, you must not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points or alarm delay time, except as established in your site-specific monitoring plan required in § 63.628(c). In no event may the sensitivity be increased more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete inspection of the fabric filter system that demonstrates that the system is in good operating condition.
(8) Operate and maintain each fabric filter and bag leak detection system such that the alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. If the alarm sounds more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month
period, it is considered an operating parameter exceedance. Calculate the alarm time (
i.e.,
time that the alarm sounds) as specified in paragraphs (e)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that corrective action is not required, the alarm duration is not counted in the alarm time calculation.
(ii) If corrective action is required, each alarm time is counted as a minimum of 1 hour.
(iii) If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, each alarm time (
i.e.,
time that the alarm sounds) is counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.
(9) If the alarm on a bag leak detection system is triggered, you must initiate procedures within 1 hour of an alarm to identify the cause of the alarm and then initiate corrective action, as specified in § 63.628(d)(2), no later than 48 hours after an alarm. Failure to take these actions within the prescribed time periods is considered a violation.
(10) Retain records of any bag leak detection system alarm, including the date, time, duration, and the percent of the total operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm triggers, with a brief explanation of the cause of the alarm, the corrective action taken, and the schedule and duration of the corrective action.

§ 63.627
Notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
(a) You must comply with the notification requirements specified in § 63.9. During the most recent performance test, if you demonstrate compliance with the emission limit while operating your control device outside the previously established operating limit, you must establish a new operating limit based on that most recent performance test and notify the Administrator that the operating limit changed based on data collected during the most recent performance test. When a source is retested and the performance test results are submitted to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, § 63.7(g)(1), or § 63.10(d)(2), you must indicate whether the operating limit is based on the new performance test or the previously established limit. Upon establishment of a new operating limit, you must thereafter operate under the new operating limit. If the Administrator determines that you did not conduct the compliance test in accordance with the applicable requirements or that the operating limit established during the performance test does not correspond to representative (normal) conditions, you must conduct a new performance test and establish a new operating limit.
(b) You must comply with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in § 63.10 as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You must comply with the general recordkeeping requirements in § 63.10(b)(1); and
(2) As required by § 63.10(d), you must report the results of the initial and subsequent performance tests as part of the notification of compliance status required in § 63.9(h). You must verify in the performance test reports that the operating limits for each process have not changed or provide documentation of revised operating limits established according to § 63.625, as applicable. In the notification of compliance status, you must also:
(i) Certify to the Administrator that you have not shipped fresh granular triple superphosphate from an affected facility.
(ii) Certify to the Administrator annually that you have complied with the evaporative cooling tower requirements specified in § 63.622(c).
(iii) Submit analyses and supporting documentation demonstrating conformance with the Office Of Air Quality Planning And Standards (OAQPS), Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) and specifications for bag leak detection systems as part of the notification of compliance status report.
(iv) If you elect to demonstrate compliance by following the procedures in § 63.625(d)(1)(ii)(B), certify to the Administrator annually that the control devices and processes have not been modified since the date of the performance test from which you obtained the data used to establish the allowable ranges.
(3) As required by § 63.10(e)(1), you must submit an excess emissions report for any exceedance of an emission or operating parameter limit if the total duration of the exceedances for the reporting period is 1 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period or greater. The report must contain the information specified in § 63.10 and paragraph (b)(4) of this section. When exceedances of an emission limit or operating parameter have not occurred, you must include such information in the report.

General requirements and applicability of general provisions of this part.
(a) You must comply with the general provisions in subpart A of this part as specified in appendix A to this subpart.
(b) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by this standard have been achieved. Determination by the Administrator of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(c) For each CMS used to demonstrate compliance with any applicable emission limit, you must develop, and submit to the Administrator for approval upon request, a site-specific monitoring plan according to the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. You must submit the site-specific monitoring plan, if requested by the Administrator, at least 60 days before the initial performance evaluation of the CMS. The requirements of this paragraph also apply if a petition is made to the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters under § 63.8(f).
(1) You must include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section in the site-specific monitoring plan.
(i) Location of the CMS sampling probe or other interface. You must include a justification demonstrating that the sampling probe or other interface is at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (
e.g.,
on or downstream of the last control device).
(ii) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction systems.
(iii) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (
e.g.,
calibrations).
(iv) Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(c)(1)(ii), (c)(3), (c)(4)(ii), and Table 4 to this subpart.
(v) Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(d)(1) and (2) and Table 5 to this subpart.
(vi) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.10(c), (e)(1), (e)(2)(i).
(2) You must include a schedule for conducting initial and subsequent performance evaluations in the site-specific monitoring plan.
(3) You must keep the site-specific monitoring plan on site for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If you revise the site-specific monitoring plan, you must keep previous (
i.e.,
superseded) versions of the plan on site to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. You must include the program of corrective action required under § 63.8(d)(2) in the plan.
(d) For each bag leak detection system installed to comply with the requirements specified in § 63.625(e), you must include the information specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(1) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (
e.g.,
calibrations), including how the alarm set-point will be established.
(2) A corrective action plan describing corrective actions to be taken and the timing of those actions when the bag leak detection alarm sounds. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the actions specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(i) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other conditions that may cause an increase in regulated material emissions.
(ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
(iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device.
(iv) Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment.
(v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system.
(vi) Shutting down the process controlled by the fabric filter.
(e) If you use blower design capacity to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section calculations showing how you determined the maximum possible gas flow rate through the absorber based on the blower's specifications (including any adjustments you made for pressure drop).
(f) If you use a regression model to determine the gas flow rate through the absorber for use in the liquid-to-gas ratio as specified in Table 3 to this subpart, then you must include in the site-specific monitoring plan specified in paragraph (c) of this section the calculations that were used to develop the regression model, including the calculations you use to convert amperage of the blower to brake horsepower. You must describe any constants included in the equations (e.g., efficiency, power factor), and describe how these constants were determined. If you want to change a constant in your calculation, then you must conduct a regression model verification to confirm the new value of the constant. In addition, the site-specific monitoring plan must be updated annually to reflect the data used in the annual regression model verification that is described in Table 3 to this subpart.

Absorbers (Wet Scrubbers)
Install a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) for liquid flow at the inlet of the absorber.
Your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or more; and you choose to monitor only the influent liquid flow, rather than the liquid-to-gas ratio
Influent liquid flow.
Install CPMS for liquid and gas flow at the inlet of the absorber

Your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less; or
Your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or more, and you choose to monitor the liquid-to-gas ratio, rather than only the influent liquid flow, and you want the ability to lower liquid flow with changes in gas flow
Liquid-to-gas ratio as determined by dividing the influent liquid flow rate by the gas flow rate through the absorber. The units of measure must be consistent with those used to calculate this ratio during the performance test
You must determine the gas flow rate through the absorber by:
Measuring the gas flow rate at the absorber inlet or outlet;
Using the blower design capacity, with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop;
c
or
Using a regression model.
d
Install CPMS for pressure at the gas stream inlet and outlet of the absorber
Your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or more
Pressure drop through the absorber
You may measure the pressure of the inlet gas using amperage on the blower if a correlation between pressure and amperage is established.
a
To monitor an operating parameter that is not specified in this table (including process-specific techniques not specified in this table to determine gas flow rate through an absorber), you must request, on a site-specific basis, an alternative monitoring method under the provisions of § 63.8(f).
b
For new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after August 19, 2015, the compliance date is immediately upon startup. For existing sources, and new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996, and on or before August 19, 2015, if your absorber is designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less, then the compliance date is August 19, 2018. In the interim, for existing sources, and new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after December 27, 1996, and on or before August 19, 2015, with an absorber designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less, you must comply with one of the following: (i) The monitoring requirements in this Table 3 for absorbers designed and operated with pressure drops of 5 inches of water column or less; (ii) the applicable monitoring provisions included in a permit issued under 40 CFR part 70 to assure compliance with subpart BB; (iii) the applicable monitoring provisions of an Alternative Monitoring Plan approved pursuant to § 63.8(f); or (iv) install CPMS for pressure at the gas stream inlet and outlet of the absorber, and monitor pressure drop through the absorber.
c
If you select this option, then you must comply with § 63.628(e). The option to use blower design capacity is intended to establish the maximum possible gas flow through the absorber; and is available regardless of the location of the blower (influent or effluent), as long as the gas flow rate through the absorber can be established. Establish the minimum liquid-to-gas ratio operating limit by dividing the minimum liquid flow rate to the absorber (determined during a performance test) by the maximum possible gas flow rate through the absorber (determined using blower design capacity).
d
If you select this option, then you must comply with § 63.628(f). The regression model must be developed using direct measurements of gas flow rate, and design fan curves that correlate gas flow rate to static pressure (
i.e.,
fan suction pressure) and brake horsepower of the blower. You must conduct an annual regression model verification using direct measurements of gas flow rate to ensure the correlation remains accurate. Direct measurements of gas flow rate used to develop or verify regression models may be collected during, or separately from, the annual performance testing that is required in § 63.626(b).

The owner or operator using emissions averaging shall meet the requirements in paragraphs (l)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Calculate emission debits and credits for those emission points involved in the emissions average according to the procedures specified in § 63.652; and
(2) Comply with the requirements of §§ 63.648 and/or 63.649, 63.654, 63.652, 63.653, 63.655, 63.657, 63.658, 63.670 and 63.671, as applicable.
(m) A State may restrict the owner or operator of an existing source to using only the procedures in paragraph (k) of this section to comply with the emission standard in paragraph (g) of this section. Such a restriction would preclude the source from using an emissions averaging compliance approach.
(n) At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.

(2) Where a flare is used prior to January 30, 2019, a device (including but not limited to a thermocouple, an ultraviolet beam sensor, or an infrared sensor) capable of continuously detecting the presence of a pilot flame is required, or the requirements of § 63.670 shall be met. Where a flare is used on and after January 30, 2019, the requirements of § 63.670 shall be met.
(3) Any boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity greater than or equal to 44 megawatt or any boiler or process heater in which all vent streams are introduced into the flame zone is exempt from monitoring.
(4) Any boiler or process heater less than 44 megawatts design heat capacity where the vent stream is not introduced into the flame zone is required to use a temperature monitoring device in the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder.
(b) An owner or operator of a Group 1 miscellaneous process vent may request approval to monitor parameters other than those listed in paragraph (a) of this section. The request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in § 63.655(h). Approval shall be requested if the owner or operator:
(1) Uses a control device other than an incinerator, boiler, process heater, or flare; or

Use of the bypass at any time to divert a Group 1 miscellaneous process vent stream to the atmosphere or to a control device that does not comply with the requirements in § 63.643(a) is an emissions standards violation. Equipment such as low leg drains and equipment subject to § 63.648 are not subject to this paragraph (c).
(1) Install, calibrate and maintain a flow indicator that determines whether a vent stream flow is present at least once every hour. A manual block valve equipped with a valve position indicator may be used in lieu of a flow indicator, as long as the valve position indicator is monitored continuously. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.655(h) and (i). The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the vent stream away from the control device to the atmosphere; or
(2) Secure the bypass line valve in the non-diverting position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the non-diverting position and that the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line; or
(3) Use a cap, blind flange, plug, or a second valve for an open-ended valve or line following the requirements specified in § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b) and (c).
(d) The owner or operator shall establish a range that ensures compliance with the emissions standard for each parameter monitored under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. In order to establish the range, the information required in § 63.655(f)(3) shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report.
(e) Each owner or operator of a control device subject to the monitoring provisions of this section shall operate the control device in a manner consistent with the minimum and/or maximum operating parameter value or procedure required to be monitored under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Operation of the control device in a manner that constitutes a period of excess emissions, as defined in § 63.655(g)(6), or failure to perform procedures required by this section shall
constitute a violation of the applicable emission standard of this subpart.

(A) Identifying the pressure release;
(B) Recording the time and duration of each pressure release; and
(C) Notifying operators immediately that a pressure release is occurring. The device or monitoring system may be either specific to the pressure relief device itself or may be associated with the process system or piping, sufficient to indicate a pressure release to the atmosphere. Examples of these types of
devices and systems include, but are not limited to, a rupture disk indicator, magnetic sensor, motion detector on the pressure relief valve stem, flow monitor, or pressure monitor.
(ii) The owner or operator must apply at least three redundant prevention measures to each affected pressure relief device and document these measures. Examples of prevention measures include:
(A) Flow, temperature, liquid level and pressure indicators with deadman switches, monitors, or automatic actuators. Independent, non-duplicative systems within this category count as separate redundant prevention measures.
(B) Documented routine inspection and maintenance programs and/or operator training (maintenance programs and operator training may count as only one redundant prevention measure).
(C) Inherently safer designs or safety instrumentation systems.
(D) Deluge systems.
(E) Staged relief system where initial pressure relief device (with lower set release pressure) discharges to a flare or other closed vent system and control device.

§ 63.652
Emissions averaging provisions.
(a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing sources who seek to comply with the emission standard in § 63.642(g) by using emissions averaging according to § 63.642(l) rather than following the provisions of §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651. Existing marine tank vessel loading operations located at the Valdez Marine Terminal source may not comply with the standard by using emissions averaging.
(b) The owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Implementation Plan containing all of the information required in § 63.653(d) for all points to be included in an emissions average. The Implementation Plan shall identify all emission points
to be included in the emissions average. This must include any Group 1 emission points to which the reference control technology (defined in § 63.641) is not applied and all other emission points being controlled as part of the average.
(c) The following emission points can be used to generate emissions averaging credits if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point:
(1) Group 2 emission points;
(2) Group 1 storage vessels, Group 1 wastewater streams, Group 1 gasoline loading racks, Group 1 marine tank vessels, and Group 1 miscellaneous process vents that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies must be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section; and
(3) Emission points from which emissions are reduced by pollution prevention measures. Percentages of reduction for pollution prevention measures shall be determined as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
(i) For a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had the reference control technology been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference control technology, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had it been applied instead.
(d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits:
(1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990 unless the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990, in which case credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990;
(2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a reference control technology unless the reference control technology has been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section. For example, it is not allowable to claim that an internal floating roof meeting only the specifications stated in the reference control technology definition in § 63.641 (i.e., that meets the specifications of § 63.119(b) of subpart G but does not have controlled fittings per § 63.119 (b)(5) and (b)(6) of subpart G) applied to a storage vessel is achieving greater than 95 percent control;
(3) Emission points on shutdown process units. Process units that are shut down cannot be used to generate credits or debits;
(4) Wastewater that is not process wastewater or wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. Group 1 wastewater streams cannot be left undercontrolled or uncontrolled to generate debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms “wastewater” and “wastewater stream” are used to mean process wastewater; and
(5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved average.
(e) For all points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall:
(1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology for those emission points. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits.
(2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 or Group 2 emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits. Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be included.
(3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this section.
(i) The initial demonstration in the Implementation Plan that credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating emission points must be made under representative operating conditions.
(ii) After the compliance date, actual operating data will be used for all debit and credit calculations.
(4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.
(5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the Periodic Reports as specified in § 63.655(g)(8). Every fourth Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the emissions averaging provisions as required by § 63.655(g)(8)(iii).
(f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, respectively, and shall not include emissions from the following:
(1) More than 20 individual emission points. Where pollution prevention measures (as specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) are used to control emission points to be included in an emissions average, no more than 25 emission points may be included in the average. For example, if two emission points to be included in an emissions average are controlled by pollution prevention measures, the average may include up to 22 emission points.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) For emission points for which continuous monitors are used, periods of excess emissions as defined in § 63.655(g)(6)(i). For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
(i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission point.
(ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating emission point.
(iii) The owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (l) of this section to demonstrate to the Administrator that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned.
(g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology, and the emissions allowed for Group 1 emission point. Debits shall be calculated as follows:

(ii) If, in reviewing the submittal, the permitting authority believes the control technology has broad applicability for use by other sources, the permitting authority shall submit the information provided in the application to the Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. The Administrator shall review the technology for broad applicability and may publish a
Federal Register
notice; however, this review shall not affect the permitting authority's approval of the nominal efficiency of the control technology for the specific application.
(6) If, in reviewing an application for a control technology for an emission point, the Administrator or permitting authority determines the control technology is not different in use or design from the reference control technology, the Administrator or permitting authority shall deny the application.
(j) The following procedures shall be used for calculating the efficiency (percentage of reduction) of pollution prevention measures:
(1) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that meets the criteria of paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that results in a lesser quantity of organic HAP emissions per unit of product released to the atmosphere prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or control of emissions while the same product is produced.
(ii) Pollution prevention measures may include: Substitution of feedstocks that reduce HAP emissions, alterations to the production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the environment, equipment modifications; housekeeping measures, and in-process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution prevention.
(2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention measures implemented after November 15, 1990 can be used in calculating the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
(i) For pollution prevention measures, the percentage of reduction used in the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section and paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(4) of this section is the difference in percentage between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced during the two monthly periods.
(ii) The following equation shall be used to calculate the percentage of reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission point.

shall be calculated as follows:
ER18AU95.037
where:
n = Number of wastewater streams.
Q
Bi
= Average flow rate for wastewater stream i before the pollution prevention measure, liters per minute.

B
.
(D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, E

pp
shall be calculated using the following equation:
ER18AU95.038
where n, Q, H, s, Fe
m
, and HAP are defined and determined as described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section except that Q
ppi
, H
ppi
, and HAP
ppim
shall be determined after the pollution prevention measure has been implemented.
(iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, and other information used to determine the percentage of reduction achieved by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully documented.
(iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from multiple emission points. In such cases, the percentage of reduction in emissions for each emission point must be calculated.
(v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(6) of this section used to calculate credits for emission points controlled more stringently than the reference control technology, the nominal efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is equivalent to the percentage of reduction of the pollution prevention measure. When a pollution prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of a source is not required to apply to the Administrator for a nominal efficiency and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
(k) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the emissions from the emission points proposed to be included in the average will not result in greater hazard or, at the option of the State or local permitting authority, greater risk to human health or the environment than if the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651, as applicable.

(2) Owners and operators shall provide documentation demonstrating the hazard or risk equivalency of their proposed emissions average in their Implementation Plan.
(3) An emissions averaging plan that does not demonstrate an equivalent or lower hazard or risk to the satisfaction of the State or local permitting authority shall not be approved. The State or local permitting authority may require such adjustments to the emissions averaging plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human health or the environment than would result if the emission points were controlled according to §§ 63.643 through 63.645, 63.646 or 63.660, 63.647, 63.650, and 63.651, as applicable.
(4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration shall:
(i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment;
(ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human health or the environment; and
(iii) Meet any requirements set by the State or local permitting authority for such demonstrations.
(l) For periods of excess emissions, an owner or operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(ii) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of excess emissions in the Periodic Reports as required in § 63.655(g)(6).
(2) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that other types of monitoring data or engineering calculations are appropriate to establish that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. This demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the Administrator may establish procedures for demonstrating compliance that are acceptable.
(3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the period of excess emissions and the other type of monitoring data or engineering calculations to be used to demonstrate
that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits.
(4) The Administrator may assign full or partial credit and debits upon review of the information provided.

§ 63.654
Heat exchange systems.
(a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator of a heat exchange system that meets the criteria in § 63.640(c)(8) must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.
(b) A heat exchange system is exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section if all heat exchangers within the heat exchange system either:
(1) Operate with the minimum pressure on the cooling water side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the maximum pressure on the process side; or
(2) Employ an intervening cooling fluid containing less than 5 percent by weight of total organic HAP, as determined according to the provisions of § 63.180(d) of this part and table 1 of this subpart, between the process and the cooling water. This intervening fluid must serve to isolate the cooling water from the process fluid and must not be sent through a cooling tower or discharged. For purposes of this section, discharge does not include emptying for maintenance purposes.
(c) The owner or operator must perform monitoring to identify leaks of total strippable volatile organic compounds (VOC) from each heat exchange system subject to the requirements of this subpart according to the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.
(1)
Monitoring locations for closed-loop recirculation heat exchange systems.
For each closed loop recirculating heat exchange system, collect and analyze a sample from the location(s) described in either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i) Each cooling tower return line or any representative riser within the cooling tower prior to exposure to air for each heat exchange system.
(ii) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s) so that each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat
exchange system is covered by the selected monitoring location(s).
(2)
Monitoring locations for once-through heat exchange systems.
For each once-through heat exchange system, collect and analyze a sample from the location(s) described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. The owner or operator may also elect to collect and analyze an additional sample from the location(s) described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s) so that each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is covered by the selected monitoring location(s). The selected monitoring location may be at a point where discharges from multiple heat exchange systems are combined provided that the combined cooling water flow rate at the monitoring location does not exceed 40,000 gallons per minute.
(ii) The inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system prior to any heat exchanger. If multiple heat exchange systems use the same water feed (
i.e.,
inlet water from the same primary water source), the owner or operator may monitor at one representative location and use the monitoring results for that sampling location for all heat exchange systems that use that same water feed.
(3)
Monitoring method.
Determine the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (in parts per million by volume (ppmv) as methane) at each monitoring location using the “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” Revision Number One, dated January 2003, Sampling Procedures Manual, Appendix P: Cooling Tower Monitoring, prepared by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, January 31, 2003 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) using a flame ionization detector (FID) analyzer for on-site determination as described in Section 6.1 of the Modified El Paso Method.
(4)
Monitoring frequency and leak action level for existing sources.
For a heat exchange system at an existing source, the owner or operator must comply with the monitoring frequency and leak action level as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section or comply with the monitoring frequency and leak action level as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The owner or operator of an affected heat exchange system may choose to comply with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section for some heat exchange systems at the petroleum refinery and comply with paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for other heat exchange systems. However, for each affected heat exchange system, the owner or operator of an affected heat exchange system must elect one monitoring alternative that will apply at all times. If the owner or operator intends to change the monitoring alternative that applies to a heat exchange system, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator 30 days in advance of such a change. All “leaks” identified prior to changing monitoring alternatives must be repaired. The monitoring frequencies specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section also apply to the inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system, if monitoring of the inlet water feed is elected as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i) Monitor monthly using a leak action level defined as a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 6.2 ppmv.
(ii) Monitor quarterly using a leak action level defined as a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 3.1 ppmv unless repair is delayed as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. If a repair is delayed as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, monitor monthly.
(5)
Monitoring frequency and leak action level for new sources.
For a heat exchange system at a new source, the owner or operator must monitor monthly using a leak action level defined as a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 3.1 ppmv.
(6)
Leak definition.
A leak is defined as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) or (c)(6)(ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed is monitored as described in paragraph
(c)(2)(ii) of this section, a leak is detected if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.
(ii) For all other heat exchange systems, a leak is detected if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in either paragraph (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(2)(i) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.
(d) If a leak is detected, the owner or operator must repair the leak to reduce the measured concentration to below the applicable action level as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after identifying the leak, except as specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. Repair includes re-monitoring at the monitoring location where the leak was identified according to the method specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section to verify that the measured concentration is below the applicable action level. Actions that can be taken to achieve repair include but are not limited to:
(1) Physical modifications to the leaking heat exchanger, such as welding the leak or replacing a tube;
(2) Blocking the leaking tube within the heat exchanger;
(3) Changing the pressure so that water flows into the process fluid;
(4) Replacing the heat exchanger or heat exchanger bundle; or
(5) Isolating, bypassing, or otherwise removing the leaking heat exchanger from service until it is otherwise repaired.
(e) If the owner or operator detects a leak when monitoring a cooling tower return line under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may conduct additional monitoring of each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers associated with the heat exchange system for which the leak was detected as provided under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. If no leaks are detected when monitoring according to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the heat exchange system is considered to meet the repair requirements through re-monitoring of the heat exchange system as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(f) The owner or operator may delay the repair of a leaking heat exchanger when one of the conditions in paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section is met and the leak is less than the delay of repair action level specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The owner or operator must determine if a delay of repair is necessary as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after first identifying the leak.
(1) If the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monthly monitoring periods during the delay of repair, the owner or operator may delay repair until the next scheduled shutdown of the heat exchange system. If, during subsequent monthly monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, the owner or operator must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
(2) If the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel are not available and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monthly monitoring periods during the delay of repair, the owner or operator may delay the repair for a maximum of 120 calendar days. The owner or operator must demonstrate that the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel were not available. If, during subsequent monthly monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, the owner or operator must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
(3) The delay of repair action level is a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 62 ppmv. The delay of repair action level is assessed as described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed
is monitored as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the delay of repair action level is exceeded if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
(ii) For all other heat exchange systems, the delay of repair action level is exceeded if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in either paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(2)(i) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
(g) To delay the repair under paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator must record the information in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) The reason(s) for delaying repair.
(2) A schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.
(3) The date and concentration of the leak as first identified and the results of all subsequent monthly monitoring events during the delay of repair.
(4) An estimate of the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions from the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for each required delay of repair monitoring interval following the procedures in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) Determine the leak concentration as specified in paragraph (c) of this section and convert the stripping gas leak concentration (in ppmv as methane) to an equivalent liquid concentration, in parts per million by weight (ppmw), using equation 7-1 from “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” Revision Number One, dated January 2003, Sampling Procedures Manual, Appendix P: Cooling Tower Monitoring, prepared by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, January 31, 2003 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) and the molecular weight of 16 grams per mole (g/mol) for methane.
(ii) Determine the mass flow rate of the cooling water at the monitoring location where the leak was detected. If the monitoring location is an individual cooling tower riser, determine the total cooling water mass flow rate to the cooling tower. Cooling water mass flow rates may be determined using direct measurement, pump curves, heat balance calculations, or other engineering methods. Volumetric flow measurements may be used and converted to mass flow rates using the density of water at the specific monitoring location temperature or using the default density of water at 25 degrees Celsius, which is 997 kilograms per cubic meter or 8.32 pounds per gallon.
(iii) For delay of repair monitoring intervals prior to repair of the leak, calculate the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the monitoring interval by multiplying the leak concentration in the cooling water, ppmw, determined in (g)(4)(i) of this section, by the mass flow rate of the cooling water determined in (g)(4)(ii) of this section and by the duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval. The duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight on the day of the previous monitoring event or at midnight on the day the repair would have had to be completed if the repair had not been delayed, whichever is later, and ending at midnight of the day the of the current monitoring event.
(iv) For delay of repair monitoring intervals ending with a repaired leak, calculate the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the final delay of repair monitoring interval by multiplying the duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval by the leak concentration and cooling water flow rates determined for the last monitoring event prior to the re-monitoring event used to verify the leak was repaired. The duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight of the day of the last monitoring event prior to re-monitoring to verify the leak was repaired and ending at the time of the re-
monitoring event that verified that the leak was repaired.

Extensions to electronic reporting deadlines.
(i) If you are required to electronically submit a report through the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) in the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX), and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date(s) and time(s) the CDX or CEDRI were unavailable when you attempted to access it in the 5 business days prior to the submission deadline; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(ii) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely
comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this paragraph, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.

§ 63.658
Fenceline monitoring provisions.
(a) The owner or operator shall conduct sampling along the facility property boundary and analyze the samples in accordance with Methods 325A and 325B of appendix A of this part and paragraphs (b) through (k) of this section.
(b) The target analyte is benzene.
(c) The owner or operator shall determine passive monitor locations in accordance with Section 8.2 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part.
(1) As it pertains to this subpart, known sources of VOCs, as used in Section 8.2.1.3 in Method 325A of appendix A of this part for siting passive monitors, means a wastewater treatment unit, process unit, or any emission source requiring control according to the requirements of this subpart, including marine vessel loading operations. For marine vessel loading operations, one passive monitor should be sited on the shoreline adjacent to the dock. For this subpart, an additional monitor is not required if the only emission sources within 50 meters of the monitoring boundary are equipment leak sources satisfying all of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) The equipment leak sources in organic HAP service within 50 meters of the monitoring boundary are limited to valves, pumps, connectors, sampling connections, and open-ended lines. If compressors, pressure relief devices, or agitators in organic HAP service are present within 50 meters of the monitoring boundary, the additional passive monitoring location specified in Section 8.2.1.3 in Method 325A of appendix A of this part must be used.
(ii) All equipment leak sources in gas or light liquid service (and in organic HAP service), including valves, pumps, connectors, sampling connections and open-ended lines, must be monitored using EPA Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 no less frequently than quarterly with no provisions for skip period monitoring, or according to the provisions of § 63.11(c) Alternative Work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks. For the purpose of this provision, a leak is detected if the instrument reading equals or exceeds the applicable limits in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A) through (E) of this section:
(A) For valves, pumps or connectors at an existing source, an instrument reading of 10,000 ppmv.
(B) For valves or connectors at a new source, an instrument reading of 500 ppmv.
(C) For pumps at a new source, an instrument reading of 2,000 ppmv.
(D) For sampling connections or open-ended lines, an instrument reading of 500 ppmv above background.
(E) For equipment monitored according to the Alternative Work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks, the leak definitions contained in § 63.11 (c)(6)(i) through (iii).
(iii) All equipment leak sources in organic HAP service, including sources in gas, light liquid and heavy liquid service, must be inspected using visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method at least monthly. A leak is detected if the inspection identifies a potential leak to the atmosphere or if there are indications of liquids dripping.
(iv) All leaks identified by the monitoring or inspections specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section must be repaired no later than 15 calendar days after it is detected with no provisions for delay of repair. If a repair is not completed within 15 calendar days, the additional passive monitor specified in Section 8.2.1.3 in Method 325A of appendix A of this part must be used.
(2) The owner or operator may collect one or more background samples if the owner or operator believes that an offsite upwind source or an onsite source excluded under § 63.640(g) may influence the sampler measurements. If the owner or operator elects to collect one or more background samples, the owner or operator must develop and submit a site-specific monitoring plan for approval according to the requirements in paragraph (i) of this section. Upon approval of the site-specific monitoring plan, the background sampler(s) should be operated co-currently with the routine samplers.
(3) If there are 19 or fewer monitoring locations, the owner or operator shall collect at least one co-located duplicate sample per sampling period and at least one field blank per sampling period. If there are 20 or more monitoring locations, the owner or operator shall collect at least two co-located duplicate samples per sampling period and at least one field blank per sampling period. The co-located duplicates may be collected at any of the perimeter sampling
(4) The owner or operator shall follow the procedure in Section 9.6 of Method 325B of appendix A of this part to determine the detection limit of benzene for each sampler used to collect samples, background samples (if the owner or operator elects to do so), co-located samples and blanks.
(d) The owner or operator shall collect and record meteorological data according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) If a near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section or if an alternative test method is used that provides time-resolved measurements, the owner or operator shall:
(i) Use an on-site meteorological station in accordance with Section 8.3 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part.
(ii) Collect and record hourly average meteorological data, including temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and wind direction and calculate daily unit vector wind direction and daily sigma theta.
(2) For cases other than those specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall collect and record sampling period average temperature and barometric pressure using either an on-site meteorological station in accordance with Section 8.3.1 through 8.3.3 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part or, alternatively, using data from a United States Weather Service (USWS) meteorological station provided the USWS meteorological station is within 40 kilometers (25 miles) of the refinery.
(3) If an on-site meteorological station is used, the owner or operator shall follow the calibration and standardization procedures for meteorological measurements in EPA-454/B-08-002 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14).
(e) The owner or operator shall use a sampling period and sampling frequency as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1)
Sampling period.
A 14-day sampling period shall be used, unless a shorter sampling period is determined to be necessary under paragraph (g) or (i) of this section. A sampling period is defined as the period during which sampling tube is deployed at a specific sampling location with the diffusive sampling end cap in-place and does not include the time required to analyze the sample. For the purpose of this subpart, a 14-day sampling period may be no shorter than 13 calendar days and no longer than 15 calendar days, but the routine sampling period shall be 14 calendar days.
(2)
Base sampling frequency.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the frequency of sample collection shall be once each contiguous 14-day sampling period, such that the beginning of the next 14-day sampling period begins immediately upon the completion of the previous 14-day sampling period.
(3)
Alternative sampling frequency for burden reduction.
When an individual monitor consistently achieves results at or below 0.9 µg/m
3
, the owner or operator may elect to use the applicable minimum sampling frequency specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (v) of this section for that monitoring site. When calculating Δc for the monitoring period when using this alternative for burden reduction, zero shall be substituted for the sample result for the monitoring site for any period where a sample is not taken.
(i) If every sample at a monitoring site is at or below 0.9 µg/m
3
for 2 years (52 consecutive samples), every other sampling period can be skipped for that monitoring site,
i.e.,
sampling will occur approximately once per month.
(ii) If every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is at or below 0.9 µg/m
3
for 2 years (
i.e.,
26 consecutive “monthly” samples), five 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that monitoring site following each period of sampling,
i.e.,
sampling will occur approximately once per quarter.
(iii) If every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is at or below 0.9 µg/m
3
for 2 years (
i.e.,
8 consecutive quarterly samples), twelve 14-day sampling periods can be skipped for that monitoring site following each period of sampling,
i.e.,
sampling will occur twice a year.
(iv) If every sample at a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section is at or below 0.9 µg/m
3
for 2 years (
i.e.,
4 consecutive semiannual samples), only one sample per year is required for that monitoring site. For yearly sampling, samples shall occur at least 10 months but no more than 14 months apart.
(v) If at any time a sample for a monitoring site that is monitored at the frequency specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section returns a result that is above 0.9 µg/m
3
, the sampling site must return to the original sampling requirements of contiguous 14-day sampling periods with no skip periods for one quarter (six 14-day sampling periods). If every sample collected during this quarter is at or below 0.9 µg/m
3
, the owner or operator may revert back to the reduced monitoring schedule applicable for that
monitoring site prior to the sample reading exceeding 0.9 µg/m
3
If any sample collected during this quarter is above 0.9 µg/m
3
, that monitoring site must return to the original sampling requirements of contiguous 14-day sampling periods with no skip periods for a minimum of two years. The burden reduction requirements can be used again for that monitoring site once the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section are met again,
i.e.,
after 52 contiguous 14-day samples with no results above 0.9 µg/m
3
.
(f) Within 45 days of completion of each sampling period, the owner or operator shall determine whether the results are above or below the action level as follows:
(1) The owner or operator shall determine the facility impact on the benzene concentration (Δc) for each 14-day sampling period according to either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) Except when near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine the highest and lowest sample results for benzene concentrations from the sample pool and calculate Δc as the difference in these concentrations. Co-located samples must be averaged together for the purposes of determining the benzene concentration for that sampling location, and, if applicable, for determining Δc. The owner or operator shall adhere to the following procedures when one or more samples for the sampling period are below the method detection limit for benzene:
(A) If the lowest detected value of benzene is below detection, the owner or operator shall use zero as the lowest sample result when calculating Δc.
(B) If all sample results are below the method detection limit, the owner or operator shall use the method detection limit as the highest sample result and zero as the lowest sample result when calculating Δc.
(ii) When near-field source correction is used as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine Δc using the calculation protocols outlined in the approved site-specific monitoring plan and in paragraph (i) of this section.
(2) The owner or operator shall calculate the annual average Δc based on the average of the 26 most recent 14-day sampling periods. The owner or operator shall update this annual average value after receiving the results of each subsequent 14-day sampling period.
(3) The action level for benzene is 9 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) on an annual average basis. If the annual average Δc value for benzene is less than or equal to 9 µg/m
3
, the concentration is below the action level. If the annual average Δc value for benzene is greater than 9 µg/m
3
, the concentration is above the action level, and the owner or operator shall conduct a root cause analysis and corrective action in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
(g) Within 5 days of determining that the action level has been exceeded for any annual average Δc and no longer than 50 days after completion of the sampling period, the owner or operator shall initiate a root cause analysis to determine the cause of such exceedance and to determine appropriate corrective action, such as those described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section. The root cause analysis and initial corrective action analysis shall be completed and initial corrective actions taken no later than 45 days after determining there is an exceedance. Root cause analysis and corrective action may include, but is not limited to:
(1) Leak inspection using Method 21 of part 60, appendix A-7 of this chapter and repairing any leaks found.
(2) Leak inspection using optical gas imaging and repairing any leaks found.
(3) Visual inspection to determine the cause of the high benzene emissions and implementing repairs to reduce the level of emissions.
(4) Employing progressively more frequent sampling, analysis and meteorology (
e.g.,
using shorter sampling periods for Methods 325A and 325B of appendix A of this part, or using active sampling techniques).
(h) If, upon completion of the corrective action analysis and corrective actions such as those described in paragraph (g) of this section, the Δc value for the next 14-day sampling period for which the sampling start time begins
after the completion of the corrective actions is greater than 9 µg/m
3
or if all corrective action measures identified require more than 45 days to implement, the owner or operator shall develop a corrective action plan that describes the corrective action(s) completed to date, additional measures that the owner or operator proposes to employ to reduce fenceline concentrations below the action level, and a schedule for completion of these measures. The owner or operator shall submit the corrective action plan to the Administrator within 60 days after receiving the analytical results indicating that the Δc value for the 14-day sampling period following the completion of the initial corrective action is greater than 9 µg/m
3
or, if no initial corrective actions were identified, no later than 60 days following the completion of the corrective action analysis required in paragraph (g) of this section.
(i) An owner or operator may request approval from the Administrator for a site-specific monitoring plan to account for offsite upwind sources or onsite sources excluded under § 63.640(g) according to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator shall prepare and submit a site-specific monitoring plan and receive approval of the site-specific monitoring plan prior to using the near-field source alternative calculation for determining Δc provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The site-specific monitoring plan shall include, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. The procedures in Section 12 of Method 325A of appendix A of this part are not required, but may be used, if applicable, when determining near-field source contributions.
(i) Identification of the near-field source or sources. For onsite sources, documentation that the onsite source is excluded under § 63.640(g) and identification of the specific provision in § 63.640(g) that applies to the source.
(ii) Location of the additional monitoring stations that shall be used to determine the uniform background concentration and the near-field source concentration contribution.
(iii) Identification of the fenceline monitoring locations impacted by the near-field source. If more than one near-field source is present, identify the near-field source or sources that are expected to contribute to the concentration at that monitoring location.
(iv) A description of (including sample calculations illustrating) the planned data reduction and calculations to determine the near-field source concentration contribution for each monitoring location.
(v) If more frequent monitoring or a monitoring station other than a passive diffusive tube monitoring station is proposed, provide a detailed description of the measurement methods, measurement frequency, and recording frequency for determining the uniform background or near-field source concentration contribution.
(2) When an approved site-specific monitoring plan is used, the owner or operator shall determine Δc for comparison with the 9 µg/m
3
action level using the requirements specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) For each monitoring location, calculate Δc
i
using the following equation.
Δc
i
= MFC
i
− NFS
i
− UB
Where:
Δc
i
= The fenceline concentration, corrected for background, at measurement location i, micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m
3
).
MFC
i

3
.
NFS
i
= The near-field source contributing concentration at measurement location i determined using the additional measurements and calculation procedures included in the site-specific monitoring plan, µg/m
3
. For monitoring locations that are not included in the site-specific monitoring plan as impacted by a near-field source, use NFS
i
= 0 µg/m
3
.
UB = The uniform background concentration determined using the additional measurements included in the site-specific monitoring plan, µg/m
3
. If no additional measurements are specified in the site-specific monitoring plan for determining the uniform background concentration, use UB = 0 µg/m
3
.
(ii) When one or more samples for the sampling period are below the method detection limit for benzene, adhere to the following procedures:
(A) If the benzene concentration at the monitoring location used for the uniform background concentration is below the method detection limit, the owner or operator shall use zero for UB for that monitoring period.
(B) If the benzene concentration at the monitoring location(s) used to determine the near-field source contributing concentration is below the method detection limit, the owner or operator shall use zero for the monitoring location concentration when calculating NFS
i
for that monitoring period.
(C) If a fenceline monitoring location sample result is below the method detection limit, the owner or operator shall use the method detection limit as the sample result.
(iii) Determine Δc for the monitoring period as the maximum value of Δc
i
from all of the fenceline monitoring locations for that monitoring period.
(3) The site-specific monitoring plan shall be submitted and approved as described in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) The site-specific monitoring plan must be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
(ii) The site-specific monitoring plan shall also be submitted to the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Sector Policies and Programs Division, U.S. EPA Mailroom (E143-01), Attention: Refinery Sector Lead, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Electronic copies in lieu of hard copies may also be submitted to
refineryrtr@epa.gov.
(iii) The Administrator shall approve or disapprove the plan in 90 days. The plan shall be considered approved if the Administrator either approves the plan in writing, or fails to disapprove the plan in writing. The 90-day period shall begin when the Administrator receives the plan.
(iv) If the Administrator finds any deficiencies in the site-specific monitoring plan and disapproves the plan in writing, the owner or operator may revise and resubmit the site-specific monitoring plan following the requirements in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. The 90-day period starts over with the resubmission of the revised monitoring plan.
(4) The approval by the Administrator of a site-specific monitoring plan will be based on the completeness, accuracy and reasonableness of the request for a site-specific monitoring plan. Factors that the Administrator will consider in reviewing the request for a site-specific monitoring plan include, but are not limited to, those described in paragraphs (i)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) The identification of the near-field source or sources. For onsite sources, the documentation provided that the onsite source is excluded under § 63.640(g).

(1) The alternative method may be used in lieu of all or a partial number of passive samplers required in Method 325A of appendix A of this part.
(2) The alternative method must be validated according to Method 301 in
appendix A of this part or contain performance based procedures and indicators to ensure self-validation.
(3) The method detection limit must nominally be at least an order of magnitude below the action level,
i.e.,
0.9 µg/m
3
benzene. The alternate test method must describe the procedures used to provide field verification of the detection limit.
(4) The spatial coverage must be equal to or better than the spatial coverage provided in Method 325A of appendix A of this part.
(i) For path average concentration open-path instruments, the physical path length of the measurement shall be no more than a passive sample footprint (the spacing that would be provided by the sorbent traps when following Method 325A). For example, if Method 325A requires spacing monitors A and B 610 meters (2000 feet) apart, then the physical path length limit for the measurement at that portion of the fenceline shall be no more than 610 meters (2000 feet).
(ii) For range resolved open-path instrument or approach, the instrument or approach must be able to resolve an average concentration over each passive sampler footprint within the path length of the instrument.
(iii) The extra samplers required in Sections 8.2.1.3 of Method 325A may be omitted when they fall within the path length of an open-path instrument.
(5) At a minimum, non-integrating alternative test methods must provide a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period.
(6) For alternative test methods capable of real time measurements (less than a 5 minute sampling and analysis cycle), the alternative test method may allow for elimination of data points corresponding to outside emission sources for purpose of calculation of the high point for the two week average. The alternative test method approach must have wind speed, direction and stability class of the same time resolution and within the footprint of the instrument.
(7) For purposes of averaging data points to determine the Δc for the 14-day average high sample result, all results measured under the method detection limit must use the method detection limit. For purposes of averaging data points for the 14-day average low sample result, all results measured under the method detection limit must use zero.

Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, use of the bypass at any time to divert a Group 1 storage vessel either directly to the atmosphere or to a control device that does not comply with the requirements in subpart SS of this part is an emissions standards violation. Equipment such as low leg drains and equipment subject to § 63.648 are not subject to this paragraph (i)(2).
(i) If planned routine maintenance of the control device cannot be performed during periods that storage vessel emissions are vented to the control device or when the storage vessel is taken out of service for inspections or other planned maintenance reasons, the owner or operator may bypass the control device.
(ii) Periods for which storage vessel control device may be bypassed for planned routine maintenance of the control device shall not exceed 240 hours per calendar year.
(iii) Use a cap, blind flange, plug, or a second valve for an open-ended valve or line following the requirements specified in § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c).
(3) If storage vessel emissions are routed to a fuel gas system or process, the fuel gas system or process shall be operating at all times when regulated emissions are routed to it. The exception in § 63.984(a)(1) does not apply.

The owner or operator shall continuously monitor the presence of the pilot flame(s) using a device (including, but not limited to, a thermocouple, ultraviolet beam sensor, or infrared sensor) capable of detecting that the pilot flame(s) is present.
(h)
Visible emissions monitoring.
The owner or operator shall conduct an initial visible emissions demonstration using an observation period of 2 hours using Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. The initial visible emissions demonstration should be conducted the first time regulated materials are routed to the flare. Subsequent visible emissions observations must be conducted using either the methods in paragraph (h)(1) of this section or, alternatively, the methods in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The owner or operator must record and report any instances where visible emissions are observed for more than 5 minutes during any 2 consecutive hours as specified in § 63.655(g)(11)(ii).
(1) At least once per day for each day regulated material is routed to the flare, conduct visible emissions observations using an observation period of 5 minutes using Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. If at any time the owner or operator sees visible emissions while regulated material is routed to the flare, even if the minimum required daily visible emission monitoring has already been performed, the owner or operator shall immediately begin an observation period of 5 minutes using Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. If visible emissions are observed for more than one continuous minute during any 5-minute observation period, the observation period using Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 must be extended to 2 hours or until 5-minutes of visible emissions are observed. Daily 5-minute Method 22 observations are not required to be conducted for days the flare does not receive any regulated material.
(2) Use a video surveillance camera to continuously record (at least one frame every 15 seconds with time and date stamps) images of the flare flame and a reasonable distance above the flare flame at an angle suitable for visual emissions observations.

(i)
Flare vent gas, steam assist and air assist flow rate monitoring.
The owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of continuously measuring, calculating, and recording the volumetric flow rate in the flare header or headers that feed the flare as well as any flare supplemental gas used. Different flow monitoring methods may be used to measure different gaseous streams that make up the flare vent gas provided that the flow rates of all gas streams that contribute to the flare vent gas are determined. If assist air or assist steam is used, the owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of continuously measuring, calculating, and recording the volumetric flow rate of assist air and/or assist steam used with the flare. If pre-mix assist air and perimeter assist are both used, the owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of separately measuring, calculating, and recording the volumetric flow rate of premix assist air and perimeter assist air used with the flare. Flow monitoring system requirements and acceptable alternatives are provided in paragraphs (i)(1) through (6) of this section.
(1) The flow rate monitoring systems must be able to correct for the temperature and pressure of the system and output parameters in standard conditions (
i.e.,
a temperature of 20 °C (68 °F) and a pressure of 1 atmosphere).
(2) Mass flow monitors may be used for determining volumetric flow rate of flare vent gas provided the molecular weight of the flare vent gas is determined using compositional analysis as specified in paragraph (j) of this section so that the mass flow rate can be converted to volumetric flow at standard conditions using the following equation.
ER01DE15.009

Q
mass
= Mass flow rate, pounds per second.
385.3 = Conversion factor, standard cubic feet per pound-mole.

(3) Mass flow monitors may be used for determining volumetric flow rate of assist air or assist steam. Use equation in paragraph (i)(2) of this section to convert mass flow rates to volumetric flow rates. Use a molecular weight of 18 pounds per pound-mole for assist steam and use a molecular weight of 29 pounds per pound-mole for assist air.
(4) Continuous pressure/temperature monitoring system(s) and appropriate engineering calculations may be used in lieu of a continuous volumetric flow monitoring systems provided the molecular weight of the gas is known. For assist steam, use a molecular weight of 18 pounds per pound-mole. For assist air, use a molecular weight of 29 pounds per pound-mole. For flare vent gas, molecular weight must be determined using compositional analysis as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.

(6) For perimeter assist air intentionally entrained in lower and/or upper steam, the monitored steam flow rate and the maximum design air-to-
steam volumetric flow ratio of the entrainment system may be used to determine the assist air flow rate.
(j)
Flare vent gas composition monitoring.
The owner or operator shall determine the concentration of individual components in the flare vent gas using either the methods provided in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section, to assess compliance with the operating limits in paragraph (e) of this section and, if applicable, paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section. Alternatively, the owner or operator may elect to directly monitor the net heating value of the flare vent gas following the methods provided in paragraphs (j)(3) of this section and, if desired, may directly measure the hydrogen concentration in the flare vent gas following the methods provided in paragraphs (j)(4) of this section. The owner or operator may elect to use different monitoring methods for different gaseous streams that make up the flare vent gas using different methods provided the composition or net heating value of all gas streams that contribute to the flare vent gas are determined.
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(5) and (6) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of continuously measuring (
i.e.,
at least once every 15-minutes), calculating, and recording the individual component concentrations present in the flare vent gas.
(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(5) and (6) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain a grab sampling system capable of collecting an evacuated canister sample for subsequent compositional analysis at least once every eight hours while there is flow of regulated material to the flare. Subsequent compositional analysis of the samples must be performed according to Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6, ASTM D6420-99 (Reapproved 2010), ASTM D1945-03 (Reapproved 2010), ASTM D1945-14 or ASTM UOP539-12 (all incorporated by reference—see § 63.14).
(3) Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(5) and (6) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a calorimeter capable of continuously measuring, calculating, and recording NHV
vg
at standard conditions.
(4) If the owner or operator uses a continuous net heating value monitor according to paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the owner or operator may, at their discretion, install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring system capable of continuously measuring, calculating, and recording the hydrogen concentration in the flare vent gas.
(5) Direct compositional or net heating value monitoring is not required for purchased (“pipeline quality”) natural gas streams. The net heating value of purchased natural gas streams may be determined using annual or more frequent grab sampling at any one representative location. Alternatively, the net heating value of any purchased natural gas stream can be assumed to be 920 Btu/scf.
(6) Direct compositional or net heating value monitoring is not required for gas streams that have been demonstrated to have consistent composition (or a fixed minimum net heating value) according to the methods in paragraphs (j)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a written application for an exemption from monitoring. The application must contain the following information:
(A) A description of the flare gas stream/system to be considered, including submission of a portion of the appropriate piping diagrams indicating the boundaries of the flare gas stream/system and the affected flare(s) to be considered;
(B) A statement that there are no crossover or entry points to be introduced into the flare gas stream/system (this should be shown in the piping diagrams) prior to the point where the flow rate of the gas streams is measured;
(C) An explanation of the conditions that ensure that the flare gas net heating value is consistent and, if flare gas net heating value is expected to vary (
e.g.,
due to product loading of different material), the conditions expected to produce the flare gas with the lowest net heating value;
(D) The supporting test results from sampling the requested flare gas stream/system for the net heating value. Sampling data must include, at minimum, 2 weeks of daily measurement values (14 grab samples) for frequently operated flare gas streams/systems; for infrequently operated flare gas streams/systems, seven grab samples must be collected unless other additional information would support reduced sampling. If the flare gas stream composition can vary, samples must be taken during those conditions expected to result in lowest net heating value identified in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(C) of this section. The owner or operator shall determine net heating value for the gas stream using either gas composition analysis or net heating value monitor (with optional hydrogen concentration analyzer) according to the method provided in paragraph (l) of this section; and
(E) A description of how the 2 weeks (or seven samples for infrequently operated flare gas streams/systems) of monitoring results compares to the typical range of net heating values expected for the flare gas stream/system going to the affected flare (
e.g.,
“the samples are representative of typical operating conditions of the flare gas stream going to the loading rack flare” or “the samples are representative of conditions expected to yield the lowest net heating value of the flare gas stream going to the loading rack flare”).
(F) The net heating value to be used for all flows of the flare vent gas from the flare gas stream/system covered in the application. A single net heating value must be assigned to the flare vent gas either by selecting the lowest net heating value measured in the sampling program or by determining the 95th percent confidence interval on the mean value of all samples collected using the t-distribution statistic (which is 1.943 for 7 grab samples or 1.771 for 14 grab samples).
(ii) The effective date of the exemption is the date of submission of the information required in paragraph (j)(6)(i) of this section.
(iii) No further action is required unless refinery operating conditions change in such a way that affects the exempt fuel gas stream/system (
e.g.,
the stream composition changes). If such a change occurs, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in paragraph (j)(6)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
(A) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value that is still within the range of net heating values included in the original application, the owner or operator shall determine the net heating value on a grab sample and record the results as proof that the net heating value assigned to the vent gas stream in the original application is still appropriate.
(B) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value that is lower than the net heating value assigned to the vent gas stream in the original application, the owner or operator may submit new information following the procedures of paragraph (j)(6)(i) of this section within 60 days (or within 30 days after the seventh grab sample is tested for infrequently operated process units).
(C) If the operation change results in a flare vent gas net heating value has greater variability in the flare gas stream/system such the owner or operator chooses not to submit new information to support an exemption, the owner or operator must begin monitoring the composition or net heat content of the flare vent gas stream using the methods in this section (
i.e.,
grab samples every 8 hours until such time a continuous monitor, if elected, is installed).
(k)
Calculation methods for cumulative flow rates and determining compliance with Vtip operating limits
. The owner or operator shall determine V
tip
on a 15-minute block average basis according to the following requirements.
(1) The owner or operator shall use design and engineering principles to determine the unobstructed cross sectional area of the flare tip. The unobstructed cross sectional area of the flare tip is the total tip area that vent gas can pass through. This area does not include any stability tabs, stability rings, and upper steam or air tubes because flare vent gas does not exit through them.
(2) The owner or operator shall determine the cumulative volumetric flow
of flare vent gas for each 15-minute block average period using the data from the continuous flow monitoring system required in paragraph (i) of this section according to the following requirements, as applicable. If desired, the cumulative flow rate for a 15-minute block period only needs to include flow during those periods when regulated material is sent to the flare, but owners or operators may elect to calculate the cumulative flow rates across the entire 15-minute block period for any 15-minute block period where there is regulated material flow to the flare.
(i) Use set 15-minute time periods starting at 12 midnight to 12:15 a.m., 12:15 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. and so on concluding at 11:45 p.m. to midnight when calculating 15-minute block average flow volumes.
(ii) If continuous pressure/temperature monitoring system(s) and engineering calculations are used as allowed under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the owner or operator shall, at a minimum, determine the 15-minute block average temperature and pressure from the monitoring system and use those values to perform the engineering calculations to determine the cumulative flow over the 15-minute block average period. Alternatively, the owner or operator may divide the 15-minute block average period into equal duration subperiods(
e.g.
, three 5-minute periods) and determine the average temperature and pressure for each subperiod, perform engineering calculations to determine the flow for each subperiod, then add the volumetric flows for the subperiods to determine the cumulative volumetric flow of vent gas for the 15-minute block average period.
(3) The 15-minute block average V
tip
shall be calculated using the following equation.
ER01DE15.010
Where:

Area = Unobstructed area of the flare tip, square feet.
900 = Conversion factor, seconds per 15-minute block average.
(4) If the owner or operator chooses to comply with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall also determine the net heating value of the flare vent gas following the requirements in paragraphs (j) and (l) of this section and calculate V
max
using the equation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in order to compare V
tip
to V
max
on a 15-minute block average basis.
(l)
Calculation methods for determining flare vent gas net heating value.
The owner or operator shall determine the net heating value of the flare vent gas (NHV

vg
= Net heating value of flare vent gas, Btu/scf.
i = Individual component in flare vent gas.
n = Number of components in flare vent gas.
x
i
= Concentration of component i in flare vent gas, volume fraction.
NHV
i
= Net heating value of component i according to table 12 of this subpart, Btu/scf. If the component is not specified in table 12 of this subpart, the heats of combustion may be determined using any published values where the net enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25 °C and 1 atmosphere (or constant pressure) with offgas water in the gaseous state, but the standard temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole of vent gas is 20 °C.
(2) If direct net heating value monitoring data are collected as provided in paragraph (j)(3) of this section but a hydrogen concentration monitor is not used, the owner or operator shall use the direct output of the monitoring system(s) (in Btu/scf) to determine the NHV
vg
for the sample.
(3) If direct net heating value monitoring data are collected as provided in paragraph (j)(3) of this section and hydrogen concentration monitoring data are collected as provided in paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the owner or operator shall use the following equation to determine NHV
vg
for each sample measured via the net heating value monitoring system.
NHV
vg
=
NHV
measured
+ 938
x
H2
Where:
NHV
vg

NHV
measured
= Net heating value of flare vent gas stream as measured by the continuous net heating value monitoring system, Btu/scf.
x
H2
= Concentration of hydrogen in flare vent gas at the time the sample was input into the net heating value monitoring system, volume fraction.
938 = Net correction for the measured heating value of hydrogen (1,212 − 274), Btu/scf.
(4) Use set 15-minute time periods starting at 12 midnight to 12:15 a.m., 12:15 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. and so on concluding at 11:45 p.m. to midnight when calculating 15-minute block averages.
(5) When a continuous monitoring system is used as provided in paragraph (j)(1) or (3) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the owner or operator of a flare other than a pressure-assisted flare may elect to determine the 15-minute block average NHV
vg
using either the calculation methods in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section or the calculation methods in paragraph (l)(5)(ii) of this section. The owner or operator may choose to comply using the calculation methods in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section for some non-pressure-assisted flares at the petroleum refinery and comply using the calculation methods (l)(5)(ii) of this section for other flares. However, for each non-pressure-assisted flare, the owner or operator must elect one calculation method that will apply at all times, and use that method for all continuously monitored flare vent streams associated with that flare. If the owner or operator intends to change the calculation method that applies to a flare, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator 30 days in advance of such a change. For pressure-assisted flares, beginning on April 4, 2024, the owner or operator must use the calculation method in paragraph (l)(5)(ii) of this section.
(i)
Feed-forward calculation method.
When calculating NHV
vg
for a specific 15-minute block:
(A) Use the results from the first sample collected during an event, (for periodic flare vent gas flow events) for the first 15-minute block associated with that event.
(B) If the results from the first sample collected during an event (for periodic flare vent gas flow events) are not available until after the second 15-minute block starts, use the results from the first sample collected during an event for the second 15-minute block associated with that event.
(C) For all other cases, use the results that are available from the most recent sample prior to the 15-minute block period for that 15-minute block period for all flare vent gas steams. For the purpose of this requirement, use the time that the results become available rather than the time the sample was collected. For example, if a sample is collected at 12:25 a.m. and the analysis is completed at 12:38 a.m., the results are available at 12:38 a.m. and these results would be used to determine compliance during the 15-minute block period from 12:45 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.
(ii)
Direct calculation method.
When calculating NHV
vg
for a specific 15-minute block:
(A) If the results from the first sample collected during an event (for periodic flare vent gas flow events) are not available until after the second 15-minute block starts, use the results from the first sample collected during an event for the first 15-minute block associated with that event.
(B) For all other cases, use the arithmetic average of all NHV
vg
measurement data results that become available during a 15-minute block to calculate the 15-minute block average for that period. For the purpose of this requirement, use the time that the results become available rather than the time the sample was collected. For example, if a sample is collected at 12:25 a.m. and the analysis is completed at 12:38 a.m., the results are available at 12:38 a.m. and these results would be used to determine compliance during the 15-minute block period from 12:30 a.m. to 12:45 a.m.
(6) When grab samples are used to determine flare vent gas composition:
(i) Use the analytical results from the first grab sample collected for an event for all 15-minute periods from the start of the event through the 15-minute block prior to the 15-minute block in which a subsequent grab sample is collected.
(ii) Use the results from subsequent grab sampling events for all 15 minute periods starting with the 15-minute block in which the sample was collected and ending with the 15-minute block prior to the 15-minute block in which the next grab sample is collected. For the purpose of this requirement, use the time the sample was collected rather than the time the analytical results become available.
(7) If the owner or operator monitors separate gas streams that combine to comprise the total flare vent gas flow, the 15-minute block average net heating value shall be determined separately for each measurement location according to the methods in paragraphs (l)(1) through (6) of this section and a flow-weighted average of the gas stream net heating values shall be used to determine the 15-minute block average net heating value of the cumulative flare vent gas.
(m)
Calculation methods for determining combustion zone net heating value.
The owner or operator shall determine the net heating value of the combustion zone gas (NHV
cz
) as specified in paragraph (m)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.
(1) Except as specified in paragraph (m)(2) of this section, determine the 15-minute block average NHV

(i) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single continuous flare flow event that meets both of the criteria in paragraphs (o)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(ii) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single continuous flare flow event regardless of the number of 15-minute block periods in which the flare tip velocity was exceeded or the number of 2 hour periods that contain more the 5 minutes of visible emissions.
(iii) You may conduct a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis for a single event that causes two or more flares that are operated in series (
i.e.,
cascaded flare systems) to have a flow event meeting the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.

For the purpose of this requirement, a single root cause analysis conducted for an event that met both of the criteria in paragraphs (o)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section would be counted as an event under each of the separate criteria counts for that flare. Additionally, if a single root cause analysis was conducted for an event that caused multiple flares to meet the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, that event would count as an event for each of the flares for each criteria in paragraph (o)(3) of this section that was met during that event. Prior to June 3, 2024, the owner or operator shall also determine the total number of events for which a root cause and correct action analyses was required and the analyses concluded that the root cause was a force majeure event, as defined in this subpart.

Out-of-control periods
. For each CPMS installed to comply with applicable provisions in § 63.670 except for CPMS installed for pilot flame monitoring, the owner or operator shall comply with the out-of-control procedures described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) A CPMS is out-of-control if the zero (low-level), mid-level (if applicable) or high-level calibration drift exceeds two times the accuracy requirement of table 13 of this subpart.
(2) When the CPMS is out of control, the owner or operator shall take the necessary corrective action and repeat all necessary tests that indicate the system is out of control. The owner or operator shall take corrective action and conduct retesting until the performance requirements are below the applicable limits. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour a performance check (
e.g.
, calibration drift) that indicates an exceedance of the performance requirements established in this section is conducted. The end of the out-of-control period is the hour following the completion of corrective action and successful demonstration that the system is within the allowable limits. The owner or operator shall not use data recorded during periods the CPMS is out of control in data averages and calculations, used to report emissions or operating levels, as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(d)
CPMS data reduction
. The owner or operator shall reduce data from a CPMS installed to comply with applicable provisions in § 63.670 as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator may round the data to the same number of significant digits used in that operating limit.
(2) Periods of non-operation of the process unit (or portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies must not be included in the 15-minute block averages.
(3) Periods when the CPMS is out of control must not be included in the 15-minute block averages.
(e)
Additional requirements for gas chromatographs.
For monitors used to determine compositional analysis for net heating value per § 63.670(j)(1) that include a gas chromatograph, the gas chromatograph must also meet the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) The quality assurance requirements are in table 13 of this subpart.
(2) The calibration gases must meet one of the following options:
(i) The owner or operator must use a calibration gas or multiple gases that include all of compounds listed in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) through (K) of this section that may be reasonably expected to exist in the flare gas stream and optionally include any of the compounds listed in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(L) through (O) of this section. All of the calibration gases may be combined in one cylinder. If multiple calibration gases are necessary to cover all compounds, the owner or operator must calibrate the instrument on all of the gases.
(A) Hydrogen.
(B) Methane.
(C) Ethane.
(D) Ethylene.
(E) Propane.
(F) Propylene.
(G) n-Butane.
(H) iso-Butane.
(I) Butene (general). It is not necessary to separately speciate butene isomers, but the net heating value of trans-butene must be used for co-eluting butene isomers.
(J) 1,3-Butadiene. It is not necessary to separately speciate butadiene isomers, but you must use the response factor and net heating value of 1,3-butadiene for co-eluting butadiene isomers.
(K) n-Pentane. Use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify all C5+ hydrocarbons.
(L) Acetylene (optional).
(M) Carbon monoxide (optional).
(N) Propadiene (optional).
(O) Hydrogen sulfide (optional).
(ii) The owner or operator must use a surrogate calibration gas consisting of
hydrogen and C1 through C5 normal hydrocarbons. All of the calibration gases may be combined in one cylinder. If multiple calibration gases are necessary to cover all compounds, the owner or operator must calibrate the instrument on all of the gases.
(3) If the owner or operator chooses to use a surrogate calibration gas under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Use the response factor for the nearest normal hydrocarbon (
i.e.,
n-alkane) in the calibration mixture to quantify unknown components detected in the analysis.
(ii) Use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify unknown components detected in the analysis that elute after n-pentane.
(4) Beginning on April 4, 2024, the owner or operator must initially determine the average instrument calibration error during the Seven (7)-Day Calibration Error Test Period and subsequently perform daily calibration and quarterly audits using either the compound-specific calibration error (CE) method provided in paragraph (i) of this section or using the net heating value (NHV) method provided in paragraph (ii) of this section.
(i) The average instrument CE for each calibration compound at any calibration concentration must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE for each component in the calibration blend must be calculated using the following equation:
Where:
ER04AP24.000
Where:
C
m
= Average instrument response (ppm).
C
a
= Certified cylinder gas value (ppm).
(ii) The CE for NHV at any calibration level must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE for must be calculated using the following equation:
ER04AP24.001
Where:
NHV
measured
= Average instrument response (Btu/scf). NHV calculations must be based on the individual component properties in table 12 of this subpart.
NHV
a
= Certified cylinder gas value (Btu/scf).
(f)
Additional requirements for continuous process mass spectrometers.
Beginning on April 4, 2024, for continuous process mass spectrometers used to determine compositional analysis for net heating value per § 63.670(j)(1) without the use of gas chromatography, the continuous process mass spectrometer must also meet the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) You must meet the calibration gas requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. You may augment the minimum list of calibration gas components found in paragraph (e)(2) of this section with compounds found during a pre-survey or known to be in the gas through process knowledge.
(2) Calibration gas cylinders (
i.e.,
low-, mid-, and high-levels) must be certified to an accuracy of 2 percent and traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.
(3) For unknown gas components that have similar analytical mass fragments to calibration compounds, you
may report the unknowns as an increase in the overlapped calibration gas compound. For unknown compounds that produce mass fragments that do not overlap calibration compounds, you may use the response factor for the nearest molecular weight hydrocarbon in the calibration mix to quantify the unknown component's net heating value of flare vent gas (NHV
vg
).
(4) You may use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify any unknown components detected with a higher molecular weight than n-pentane.
(5) You must perform an initial calibration to identify mass fragment overlap and response factors for the target compounds.
(6) You must meet applicable requirements in Table 13 of this subpart for Net Heating Value by Mass Spectrometer.
(7) The owner or operator must estimate the instrument calibration error in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section.

Off-site material management units.
For each operation specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is located at the plant site, the affected source is the entire group of off-site material management units associated with the operation. An off-site material management unit is a tank, container, surface impoundment, oil-water separator, organic-water separator, or
transfer system used to manage off-site material. For the purpose of implementing the standards under this subpart, a unit that meets the definition of a tank or container but also is equipped with a vent that serves as a process vent for any of the processes listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section is not an off-site material management unit but instead is a process vent and is to be included in the appropriate affected source group under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Examples of such a unit may include, but are not limited to, a distillate receiver vessel, a primary condenser, a bottoms receiver vessel, a surge control tank, a separator tank, and a hot well.
(2)
Process vents.
For each operation specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is located at the plant site, the affected source is the entire group of process equipment associated with the process vents for the processes listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section.
(i) Distillation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Distillation means a process, either batch or continuous, separating one or more off-site material feed streams into two or more exit streams having different component concentrations from those in the feed stream or streams. The separation is achieved by the redistribution of the components between the liquid and vapor phases as they approach equilibrium within the distillation unit.
(ii) Fractionation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Fractionation means a liquid mixture separation process or method used to separate a mixture of several volatile components of different boiling points in successive stages, each stage removing from the mixture some proportion of one of the components.
(iii) Thin-film evaporation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Thin-film evaporation means a liquid mixture separation process or method that uses a heating surface consisting of a large diameter tube that may be either straight or tapered, horizontal or vertical. Liquid is spread on the tube wall by a rotating assembly of blades that maintain a close clearance from the wall or actually ride on the film of liquid on the wall.
(iv) Solvent extraction process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Solvent extraction means a separation process or method in which a solid or a solution is contacted with a liquid solvent (the material and the solvent being relatively insoluble in each other) to preferentially dissolve and transfer one or more components into the solvent.
(v) Steam stripping process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Steam stripping means a liquid mixture separation process or method in which vaporization of the volatile components of a liquid mixture occurs by the introduction of steam directly into the process.
(vi) Gas stripping process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Gas stripping means a desorption process or method used to transfer one or more volatile components from a liquid mixture into a gas stream either with or without the application of heat to the liquid. Packed towers, spray towers, and bubble-cap, sieve, or valve-type plate towers are examples of the process configurations used for contacting the gas and a liquid.
(3)
Equipment leaks.
For each operation specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is located at the plant site, the affected source is the entire group of equipment components for which each component meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section. If any one of these conditions do not apply to an equipment component, then that component is not part of the affected source for equipment leaks.
(i) The equipment component is a pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, or instrumentation system;
(ii) The equipment component contains or contacts off-site material having a total HAP concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight; and
(iii) The equipment component is intended to operate for 300 hours or more during a calendar year in off-site material service, as defined in § 63.681 of this subpart.
(d)
Facility-wide exemption.
The owner or operator of affected sources subject to this subpart is exempted from the requirements of §§ 63.682 through 63.699 of this subpart in situations when the total annual quantity of the HAP that is contained in the off-site material received at the plant site is less than 1 megagram per year. For a plant site to be exempted under the provisions of this paragraph (d), the owner or operator must meet the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator must prepare an initial determination of the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site. This determination is based on the total quantity of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart as determined at the point-of-delivery for each off-site material stream.
(2) The owner or operator must prepare a new determination whenever the extent of changes to the quantity or composition of the off-site material received at the plant site could cause the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site to exceed the limit of 1 megagram per year.
(3) The owner or operator must maintain documentation to support the owner's or operator's determination of the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site.

Pressure release
means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period.
Pressure relief device or valve
means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
Process heater

Separator
means a waste management unit, generally a tank, used to separate oil or organics from water. A separator consists of not only the separation unit but also the forebay and other separator basins, skimmers, weirs, grit chambers, sludge hoppers, and bar screens that are located directly after the individual drain system and prior to any additional treatment units such as an air flotation unit clarifier or biological treatment unit. Examples of a separator include, but are not limited
to, an API separator, parallel-plate interceptor, and corrugated-plate interceptor with the associated ancillary equipment.

means a unit that is a natural topographical depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids. Examples of surface impoundments include holding, storage, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.
Tank
means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or plastic) which provide structural support and is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids or other materials.
Transfer system
means a stationary system for which the predominant function is to convey liquids or solid materials from one point to another point within a waste management operation or recovery operation. For the purpose of this subpart, the conveyance of material using a container (as defined for this subpart) or a self-propelled vehicle (e.g., a front-end loader) is not a transfer system. Examples of a transfer system include but are not limited to a pipeline, an individual drain system, a gravity-operated conveyor (such as a chute), and a mechanically-powered conveyor (such as a belt or screw conveyor).
Temperature monitoring device
means a piece of equipment used to monitor temperature and having an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius (°C) or ±1.2 degrees °C, whichever value is greater.

A treatment process can be composed of a single unit (e.g., a steam stripper) or a series of units (e.g., a wastewater treatment system). A treatment process can be used to treat one or more off-site material streams at the same time.
Used oil
means any oil refined from crude oil or any synthetic oil that has been used and as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities. This definition is the same definition of “used oil” in 40 CFR 279.1.
Used solvent
means a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons or a mixture of one and two ring aromatic hydrocarbons that has been used as a solvent and as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities.

or
VOHAP concentration
means the fraction by weight of those compounds listed in Table 1 of this subpart that are in an off-site material as measured using Method 305 in appendix A of this part and expressed in terms of parts per million (ppm). As an alternative to using Method 305, an owner or operator may determine the HAP concentration of an off-site material using any one of the other test methods specified in § 63.694(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart. When a test method specified in § 63.694(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart other than Method 305 is used to determine the speciated HAP concentration of an off-site material, the individual compound concentration may be adjusted by the corresponding f
m305
value listed in Table 1 of this subpart to determine a VOHAP concentration.
Waste
means a material generated from industrial, commercial, mining, or agricultural operations or from community activities that is discarded, discharged, or is being accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated prior to being discarded or discharged.
Waste management operation
means the collection of off-site material management units, process vents, and equipment components used at a plant site to manage an off-site material stream from the point-of-delivery to the point where the waste exits or is
discharged from the plant site or the waste is placed for on-site disposal in a unit not subject to this subpart (e.g., a waste incinerator, a land disposal unit).
Waste stabilization process
means any physical or chemical process used to either reduce the mobility of hazardous constituents in a waste or eliminate free liquids as determined by Test Method 9095—Paint Filter Liquids Test in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication No. SW-846, Third Edition, September 1986, as amended by Update I, November 15, 1992. (As an alternative, an owner or operator may use any more recent, updated version of Method 9095 approved by the EPA.) A waste stabilization process includes mixing the waste with binders or other materials and curing the resulting waste and binder mixture. Other synonymous terms used to refer to this process are “waste fixation” or “waste solidification.” A waste stabilization process does not include the adding of absorbent materials to the surface of a waste, without mixing, agitation, or subsequent curing, to absorb free liquid.

Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 8.1.1 of Method 21 shall be for the weighted average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit at the time of monitoring, not for each individual organic constituent.
(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppmv.
(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (k)(8)(i) or (k)(8)(ii) of this section.
(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (k)(9) of this section.
(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (k)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (k)(9) of this section.
(9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (k)(9)(i) and (k)(9)(ii) of this section.
(i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that
passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (k)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
(ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (k)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.

Prior to each inspection, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in accordance with the reporting requirements specified in § 63.697 of this subpart.
(C) If a tank ceases to hold off-site material for a period of 1 year or more, subsequent introduction of off-site material into the tank shall be considered an initial operation for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(D) The owner shall determine the total surface area of gaps in the primary seal and in the secondary seal individually using the following procedure.
(
1
) The seal gap measurements shall be performed at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof supports.
(
2
) Seal gaps, if any, shall be measured around the entire perimeter of the floating roof in each place where a 0.32-centimeter (cm) (
1/8
-inch) diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the tank and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
(
3
) For a seal gap measured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the gap surface area shall be determined by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the tank wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.
(
4
) The total gap area shall be calculated by adding the gap surface areas determined for each identified gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually, and then dividing the sum for each seal type by the nominal diameter of the tank. These total gap areas for the primary seal and secondary seal are then compared to the respective standards for the seal type as specified in § 63.685(f)(1) of this subpart.
(E) In the event that the seal gap measurements do not conform to the specifications in § 63.685(f)(1) of this subpart, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

(ii) Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 calendar days if the owner or operator determines that repair of the defect requires emptying or temporary removal from service of the transfer system and no alternative transfer system is available at the site to accept the material normally handled by the system. In this case, the owner or operator shall repair the defect the next time the process or unit that is generating the material handled by the transfer system stops operation. Repair of the defect must be completed before the process or unit resumes operation.
(iii) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect repair in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.696 of this subpart.
(e)
Control device monitoring requirements.
For each control device required under § 63.693 to be monitored in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (e), the owner or operator must ensure that each control device operates properly by monitoring the control device in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) A continuous parameter monitoring system must be used to measure the operating parameter or parameters specified for the control device in § 63.693(d) through § 63.693(g) of this subpart as applicable to the type and design of the control device. The continuous parameter monitoring system must meet the following specifications and requirements:
(i) The continuous parameter monitoring system must measure either an instantaneous value at least once every 15 minutes or an average value for intervals of 15 minutes or less and continuously record either:
(A) Each measured data value; or
(B) Each block average value for each 1-hour period or shorter periods calculated from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) block average instead of all measured values.
(ii) The monitoring system must be installed, calibrated, operated, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications or other written procedures that provide reasonable assurance that the monitoring equipment is operating properly.
(2) Using the data recorded by the monitoring system, the owner or operator must calculate the daily average value for each monitored operating parameter for each operating day. If operation of the control device is continuous, the operating day is a 24-hour period. If control device operation is not continuous, the operating day is the total number of hours of control device operation per 24-hour period. Valid data points must be available for 75 percent of the operating hours in an operating day to compute the daily average.
(3) For each monitored operating parameter, the owner or operator must
establish a minimum operating parameter value or a maximum operating parameter value, as appropriate, to define the range of conditions at which the control device must be operated to continuously achieve the applicable performance requirements specified in § 63.693(b)(2) of this subpart. Each minimum or maximum operating parameter value must be established in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
(i) If the owner or operator conducts a performance test to demonstrate control device performance, then the minimum or maximum operating parameter value must be established based on values measured during the performance test and supplemented, as necessary, by the control device design specifications, manufacturer recommendations, or other applicable information.
(ii) If the owner or operator uses a control device design analysis to demonstrate control device performance, then the minimum or maximum operating parameter value must be established based on the control device design analysis and supplemented, as necessary, by the control device manufacturer recommendations or other applicable information.
(4) A deviation for a given control device is determined to have occurred when the monitoring data or lack of monitoring data result in any one of the criteria specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section being met. When multiple operating parameters are monitored for the same control device and during the same operating day more than one of these operating parameters meets a deviation criterion specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, then a single deviation is determined to have occurred for the control device for that operating day.
(i) A deviation occurs when the daily average value of a monitored operating parameter is less than the minimum operating parameter limit (or, if applicable, greater than the maximum operating parameter limit) established for the operating parameter in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(ii) A deviation occurs when the period of control device operation is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and the monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours. Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour.
(iii) A deviation occurs when the period of control device operation is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than 1 of the hours during the period does not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data. Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour.
(5) For each deviation, except when the deviation occurs during periods of non-operation of the unit or the process that is vented to the control device (resulting in cessation of HAP emissions to which the monitoring applies), the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied control in a manner that achieves the required operating parameter limits. Failure to achieve the required operating parameter limits is a violation of this standard.
(f)
Alternative inspection and monitoring interval.
Following the initial inspection and monitoring of a piece of air pollution control equipment in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section, subsequent inspection and monitoring of the equipment may be performed at intervals longer than 1 year when an owner or operator determines that performing the required inspection or monitoring procedures would expose a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions and the owner or operator complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator must prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation identifying the specific air pollution control equipment designated as “unsafe to inspect and monitor.” The documentation
must include for each piece of air pollution control equipment designated as such a written explanation of the reasons why the equipment is unsafe to inspect or monitor using the applicable procedures under this section.
(2) The owner or operator must develop and implement a written plan and schedule to inspect and monitor the air pollution control equipment using the applicable procedures specified in this section during times when a worker can safely access the air pollution control equipment. The required inspections and monitoring must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not need to be performed more frequently than the periodic schedule that would be otherwise applicable to the air pollution control equipment under the provisions of this section. A copy of the written plan and schedule must be maintained at the plant site.

# Subpart EE—National Emission Standards for Magnetic Tape Manufacturing Operations

# Source:
59 FR 64596, Dec. 15, 1994, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.701
Applicability.
(a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the provisions of this subpart apply to:
(1) Each new and existing magnetic tape manufacturing operation located at a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions; and
(2) A magnetic tape manufacturing operation for which the owner or operator chooses to use the provisions of § 63.703(b) and (h) to obtain a Federally enforceable limit on its potential to emit HAP.

# Explanatory Note:
A reason the owner or operator would make the choice described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is if the plant site, without this limit, would be a major source. The owner or operator could use this limit, which would establish the potential to emit from magnetic tape manufacturing operations, in conjunction with the potential to emit from the other HAP emission points at the stationary source, to be an area source. Note, however, that an owner or operator is not required to use the provisions in § 63.703(b) and (h) to determine the potential to emit HAP from magnetic tape manufacturing operations.
(b) This subpart does not apply to the following:
(1) Research or laboratory facilities; and
(2) Any coating operation that produces a quantity of magnetic tape that is 1 percent or less of total production (in terms of total square footage coated) from that coating operation in any 12-month period.
(c) The affected source subject to this standard is the magnetic tape manufacturing operation, as defined in § 63.702.
(d) An owner or operator of an existing affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply according to the following schedule:
(1) Within 3 years after the effective date of the standard, if the owner or operator is required to install a new add-on air pollution control device to meet the requirements of § 63.703(c) or (g); or
(2) Within 2 years after the effective date of the standard, if a new add-on air pollution control device is not needed to comply with § 63.703(c) or (g) of these standards.
(e) The compliance date for an owner or operator of a new affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart is immediately upon startup of the affected source.
(f) The provisions of this subpart apply during periods of startup and shutdown, and whenever magnetic tape manufacturing operations are taking place.
(g) Owners or operators of affected sources subject to the provisions of this subpart shall also comply with the requirements of subpart A as identified in Table 1, according to the applicability of subpart A to such sources.
(h) In any title V permit for an affected source, all research or laboratory facilities that are exempt from the requirements of this subpart shall be clearly identified.
§ 63.702
Definitions.
(a) All terms used in this subpart that are not defined below have the meaning given to them in the Clean Air Act and in subpart A of this part.
Add-on air pollution control device
means equipment installed at the end of a process vent exhaust stack or stacks that reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to the air. The device may destroy or secure the pollutant for subsequent recovery. Examples are incinerators, condensers, carbon adsorbers, and biofiltration units. Transfer equipment and ductwork are not considered in and of themselves add-on air pollution control devices.
Bag slitter
means a device for enclosed transfer of particulates. A bag of raw materials is placed in a hopper, the hopper is closed, and an internal mechanism slits the bag, releasing the particulates into either a closed conveyor that feeds the mix preparation equipment or into the mix preparation equipment itself.
Base substrate
means the surface, such as plastic or paper, to which a coating is applied.
Capture efficiency
means the fraction of all organic vapors or other pollutants generated by a process that are directed to an add-on air pollution control device.
Capture device
means a hood, enclosed room, or other means of collecting HAP vapors or other pollutants into a duct that exhausts to an add-on air pollution control device.
Carbon adsorber vessel
means one vessel in a series of vessels in a carbon adsorption system that contains carbon and is used to remove gaseous pollutants from a gaseous emission source.
Car seal
means a seal that is placed on a device that is used either to open a closed valve or close an opened valve so that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal.
Closed system for flushing fixed lines
means a system in which the line to be flushed is disconnected from its original position and connected to two closed containers, one that contains cleaning solvent and one that is empty. Solvent is flushed from the container with cleaning solvent, through the line, and into the empty containers.
Coater or coating applicator
means the apparatus used to apply a coating to a continuous base substrate.
Coating application
means the process by which the coating mix is applied to the base substrate.
Coating operation
means any coater, flashoff area, and drying oven located between a base substrate unwind station and a base substrate rewind station that coats a continuous base substrate.
Control device efficiency
means the ratio of the emissions collected or destroyed by an add-on air pollution control device to the total emissions that are introduced to the control device, expressed as a percentage.
Day
means a 24-consecutive-hour period.
Drying oven
means a chamber that uses heat to bake, cure, polymerize, or dry a surface coating; if the coating contains volatile solvents, the volatile portion is evaporated in the oven.
Enclosed transfer method
means a particulate HAP transfer method that uses an enclosed system to prevent particulate HAP from entering the atmosphere as dust. Equipment used for this purpose may include vacuum injection
systems or other mechanical transfer systems, bag slitters, or supersacks.
Equivalent diameter
means four times the area of an opening divided by its perimeter.
Facility
means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common ownership or control in which magnetic tape manufacturing is performed. The definition includes properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way.
Flashoff area
means the portion of a coating operation between the coater and the drying oven where solvent begins to evaporate from the coated base substrate.
Flushing of fixed lines
means the flushing of solvent through lines that are typically fixed and are not associated with the cleaning of a tank, such as the line from the mix room to the coater.
Freeboard ratio
means the vertical distance from the surface of the liquid to the top of the sink or tank (freeboard height) divided by the smaller of the length or width of the sink or tank evaporative area.
Magnetic coatings
means coatings applied to base substrates to make magnetic tape. Components of magnetic coatings may include: Magnetic particles, binders, dispersants, conductive pigments, lubricants, solvents, and other additives.
Magnetic particles
means particles in the coating mix that have magnetic properties. Examples of magnetic particles used in magnetic tape manufacturing are: y-oxide, doped iron oxides, chromium dioxide, barium ferrite, and metallic particles that usually consist of elemental iron, cobalt, and/or nickel.
Magnetic tape
means any flexible base substrate that is covered on one or both sides with a coating containing magnetic particles and that is used for audio recording, video recording, or any type of information storage.
Magnetic tape manufacturing operation
means all of the emission points within a magnetic tape manufacturing facility that are specifically associated with the manufacture of magnetic tape. These include, but are not limited to:
(1) Solvent storage tanks;
(2) Mix preparation equipment;
(3) Coating operations;
(4) Waste handling devices;
(5) Particulate transfer operations;
(6) Wash sinks for cleaning removable parts;
(7) Cleaning involving the flushing of fixed lines;
(8) Wastewater treatment systems; and
(9) Condenser vents associated with distillation and stripping columns in the solvent recovery area, but not including the vent on a condenser that is used as the add-on air pollution control device.

Mix preparation equipment
means the vessels, except for mills, used to prepare the magnetic coating.
Natural draft opening
means any opening in a room, building, or total enclosure that remains open during operation of the facility and that is not connected to a duct in which a fan is installed. The rate and direction of the natural draft through such an opening is a consequence of the difference in pressures on either side of the wall containing the opening.
Nonregenerative carbon adsorber
means a carbon adsorber vessel in which the spent carbon bed does not undergo carbon regeneration in the adsorption vessel.
Operating parameter value
means a minimum or maximum value established for a control device or process parameter that, if achieved by itself or in combination with one or more other operating parameter values, determines that an owner or operator has complied with an applicable emission limitation or standard.
Overall HAP control efficiency
means the total efficiency of the control system, determined by the product of the capture efficiency and the control device efficiency.
Particulate
means any material, except uncombined water, that exists as liquid or solid particles such as dust,
smoke, mist, or fumes at standard conditions (760 millimeters of mercury, 0 degrees celsius).
Particulate HAP transfer
means the introduction of a particulate HAP into other dry ingredients or a liquid solution.
Removable parts cleaning
means cleaning of parts that have been moved from their normal position to a wash tank or sink containing solvent for the purpose of cleaning.
Research or laboratory facility
means any stationary source whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development to develop new processes and products, where such source is operated under the close supervision of technically trained personnel and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de minimis manner.
Separator
means a device in the wastewater treatment system in which immiscible solvent is physically separated from the water with which it is mixed.
Solvent storage tanks
means the stationary tanks that are associated with magnetic tape operations and that store virgin solvent, spent solvent, cleaning solvent, solvent at any stage of the solvent recovery process, or any volatile compound. They do not serve a process function.
Solvent recovery area
means the collection of devices used to remove HAP emissions from process air, to recover the HAP, and to purify the HAP. Typically, this area contains a control device such as a carbon adsorber or condenser, the wastewater treatment system, and the distillation columns.
Solvent recovery device
means, for the purposes of this subpart, an add-on air pollution control device in which HAP is captured rather than destroyed. Examples include carbon adsorption systems and condensers.
Supersack
means a container of particulate from the manufacturer or supplier with attached feed tubes and that is used to transfer particulate under the following conditions: the feed tubes are attached directly to the mix preparation equipment, the attachment interface is sealed, and all openings on the mix transfer equipment are closed to the atmosphere.
Temporary total enclosure
means a total enclosure that is constructed for the sole purpose of measuring the fugitive emissions from an affected source. A temporary total enclosure must be constructed and ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has minimal impact on the performance of the permanent capture system. A temporary total enclosure will be assumed to achieve total capture of fugitive emissions if it conforms to the requirements found in § 63.705(c)(4)(i) and if all natural draft openings are at least four duct or hood equivalent diameters away from each exhaust duct or hood. Alternatively, the owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for approval of a temporary enclosure on a case-by-case basis.
Total enclosure
means a structure that is constructed around a gaseous emission source so that all gaseous pollutants emitted from the source are collected and ducted through a control device, such that 100 percent capture efficiency is achieved. There are no fugitive emissions from a total enclosure. The only openings in a total enclosure are forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and any natural draft openings such as those that allow raw materials to enter and exit the enclosure for processing. All access doors or windows are closed during routine operation of the enclosed source. Brief, occasional openings of such doors or windows to accommodate process equipment adjustments are acceptable, but if such openings are routine or if an access door remains open during the entire operation, the access door must be considered a natural draft opening. The average inward face velocity across the natural draft openings of the enclosure must be calculated including the area of such access doors. The drying oven itself may be part of the total enclosure. A permanent enclosure that meets the requirements found in § 63.705(c)(4)(i) is a total enclosure.
Utilize
means the use of HAP that is delivered to mix preparation equipment for the purpose of formulating coatings, the use of any other HAP (e.g., dilution solvent) that is added at any point in the manufacturing process, and the use of any HAP for cleaning activities. Alternatively, annual
HAP utilization can be determined as net usage; that is, the HAP inventory at the beginning of a 12-month period, plus the amount of HAP purchased during the 12-month period, minus the amount of HAP in inventory at the end of a 12-month period.
Vacuum injection system
means a system in which a vacuum draws particulate from a storage container into a closed system that transfers particulates into the mix preparation equipment.
Volatile organic compound (VOC)
means any organic compound that participates in atmospheric photochemical reactions or that is measured by EPA Test Methods 18, 24, or 25A in appendix A of part 60 or an alternative test method as defined in § 63.2.
Volatile organic hazardous air pollutant (VOHAP) concentration
means the concentration of an individually-speciated organic HAP in a wastewater discharge that is measured by Method 305 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 63.
Waste handling
means processing or treatment of waste (liquid or solid) that is generated as a by-product of either the magnetic tape production process or cleaning operations.
Waste handling device
means equipment that is used to separate solvent from solid waste (e.g., filter dryers) or liquid waste (e.g., pot stills and thin film evaporators). The solvents are recovered by heating, condensing, and collection.
Wastewater discharge
means the water phase that is discharged from the separator in a wastewater treatment system.
Wastewater treatment system
means the assortment of devices in which the solvent/water mixture, generated when the carbon bed in the carbon adsorber is desorbed by steam, is treated to remove residual organics in the water.

If multiple emission points are vented to one common control device to meet the requirements of § 63.703 (c), (d)(2), (e)(1), and (f)(1), only one performance test is required to demonstrate initial compliance for that group of emission points. This section also contains initial compliance demonstration procedures (other than testing) for owners or operators subject to § 63.703 (c), (d)(1), (e)(1)(ii), (f)(1)(ii), and (g).
(1) A control device (not enclosure) used to comply with § 63.703 (c), (e), or (f) does not need to be tested if each of the following criteria are met:
(i) It is used to control gaseous HAP emissions from an existing affected source;
(ii) It is operating prior to March 11, 1994;
(iii) It is equipped with continuous emission monitors for determining inlet and outlet total HAP or VOC concentration, such that a percent efficiency can be calculated; and

(1) EPA Method 24 of appendix A of part 60 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that plant coating formulation data are equivalent to EPA Method 24 results, formulation data may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between an EPA Method 24 test and an affected source's formulation data, the EPA Method 24 test will govern. For EPA Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample taken into a 1-liter container at a location and time such that the sample will be representative of the coating applied to the base substrate (i.e., the sample shall include any dilution solvent or other VOC added during the manufacturing process). The container must be tightly sealed immediately after the sample is taken. Any solvent or other VOC added after the sample is taken must be measured and accounted for in the calculations that use EPA Method 24 results.
(2) Formulation data is used to determine the HAP content of coatings.
(3) Either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A of appendix A of part 60, as appropriate to the conditions at the site, shall be used to determine HAP or VOC concentration of air exhaust streams as required by § 63.705(c). The owner or operator shall submit notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with the notification of the performance test required under § 63.7(b). Method selection shall be based on consideration of the diversity of organic species present and their total concentration and on consideration of the potential presence of interfering gases. Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.
(i) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual carbon adsorber vessels pursuant to § 63.705(c) (2) or (4), the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the adsorption cycles of all of the individual carbon adsorber vessels.
(ii) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel pursuant to § 63.705(c) (3) or (4), each carbon adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The test for each carbon adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.
(4) EPA Method 1 or 1A of appendix A of part 60 is used for sample and velocity traverses.
(5) EPA Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of part 60 is used for velocity and volumetric flow rates.
(6) EPA Method 3 of appendix A of part 60 is used for gas analysis.

The specific requirement of Method 305 of appendix A of this part to collect the sample into polyethylene glycol would not be applicable.
(A) If measuring the total VOHAP concentration of the exit stream in accordance with §§ 63.703(g)(1)(ii) and 63.705(h)(2), the concentrations of the individual organic HAP measured in the water shall be corrected to their concentrations had they been measured by Method 305 of appendix A of this part. This is done by multiplying each concentration by the compound-specific fraction measured factor (F
M
) listed in table 34 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart G.
(B) If measuring the total HAP concentration of an inlet and outlet wastewater stream to demonstrate compliance with § 63.703(g)(1)(i) and following the procedures of § 63.705(h)(3), the concentrations of the individual organic HAP measured in the water do not need to be corrected.

The calculation of the HAP content of the coating used to demonstrate initial compliance with § 63.703(c)(5) shall be submitted to the Administrator with the notification of compliance status required by § 63.9(h) and § 63.707(e). When demonstrating compliance by this procedure, § 63.7(e)(3) of subpart A does not apply.
(i) Determine the weight fraction of HAP in each coating applied using formulation data as specified in § 63.705(b)(2);
(ii) Determine the volume of coating solids in each coating applied from the facility records; and
(iii) Compute the mass of HAP per volume of coating solids by equation 7:
ER15DE94.011

gaseous emission source so that all gaseous pollutants emitted from the source are collected and ducted through a control device, such that 100% capture efficiency is achieved. There are no fugitive emissions from a total enclosure. The only openings in a total enclosure are forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and any natural draft openings such as those that allow raw materials to enter and exit the enclosure for processing. All access doors or windows are closed during routine operation of the enclosed source. Brief, occasional openings of such doors or windows to accommodate process equipment adjustments are acceptable, but if such openings are routine or if an access door remains open during the entire operation, the access door must be considered a natural draft opening. The average inward face velocity across the natural draft openings of the enclosure must be calculated including the area of such access doors. The drying oven itself may be part of the total enclosure. An enclosure that meets the requirements found in § 63.750(g)(4) is a permanent total enclosure.

Type II etchant
means a chemical milling etchant that is a strong sodium hydroxide solution containing amines.
Volatile organic compound (VOC)
means any compound defined as VOC in 40 CFR 51.100. This includes any organic compound other than those determined by the EPA to be an exempt solvent. For purposes of determining compliance with emission limits, VOC will be measured by the approved test methods. Where such a method also inadvertently measures compounds that are exempt solvent, an owner or operator may exclude these exempt solvents when determining compliance with an emission standard.
Waterborne (water-reducible) coating
means any coating that contains more than 5 percent water by weight as applied in its volatile fraction.
Waterwash system
means a control system that utilizes flowing water (i.e., a conventional waterwash system) or a pumpless system to remove particulate emissions from the exhaust air stream in spray coating application or dry media blast depainting operations.

Notification shall be submitted on or before March 1 of each year and shall include the information required in § 63.5(b)(4) for each such spray booth or hangar constructed or reconstructed during the prior calendar year, except that such information shall be limited to inorganic HAP. No advance notification or written approval from the Administrator pursuant to § 63.5(b)(3) shall be required for the construction or reconstruction of such a spray booth or hangar unless the booth or hangar has the potential to emit 10 tons/yr or more of an individual inorganic HAP or 25 tons/yr or more of all inorganic HAP combined.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) An owner or operator who uses an air pollution control device or equipment not listed in this subpart shall submit a description of the device or equipment, test data verifying the performance of the device or equipment in controlling organic HAP and/or VOC emissions, as appropriate, and specific operating parameters that will be monitored to establish compliance with the standards to the Administrator for approval not later than 120 days prior to the compliance date.
(d) Instead of complying with the individual coating limits in §§ 63.745 and 63.747, a facility may choose to comply with the averaging provisions specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section.
(1) Each owner or operator of a new or existing source shall use any combination of primers, topcoats (including self-priming topcoats), specialty coatings, Type I chemical milling maskants, or Type II chemical milling maskants such that the monthly volume-weighted average organic HAP and VOC contents of the combination of primers, topcoats, specialty coatings, Type I chemical milling maskants, or Type II chemical milling maskants, as determined in accordance with the applicable procedures set forth in § 63.750, complies with the specified content limits in §§ 63.745(c) and 63.747(c), unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
(2) Averaging is allowed only for uncontrolled primers, topcoats (including self-priming topcoats), specialty coatings, Type I chemical milling maskants, or Type II chemical milling maskants.
(3) Averaging is not allowed between specialty coating types defined in appendix A to this subpart, or between the different types of coatings specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section.
(i) Primers and topcoats (including self-priming topcoats).
(ii) Type I and Type II chemical milling maskants.
(iii) Primers and chemical milling maskants.
(iv) Topcoats and chemical milling maskants.

(vi) Topcoats and specialty coatings.
(vii) Chemical milling maskants and specialty coatings.
(4)—(5) [Reserved]
(6) Each averaging scheme shall be approved in advance by the permitting agency and adopted as part of the facility's title V permit.
(e) At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not
limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.

§ 63.744
Standards: Cleaning operations.
(a)
Housekeeping measures
. Each owner or operator of a new or existing cleaning operation subject to this subpart shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section unless the cleaning solvent used is identified in Table 1 of this section or meets the definition of “Non-HAP material” in 63.742. The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section do not apply to spent cleaning solvents, and solvent-laden applicators that are subject to and handled and stored in compliance with 40 CFR parts 262 through 268 (including the air emission control requirements in 40 CFR part 265, subpart CC).
(1) Unless the owner or operator satisfies the requirements in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, place used solvent-laden cloth, paper, or any other absorbent applicators used for cleaning in bags or other closed containers. Ensure that these bags and containers are kept closed at all times except when depositing or removing these materials from the container. Use bags and containers of such design so as to contain the vapors of the cleaning solvent. Cotton-tipped swabs used for very small cleaning operations are exempt from this requirement.
(2) Unless the owner or operator satisfies the requirements in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, store fresh and spent cleaning solvents, except semi-aqueous solvent cleaners, used in aerospace cleaning operations in closed containers.
(3) Conduct the handling and transfer of cleaning solvents to or from enclosed systems, vats, waste containers, and other cleaning operation equipment that hold or store fresh or spent cleaning solvents in such a manner that minimizes spills.
(4) Demonstrate to the Administrator (or delegated State, local, or Tribal authority) that equivalent or better alternative measures are in place compared to the use of closed containers for the solvent-laden materials described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or the storage of solvents described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(b)
Hand-wipe cleaning.
Each owner or operator of a new or existing hand-wipe cleaning operation (excluding cleaning of spray gun equipment performed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section) subject to this subpart shall use cleaning solvents that meet one of the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section. Cleaning solvent solutions that contain HAP and VOC below the de minimis levels specified in § 63.741(f) are exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section.
(1) Meet one of the composition requirements in Table 1 of this section;
(2) Have a composite vapor pressure of 45 mm Hg (24.1 in. H
2
O) or less at 20 °C (68 °F); or
(3) Demonstrate that the volume of hand-wipe solvents used in cleaning operations has been reduced by at least 60% from a baseline adjusted for production. The baseline shall be established as part of an approved alternative plan administered by the State. Demonstrate that the volume of hand-wipe cleaning solvents used in cleaning operations has been reduced by at least 60 percent from a baseline adjusted for production. The baseline shall be calculated using data from 1996 and 1997, or as otherwise agreed upon by the Administrator or delegated State Authority. The baseline shall be approved by the Administrator or delegated State Authority and shall be included as part of the facility's title V or part 70 permit.
(c)
Spray gun cleaning.
Each owner or operator of a new or existing spray gun cleaning operation subject to this subpart in which spray guns are used for the application of coatings or any other materials that require the spray guns to be cleaned shall use one or more of the techniques, or their equivalent, specified in paragraphs (c)(1)
through (c)(4) of this section. Spray gun cleaning operations using cleaning solvent solutions that contain HAP and VOC below the de minimis levels specified in § 63.741(f) are exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
(1)(i) Enclosed system. Clean the spray gun in an enclosed system that is closed at all times except when inserting or removing the spray gun. Cleaning shall consist of forcing solvent through the gun.
(ii) If leaks are found during the monthly inspection required in § 63.751(a), repairs shall be made as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 days after the leak was found. If the leak is not repaired by the 15th day after detection, the cleaning solvent shall be removed, and the enclosed cleaner shall be shut down until the leak is repaired or its use is permanently discontinued.
(2)
Nonatomized cleaning.
Clean the spray gun by placing cleaning solvent in the pressure pot and forcing it through the gun with the atomizing cap in place. No atomizing air is to be used. Direct the cleaning solvent from the spray gun into a vat, drum, or other waste container that is closed when not in use.
(3) Disassembled spray gun cleaning. Disassemble the spray gun and clean the components by hand in a vat, which shall remain closed at all times except when in use. Alternatively, soak the components in a vat, which shall remain closed during the soaking period and when not inserting or removing components.
(4)
Atomizing cleaning.
Clean the spray gun by forcing the cleaning solvent through the gun and direct the resulting atomized spray into a waste container that is fitted with a device designed to capture the atomized cleaning solvent emissions.
(5) Cleaning of the nozzle tips of automated spray equipment systems, except for robotic systems that can be programmed to spray into a closed container, shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(d)
Flush cleaning.
Each owner or operator of a flush cleaning operation subject to this subpart (excluding those in which Table 1 or semi-aqueous cleaning solvents are used) shall empty the used cleaning solvent each time aerospace parts or assemblies, or components of a coating unit (with the exception of spray guns) are flush cleaned into an enclosed container or collection system that is kept closed when not in use or into a system with equivalent emission control.
(e)
Exempt cleaning operations.
The following cleaning operations are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section:
