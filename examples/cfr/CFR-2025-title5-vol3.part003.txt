§ 3401.101
General.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635. In addition to the standards in 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, employees are subject to the executive branch financial disclosure regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634, additional regulations on responsibilities and conduct at 5 CFR part 735, and Commission specific provisions contained in 18 CFR part 3c.
§ 3401.102
Prohibited financial interests.
(a)
General prohibition.
No employee, and no spouse or minor child of an employee, shall acquire or hold any securities issued by an entity on the prohibited securities list described in paragraph (b) of this section. The list shall include, but not be limited to the following:
(1) Natural gas companies;
(2) Interstate oil pipelines;
(3) Hydroelectric licensees or exemptees;
(4) Public utilities;
(5) Transmitting utilities or electric utilities engaged in the wholesale sale or transmission of electricity or having obtained an interconnection or wheeling order under part II of the Federal Power Act;
(6) Liquefied natural gas terminals as defined by section 3 of the Natural Gas Act; or
(7) Parent companies of an entity identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section.
(b)
Prohibited securities list.
A prohibited securities list shall be maintained, published, and distributed by the Office of the General Counsel's General and Administrative Law section, updated annually or on a more frequent basis to include entities that meet the criteria in paragraph (a) or are otherwise subject to the Commission's jurisdiction and to remove entities that do not raise impartiality concerns after considering the above criteria.
(c)
Exception.
Nothing in this section prohibits an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, from acquiring or holding an interest in a publicly traded or publicly available mutual fund or other collective investment fund, or in a widely held pension or mutual fund, provided: (1) That the employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in the fund; or (2) that the fund's prospectus or practice does not indicate the stated objective of concentrating its investments in entities identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section.
(d)
Reporting and divestiture
—(1)
Reporting of prohibited securities.
An employee must promptly report in writing to the DAEO any acquired interest prohibited under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. New employees must report in writing to the DAEO prohibited financial interests within 30 days of commencement of employment. Prohibited financial interests acquired after employment commences and without specific intent, such as through gift, inheritance, or marriage, must be reported in writing to the DAEO within 30 days of acquisition of such interest.
(2)
Divestiture of prohibited securities.
A prohibited financial interest must be
divested within 90 days from the date divestiture is ordered by the DAEO unless the employee obtains a written waiver from the DAEO in accordance with this section.
(3)
Disqualification pending divestiture.
Pending divestiture of prohibited securities, an employee must disqualify himself or herself, in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.402 and 3401.103, from participating in particular matters which, as a result of continued ownership of prohibited securities, could affect the financial interests of the employee or those of the spouse or minor child of the employee. Disqualification is not required where a waiver described in § 2635.402(d) applies.
(4)
Tax treatment of gain on divested securities.
Where divestiture is required by this section, the employee or the spouse or minor child of an employee may be eligible to defer the tax consequences of divestiture by obtaining a Certificate of Divestiture from the Director of the Office of Government Ethics before selling the securities in accordance with subpart J of 5 CFR part 2634.
(e)
Waiver.
The DAEO may grant a written waiver from this section based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 of this title or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of an employee's misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or to otherwise ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which the Commission's programs are administered, or in the case of a special Government employee, divestiture would result in substantial financial hardship. A waiver under this paragraph must be in writing and may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification.
(f)

For the purposes of this section:
(1) The term
securities
includes an interest in debt or equity instruments. The term includes, without limitation, secured and unsecured bonds, debentures, notes, securitized assets, and commercial paper, as well as all types of preferred and common stock. The term encompasses both current and contingent ownership interests, including any beneficial or legal interest derived from a trust.

This procedure is required notwithstanding the guidance in 5 CFR 2635.402(c)(2), 2635.502(e)(2), and 2635.604(c).
(b) An employee may withdraw written notice under paragraph (a) of this section upon determining that disqualification from participation in the matter is no longer required. A withdrawal of disqualification shall be in writing and shall be provided to the employee's supervisor and to the DAEO.
§ 3401.104
Prior approval for outside employment.
(a)
Prior approval requirement.
An employee, other than a special Government employee, must obtain written approval from the DAEO through normal supervisory channels before engaging in outside employment with any person who is a “prohibited source” as that term is defined at 5 CFR 2635.203(d).

§ 3501.101
General.
(a) In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Department of the Interior and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635. In addition to the regulations in 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, employees of the Department are subject to the employee responsibilities and conduct regulations at 5 CFR part 735; the executive branch financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634; and the Department's employee responsibilities and conduct regulations at 43 CFR part 20.
(b)
Definitions.
As used in this part:
(1)
Department
means the U.S. Department of the Interior and any of its components.
(2)
Bureau
means each major program operating component of the Department, the Office of the Secretary, the Office of the Solicitor, and the Office of the Inspector General.
(3)
Ethics Counselor
means the head of each bureau, except that the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy is the Ethics Counselor for employees within the Office of the Secretary.
(4)
Deputy Ethics Counselor
means the bureau personnel officer or other qualified headquarters employee who has been delegated responsibility for the operational duties of the Ethics Counselor for the bureau.
(c)
Bureau instructions.
With the concurrence of the Designated Agency Ethics Official, each Ethics Counselor is authorized, consistent with 5 CFR 2635.105(c), to issue explanatory guidance and establish procedures necessary to implement this part and part 2635 of this title for his or her bureau.
[62 FR 53718, Oct. 16, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 34259, June 24, 1998]
§ 3501.102
Designation of separate agency components.
(a) Each of the following eleven components of the Department is designated as an agency separate from each of the other ten listed components and, for employees of that component, as an agency distinct from the remainder of the Department, for purposes of the regulations in subpart B of 5 CFR part 2635 governing gifts from outside sources, 5 CFR 2635.807 governing teaching, speaking and writing, and § 3501.105 requiring prior approval of outside employment. However, the following eleven components are not deemed to be separate agencies for purposes of applying any provision of 5 CFR part 2635 or this part to employees of the remainder of the Department:
(1) Bureau of Indian Affairs, including the Office of Indian Education Programs;
(2) Bureau of Land Management;
(3) Bureau of Reclamation;
(4) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management;
(5) Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement;
(6) National Indian Gaming Commission;
(7) National Park Service;
(8) Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement;
(9) Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians;
(10) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and
(11) U.S. Geological Survey.
(b) Employees in components not listed in paragraph (a) of this section (including employees within the immediate office of each Assistant Secretary) are employees of the remainder
of the Department, which for those employees shall include the components designated in this section as well as those parts of the Department not designated in this section.

# Example 1:
A company that conducts activities regulated by the Bureau of Land Management would not be a prohibited source of gifts for an employee of the National Park Service (NPS), unless that company seeks official action by the NPS; does business or seeks to do business with the NPS; conducts activities that are regulated by the NPS; or has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of that employee's official duties.

# Example 2:
A paralegal who works part-time in the Office of the Solicitor wants to take an additional part-time job with a private company that does business with the U.S. Geological Survey. The company is a prohibited source for the paralegal, since the company does business with a component of the Department from which his component has not been listed as separate in § 3501.102(a). The paralegal must obtain prior approval for the outside employment, because § 3501.105 requires employees to obtain such approval before engaging in outside employment with a prohibited source.

§ 3601.101
Purpose.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Department of Defense (DoD) and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635. DoD employees are required to comply with part 2635, this part, and implementing guidance and procedures.
§ 3601.102
Designation of DoD components as separate agencies for purposes of gifts from outside sources, and teaching, speaking, and writing.
(a) Pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.203(a), each of the following DoD components is designated as a separate agency for purposes of the regulations in subpart B of 5 CFR part 2635 governing gifts from outside sources and 5 CFR 2635.807 governing teaching, speaking, and writing:
(1) Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals;
(2) Department of the Army;
(3) Department of the Navy;
(4) Department of the Air Force;
(5) Defense Commissary Agency;
(6) Defense Contract Audit Agency;
(7) Defense Finance and Accounting Service;
(8) Defense Information Systems Agency;
(9) Defense Intelligence Agency;
(10) Defense Logistics Agency;
(11) Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency;
(12) Defense Threat Reduction Agency;
(13) National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency;
(14) National Security Agency;
(15) Office of Inspector General;
(16) Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences;
(17) National Reconnaissance Office; and
(18) Office of the Secretary of Defense remainder agency.
Example 1 to paragraph (a).
For paragraph (a)(1) of this section [Teaching, Speaking, or Writing]: An Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) employee is asked to give a compensated speech on prisoners of war, a topic on which he has a personal interest. While the Department of Defense has ongoing policies, programs, or operations related to this topic, the ASBCA does not. The employee may give the speech in a personal capacity and receive compensation because the ASBCA is a designated separate agency, the speech is not related to an ongoing program or operation of the ASBCA, and the speech is not otherwise related to the employee's official duties.
Example 2 to paragraph (a).
For paragraphs (a)(2) and (18) of this section [Separate component—gift]: An employee of the Department of the Army (Army) and an employee of the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) are each offered a ticket to a football game by a company that contracts with OSD. As long as the contractor is not a prohibited source for the Army and the gift is not offered because of the employee's official position, the Army employee may accept the ticket because the Army is designated as a separate agency under paragraph (a)(2). The
JCS employee may not accept the ticket because JCS is not designated as a separate agency and, therefore, is part of the “OSD remainder agency.” The OSD contractor is therefore a prohibited source for the JCS employee or for any employee of any of the other organizations that are part of the OSD remainder agency.
Example 3 to paragraph (a).
For paragraph (a)(11) of this section [Agency designation]: An employee of the Department of the Air Force is offered a gift by a company that only does business with the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, which is designated as a separate agency. The company would be a prohibited source of gifts for employees of the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency but not for employees of the Department of the Air Force or for any other component which has been designated as a separate agency.
(b) Employees of DoD components not designated as separate agencies, including employees of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, will be treated as employees of the “Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) remainder agency.” The OSD remainder agency shall itself be treated as a separate DoD agency for purposes of determining whether the donor of a gift is a prohibited source under 5 CFR 2635.203(d) and for identifying the employee's agency under 5 CFR 2635.807 governing teaching, speaking, and writing.
(1) The use of the term “agency” in this part does not carry with it the designation and responsibilities of a “defense agency” as set forth in 10 U.S.C. 191-197 (2019).
(2) For purposes of this part, “prohibited source” is defined at 5 CFR 2635.203(d), except that “agency” shall mean the employee's component.

# Note 1 to paragraph (b).
All DoD organizations not individually listed in paragraph (a) of this section are part of the OSD remainder agency.

# Note 2 to paragraph (b):
Prohibited sources for each component for purposes of gifts and teaching, speaking, and writing are exclusive to that component and are not imputed to OSD.

# Note 3 to paragraph (b).
An employee who is detailed to another component will use the prohibited source list of the component to which they are detailed for purposes of gifts, teaching, speaking, and writing.
(c) The designations in this section shall only apply for purposes of gifts under 5 CFR 2635.203(a) and teaching, speaking, and writing under 5 CFR 2635.807, and are distinct from the designations approved by the Office of Government Ethics for purposes of the post-Government employment restrictions in 18 U.S.C. 207(c).
See
5 CFR 2641.302 and appendix B to part 2641.
§ 3601.103
Additional exceptions for gifts from outside sources.
In addition to the gift exceptions in 5 CFR 2635.204, which authorize acceptance of certain gifts from outside sources, and subject to all provisions of 5 CFR part 2635, subpart B, an employee may accept unsolicited gifts from outside sources otherwise prohibited by 5 CFR 2635.202 as detailed in this section. For purposes of this section, the term “agency” is defined in § 3601.102, and the term “free attendance” is defined in 5 CFR 2635.203(g).
(a)
Community relations events.
(1) An employee may accept an unsolicited gift of free attendance for himself or herself and a guest at a community relations event sponsored by a State or local government, or by a civic organization exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(4), when:
(i) The cost of free attendance is provided by the sponsor of the event; and
(ii) The employee's agency designee determines that the community relations interests of the agency will be served by the employee's attendance in his or her personal capacity, and the employee's attendance outweighs any concern that acceptance would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the employee's integrity or impartiality.
(2) Refer to 5 CFR 2635.204(g)(5) in determining whether the cost of attendance may be considered to be provided by the sponsor of the event.
Example 1 to paragraph (a)
[Community relations interest]: The City of Jacksonville, Florida, hosts a Military Appreciation Day event. Members of the general public are charged an admission fee to attend. Department of the Navy employees who have recently returned from deployment are invited
and offered free admission for themselves and a guest. These Navy employees may personally accept the gift of free attendance for themselves and a guest, if their agency designee determines that their attendance at the event will serve a community relations interest and that employees' attendance outweighs concerns that acceptance would call into question their integrity or impartiality.
Example 2 to paragraph (a)
[No community relations interest]: A foundation that provides grants to non-profit organizations focusing on environmental initiatives is sponsoring a fundraising golf tournament. The foundation is offering to waive the entry fee for military personnel at the local installation. Military personnel may not accept the offer by the sponsor to waive the entry fee under paragraph (a) of this section, because participation in this event does not further local community relations interests for the DoD installation. While the community relations exception may not be used to accept the gift, nothing in this section precludes an employee from accepting the gift if another gift exclusion, exception, or authority would apply.
(b)
Scholarships and grants.
An employee and his or her dependents may accept an educational scholarship or grant from an entity that does not have interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or non-performance of the employee's official duties, or from an association or similar entity that does not have a majority of members with such interests, if the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) or the DAEO's designee makes a written determination that the scholarship or grant is made pursuant to an established program of recognition, including those established for the benefit of employees, or the dependents of employees. A scholarship or grant is made pursuant to an established program of recognition if:
(1) Scholarships or grants have been made on a regular basis or, if the program is new, there is a reasonable basis for concluding that scholarships or grants will be made on a regular basis based on funding or funding commitments; and
(2) Selection of recipients is made pursuant to written standards.
§ 3601.104
Additional limitations on gifts between employees.
The following limitations apply to gifts from groups of employees that include a subordinate and to voluntary contributions to gifts for superiors permitted under 5 CFR 2635.304(c)(1):
(a)
Gifts from a group that includes a subordinate.
Regardless of the number of employees contributing to a gift on a special, infrequent occasion as permitted by 5 CFR 2635.304(c)(1), an employee may not accept a gift or gifts, including indirectly within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.203(f), from a donating group if the aggregate market value exceeds the minimal value, as established by 5 U.S.C. 7342(a)(5), and if the employee knows or has reason to know that any member of the donating group is a subordinate.
(1) The cost of items excluded from the definition of a gift by 5 CFR 2635.203(b) and the cost of food, refreshments, and entertainment provided to mark the occasion for which the gift is given shall not be included in determining whether the value of a gift or gifts exceeds the aggregate minimal value limit.
(2) The value of a gift or gifts from two or more donating groups will be aggregated and will be considered to be from a single donating group if the employee who is offered the gift knows or has reason to know that an individual who is his or her subordinate is a member of more than one of the donating groups.
(b)
Voluntary contribution.
For purposes of 5 CFR 2635.304(c)(1), the nominal amount of a voluntary contribution that an employee may solicit from another employee for a group gift to the contributory employee's superior for any special, infrequent occasion will not exceed $10. A voluntary contribution of a nominal amount for food, refreshments, and entertainment at an event to mark the occasion for which a group gift is given may be solicited as a separate, voluntary contribution not subject to the $10 limit.
§ 3601.105
Disclaimer for teaching, speaking, and writing in a personal capacity related to official duties.
An employee who uses or permits the use of his or her military rank or who includes or permits the inclusion of his or her title or position as one of several biographical details given to identify himself or herself in connection with teaching, speaking, or writing, in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.807(b), must make a disclaimer if the subject of the teaching, speaking, or writing deals in significant part with any ongoing or announced policy, program, or operation of the employee's agency, as defined in § 3601.102, and the employee has not been authorized by appropriate agency authority to present that material as the agency's position. The disclaimer must be made as follows:
(a) The required disclaimer must expressly state that the views presented are those of the speaker or author and do not necessarily represent the views of DoD or its components.
(b) When a disclaimer is required for an article, book, or other writing, the disclaimer will be printed in a reasonably prominent position in the writing itself.
(c) When a disclaimer is required for a speech or other oral presentation, the disclaimer may be given orally provided it is given at the beginning of the oral presentation.
Example 1 to § 3601.105
[Disclaimer Required]: An employee is asked to provide unpaid personal remarks at a local university on a DoD matter she handled in the past year. As part of her introduction, the university facilitator identifies the employee by her official title. Since the subject matter of her speech is related to her official duties, and her official title is used, she must provide a reasonably prominent disclaimer at the beginning of her remarks.
Example 2 to § 3601.105
[Disclaimer Not Required]: An employee is invited in his personal capacity to speak at his alma mater on Career Day about his personal experiences as a Government employee, but will not discuss the ongoing or announced policy, program, or operation of his agency. The introduction to his talk only mentions that he is a graduate of the school and currently a “DoD employee,” but does not use his official title, rank, or position. No disclaimer would be necessary because the introduction to the employee's speech did not include his official title or position and the subject of the speech does not deal in significant part with any ongoing or announced policy, program or operation of the relevant DoD agency.

# Note 1 to § 3601.105.
Ethics review of whether a disclaimer is necessary or prudent is not a substitute for compliance with other DoD requirements such as obtaining a security review of the content of the teaching, speaking, or writing.
§ 3601.106
Prior approval for outside employment and business activities.
(a) A DoD employee, other than a special Government employee, who is required to file a financial disclosure report (OGE Forms 450 or 278e) shall obtain approval from the agency designee before engaging in a business activity or compensated outside employment with a prohibited source, unless general approval has been given in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Approval shall be granted unless a determination is made that the business activity or compensated outside employment is expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or regulation. Approval of the DoD employee's business activity or compensated outside employment with a prohibited source will be annotated on the employee's annual financial disclosure report. Nothing in this part precludes a supervisor from providing the employee with written approval. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Business activity.
Any business, contractual, or other financial relationship not involving the provision of personal services by the DoD employee. It does not include a routine commercial transaction or the purchase of an asset or interest, such as common stock, that is available to the general public.
(2)
Employment.
Any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services by the DoD employee. It includes, but is not limited to, personal
services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, or trustee.
(3)
Prohibited source. See
5 CFR 2635.203(d) (modified by the separate DoD component agency designations in § 3601.102).
(b) The DoD component DAEO or designee may, by a written notice, exempt categories of business activities or employment from the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section based on a determination that business activities or employment within those categories would generally be approved and are not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or regulation.
[88 FR 12543, Feb. 28, 2023, as amended at 88 FR 86029, Dec. 12, 2023]
§ 3601.107
Waiver.
(a) The DoD General Counsel may waive any provision of this part based upon a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that waiver of the provision will not undermine public confidence in the integrity of Government programs or operations. The waiver must be:
(1) In writing;
(2) Supported by a detailed statement of facts and findings; and
(3) Narrow in scope and limited in duration.
(b) The DoD General Counsel may withdraw the waiver, in writing, if it is determined to no longer be necessary.
(c) The authority for granting and withdrawing a waiver cannot be delegated below the DoD Alternate DAEO.

[62 FR 23942, May 2, 1997, as amended at 79 FR 44263, July 31, 2014]
§ 3801.104
Purchase or use of certain forfeited and other property.
(a) In the absence of prior approval by the agency designee, no employee shall purchase, directly or indirectly, from the Department of Justice or its agents property forfeited to the United States and no employee shall use property forfeited to the United States which has been purchased, directly or indirectly, from the Department of Justice or its agents by his spouse or minor child. Approval may be granted only on the basis of a written determination by the agency designee that in the mind of a reasonable person with knowledge of the circumstances, purchase or use by the employee of the asset will not raise a question as to whether the employee has used his official position or nonpublic information to obtain or assist in an advantageous purchase or create an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of the employee's duties. A copy of the written determination shall be filed with the Deputy Attorney General.
(b) No employee of the United States Marshals Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, or Drug Enforcement Administration shall purchase, directly or indirectly, from his component, the General Services Administration, or the agent of either, property formerly used by that component and no such employee shall use property formerly used by his component which has been purchased, directly or indirectly, by his spouse or minor child from his component, the General Services Administration, or to the agent of either.
§ 3801.105
Personal use of Government property.
Employees are prohibited by part 2635 of this title from using Government property for other than authorized purposes. The Department rule authorizing limited personal use of Department of Justice office and library equipment and facilities by its employees is at 28 CFR 45.4.
§ 3801.106
Outside employment.
(a)
Definition.
For purposes of this section,
outside employment
means any form of employment, business relationship or activity, involving the provision of personal services whether or not for compensation, other than in the discharge of official duties. It includes, but is not limited to, services as a lawyer, officer, director, trustee, employee, agent, consultant, contractor, or general partner. Speaking, writing and serving as a fact witness are excluded from this definition, so long as they are not combined with the provision of other services that do fall within this definition, such as the practice of law. Employees who wish to engage in compensated speaking and writing should review § 2635.807 of this title.
(b)
Prohibited outside employment.
(1) No employee may engage in outside employment that involves:
(i) The practice of law, unless it is uncompensated and in the nature of community service, or unless it is on behalf of himself, his parents, spouse, or children;
(ii) Any criminal or habeas corpus matter, be it Federal, State, or local; or
(iii) Litigation, investigations, grants or other matters in which the Department of Justice is or represents a party, witness, litigant, investigator or grant-maker.
(2) Where application of the restrictions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section will cause undue personal or family hardship; unduly prohibit an employee from completing a professional obligation entered into prior to Government service; or unduly restrict the Department from securing necessary and uniquely specialized services, the restrictions may be waived in writing based upon a determination that the
activities covered by the waiver are not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation. Employees should refer to DOJ Order 1735.1 on obtaining waivers. The Order is available from the agency designee which, for purposes of this rule, shall be the Deputy Designated Agency Ethics Official for the component.
(c)
Prior approval for outside employment.
(1) An employee must obtain written approval before engaging in outside employment, not otherwise prohibited by paragraph (b) of this section that involves:
(i) The practice of law; or
(ii) A subject matter, policy,or program that is in his component's area of responsibility.
(2) Employees should refer to DOJ Order 1735.1 for procedures on obtaining prior approval. A waiver granted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section will be sufficient to satisfy this prior approval requirement.
(3) Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct that is prohibited by statute or Federal regulation.

§ 3801.107
Additional rules for Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives employees.
The following rules apply to the employees of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and are in addition to §§ 3801.101 through 3801.106:
(a)
Prohibited financial interests.
Except as provided in this section, no employee of ATF, or spouse or minor child of an ATF employee, shall have, directly or indirectly, any financial interest, including compensated employment, in the alcohol, tobacco, firearms or explosives industries. The term financial interest is defined in § 2635.403(c) of this title.
(b)
Waiver.
An agency designee, with the advice and legal clearance of the Deputy Designated Agency Ethics Official, may grant a written waiver of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with part 2635 of this title or otherwise prohibited by law and that, in the mind of a reasonable person with knowledge of the particular circumstances, the financial interest will not create an appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or call into question the impartiality and objectivity with which ATF's programs are administered. A waiver under this paragraph (b) may require appropriate conditions, such as execution of a written disqualification.

(ii) For employees in the immediate Office of a Commissioner, through the Commissioner; or
(iii) For all other employees, through the Head of the Bureau or Office to which the employee is assigned.
(2) A request for approval shall include, at a minimum:
(i) A full description of the services to be performed in practicing the profession;
(ii) The name and address of the person or organization for which services are to be provided; and

(3) Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the employee's FCC position or the services to be provided in practicing the profession, the employee shall submit a revised request for approval.
(c)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the proposed outside practice of the employee's profession is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR 2635.

Notice shall be made as soon as possible after learning about employment already in existence or in advance of known prospective employment. The employee shall be disqualified from participation in any matter involving the employee's spouse or relative, or the employing entity, unless the DAEO authorizes the employee to participate in the matter using the standard in § 2635.502(d) of the Executive Branch-wide Standards.
§ 4001.107
Involvement in System institution board member elections.
No covered employee who is able to participate in a System institution board election because of System securities owned by virtue of retaining a pre-existing loan or extension of credit from a System institution in accordance with § 4001.104(b) shall take any part, directly or indirectly, in the nomination or election of a board member of a System institution, other than by exercising the right to vote.

(a)
Prohibition.
No covered employee shall perform services, either on a paid or unpaid basis, for any System institution or related entity, or any officer, director, employee, or person connected with a System institution or related entity. Nothing in this section would prohibit covered employees from providing any service that is a part of their official duties.
(b)
General requirement for prior approval.
All employees shall obtain prior written approval before engaging in any outside employment or business activity, with or without compensation, unless the outside activity is exempt from the definition of “employment” as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. An employee proposing to engage in outside employment and business activities is required, prior to commencement, to send a written notice of the proposed employment or activity to the DAEO on a form prescribed by the DAEO. Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the employment or activity is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute, part 2635 of this title, or paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Definition.
For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment, business relationship or activity involving the provision of personal services by the employee, whether or not for compensation. It includes, but is not limited to, personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product. It does not, however, include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organization for which no compensation is received other than reimbursement for necessary expenses.
§ 4001.109
Waivers.
The DAEO may grant a written waiver from any provision of this part based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with part 2635 of this title or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the provision is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which Corporation programs are administered. A waiver under this paragraph may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification.

A member requests a waiver by submitting a confidential written application to the Commission's Office of the Ethics Counsel.

In developing a recommendation, the DAEO may consult, on a confidential basis, other Commission personnel as the DAEO in his or her discretion considers necessary.
(2) Employees may request from the DAEO a waiver of the prohibitions, restrictions, or requirements that would otherwise apply to a securities holding
or transaction on the grounds that application of the rule would cause an undue hardship. An employee requests a waiver by submitting a confidential written application to the Commission's Office of the Ethics Counsel in the manner prescribed by the DAEO. In considering a waiver request, the DAEO, or his or her designee, may consult with the employee's supervisors and other Commission personnel as the DAEO in his or her discretion considers necessary.
(3) The Commission or the DAEO, as applicable, will provide written notice of its determination of the waiver request to the requesting member or employee.
(4) The Commission or the DAEO, as applicable, may condition the grant of a waiver under this provision upon the agreement to certain undertakings (such as execution of a written statement of disqualification) to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, and to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity of the Commission. The Commission or DAEO, as applicable, shall note the existence of conditions on the waiver and describe them in reasonable detail in the text of the waiver-request determination.
(5) The grant of a waiver requested pursuant to this section must reflect the judgment that the waiver:
(i) Is necessary to avoid an undue hardship and, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition, restriction, or requirement is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise necessary to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity of the Commission;
(ii) Is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 208 (Acts affecting a personal financial interest), 5 CFR part 2635 (Standards of ethical conduct for employees of the executive branch), and 5 CFR part 2640 (Interpretation, exemptions and waiver guidance concerning 18 U.S.C. 208); and
(iii) Is not otherwise prohibited by law.
(6) The determination of the Commission with respect to a member's request for a waiver is final and binding on the member.
(7) The determination of the DAEO with respect to an employee's request for a waiver may be appealed to the Commission, in accordance with the requirements of 17 CFR 201.430 and 201.431 (Rules 430 and 431 of the Commission's Rule of Practice). The determination of the DAEO or, if appealed, the Commission, is final and binding on the employee.
(8) Notwithstanding the grant of a waiver, a member or employee remains subject to the disqualification requirements of 5 CFR 2635.402 (Disqualifying financial interests) and 5 CFR 2635.502 (Personal and business relationships) with respect to transactions or holdings subject to the waiver.
(i)
Required disposition of securities.
The DAEO is authorized to require disposition of securities acquired as a result of a violation of the provisions of this section, whether unintentional or not. The DAEO shall report repeated violations to the Commission for appropriate action.

(8) U.S. Secret Service.
(b)(1) DHS will treat employees of DHS components not designated as separate agencies in paragraph (a) of this section, including employees of the Office of the Secretary, as employees of the remainder of DHS. For purposes of the regulations in subpart B of 5 CFR part 2635 governing gifts from outside sources, including determining whether the donor of a gift is a prohibited source under 5 CFR 2635.203(d); for purposes of the regulations in § 4601.103(c) of this part governing the establishment of procedures for obtaining prior approval for outside employment; for purposes of the regulations in § 4601.103(c) of this part governing the designation of officials; and for purposes of the regulations in 5 CFR 2635.807 governing teaching, speaking, and writing, DHS will treat the remainder of DHS as a single agency that is separate from the components designated as separate agencies in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) For the limited purposes of establishing procedures for obtaining prior approval for outside employment and designating officials pursuant to § 4601.103(c) of this part, DHS will treat the DHS Office of Inspector General as a separate agency.
(c) An employee on detail from his or her employing agency to another agency for a period in excess of 30 calendar days is subject to the supplemental regulations and instructions of the agency to which he is detailed rather than his or her employing agency.
§ 4601.103
Prior approval for outside employment and activities.
(a)
General requirement for approval.
A DHS employee, other than a Special Government Employee, shall obtain
prior written approval before engaging in any outside employment or activity (as defined by § 4601.101 of this part), with or without compensation, unless the employee's agency has exempted the outside employment or activity (or category or class of outside employment or activity) from this requirement by an instruction or manual issued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted unless it has been determined that the outside employment is expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
(c)
Agency responsibilities.
(1) With the approval of the DHS DAEO, each agency as set forth in § 4601.102 of this part shall issue internal instructions or a manual governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment and activities and designating appropriate officials to act on such requests not later than May 5, 2016.
(2) The instructions or manual may exempt particular outside employment or activities (or categories or classes of outside employment or activities) from the prior approval requirement of this section if such outside employment or activities would generally be approved and are not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part. Agencies may include in their instructions or manual examples of outside employment or activities that are permissible or prohibited consistent with 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
(3) In the absence of a manual or instruction identifying a person designated to act upon a request for approval for outside employment, the Chief Deputy Ethics Official at each agency shall act upon a request.
§ 4601.104
Additional rules for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) employees.
The following rules apply to employees of CBP, except Special Government Employees, and are in addition to §§ 4601.101 through 4601.103 and §§ 4601.107 and 4601.108 of this part:

(b)
Restrictions arising from employment of the spouse, relatives, members of the employee's household, or financial dependents.
(1) A CBP employee shall notify in writing his or her agency designee when any of the following circumstances exist:
(i) The spouse of the CBP employee is employed in a position that the CBP employee would be prohibited from occupying by paragraph (a) of this section;
(ii) A relative (as defined in 5 CFR 2634.105(o)), who is financially dependent on or who is a member of the household of the CBP employee, is employed in a position that the CBP employee would be prohibited from occupying by paragraph (a) of this section; or
(iii) Any person, other than the spouse or relative of the CBP employee, who is financially dependent on or who is a member of the household of the CBP employee, is employed in a position that the CBP employee would be prohibited from occupying by paragraph (a) of this section.

To grant the waiver, the FEMA Chief Deputy Ethics Official or his or her agency designee must determine that the waiver is consistent with 5 CFR part 2635 and not otherwise prohibited by law; that the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality; and that the waiver will not undermine the public's confidence in the employee's impartiality and objectivity in administering FEMA programs. A waiver under this paragraph may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification statement.
§ 4601.106
Additional rules for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees.
The following rules apply to employees of ICE, except Special Government Employees, and are in addition to §§ 4601.101 through 4601.103 and 4601.107 and 4601.108 of this part:

(ii) A relative (as defined in 5 CFR 2634.105(o)) who is financially dependent on or who is a member of the household of the ICE employee is employed in a position that the ICE employee would be prohibited from occupying by paragraph (a) of this section; or
(iii) Any person, other than the spouse or relative of the ICE employee, who is financially dependent on or who is a member of the household of the ICE employee, is employed in a position that the ICE employee would be prohibited from occupying by paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) The ICE employee shall be disqualified from participating in an official capacity in any particular matter involving the individuals described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the employer thereof, unless the agency designee, with the advice and clearance of the ICE Chief Deputy Ethics Official, authorizes the ICE employee to participate in the matter using the standard in 5 CFR 2635.502(d), or the waiver provisions in 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1), as appropriate.

(2) Seized or forfeited under the direction or incident to the functions of the employee's agency.
(b)
Designated separate components.
For purposes of this section, the employee's agency is the relevant separate agency component as set forth in § 4601.102 of this part.
(c)
Waiver.
Employees may make a purchase prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section where a written waiver of the prohibition is issued in advance by the agency designee with the clearance of the DAEO or his or her designee. A waiver may only be granted if it is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation and the purchase of the property will not cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the particular circumstances to question the employee's impartiality, or create the appearance that the employee has used his or her official position or nonpublic information for his or her personal gain.
§ 4601.108
Reporting waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption.
Employees shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities, such as the DHS Office of Inspector General.

§ 4701.102
Prior approval for certain outside employment.
(a)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
Active participant
has the meaning set forth in 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1)(v).
(2)
Employee
has the meaning set forth in 5 CFR 2635.102(h).
(3) Definition of
outside employment.
For purposes of this section,
outside employment
means any form of non-Federal employment, business relationship or activity involving the provision of personal services, whether or not for compensation. It includes, but is not limited to, services as an officer, director, agent, advisor, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, speaker, writer, or any other services provided by an individual. It includes writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product. The definition does not include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civic organization, unless:
(i) The activity provides compensation other than reimbursement of expenses;
(ii) The activities of the non-Federal organization are devoted substantially to matters relating to the employee's official duties as defined in 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(i)(B) through (E) and the employee will serve as officer or director of the non-Federal organization; or
(iii) The activities will involve the provision of consultative or professional services. Consultative services means the provision of personal services, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which requires advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a course of specialized instruction and study in an institution of higher education, hospital, or similar facility. Professional services means the provision of personal services, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which involves application of the skills of a profession as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(1) or involves a fiduciary relationship as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(2).
(4)

(i) Outside employment that an employee has been invited to participate in because of his or her official position rather than his or her expertise in the subject matter;
(ii) Outside employment in which an employee has been asked to participate by a person that has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties;
(iii) Outside employment that conveys information derived from nonpublic information gained during the course of government employment; and
(iv) Outside employment that deals in significant part with any matter to which the employee is or has been officially assigned in the last year, or any ongoing or announced Commission policy, program, or operation.
(b)
Prior approval requirement.
An employee of the Commission, including a member of a Commissioner's staff, but not a member of the Commission or a special Government employee, shall obtain written approval from the Designated Agency Ethics Official before engaging in outside employment where the services provided:
(1) Are related to the employee's official duties; or
(2) Involve the application of the same specialized skills or the same educational background as used in the performance of the employee's official duties.
(c)
Submission of requests for approval.
(1) The request for approval shall be sent through all of the employee's supervisors and shall state the name of the person, group, or organization for whom the outside employment is to be performed; the type of outside employment to be performed; and the proposed hours of, and approximate dates of, the outside employment.
(2) Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or in the employee's official position, the employee shall submit a revised request for approval.
(d)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.

§ 5101.101
General.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to members and other employees of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635. Members and other employees are required to comply with 5 CFR part 2635 and this part. Commission members and other employees are also subject to the Regulation Concerning Conduct of Members and Employees and Former Members and Employees of the Commission at 17 CFR part 140.
§ 5101.102
Prohibited financial interests and transactions.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.403(a), no Commission member or other employee shall engage in business or financial transactions, or hold business or financial interests, prohibited by the Commodity Exchange Act, as set forth in 17 CFR 140.735-2.
§ 5101.103
Outside employment and activities.
(a) Subject to the restrictions and requirements contained in 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, Commission members and other employees are encouraged to engage in teaching, speaking, and writing activities and, when qualified, to participate without compensation in programs to provide legal assistance and representation to indigents.
(b)
Prohibitions.
A Commission member or other employee shall not engage in non-Federal employment or any other outside activity that:
(1) Involves the rendering of advice concerning any legal, accounting or economic matter, or any agricultural, mining, foreign currency market or other commodity-related matter, in which the Commission may be significantly interested, except that this prohibition shall not apply to a special Government employee unless the special Government employee:
(i) Has participated personally and substantially as an employee or special Government employee in the same matter; or
(ii) Has served with the Commission 60 days or more during the immediately preceding period of 365 consecutive days.
(2) Involves an appearance in court or on a brief in a representative capacity in relation to any matter which relates to any policy, program or operation of the Commission; or
(3) Is prohibited by section 2(a)(7) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as incorporated in 17 CFR 140.735-2 and 140.735-3. That statute provides that no Commission member or employee shall accept employment or compensation from any person, exchange or clearinghouse subject to regulation by the Commission, or participate, directly or indirectly, in any contract market operations or transactions of a character subject to regulation by the Commission.
(c)
Prior approval for outside employment.
(1) Before engaging in any outside employment, with or without compensation, an employee of the Commission, other than a special Government employee, must obtain written approval from his or her division or office head and the Executive Director, who may seek the concurrence of the General Counsel.
(2) In addition to the approval under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an employee, including a special Government employee, must obtain written approval from the Commission to appear in court or on a brief in a representative capacity.
(3) Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
(4) The approval required by paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section shall be requested in writing in advance of engaging in outside employment. The request shall be submitted to the employee's division or office head, through the employee's immediate supervisor, and shall set forth all pertinent facts regarding the anticipated employment, including the name of the employer, the nature of the work to be performed, its estimated duration and the amount of compensation to be received. If approved by the division or office head, the request shall be forwarded by the division or office head to the Executive Director. In granting or denying approval, the Executive Director may seek the concurrence of the General Counsel. If approved by the Executive Director, a request for permission to appear in court or on a brief in a representational capacity shall be forwarded to the Commission for final decision.
(5) For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services by the employee. It includes, but is not limited to personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher or speaker. It includes writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product. It does not, however, include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organization, unless such activities involve the provision of professional services or advice or are for compensation other than reimbursement of expenses.

§ 5201.101
General.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Department of Labor (Department) and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635.
§ 5201.102
Designation of separate agency components.
(a)
Separate agency components of the Department of Labor.
Pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.203(a), each of the ten components of the Department listed below is designated as an agency separate from each of the other nine listed components and, for employees of that component, as an agency distinct from the remainder of the Department. However, the components listed below are not deemed to be separate agencies for purposes of applying any provision of 5 CFR part 2635 or this part to employees of the remainder of the Department:
(1) Benefits Review Board;
(2) Employees Compensation Appeals Board;
(3) Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA);
(4) Veterans' Employment and Training Service;
(5) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA);
(6) Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA);
(7) Bureau of International Labor Affairs;
(8) Bureau of Labor Statistics;
(9) Employment and Training Administration (ETA); and
(10) Employment Standards Administration (ESA).
(b)
Separate agency subcomponents of ESA.
Pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.203(a), each of the four subcomponents of the Employment Standards Administration (ESA) listed in this paragraph is designated as an agency separate from each of the other three listed components and, for employees of that subcomponent, as an agency distinct from the remainder of ESA. However, the components listed in this paragraph are not deemed to be separate agencies for purposes of applying any provision of 5 CFR part 2635 or this part to employees of the remainder of ESA:
(1) Wage and Hour Division;
(2) Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs;
(3) Office of Workers Compensation Programs; and
(4) Office of Labor-Management Standards.
(c)
Definitions
—(1)
Remainder of the Department
means employees in the Office of the Secretary and any other employee of the Department not in one of the 10 components designated as separate agencies in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Remainder of ESA
means employees in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards and any other ESA employee not in one of the four subcomponents designated as separate agencies in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Applicability of separate agency designations.
The designations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section identify an employee's “agency” for purposes of:
(1) Determining when a person is a prohibited source within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.203(d) for purposes of applying the regulations at subpart B of 5 CFR part 2635 governing gifts from outside sources;
(2) Determining whether teaching, speaking or writing relates to the employee's official duties within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(i); and
(3) Determining when a person is a prohibited source for purposes of applying the regulations at 5 CFR 2635.808(c) governing fundraising in a personal capacity.

# Example 1:
An employee of the Mine Safety and Health Administration attends a Saturday football game together with an employee of the Office of the Solicitor. By coincidence, they are seated next to a contract consultant to the Employment and Training Administration. They talk about the game and describe their jobs and personal interests to their new seat-mate. The consultant states that he and his wife will not be able to attend next week's game and would like to give their very expensive tickets to people who will really enjoy them. The MSHA employee may accept the ticket. MSHA is designated as a separate agency under § 5201.102, and the ETA contractor is not a prohibited source of gifts for MSHA employees. The contractor is not regulated by and has no business dealings with MSHA. The Solicitor's Office employee may not accept the gift. The ETA contractor is a prohibited source for Solicitor's Office employees because the Solicitor's Office is a part of the “Remainder of the Department of Labor.” Any source which is prohibited for any component of the Department of Labor is a prohibited source for employees in the “Remainder.”
[61 FR 57284, Nov. 6, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 16398, Apr. 3, 2003]
§ 5201.103
Fundraising activities.
Notwithstanding 5 CFR 2635.808(c)(1)(i), an employee of any separate agency component listed in this section may, in a personal capacity, personally solicit funds from a person who is a prohibited source if person is a prohibited source for employees of the component only under 5 CFR 2635.203(d)(3) because the person conducts activities regulated by the component:
(a) The Wage and Hour Division;
(b) The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs;
(c) The Remainder of the Employment Standards Administration, as defined in § 5201.102(c);
(d) Occupational Safety and Health Administration;
(e) Employee Benefits Security Administration;
(f) Veterans' Employment and Training Service; and
(g) The Remainder of the Department of Labor, as defined in § 5201.102(c).

# Example 1:
A training official in the Mine Safety and Health Administration is president of the local branch of her college alumni association. The association is seeking used computers from local businesses to upgrade the college's language lab. The employee may not seek a contribution from the vice president of a mining company which is regulated by MSHA. Even though the mining company is not currently under investigation, it is a prohibited source for the employment because it is subject to MSHA regulation and MSHA is not one of the agency components designated as separate for the purpose of fundraising in a personal capacity.

# Example 2:
A typist in the Employee Benefits Security Administration raises money for a local homeless shelter during his off-duty hours. He may seek a contribution from a firm that is regulated by EBSA under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act but may not seek contributions from one that he knows is currently under investigation for a violation of the Act. While firms regulated by an agency would ordinarily be prohibited sources for purposes of an employee's fundraising in a personal capacity, § 5201.103 provides that employees of EBSA and the other separate agency components listed in that section may seek charitable contributions from an entity that is a prohibited source only because its activities are subject to regulation by that separate agency component. On the other hand, the employee may not engage in fundraising from a person who he knows is a prohibited source for any other reason, such as an ongoing enforcement action.

# Example 3:
An employee of the Employment and Training Administration may seek charitable contributions from a firm currently under investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). ETA does not regulate this firm and has had no dealings or business with it of any kind. Since ETA has been designated as a separate agency under § 5201.102, ETA employees need only consider their own official duties and activities and those of ETA in determining whether a person is a prohibited source for purposes of their fundraising in a personal capacity. The fact that a person may be a prohibited source of direct and indirect gifts for OSHA employees is not relevant in this instance.

§ 5201.104
Additional rules for Office of the Inspector General employees.
The rules in this section apply to employees of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and are in addition to §§ 5201.101, 5201.102, and 5201.103.
(a)
Prior approval for outside employment.
(1) Before engaging in any outside employment, an OIG employee must obtain the written approval of the Inspector General or the Inspector General's designee.
(2)
Submission of requests for approval.
(i) Requests for approval shall be submitted in writing to the Inspector General or the Inspector General's designee. Such requests shall include, at a minimum, the following:
(A) The employee's name and position title;
(B) The name and address of the person, group, or organization for whom the employee proposes to engage in outside employment; and
(C) A description of the proposed outside employment, including the duties and services to be performed while engaged in the outside employment, and the approximate dates of the outside employment.
(ii) Together with the employee's request for approval, the employee shall provide a certification that:
(A) The outside employment will not depend in any way on nonpublic information, as defined at 5 CFR 2635.703(b);
(B) No official duty time or Government property, resources, or facilities not available to the general public will be used in connection with the outside employment; and
(C) The employee has read and is familiar with the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR part 2635), including subpart H. (“Outside Activities”), and the Department's supplemental standards of ethical conduct set forth in this part.
(iii) Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or in the employee's official position, the employee shall submit a revised request for approval.
(3)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
(4)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment or any business relationship involving the provision of personal services by the employee. It includes but is not limited to personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, or trustee.
§ 5201.105
Additional rules for Mine Safety and Health Administration employees.
The rules in this section apply to employees of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and are in addition to §§ 5201.101, 5201.102, and 5201.103.
(a)
Prohibited financial interests.
Employees in the MSHA and their spouses and minor children are prohibited from having any financial interests (including compensated employment) in any company or other person engaged in mining activities subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Safety and Health Act), 30 U.S.C. 801
et seq.
A company or other person shall be deemed to be engaged in such mining activities if it owns 50 percent or more of the voting securities of another company or other person engaged in such mining activities. A company or other person shall not be deemed to be engaged in such mining activities solely because it is controlled by a company or other person which does engage in such activities.
(b)
Exceptions.
(1) Nothing in this section prohibits an employee or the spouse or minor child of an employee from acquiring, owning or controlling an interest in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund provided that, upon initial or subsequent investment by the employee (excluding ordinary dividend reinvestment), the fund does not have invested, or does not indicate in its prospectus the intent to invest, more than 30 percent of its assets in the securities of a company or other person engaged in mining activities subject to the Mine Safety and Health Act, and the employee, spouse, or minor child neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise
control over the financial interests held in the fund.
(2) Nothing in this section prohibits an employee or the spouse or minor child of an employee from having a financial interest in a pension administered by, or which invests in, a company or other person engaged in mining activities subject to the Mine Safety and Health Act.

# Example:
A mine inspector who was a former employee of mining company X could continue to participate in mine company X's pension plan without violating this section. However, he would have to disclose the interest on his financial disclosure report. Additionally, the inspector should not inspect or otherwise take official action on a matter affecting mine company X without checking with his ethics advisor to ensure that performance of his official duties would not violate the conflict of interest statute (18 U.S.C. 208) or any other ethics provisions.
(c)
Waiver.
(1) The Assistant Secretary of labor for Mine Safety and Health or the Assistant Secretary's designee may grant an employee a written waiver from the prohibitions contained in paragraph (a) of this section, based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which Mine Safety and Health Administration programs are administered.
(2) The Assistant Secretary or the designee shall grant a waiver from the prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section regarding spouses and minor children unless the Assistant Secretary or the designee determines that the covered relationship or interest is likely to be inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or is otherwise prohibited by law.
(3) A waiver under this section may be accompanied by appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written statement of disqualification. A waiver may be withdrawn if it is later determined that such waiver does not meet the requirements for the granting of waivers under this paragraph. Notwithstanding the grant of any waiver, a covered employee remains subject to the disqualification requirements of 5 CFR 2635.402 and 2635.502.
(4) Factors which may be considered in connection with the granting or denial of waivers include the nature and extent of the financial interest, and the official position and duties of the employee.
(d)
Pre-existing interests.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an employee of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and a spouse or minor child of such an employee, may retain financial interests otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section which were approved in writing under procedures in effect before the effective date of this section, unless the approval is withdrawn, subject to the standards applicable to the withdrawal of waivers under paragraph (c) of this section.

§ 5301.101
General.
(a)
Purpose.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the National Science Foundation (NSF), including Members of the National Science Board. They supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this part, unless a provision plainly indicates otherwise:
(1)
Award
means any grant, contract, cooperative agreement, loan, or other arrangement made by the Government.
(2)
Employee
has the meaning set forth in 5 CFR 2635.102(h), except that, for purposes of this part, it shall not include a special Government employee.
(3)
Institution
means any university, college, business firm, research institute, professional society, or other organization. It includes all parts of a university or college, including all institutions in a multi-institution State or city system. It includes any university consortium or joint corporation, but not the individual universities that belong to such a consortium. Those universities shall be considered separate institutions for purposes of this part.
(4)
Proposal
means an application for an award and includes a bid.
§ 5301.102
Participation in proposals and awards.
(a)
Participation in proposals and awards.
(1) For the purpose of determining whether an employee or a special Government employee, other than a Member of the National Science Board, should participate as part of his official duties in a proposal or award, the affiliations and relationships listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be considered additional “covered relationships” for purposes of applying 5 CFR 2635.502. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, they shall be treated as disqualifying to the same extent as the covered relationships listed in 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1).
(2) Where an affiliation or relationship is listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section as “automatically disqualifying,” an employee shall not participate in a proposal or award in which the institution or other person with whom the employee has a covered relationship is or represents a party unless participation is authorized in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.502(d) by the agency designee, with the concurrence of an ethics counselor in the Office of the General Counsel.
(3) An employee has a covered relationship, within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1), with:
(i) An institution with which the employee is affiliated through:
(A) Membership on a visiting committee or similar body at the institution. The relationship is automatically disqualifying where the particular department, school, or faculty that the visiting committee or similar body advises originated the proposal or where a proposal from the department, school, or faculty formed the basis for the award;
(B) Current enrollment of the employee or a member of the employee's household as a student;
(C) Receipt and retention of an honorarium or other form of compensation, award, or off-duty travel payment from the institution within the last twelve months. The relationship is automatically disqualifying, unless the payment
or award was received before beginning Government service; and
(ii) A person who is an investigator or project director on or who otherwise is identified in a proposal as a party to the proposal or award and with whom the employee has:
(A) A family relationship as sibling, parent, spouse, or child. Any such relationship is automatically disqualifying;
(B) Associated, in the past or currently, as thesis advisor or thesis student;
(C) Collaborated on a project, book, article, report, or paper within the last 48 months; or
(D) Co-edited a journal, compendium, or conference proceedings within the last 24 months.
(b)
Reporting involvement of prospective, current, or recent employees.
(1) When an employee who is participating in a proposal or award becomes aware that a prospective, current, or recent NSF employee or current National Science Board member is or is likely to become a member of the research group or project staff under that proposal or award, the employee shall bring that circumstance to the attention of an agency designee. For purposes of this paragraph:
(i) A “recent NSF employee” is any former NSF employee who left the NSF within the year before submission of the proposal at issue or on which the award was based.
(ii) A “prospective NSF employee” is any person being recruited by an NSF official for a specific opening and from whom the official has received an indication of mutual interest. Such a person is a “prospective NSF employee” even though those recruiting have not extended an offer and even though the person might not accept an offer if it were extended.
(2) The agency designee shall review the circumstances to determine what action, if any, should be taken to assure that the proposal or award is administered impartially and otherwise in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including this part, 5 CFR part 2635, 18 U.S.C. 207 and 208, and 45 CFR part 680.
§ 5301.103
Outside employment and activities.
(a)
Prohibited outside employment and activities.
(1) An NSF employee may not receive, directly or indirectly, any salary, consulting fee, honorarium, or other form of compensation for services, or reimbursement of expenses, from an NSF award.
(2) An NSF employee may not serve as principal investigator or project director under an NSF award.
(3) An NSF employee may not receive, directly or indirectly, any honorarium or any other form of compensation, or reimbursement of expenses from anyone, other than the United States, for participating in an event supported by NSF funds.
(b)
Prior approval of outside employment and activities.
(1) An employee shall obtain written approval from an agency designee before:
(i) Engaging in compensated outside employment with any person or institution (including any for-profit, non-profit, or governmental organization) which does business or may reasonably be expected to do business with the NSF. For these purposes, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services by the employee. It includes, but is not limited to, personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes writing when done under an arrangement for publication of the written product; or
(ii) Serving, with or without compensation, on a visiting committee with any institution that does business or may reasonably be expected to do business with NSF.
(2) In addition to any prior approval required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an employee shall obtain prior written approval:
(i) From an ethics counselor in the Office of the General Counsel before participating, with or without compensation, as a policymaking officer of any research or educational institution or any scientific society or professional association; and
(ii) From his Assistant Director or Office head before serving in a personal
capacity as an organizer, director, proceedings editor, or session chairperson for a conference, workshop, or similar event supported by NSF funds, or before presenting a paper at such an event.
(3) The approvals required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall be granted only upon a determination by the appropriate NSF official that the outside employment or activity is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
§ 5301.104
Participation in NSF-supported conferences.
An NSF employee may participate in conferences, workshops, and similar events supported by NSF funds provided that:
(a) Where the employee's participation is undertaken in a personal capacity, his participation does not violate the restrictions on outside employment and activities of § 5301.103(a), and the approval requirements of § 5301.103(b) have been met.
(b) Where the employee's participation is undertaken as part of his official duties as an NSF employee:
(1) The employee shall obtain prior written approval from his Assistant Director or Office head before serving as an organizer, director, proceedings editor, or session chairperson for a conference, workshop, or similar event sponsored by NSF funds, or before presenting a paper at such an event. However, prior approval is not required where the primary purpose of the event is to plan, assess, or publicize NSF programs or needs, or where the subject of the paper or session to be presented focuses on NSF programs or needs.
(2) The approval required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be granted only upon a determination that the importance of the employee's participation outweighs any appearance of use of official position to enhance his personal credentials.
§ 5301.105
Restrictions applicable to Members of the National Science Board.
(a)
Participation in proposals and awards.
(1) For the purpose of determining whether a Member of the National Science Board (Board) should participate as part of his official duties in a proposal or award coming before the Board or any of its committees, the affiliations and relationships listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be considered “covered relationships” for purposes of applying 5 CFR 2635.502. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, they shall be treated as disqualifying to the same extent as the covered relationships listed in 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1).
(2) Where an affiliation or relationship is listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section as “automatically disqualifying,” a Member of the National Science Board shall not participate in a proposal or award in which the institution or other person with whom the Member has a covered relationship is or represents a party, unless participation is authorized in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.502(d) by the Chairman of the National Science Board or by the Designated Agency Ethics Official.
(3) A Member of the National Science Board has a covered relationship, within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1), with:
(i) An institution or other person with which the Member is affiliated through:
(A) Membership on a visiting committee or similar body at the institution. The relationship is automatically disqualifying where the particular department, school, or faculty that the visiting committee or similar body advises originated the proposal or where a proposal from the department, school, or faculty formed the basis for the award; or
(B) Current enrollment of the Member or a member of his household as a student; and
(ii) A person who is an investigator or project director or who is otherwise identified in a proposal as a party to the proposal or award and with whom the Member has a family relationship as sibling, parent, spouse, or child. Any such relationship is automatically disqualifying.
(b)
Outside employment and activities.
(1) A Member of the National Science
Board shall not represent himself, herself, or any other person in negotiations or other dealings with an NSF official on any proposal, award, or other particular matter, as defined in 5 CFR 2635.402(b)(3).
(2) A Member of the National Science Board may not receive compensation from any award made while serving on the Board. However, unless prohibited by law, an award may be charged, and a Member may be reimbursed, for actual expenses incurred by the Member in doing work supported by the award. If a Member was an investigator or consultant under an award before appointment to the Board, the award may be charged and the Member may continue to receive compensation to the extent established before the Member's nomination.

§ 5501.102
Designation of HHS components as separate agencies.
(a)
Separate agency components of HHS.
Pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.203(a), each of the twelve components of HHS listed below is designated as an agency separate from each of the other eleven listed components and, for employees of that component, as an agency distinct from the remainder of HHS.

Definitions
—(1)
Employee of a component

(2)
Remainder of HHS
means employees in the Office of the Secretary and Staff Divisions, employees of the Office of the General Counsel with Department-wide responsibility, and any HHS employee not in one of the 12 components designated as separate agencies in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Applicability of separate agency designations.
The designations in paragraph (a) of this section identify an employee's “agency” for purposes of:
(1) Determining when a person is a prohibited source within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.203(d) for purposes of applying:
(i) The regulations at subpart B of 5 CFR part 2635 governing gifts from outside sources; and
(ii) The regulations at § 5501.106 requiring prior approval of outside employment and other outside activities; and
(iii) The regulations at § 5501.111 governing the receipt of awards by employees of the National Institutes of Health; and

§ 5501.103
Gifts from federally recognized Indian tribes or Alaska Native villages or regional or village corporations.
(a)
Tribal or Alaska Native gifts.
In addition to the gifts which come within the exceptions set forth in 5 CFR 2635.204, and subject to all provisions of 5 CFR 2635.201 through 2635.205, an employee may accept unsolicited gifts of native artwork, crafts, or other items representative of traditional native culture from federally recognized Indian tribes or Alaska Native villages or regional or village corporations, provided that the aggregate market value of individual gifts received from any one tribe or village under the authority of this paragraph shall not exceed $200 in a calendar year.
(b)
Limitations on use of exception.
If the donor is a tribe or village that has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of an employee's official duties, the employee may accept the gifts authorized by paragraph (a) of this section only where there is a written finding by the agency designee that acceptance of the gift is in the agency's interest and will not violate any of the
limitations on the use of exceptions contained in 5 CFR 2635.202(c).

§ 5501.104
Prohibited financial interests applicable to employees of the Food and Drug Administration.
(a)
General prohibition.
Except as permitted by paragraph (b) of this section, no employee or spouse or minor child of an employee, other than a special Government employee or the spouse or minor child of a special Government employee, of the Food and Drug Administration shall have a financial interest in a significantly regulated organization.
(b)
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) An employee or spouse or minor child of an employee may have a financial interest, such as a pension or other employee benefit, arising from employment with a significantly regulated organization.

# Note to paragraph (
b

# )(1):
FDA employees who file public or confidential financial disclosure reports pursuant to 5 CFR part 2634, as opposed to spouses and minor children of such employees, are generally prohibited under § 5501.106(c)(3) from engaging in current employment with a significantly regulated organization.
(2) An employee who is not required to file a public or confidential financial disclosure report pursuant to 5 CFR part 2634, or the spouse or minor child of such employee, may hold a financial interest in a significantly regulated organization if:
(i) The total cost or value, measured at the time of acquisition, of the combined interests of the employee and the employee's spouse and minor children in the regulated organization is equal to or less than the
de minimis
exemption limit for matters involving parties established by 5 CFR 2640.202(a) or $15,000, whichever is greater (the phrase “time of acquisition” shall mean the date on which the employee actually acquired the financial interest—or on which the financial interest became imputed to the employee under 18 U.S.C. 208—whether by purchase, gift, bequest, marriage, or otherwise, except that with respect to a financial interest that was acquired prior to the employee's entrance on duty as an employee of the Food and Drug Administration, the “time of acquisition” shall be deemed to be the date on which the employee entered on duty);
(ii) The holding, if it represents an equity interest, constitutes less than 1 percent of the total outstanding equity of the organization; and
(iii) The total holdings in significantly regulated organizations account for less than 50 percent of the total value of the combined investment portfolios of the employee and the employee's spouse and minor children.
(3) An employee or spouse or minor child of an employee may have an interest in a significantly regulated organization that constitutes any interest in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund (e.g., a mutual fund), or a widely held pension or similar fund, which, in the literature it distributes to prospective and current investors or participants, does not indicate the objective or practice of concentrating its investments in significantly regulated organizations, if the employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in the fund.
(4) In cases involving exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee may grant a written exception to permit an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, to hold a financial interest in a significantly regulated organization based upon a determination that the application of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section is not necessary to ensure public confidence in the impartiality or objectivity with which HHS programs are administered or to avoid a violation of part 2635 of this title.

With respect to any excepted financial interest, employees are reminded of their obligations under 5 CFR part 2635, and specifically their obligation under subpart D of part 5501 to disqualify themselves from participating in any particular matter in which they, their spouses or minor children have a financial interest arising from publicly traded securities that exceeds the
de minimis

CFR 2640.202 or from non-publicly traded securities that are not covered by the regulatory exemption. Furthermore, the agency may prohibit or restrict an individual employee from acquiring or holding any financial interest or a class of financial interests based on the agency's determination that the interest creates a substantial conflict with the employee's duties, within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.403.

(O) Such other relevant information that the designated agency ethics official or, with the concurrence of the designated agency ethics official, each of the separate agency components of HHS listed in § 5501.102(a) determines is necessary or appropriate in order to evaluate whether a proposed activity is likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
(5)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment or other outside activity is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.

# Note:
The granting of approval for an outside activity does not relieve the employee of the obligation to abide by all applicable laws governing employee conduct nor does approval constitute a sanction of any violation. Approval involves an assessment that the general activity as described on the submission does not appear likely to violate any criminal statutes or other ethics rules. Employees are reminded that during the course of an otherwise approvable activity, situations may arise, or actions may be contemplated, that, nevertheless, pose ethical concerns.

# Example 1:
A clerical employee with a degree in library science volunteers to work on the acquisitions committee at a local public library. Serving on a panel that renders advice to a non-Federal entity is subject to prior approval. Because recommending books for the library collection normally would not pose a conflict with the typing duties assigned the employee, the request would be approved.

# Example 2:
While serving on the library acquisitions committee, the clerical employee in the preceding example is asked to help the library business office locate a missing book order. Shipment of the order is delayed because the publisher has declared bankruptcy and its assets, including inventory in the warehouse, have been frozen to satisfy the claims of the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors. The employee may not contact the Federal bankruptcy trustee to seek, on behalf of the public library, the release of the books. Even though the employee's service on the acquisitions committee had been approved, a criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. 205, would preclude any representation by a Federal employee of an outside entity before a Federal court or agency with respect to a matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.
(6)
Duration of approval.
Approval shall be effective for a period not to exceed one year from the date of approval. Upon a significant change in the nature of the outside activity or in the employee's official position or duties, the employee shall submit a revised request for approval using the procedure in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. If the outside activity is anticipated to exceed one year from the date of the most recent approval, the employee shall renew the request for approval no later than thirty days prior to the expiration of the period authorized.
(7)
Responsibilities of the designated agency ethics official and component agencies.
(i) The designated agency ethics official or, with the concurrence of the designated agency ethics official, each of the separate agency components of HHS listed in § 5501.102 may issue an instruction or manual issuance exempting categories of employment or other outside activities from a requirement of prior written approval based on a determination that the employment or activities within those categories would generally be approved and are not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
(ii) HHS components may specify internal procedures governing the submission of prior approval requests and designate appropriate officials to act on such requests. The instructions or manual issuances may include examples of outside employment and other outside activities that are permissible or impermissible consistent with 5 CFR part 2635 and this part. With respect to teaching, speaking, writing, or editing activities, the instructions or manual issuances may specify preclearance procedures and/or require disclaimers indicating that the views expressed do not necessarily represent the views of the agency or the United States.
(iii) The officials within the respective HHS components who are responsible for the administrative aspects of these regulations and the maintenance of records shall make provisions for the filing and retention of requests for approval of outside employment and other outside activities and copies of the notification of approval or disapproval.
(e)
Waivers.
The designated agency ethics official may grant a written waiver, for an individual or class of similarly situated individuals, from any prohibited outside activity provision in this section or in § 5501.109 based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with part 2635 of this title or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which agency programs are administered. An individual or class waiver under this paragraph may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification.

§ 5501.107
Teaching, speaking and writing by special Government employees in the Public Health Service.

Applicability.
This section applies to special Government employees in the Public Health Service who otherwise are prohibited from accepting compensation for teaching, speaking or writing that is related to their official duties, within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(i)(C), because the invitation or the offer of compensation for the activity was extended at a time when the special Government employee was assigned to perform official duties that may substantially affect the interests of the inviter or offeror.
(b)
Permissible compensation.
A special Government employee may accept compensation for teaching, speaking or writing in circumstances described in paragraph (a) of this section only where the special Government employee recuses from the official assignment that may substantially affect the interests of the person who extended the invitation to engage in the activity or the offer of compensation.

Exception to the prohibition against assisting in the prosecution of claims against, or acting as an agent or attorney before, the Government, applicable only to employees assigned to federally recognized Indian tribes or Alaska Native villages or regional or village corporations pursuant to the Intergovernmental Personnel Act.
(a)

Such employees must advise, in writing, the head of the agency, with which they are dealing on behalf of an Indian tribe or Alaska Native village or corporation, of any personal and substantial involvement they may have had as an officer or employee of the United States in connection with the matter concerned.

(d)
Exception.
Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the NIH Director (or the Secretary, with respect to awards tendered to the NIH Director), with the approval of the designated agency ethics official, may grant a written exception to permit an employee to accept an award
otherwise prohibited by this section under the following conditions:

The following criteria will be considered in making such a determination:
(i) The identity of the awarding organization;
(ii) The longevity of the awards program;
(iii) The source of award funds;

Disposition of improperly accepted awards
—(1)
Failure to obtain prior approval.
If an employee accepts an award for which approval is required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section without obtaining such approval, the employee may be required, in addition to any penalty provided by law and applicable regulations, to forfeit the award by returning it to the donor.

(v) Any other entities not listed above for which a Commission employee holding a security may raise an actual or apparent loss of impartiality affecting the integrity of the Commission's programs and operations, e.g., entities primarily engaged in the business of publishing or distributing publications such as periodicals or sending advertising, promotional, or other material on behalf of itself or another entity through the mails; and
(vi) The parent corporation of any subsidiary described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.
(2) The list shall not include an entity whose use of the mail is merely an incidental or minor factor in the general conduct of its business.
(c)
Exception.
Nothing in this section prohibits an employee, or the spouse or dependent child of an employee, from acquiring or holding an interest in a publicly traded or publicly available mutual fund or other collective investment fund, or in a widely held pension or mutual fund, provided that the fund's prospectus or practice does not indicate the stated objective of concentrating its investments in entities identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(d)
Newly prohibited securities or new employees.
Within 30 days after the Commission disseminates the prohibited securities list to an employee, an employee who owns, or whose spouse or dependent child owns, prohibited securities shall report that ownership to the DAEO. The employee's report must be in writing and include the name of the prohibited security and the date of acquisition. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the employee, or the spouse or dependent child of the employee, shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days after dissemination of the prohibited securities list.
(e)
Securities acquired without specific intent.
Within 30 days after an employee, or the spouse or dependent child of an employee, acquires securities of an entity on the prohibited securities list as a result of marriage, inheritance, gift or otherwise without specific intent to acquire the securities, the employee shall report the acquisition to the DAEO. The employee's report must be in writing and include the name of the prohibited security, the date of acquisition, and the method
of acquisition. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, an employee, or the spouse or dependent child of an employee, shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days after the date of acquisition.
(f)
Divestiture
—(1)
Procedure for accomplishing divestiture.
To alleviate an actual or apparent conflict of interest, an employee divesting prohibited securities shall obtain written confirmation from the DAEO that divesture has been accomplished. A request for such confirmation shall be submitted in writing with sufficient proof to enable the DAEO to confirm that the employee has divested the prohibited security. The employee shall continue to be recused until the date of the DAEO's written confirmation that divesture has been accomplished.
(2)
Extension of period to divest.
Upon a showing of undue hardship, the DAEO may extend the 90 day period for divestiture specified in paragraphs (e) through (f) of this section.
(3)
Disqualification pending divestiture.
Pending divestiture of prohibited securities, an employee must disqualify himself or herself, in accordance with § 2635.402 of this title, from participation in particular matters which, as a result of continued ownership of the prohibited securities, would affect the financial interests of the employee, or those of the spouse or dependent child of the employee.
(g)
Waivers.
The DAEO may grant a written waiver from this section based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with part 2635 of this title or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of an employee's misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or to otherwise ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which the Commission's programs are administered, or in the case of a special Government employee, divestiture would result in substantial financial hardship. A waiver under this paragraph must be in writing and may impose conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification.
§ 5601.103
Notice of disqualification when seeking employment.
(a) An employee who has been assigned to or is supervising work on a particular matter that affects the financial interests of a prospective employer and who is required, in accordance with § 2635.604(a) of this title, to disqualify himself or herself from participation in that matter shall provide written notice of disqualification to the DAEO within 3 business days. The DAEO shall inform the employee's supervisor that the employee is disqualified from the matter. Public filers must comply with the notification requirement set forth in § 2635.607 of this title even when not required to disqualify from participation in a particular matter. Employees who file a notification statement in compliance with § 2635.607 of this title are not required to file a separate notice under this section.
(b) An employee may withdraw written notice under paragraph (a) of this section upon determining that disqualification from participation in the matter is no longer required. A withdrawal of disqualification shall be in writing and shall be provided to the DAEO. The DAEO shall inform the employee's supervisor that the employee is no longer disqualified from the matter.
§ 5601.104
Prohibited outside employment.
An employee shall not engage in outside employment, either on a paid or unpaid basis, with or for an entity on the prohibited securities list described in § 5601.102(b)(1)(i) through (vi).
§ 5601.105
Prior approval for outside employment.
(a)
Prior approval for outside employment.
An employee who wishes to engage in outside employment, either on a paid or unpaid basis, shall obtain the prior written approval of the DAEO. A request for such approval shall be submitted in writing with sufficient description of the employment to enable the DAEO to give approval based on an informed determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or
Federal regulation, including paragraph (a) of this section and part 2635 of this title. The DAEO shall provide a copy of any written approvals for outside employment to the employee's supervisor.
(b)
Scope of approval.
An employee must submit a new request for approval upon either a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or a change in the employee's Commission position or assigned responsibilities.

§ 5701.101
Prior approval for outside employment.
(a) Before engaging in any outside employment, whether or not for compensation, an employee of the Federal Trade Commission, other than a Commissioner, must obtain the written approval of his or her supervisor and the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) or his or her designee. Requests for approval shall be forwarded through normal supervisory channels to the DAEO and shall include, at a minimum, the following:
(1) A statement of the name of the person, group, or organization for whom the work is to be performed; the type of work to be performed; and the proposed hours of work and approximate dates of employment;
(2) The employee's certification that the outside employment will not depend in any way on information obtained as a result of the employee's official Government position;
(3) The employee's certification that no official duty time or Government property, resource, or facilities not available to the general public will be used in connection with the outside employment;
(4) The employee's certification that he has read, is familiar with, and will abide by the restrictions contained in all applicable Federal laws and regulations, including those found in 18 U.S.C. chapter 11 and those found or referenced in subpart H (“Outside Activities”) of 5 CFR part 2635 (Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch); and
(5) The written approval of the employee's immediate supervisor.
(b) Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation. In the case of an employee who wishes to practice a profession involving a fiduciary relationship, as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b), approval will be granted only on a case-by-case basis.
(c) For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services by the employee, whether or not for compensation. It includes but it is not limited to personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, or trustee. Prior approval is not required, however, to participate in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organization, unless such activities involve the provision of professional services or advice or are for compensation other than reimbursement of expenses.
[58 FR 30695, May 27, 1993]
§ 5701.102
Fundraising activities.
When engaging in personal fundraising, as described at 5 CFR 2635.808(c), an employee of the Federal Trade Commission may, notwithstanding the prohibition of § 2635.808(c)(1)(i), personally solicit funds from a person who is a prohibited source only under 5 CFR 2635.203(d)(3) (
i.e.,
because the person “conducts activities regulated by” the Commission). The other provisions of § 2635.808(c) continue to apply to any such personal fundraising.

# Example 1:
A Federal Trade Commission employee is president of the local branch of her college alumni association. The association is seeking contributions from local businesses. The employee may, during her off-duty hours, seek a contribution from a company that is regulated by the Commission, but not from one that she knows is currently under Commission investigation or is seeking official action by the Commission, does business or seeks to do business with the Commission, or has interests that may be substantially affected by the employee's job.
While the Standards of Conduct provide that companies under the agency's enforcement authority generally are prohibited sources of an employee's fundraising in a personal capacity, § 5701.102 provides that employees of the FTC may seek charitable contributions from an entity that is a prohibited source only because its activities are subject to agency regulation.

(7) The parent corporation of any subsidiary described in paragraphs (b)(1)-(b)(6) of this section; and
(8) An energy or utility sector investment fund which has more than 25% of its assets invested in securities issued by entities described in paragraphs (b)(1)-(b)(7) of this section.

Definitions.
For purposes of this section:

(i) A member of the Commission;
(ii) The Inspector General of the NRC;
(iii) A member of the Senior Executive Service (SES);
(iv) An employee who holds a non-SES position above GG-15; and
(v) Any other employee, including a special Government employee, whose duties and responsibilities, as determined by the Commission or its designees, require application of the securities ownership prohibition contained in this section to ensure public confidence that NRC programs are conducted impartially and objectively. The positions of these employees are specified in NRC Management Handbook 7.7, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room; and
(2) The term “securities” includes all interests in debts or equity instruments. The term includes, without limitation, secured and unsecured bonds, debentures, notes, securitized assets
and commercial paper, as well as all types of preferred and common stock. The term encompasses both current and contingent ownership interests, including any beneficial or legal interest derived from a trust. It extends to any right to acquire or dispose of any long or short position in such securities and includes, without limitation, interests convertible into such securities, as well as options, rights, warrants, puts, calls, and straddles with respect thereto.
(d)
Divestiture and reporting of prohibited securities
—(1)
Newly covered employees.
Upon promotion or other appointment to a position subject to the securities prohibition of this section, a covered employee shall sign a certification:
(i) Identifying securities of an entity on the prohibited securities list which the employee, or the spouse or minor child of the employee, owns, or
(ii) Stating that the employee, or the spouse or minor child of the employee, does not own any prohibited securities.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the newly covered employee, or the spouse or minor child of the employee, shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days after appointment to the covered position.
(2)
Newly prohibited securities.
Within 30 days after publication of the prohibited securities list to which an entity's name has been added, a covered employee who owns, or whose spouse or minor child owns, prohibited securities shall make a written report of that ownership to the Office of the General Counsel. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the covered employee, or the spouse or minor child of the covered employee, shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days after publication of the prohibited securities list.
(3)
Securities acquired without specific intent.
Within 30 days after a covered employee, or the spouse or minor child of a covered employee, acquires securities of an entity on the prohibited securities list as a result of marriage, inheritance, gift or otherwise without specific intent to acquire the securities, the covered employee shall make a written report of the acquisition to the Office of the General Counsel. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a covered employee, or the spouse or minor child of a covered employee, shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days after the date of acquisition.

Disqualification pending divestiture.
Pending divestiture of prohibited securities, a covered employee must disqualify himself or herself, in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.402, from participation in particular matters which, as a result of continued ownership of the prohibited securities, would affect the financial interests of the employee, or those of the spouse or minor child of the employee. Disqualification is not required where a waiver described in 5 CFR 2635.402(d) applies. Procedures for obtaining individual waivers are contained in NRC Handbook 7.7, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room.
(6)
Tax treatment of gain on divested securities.
Where divestiture is required by this section, the covered employee (except a special Government employee) may be eligible to defer the tax consequences of divestiture under subpart J of 5 CFR part 2634, pursuant to procedures in NRC Handbook 7.7, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room.
(e)
Waivers.
(1) The Chairman may grant a waiver to permit a covered employee, or the spouse or minor child of a covered employee, to retain ownership of a security of an entity on the prohibited securities list upon a determination that the holding of the security is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that:
(i) Under the circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which NRC programs are administered;
(ii) Legal constraints prevent divestiture; or
(iii) For a special Government employee, divestiture would result in substantial financial hardship.
(2) Where a waiver has been granted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the covered employee must disqualify himself or herself, in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.402, from participation in particular matters which, as a result of continued ownership of the prohibited security, would affect the financial interests of the employee, or those of the spouse or minor child of the employee unless the employee has received a waiver described in 5 CFR 2635.402(d), pursuant to procedures in NRC Handbook 7.9, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room.

§ 5901.101
General.
(a)
Applicability.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, and unless provided elsewhere in this part, these regulations apply to all employees of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), including employees of the Federal Service Impasses Panel and the Office of the General Counsel, and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (Standards) contained in 5 CFR part 2635.
(b)
Cross-references.
In addition to 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, FLRA employees are required to comply with implementing guidance and procedures issued by the FLRA in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105(c). FLRA employees are also subject to the regulations concerning executive branch financial disclosure contained in 5 CFR part 2634, the regulations concerning executive branch financial interests contained in 5 CFR part 2640, and the regulations concerning executive branch employee responsibilities and conduct contained in 5 CFR part 735.
(c)
Agency designees.
The Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) and the Alternate Designated Agency Ethics Official (Alternate DAEO) shall serve as the FLRA's designees to make determinations, grant approvals, and take other actions under 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
§ 5901.102
Prior approval for outside employment.
(a)
General requirement.
Any FLRA employee, excluding all special Government employees (
i.e.,
employees expected to work no more than 130 days in any 365-day period), shall obtain prior written approval from the DAEO or the Alternate DAEO before engaging in any outside employment, except to the extent that the DAEO or the Alternate DAEO has issued an instruction or manual pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. Nonetheless, special Government employees remain subject to other statutory and regulatory provisions governing their outside activities, including 18 U.S.C. 203(c) and 205(c), as well as applicable provisions of 5 CFR part 2635.
(b)
Definition of “employment.”
(1) For the purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services by the employee for direct, indirect, or deferred compensation other than reimbursement of actual and necessary expenses. It also includes, irrespective of compensation, the following outside activities:
(i) Providing personal services as a consultant or professional, including service as an expert witness or as an attorney;
(ii) Providing personal services to a for-profit entity as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker; and
(iii) Writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product.
(2) The definition does not include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civic organization, unless:
(i) The employee will receive compensation other than reimbursement of expenses;
(ii) The organization's activities are devoted substantially to matters relating to the employee's official duties as defined in 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(i)(B) through (E) and the employee will
serve as officer or director of the organization; or
(iii) The activities will involve the provision of consultative or professional services. Consultative services means the provision of personal services by an employee, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which requires advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a course of specialized instruction and study in an institution of higher education, hospital, or similar facility. Professional services means the provision of personal services by an employee, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which involves application of the skills of a profession as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(1) or involves a fiduciary relationship as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(2).
(c)
Procedure for requesting approval.
(1) Requests for approval of outside employment shall be sent to either the DAEO or the Alternate DAEO through the employee's normal supervisory channels and shall include the following information:
(i) The name of the person, group, or organization for which the outside employment is proposed to be performed;
(ii) The nature of the service to be performed and the position's title, if any;
(iii) The proposed hours of work (if regularly scheduled) and the approximate dates of employment;
(iv) The employee's explanation as to whether the proposed outside employment (including teaching, speaking, or writing) will implicate in any way information obtained as a result of the employee's official Federal position; and
(v) The employee's explanation that no Federal property, resources, or facilities not available to the general public will be used in connection with the outside employment.
(2) Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or in the employee's official position within the FLRA, the employee must, within seven calendar days of the change, submit a revised request for approval.
(3) The DAEO or the Alternate DAEO shall grant approval only on a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including part 2635 of this title, or paragraph (d) of this section. The DAEO or the Alternate DAEO will advise the employee, in writing, of the approval or denial of the request for outside employment and will maintain a record of the written request and determination.
(d)
Prohibited outside employment.
(1) Employees shall not engage in:
(i) Rendering legal advice regarding, or preparing an individual or group in any matter relating to, labor relations in either the private or public sector, outside the employee's official duties. This prohibition shall not apply to a special Government employee unless he or she:
(A) Has participated personally and substantially as a Government employee or special Government employee in the same matter; or
(B) Has served with the FLRA 60 days or more during the immediately preceding period of 365 consecutive days; or
(C) Any other outside employment that conflicts with the employee's official Government duties or responsibilities.
(2)
Exceptions.
Nothing in this paragraph (d) prevents an employee from:
(i) Acting, with or without compensation, as an agent or attorney for, or otherwise representing, the employee's parents, spouse, child, or any other person for whom, or for any estate for which, the employee is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary to the extent permitted by 18 U.S.C. 203(d) and 205(e), or from providing advice or counsel to such persons or estate; or
(ii) Acting, without compensation, as an agent or attorney for, or otherwise representing, any person who is the subject of disciplinary, loyalty, or other personnel administration proceedings in connection with those proceedings, to the extent permitted by 18 U.S.C. 205.
(e)
DAEO's and Alternate DAEO's responsibilities.
The FLRA DAEO or Alternate DAEO may issue instructions or manual issuances governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment. The instructions or
manual issuances may exempt categories of employment from the prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that employment within those categories of employment would generally be approved and is not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635. The DAEO or Alternate DAEO may include in these instructions or issuances examples of outside employment that are permissible or impermissible consistent with this part and 5 CFR part 2635.
§ 5901.103
Procedure for accomplishing disqualification.
(a)
Disqualifying financial interest.
An FLRA employee who is required, in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.402(c), to disqualify himself or herself from participation in a particular matter to which he or she has been assigned shall, notwithstanding the guidance in 5 CFR 2635.402(c)(1) and (2), provide written notice of disqualification to his or her supervisor and the DAEO upon determining that he or she will not participate in the matter.

General.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Department of Transportation and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635. In addition to the standards in 5 CFR part 2635, employees are subject to the executive branch financial disclosure regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634.

(d) As designated by Deputy Ethics Officials, legal counsel in regional and other offices.
§ 6001.103
Designation of separate agency components.
(a) Pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.203(a), each of the following components of the Department of Transportation is designated as a separate agency for purpose of the regulations in subpart B of 5 CFR part 2635 governing gifts from outside sources and § 2635.807 of this title governing teaching, speaking, or writing:
(1) Federal Aviation Administration;
(2) Federal Highway Administration;
(3) Federal Railroad Administration;
(4) Federal Transit Administration;
(5) Maritime Administration;
(6) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration;
(7) Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation; and
(8) United States Coast Guard.
(b) Employees of Department of Transportation components not designated as separate agencies, including employees of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, the Research and Special Programs Administration, and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, will be treated as employees of DOT which shall be treated as a single agency that is separate from the above listed agencies for purposes of determining whether the donor of a gift is a prohibited source under 5 CFR 2635.203(d) and for identifying the DOT employee's agency under 5 CFR 2635.807 governing teaching, speaking, and writing.
§ 6001.104
Prohibited financial interests.
(a)
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no FRA employee shall hold stock or have any other financial interest, including outside employment, in a railroad company subject to FRA regulation.
(2) No FRA employee appointed after December 1991 shall hold reemployment rights with a railroad company subject to FRA regulation after his or her first year of employment.
(3) No spouse or minor child of an FRA employee shall hold stock or any other securities interest in a railroad company subject to FRA regulation.
(b)
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, no FAA employee, or spouse or minor child of the employee, may hold stock or have any other securities interest in an airline or aircraft manufacturing company, or in a supplier of components or parts to an airline or aircraft manufacturing company.
(c)
Exception.
The prohibitions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of this section do not apply to a financial interest in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund, provided that, at the time of the employee's appointment or upon initial investment in the fund, whichever occurs later, the fund does not have invested, or indicate in its prospectus the intent to invest more than 30 percent of its assets in a particular transportation or geographic sector and the employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in the fund.
(d)
Waiver.
An agency designee may grant a written waiver from the prohibition contained in paragraph (b) of this section, based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which FAA programs are administered. A waiver under this paragraph may be accompanied by appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written statement of disqualification. Notwithstanding the granting of any waiver, an employee remains subject to the disqualification requirements of 5 CFR 2635.402 and 2635.502.
(e)
Period to divest.
An individual subject to this section who acquires a financial interest subject to this section, as a result of gift, inheritance, or marriage, shall divest the interest within a period set by the agency designee. Until divestiture, the disqualification requirements of 5 CFR 2635.402 and 2635.502 remain in effect.

§ 6201.101
General.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Bank) and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635.

§ 6201.102
Prior approval for outside employment.
(a)
Prior approval requirement.
Before engaging in any outside employment, whether or not for compensation, an employee, other than a special Government employee, must obtain the written approval of the employee's immediate supervisor and the DAEO. Requests for approval shall be forwarded through normal supervisory channels to the DAEO and shall include the name of the person, group, or organization for whom the work is to be performed; the type of work to be performed; and the proposed hours of work and approximate dates of employment.
(b)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation (including 5 CFR part 2635). In the case of an employee who wishes to practice a profession involving a fiduciary relationship, as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b), approval will be granted only for each individual matter in the course of practicing such profession.
(c)
Definition of employment.
For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services by the employee. It includes but is not limited to personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee or teacher. It also includes writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product. It does not, however, include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civic organization, unless such activities involve the provision of professional services or advice or are for compensation other than reimbursement of expenses.

§ 6301.101
General.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Department of Education and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635.
[60 FR 5817, Jan. 30, 1995]
§ 6301.102
Prior approval for certain outside activities.
(a) An employee, other than a special Government employee, must obtain written approval prior to engaging—with or without compensation—in the following outside activities:
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, providing services, other than clerical services or service as a fact witness, on behalf of any other person in connection with a particular matter:
(i) In which the United States is a party;
(ii) In which the United States has a direct and substantial interest; or
(iii) If the provision of services involves the preparation of materials for submission to, or representation before, a Federal court or executive branch agency.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section:
(i) Serving as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, employee, advisory committee member, or active participant for a prohibited source; or
(ii) Engaging in teaching, speaking, consulting, or writing that relates to the employee's official duties.
(b) Unless the services are to be provided for compensation, including reimbursement for transportation, lodging and meals:
(1) Prior approval is not required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section to provide services as an agent or attorney for, or otherwise to represent, another Department of Education employee who is the subject of disciplinary, loyalty, or other personnel administration proceedings in connection with those proceedings; and
(2) Prior approval is not required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section:
(i) To participate in the activities of a:
(A) Social, fraternal, civic, or political entity;
(B) Religious entity that is not a prohibited source; or
(C) Parent-Teacher Association or similar parent organization at the employee's child's school or day care center, other than as a member of a board of directors or other governing body of the school or center, or the educational agency of which it is a part; or
(ii) To provide direct instructional, social, or medical services to students or other individuals.
(c) An employee who is required by paragraph (a) of this section to obtain prior written approval shall submit a written request for approval in accordance with Department procedures.
(d) The cognizant reviewing official shall grant approval unless he or she determines that the outside activity is expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635.
(e) For the purposes of this section:
(1) “Active participant” has the meaning set forth in 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1)(v).
(2) “Prohibited source” has the meaning set forth in 5 CFR 2635.203(d).
(3) “Relates to the employee's official duties” means that the activity meets one or more of the tests described in 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(i) (B) through (E). It includes, in relevant part:
(i) Activities an employee has been invited to participate in because of his
or her official position rather than his or her expertise in the subject matter;
(ii) A situation in which an employee has been asked to participate in an activity by a person or organization that has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties;
(iii) Activities that convey information derived from nonpublic information gained during the course of Government employment; and
(iv) Activities that deal in significant part with any matter to which the employee is or has been officially assigned in the last year, any ongoing or announced Department policy, program or operation, or—in the case of certain noncareer employees—any matter that is generally related to education or vocational rehabilitation.

# Example 1:
A Department employee witnessed an automobile accident involving two privately owned cars on her way to work. Some time later she is served with a subpoena at home to appear in Federal court as a fact witness on behalf of the plaintiff, who was injured in the car accident, in a civil case alleging negligence. The Department employee is not required to obtain prior approval to comply with the subpoena because this civil case is not a matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.

# Example 2:
A Department employee would like to prepare Federal tax returns for clients on his own time. He is required to obtain prior approval to participate in this outside activity because it involves the provision of personal services in the preparation of materials for submission to the Internal Revenue Service, an executive branch agency.

# Example 3:
Arlene, a Department employee, has been asked by a Department colleague to represent him, without compensation, in an equal employment opportunity complaint he filed alleging that his supervisor failed to promote him because he is over 40 years old. Arlene is not required to obtain prior approval under this regulation before providing such representation because it involves services for another Department of Education employee in connection with a personnel administration proceeding. However, under 18 U.S.C. section 205, she may only provide such representation if it is not inconsistent with faithful performance of her duties.

# Example 4:
A local school board offers a Department employee a paid position as a referee of high school football games. The employee must seek prior approval to accept this outside employment because the local school board is a prohibited source. If, on the other hand, the employee volunteered to coach soccer, without pay, in a sports program sponsored by the local school board, no prior approval is required because she would be engaging in direct instructional services to students.

# Example 5:
A Department program specialist in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education actively pursues an interest in painting. The community art league, where he has taken evening art classes, asks him if he would be interested in teaching an evening course on painting with acrylics. The employee is not required to obtain approval prior to accepting this employment. The community art league is not a prohibited source, and the subject matter of the course is not related to his duties.

# Example 6:
A Department employee helps organize local tennis tournaments. A national tennis magazine calls and asks her to write a monthly column about recreational tennis in her area. The magazine offers to pay the employee $500 for each column. The subject matter is not related to her duties, and the employee is not required to seek prior approval to write this column. However, the employee is still subject to all of the Standards of Conduct and other laws that may apply, including the limitation on outside earned income for certain noncareer employees, as well as the prohibition on using Government resources to pursue outside activities and employment.

# Example 7:
An employee's elderly parent is retired and receiving Social Security benefits. The employee would like to represent his parent in an administrative hearing before the Social Security Administration concerning a dispute over benefits. The employee must obtain prior approval to undertake the activity of representing his parent because he is providing services to his parent in a particular matter in which the United States is a party. Moreover, the services will involve representation before a Federal agency.

§ 6401.101
General.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Environmental Protection Agency and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635.
§ 6401.102
Prohibited financial interests.
(a) The following employees are prohibited from holding the types of financial interests described in this section:
(1) Employees in the Office of Mobile Sources are prohibited from having outside employment with or holding stock or any other financial interest in manufacturers of automobiles and mobile source pollution control equipment.
(2) Employees in the Office of Pesticide Programs are prohibited from having outside employment with or holding stock or any other financial interest in companies that manufacture or provide wholesale distribution of pesticide products registered by the EPA. These restrictions apply to companies with subsidiaries in these areas but do not include retail distributors to the general public.
(3) Employees in the Office of Information Resources Management involved with data management contracting or computer contracting are prohibited from having outside employment with or holding stock or any other financial interest in data management, computer, or information processing firms.
(4) Employees who perform functions or duties under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (such as reviewing Environmental Impact Statements of the Office of Surface Mining in the Department of Interior) are prohibited by 30 U.S.C. 1211(f) from holding direct or indirect interests in underground or surface coal mining operations.
(i) Implementing regulations of the Office of Surface Mining at 30 CFR 706.3 define the terms “direct financial interest” and “indirect financial interest” as follows:
(A)
Direct financial interest
means ownership or part ownership by an employee of land, stocks, bonds, debentures, warrants, a partnership, shares, or other holding and also means any other arrangement where the employee may benefit from his or her holding in or salary from coal mining operations. Direct financial interests include employment, pensions, creditor, real property and other financial relationships.
(B)
Indirect financial interest
means the same financial relationships as for direct ownership but where the employee reaps the benefits of such interests, including interests held by the employee's spouse, minor child or other relatives, including in-laws, residing in the employee's home. The employee will not be deemed to have an indirect financial interest if there is no relationship between the employee's functions or duties and the coal mining operation in which the spouse, minor child or other resident relative holds a financial interest.
(ii) Violation of the restrictions in this section is punishable by a fine of up to $2,500 or imprisonment for not more that one year, or both.
(iii) Employees who perform functions or duties under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act are not prohibited thereunder from holding interests in excepted investment funds as defined at 5 CFR 2634.310(c)(2) provided that such funds are widely diversified, that is, hold no more than 5% of the value of their portfolios in the securities of any one issuer (other than
the United States Government) and no more than 20% in any particular economic or geographic sector.
(5) Members of the Interagency Testing Committee established under section 4(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2603(e)) are prohibited thereunder from holding any stocks or bonds, or having any substantial pecuniary interest, in any person engaged in the manufacture, processing, or distribution in commerce of any substance or mixture subject to any requirement of the Act or any rule or order issued under the Act and, for a period of twelve months after their committee service has ceased, are prohibited thereunder from accepting employment or compensation from any person subject to any requirement of the Act or to any rule or order issued under the Act.
(i) The statutory prohibitions in this section are enforceable by an action for a court order to restrain violations.
(ii) Members of the Interagency Testing Committee are not prohibited thereunder from holding interests in excepted investment funds as defined at 5 CFR 2634.310(c)(2) provided that such fund are widely diversified, that is, hold no more than 5% of the value of their portfolios in the securities of any one issuer (other than the United States Government) and no more than 20% in any particular economic sector.
(b) The Designated Agency Ethics Official or the cognizant Deputy Ethics Official may grant a written waiver from the prohibitions in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with part 2635 of this title or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which agency programs are administered. A waiver under this paragraph may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification.
§ 6401.103
Prior approval for outside employment.
(a)
Requirement for approval.

(ii) The holder of an EPA assistance agreement or subagreement; or
(iii) A firm regulated by the EPA office or Region in which the employee serves.
(b)

The employee's request for approval of outside employment shall be submitted in writing to his or her Deputy Ethics Official. The request shall be sent through the employee's immediate supervisor (for the supervisor's information) and shall include:
(1) Employee's name, title and grade;
(2) Nature of the outside activity, including a full description of the services to be performed and the amount of compensation expected;
(3) The name and business of the person or organization for which the work will be done (in cases of self-employment, indicate the type of services to be rendered and estimate the number of clients or customers anticipated during the next 6 months);
(4) The estimated time to be devoted to the activity;
(5) Whether the service will be performed entirely outside of normal duty hours (if not, estimate the number of hours of absence from work required);
(6) The employee's statement that no official duty time or Government property, resources, or facilities not available to the general public will be used in connection with the outside employment;
(7) The basis for compensation (e.g., fee, per diem, per annum, etc.);
(8) The employee's statement that he or she has read, is familiar with, and will abide by the restrictions described in 5 CFR part 2635 and § 6401.102; and
(9) An identification of any EPA assistance agreements or contracts held by a person to or for whom services would be provided.
(c)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635 and § 6401.102. The decision must be in writing.
(d)

If there is a change in the nature or scope of the duties or services performed or the nature of the employee's business, the employee must submit a revised request for approval. Where an employee transfers to an organization for which a different Deputy Ethics Official has responsibility, the employee must obtain approval from the new Deputy Ethics Official. In addition, each approved request is valid only for five years unless the employee's Deputy Ethics Official specifies a longer time period.
(e)
Definition of employment.
For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment, business relationship, or activity involving the provision of personal services by the employee, whether or not for compensation. It includes but is not limited to personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product. It does not, however, include participation in the activities of nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organizations, unless such activities are for compensation other than reimbursement for expenses.

§ 7001.101
General.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635, as applied to employees of the United States Postal Service (Postal Service). Postal Service employees are subject, in addition to the standards in 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, to the executive branch financial disclosure regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634, and to any rules of conduct issued separately by the Postal Service, including but not limited to regulations contained in 39 CFR part 447, the Postal Service's Employee and Labor Relations Manual, and the Postal Service's Procurement Manual.
§ 7001.102
Restrictions on outside employment and business activities.
(a)
Prohibited outside employment and business activities.
No Postal Service employee shall:
(1) Engage in outside employment or business activities that involve providing consultation, advice, or any subcontracting service, with respect to the operations, programs, or procedures of the Postal Service, to any person who has a contract with the Postal Service or who the employee has reason to believe will compete for such a contract;
(2) Except as permitted by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, engage in outside employment or business activities with, for, or as a person engaged in:
(i) The operation of a commercial mail receiving agency registered with the Postal Service; or
(ii) The delivery outside the mails of any type of mailable matter, except daily newspapers.
Example 1 to paragraph (a)(2)(ii):
United Parcel Service (UPS), Federal Express (FedEx), Amazon, or DHL offers a part-time job to a Postal Service employee. Because UPS, FedEx, Amazon and DHL are persons engaged in the delivery outside the mails of mailable matter (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) that is not daily newspapers, the employee may not engage in employment with UPS, FedEx, Amazon, or DHL in any location in any capacity while continuing employment with the Postal Service in any location in any capacity. If the employee chooses to work for UPS, FedEx, Amazon, or DHL, the employee must end his or her postal employment before commencing work for that company.
(3) Engage in any fundraising (as defined in 5 CFR 2635.808(a)(1)), for-profit business activity, or sales activity, including the solicitation of business or the receipt of orders, for oneself or any other person, while on duty or in uniform, at any postal facility, or using any postal equipment. This paragraph does not prohibit an employee from engaging in fundraising at a postal facility as permitted in connection with the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) under 5 CFR part 950.

# Example 2 to paragraph (a)(3):
An employee volunteers at a local animal shelter (a non-profit organization) which is having its annual fundraising drive. The employee may not solicit funds or sell items to raise funds for the animal shelter while on duty, in uniform, at any postal facility, or using any postal equipment.

# Example 3 to paragraph (a)(3):
Outside of his postal employment, an employee operates a for-profit dog-walking business. The employee may not engage in activities relating to the operation of his business while on duty, in uniform, at any postal facility, or using any postal equipment.

# Example 4 to paragraph (a)(3):
Outside of her postal employment, an employee has a job as a sales associate for a cosmetics company.
The employee may not solicit sales or receive orders for the cosmetic company from any person while on duty, in uniform, at any postal facility, or using any postal equipment.
(b)
Prior approval for outside employment and business activities
—(1)
When prior approval required.
A Postal Service employee shall obtain approval from the Postal Service's Ethics Office in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section prior to:
(i) Engaging in outside employment or business activities with or for any person with whom the employee has official dealings on behalf of the Postal Service;
(ii) Engaging in outside employment or business activities with, for, or as a person who has interests that are:
(A) Substantially dependent upon, or potentially affected to a significant degree by, postal rates, fees, or classifications; or
(B) Substantially dependent upon providing goods or services to, or for use in connection with, the Postal Service; or
(iii) Engaging in outside employment or business activities with or for any Highway Contract Route (HCR) contractor.
(2)
When prior approval may be requested for prohibited outside employment and activities.
If an entity with which an employee wishes to engage in outside employment or business activities is a subsidiary of an entity that is engaged in one the activities described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but does not itself engage in any those activities, the employee may request approval from the Postal Service's Ethics Office to engage in such activity. The employee's request should follow the procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and will be evaluated under the standard set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

# Example 5 to paragraph (b)(2):
A Postal Service employee who wishes to engage in outside employment with Whole Foods Market may submit a request to engage in that activity to the Postal Service's Ethics Office. Although Whole Foods Market is a subsidiary of Amazon, it is engaged in the supermarket business, not in the delivery outside the mails of mailable matter.
(3)
Submission and contents of request for approval.
An employee who wishes to engage in outside employment or business activities for which approval is required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall submit a written request for approval to the Postal Service's Ethics Office. The request shall be accompanied by a statement from the employee's supervisor briefly summarizing the employee's duties and stating any workplace concerns raised by the employee's request for approval. The request for approval shall include:
(i) A brief description of the employee's official duties;
(ii) The name of the outside employer, or a statement that the employee will be engaging in employment or business activities on his or her own behalf;
(iii) The type of employment or business activities in which the outside employer, if any, is engaged;
(iv) The type of services to be performed by the employee in connection with the outside employment or business activities;
(v) A description of the employee's official dealings, if any, with the outside employer on behalf of the Postal Service; and
(vi) Any additional information requested by the Postal Service's Ethics Office that is needed to determine whether approval should be granted.
(4)
Standard for approval.
The approval required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment or business activities will not involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635, which includes, among other provisions, the principle stated at 5 CFR 2635.101(b)(14) that employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical standards set forth in part 2635.
(c)
Special rules for outside employment or business activities of OIG employees
—(1)
When reporting required.
A Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) employee shall report compensated and uncompensated outside employment or business activities to the OIG's Office of General Counsel, including:
(i) Any knowing sale or lease of real estate to the Postal Service or to a Postal Service employee or contractor,
regardless of the frequency of such sales or leases or whether the sale or lease is at fair market value;
(ii) Any ownership or control of a publicly-accessible online or physical storefront; and
(iii) Volunteer activities, if they regularly exceed 20 hours per week or when the employee holds an officer position in the organization.

# Example 6 to paragraph (c)(1)(iii):
An OIG employee occasionally volunteers with a domestic violence non-profit. The employee's volunteer duties are generally limited to 5 hours per week. The employee is not an officer of the organization. One weekend the employee helps to build a new home for a family, which takes a combined 22 hours. The employee is not required to report those volunteer activities because the employee is not an officer and the employee's volunteer activities do not
regularly
exceed 20 hours per week.

# Example 7 to paragraph (c)(1)(iii):
An OIG employee is a Scoutmaster for his child's local scouting group. The children meet for an hour each week and go on 4-hour hikes one weekend per month. Though “Scoutmaster” may involve leadership, it is not an officer position within the non-profit entity and need not be reported.
(2)
When prior approval required.
A Special Agent or Criminal Investigator shall also request and obtain written approval prior to engaging in outside employment or business activities which he or she is required to report under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A request for approval shall be submitted to the OIG's Office of General Counsel, which will be reviewed under the same standard stated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(3)
Implementation guidance.
The OIG's Office of General Counsel may issue internal instructions governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment, business activities, and volunteer activities. The instructions may exempt categories of employment, business activities, or volunteer activities from the reporting and prior approval requirements of this section based on a determination that those activities would generally be approved and are not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635. The OIG's Office of General Counsel may include in these instructions examples of outside activities that are permissible or impermissible consistent with this part and 5 CFR part 2635.
(d)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
Outside employment or business activity
means any form of employment or business, whether or not for compensation. It includes, but is not limited to, the provision of personal services as officer, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It also includes, but is not limited to, engagement as principal, proprietor, general partner, holder of a franchise, operator, manager, or director. It does not include equitable ownership through the holding of publicly-traded shares of a corporation.
(2)
Commercial mail receiving agency
means a private business that acts as the mail receiving agent for specific clients. The business must be registered with the post office responsible for delivery to the commercial mail receiving agency.
(3) A
person engaged in the delivery outside the mails of any type of mailable matter
means a person who is engaged in the delivery outside the mails of any letter, card, flat, or parcel eligible to be accepted for delivery by the Postal Service.
(4) A
person having interests substantially dependent upon, or potentially affected to a significant degree by, postal rates, fees, or classifications
includes a person:
(i) Primarily engaged in the business of publishing or distributing a publication mailed at Periodicals rates of postage;
(ii) Primarily engaged in the business of sending advertising, promotional, or other material on behalf of other persons through the mails;
(iii) Engaged in a commercial business that:
(A) Primarily utilizes the mails for the solicitation or receipt of orders for, or the delivery of, goods or services; and
(B) Can be expected to earn gross revenue exceeding $10,000 from utilizing the mails during the business's current fiscal year; or
(iv) Who is, or within the past 4 years has been, a party to a proceeding before the Postal Regulatory Commission.

# Example 8 to paragraph (d)(4)(iii):
An employee operates a business which sells handmade wooden bowls on its website and other e-commerce websites and uses the Postal Service as its primary shipper. The employee's business can be expected to earn gross revenue of more than $10,000 from utilizing the mails during the business's current fiscal year. The employee's business is “a person having interests substantially dependent upon, or potentially affected to a significant degree by, postal rates, fees, or classifications” because it is a commercial business that primarily utilizes the mails for the delivery of its goods and the business can be expected to earn gross revenue exceeding $10,000 from utilizing the mails during its current fiscal year.

# Example 9 to paragraph (d)(4)(iii):
An employee knits scarves as a hobby, most of which she gives to family and friends, but she occasionally sells extra scarves on an e-commerce website and uses the Postal Service as her primary shipper. The employee does not expect to receive more than $10,000 from utilizing the mails during the current calendar year in which she sells the scarves. The employee is not “a person having interests substantially dependent upon, or potentially affected to a significant degree by, postal rates, fees, or classifications” because she is not engaged in a commercial business that can be expected to earn gross revenue from utilizing the mails exceeding $10,000 during its current fiscal year.
(5)
A person having interests substantially dependent upon providing goods or services to, or for use in connection with, the Postal Service
includes a person:
(i) Providing goods or services under contract(s) with the Postal Service that in total can be expected to provide revenue exceeding $100,000 over the term(s) of the contract(s); or
(ii) Substantially engaged in the business of preparing items for others for mailing through the Postal Service.

# Example 10 to paragraph (d)(5)(ii):
A mailing house that sorts and otherwise prepares for its clients large volumes of advertising, fundraising, or political mail for mailing to prospective customers, donors, or voters through the Postal Service is “a person having interests substantially dependent upon providing goods or services to, or for use in connection with, the Postal Service” because it is substantially engaged in the business of preparing items for others for mailing through the Postal Service.
[88 FR 53354, Aug. 8, 2023, as amended at 89 FR 7267, Feb. 2, 2024]
§ 7001.103
Statutory prohibition against interests in contracts to carry mail and acting as agent for contractors.
Section 440 of title 18, United States Code, makes it unlawful for any Postal Service employee to become interested in any contract for carrying the mail, or to act as agent, with or without compensation, for any contractor or person offering to become a contractor in any business before the Postal Service.
§ 7001.104
Prohibited financial interests of the members of the Board of Governors.
(a)
General prohibitions.
(1) No member of the Board of Governors, which includes the Postmaster General, the Deputy Postmaster General, and the nine appointed Governors of the United States Postal Service, or any spouse or minor child of any member of the Board of Governors, shall acquire or hold, directly or indirectly:
(i) Any financial interest in a person engaged in the delivery outside the mails of any type of mailable matter, except daily newspapers; or
(ii) Any financial interest in a publicly-traded entity engaged primarily in the business of leasing real property to the Postal Service.
(2) No member of the Board of Governors shall actively control the acquisition of, or the holding of, any financial interest described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, on behalf of any entity whose financial interests are imputed to them under 18 U.S.C. 208. A member of the Board of Governors actively controls the financial interests of an entity if he or she selects or dictates the entity's investments, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or funds. A member of the Board of Governors does not actively control the financial interests of an entity if he or she merely directs the investment strategy of the entity, hires the entity's financial manager(s) who selects the entity's investments, or designates another employee of the entity to select the entity's investments. A
member of the Board of Governors may have such investment authority when serving as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, or employee of an entity.

# Example 1 to paragraph (a)(2):
A Governor is also the chief executive officer (CEO) of a life insurance company. The company's policy is for: the board of directors to determine the overall investment strategy for the company's excess cash, an internal team to recommend to the CEO specific financial instruments in which to invest the company's excess cash to implement the board's overall investment strategy, and the CEO to approve or disapprove of the internal team's specific investment recommendations. The Governor actively controls the financial interests of the life insurance company in her position as CEO of the company.

# Example 2 to paragraph (a)(2):
A Deputy Postmaster General is also on the board of directors of an investment company. The company's policy is for: the board of directors to determine the overall investment strategy for the company's excess cash, the board of directors to choose an external investment manager to select and manage day-to-day the specific financial instruments in which the company's excess cash is invested to implement the board's overall investment strategy, and the CEO and other company management official to oversee the investment management process, including periodic review of the company's investment portfolio. This Deputy Postmaster General does not actively control the financial interests of the investment company in his position on the board of directors.
(b)
Exception.
Paragraph (a) of this section does not prohibit any member of the Board of Governors or spouse or minor child of any member of the Board of Governors from directly or indirectly acquiring or holding, or a member of the Board of Governors from actively controlling on behalf of any entity, any financial interest in any publicly-traded or publicly-available mutual fund (as defined in 5 CFR 2640.102(k)) or other collective investment fund, including a widely-held pension or other retirement fund, that includes any financial interest described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, provided that:
(1) Neither the member of the Board of Governors nor his or her spouse exercises active control over the financial interests held by the fund; and
(2) The fund does not have a stated policy of concentrating its investments in, as applicable, persons engaged in the delivery outside the mails of mailable matter, except daily newspapers, or persons engaged primarily in the business of leasing real property to the Postal Service.
(c)
Reporting of prohibited financial interest and divestiture
—(1)
General.
Any financial interest prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section shall be divested, in the case of a Governor, within 90 calendar days of confirmation by the Senate of the Governor's nomination, and, in the case of a Postmaster General or Deputy Postmaster General, within 90 calendar days of his or her appointment, or as soon as possible thereafter if there are restrictions on divestiture.
(2)
Newly-prohibited financial interests following confirmation or appointment.
If a financial interest described in paragraph (a) of this section becomes prohibited subsequent to the Governor's confirmation or a Postmaster General or Deputy Postmaster General's appointment:
(i) The member of the Board of Governors shall report the prohibited financial interest to the Postal Service's Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) within 30 calendar days of the DAEO informing the member of the Board of Governors that such financial interests have become prohibited; and
(ii) The prohibited financial interest shall be divested within 90 calendar days of the DAEO informing the member of the Board of Governors that such financial interests have become prohibited, or as soon as possible thereafter if there are restrictions on divestiture.
(3)
Prohibited financial interests acquired without specific intent following confirmation or appointment.
(i) If a member of the Board of Governors, or spouse or minor child of any member of the Board of Governors acquires a financial interest prohibited by paragraph (a)(1) of this section without specific intent to acquire it (such as through marriage, inheritance, or gift) subsequent to the Governor's confirmation or the appointment of a Postmaster General or Deputy Postmaster General:
(A) The member of the Board of Governors shall report the prohibited financial interest to the Postal Service's
DAEO within 30 calendar days of its acquisition; and
(B) The prohibited financial interest shall be divested within 90 calendar days of its acquisition, or as soon as possible thereafter if there are restrictions on divestiture.
(ii) If an entity whose financial interests are actively controlled by a member of the Board of Governors acquires a financial interest described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section without specific intent to acquire it (such as through a gift) subsequent to a Governor's confirmation or the appointment of a Postmaster General or Deputy Postmaster General:
(A) The member of the Board of Governors shall report the prohibited financial interest to the Postal Service's DAEO within 30 calendar days of its acquisition; and
(B) The prohibited financial interest shall be divested within 90 calendar days of its acquisition, or as soon as possible thereafter if there are restrictions on divestiture.
(4)
Disqualification from participating in particular matters pending divestiture.
Pending any required divestiture of a prohibited financial interest provided for in this paragraph (c), a member of the Board of Governors shall disqualify himself or herself from participating in particular matters involving or affecting the prohibited financial interest. Disqualification is accomplished by not participating in the particular matter.
(d)
Waiver of prohibited financial interests.
For good cause shown by a member of the Board of Governors, the Postal Service's DAEO may grant a written waiver to the member of the Board of Governors of any prohibited financial interest described in paragraph (a) or (c)(2) or (3) of this section; provided that the DAEO finds that the waiver is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of the member of the Board of Governors' misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality or objectivity with which the Postal Service's programs are administered. The DAEO may impose appropriate conditions for granting of the waiver, such as requiring the member of the Board of Governors to execute a written statement of disqualification.
(e)
Definition.
For purposes of this section, a
person engaged in the delivery outside the mails of any type of mailable matter
is as defined in § 7001.102(d)(3).

General requirement.
Before engaging in any outside employment, with or without compensation, an employee of the MSPB, other than a special Government employee, must obtain written approval from the employee's supervisor and the concurrence of the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) or the alternate DAEO, except to the extent that the MSPB DAEO or alternate DAEO has issued an instruction or manual pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section exempting an activity or class of activities from this requirement. Nonetheless, special Government employees remain subject to other statutory and regulatory provisions governing their outside activities, including 18 U.S.C. 203(c) and 205(c), as well as applicable provisions of 5 CFR part 2635.
(b)
Definition of employment.
For purposes of this section, employment means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services, whether or not for compensation. It includes, but is not limited to, services as an officer, director, employee, agent, advisor, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product.

Consultative services
means the provision of personal services by an employee, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which requires advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a course of specialized instruction and study in an institution of higher education, hospital, or similar facility.
Professional services
means the provision of personal services by an employee, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which involves application of the skills of a profession as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(1) or involves a fiduciary relationship as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(2).

# Note to § 7401.102(
b

# ):
There is a special approval requirement set out in both 18 U.S.C.
203(d) and 205(e), respectively, for certain representational activities otherwise covered by the conflict of interest restrictions on compensation and activities of employees in claims against and other matters affecting the Government. Thus, an employee who wishes to act as agent or attorney for, or otherwise represent his parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or any estate for which, he is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary in such matters must obtain the approval required by law of the Government official responsible for the employee's appointment in addition to the regulatory approval required in this section.
(c)
Procedure for requesting approval.
(1) The approval required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be requested by e-mail or other form of written correspondence in advance of engaging in outside employment as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) The request for approval to engage in outside employment or certain other activities shall set forth, at a minimum:
(i) The name of the employer or organization;
(ii) The nature of the legal activity or other work to be performed;
(iii) The title of the position; and
(iv) The estimated duration of the outside employment.
(3) Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or in the employee's official position within the MSPB, the employee must, within 7 calendar days of the change, submit a revised request for approval.
(d)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.
(e)
DAEO's and alternate DAEO's responsibilities.
The MSPB DAEO or alternate DAEO may issue instructions or manual issuances governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment. The instructions or manual issuances may exempt categories of employment from the prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that employment within those categories of employment would generally be approved and is not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635. The DAEO or alternate DAEO may include in these instructions or issuances examples of outside employment that are permissible or impermissible consistent with this part and 5 CFR part 2635.

§ 7801.101
General.
(a)
Purpose.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the United States Commission on Civil Rights (Commission) and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained at 5 CFR part 2635. Employees of the Commission are required to comply with this part, 5 CFR part 2635, the executive branchwide financial disclosure and financial interests regulations at 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2640, and implementing guidance and procedures. Commission employees are also subject to the executive branch regulations on responsibilities and conduct at 5 CFR part 735.
(b)
Definition.
The Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) is the Solicitor for the Commission.
§ 7801.102
Prior approval for outside employment.
(a) An employee, other than a special Government employee, of the Commission who wishes to engage in outside employment shall first obtain the approval, in writing, of the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO). Volunteer professional services, however, may be “generally approved” in advance as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b) Standard for approval. Approval shall be granted by the DAEO only upon a determination that the prospective outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.
(c) Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or the employee's official position, the employee must submit a revised request for approval.
(d) For purposes of this section, “outside employment” means any form of non-Federal employment, business relationship or activity involving the provision of personal services by the employee, whether or not for compensation. It includes, but is not limited to, personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes writing done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product. It does not, however, include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organization, unless such activities involve the provision of professional services or advice or are for compensation other than reimbursement of expenses.
(e)(1) The Commission may designate volunteer activities as “generally approved,” or preapproved by the DAEO, in order to facilitate the participation of the Commission's professional and nonprofessional staff (whether involving legal or non-legal services). Non-representational pro bono legal services designated as “generally approved” require employees to notify the DAEO, the General Counsel (GC), and the employee's supervisor (if different from the GC) prior to the employee's participation; however, no additional prior approval is required. Representational pro bono legal services designated as “generally approved” still require prior case-specific written approval by the DAEO pursuant to this section, and notification of the GC and the employee's supervisor (if different from the GC). Non-legal
professional volunteer activities designated as “generally approved” require employees to notify their supervisor and the DAEO. However, no additional prior written approval is required.
(2) To provide professional services or advice to a program or activity not designated as “generally approved,” the employee must notify his or her supervisor and submit a written request and justification in advance to the DAEO. In addition, in order to provide pro bono legal services the employee must notify the GC (if the GC is not the employee's supervisor). If providing representational pro bono legal services, the employee must also obtain written case-specific prior approval from the DAEO pursuant to this section. All requests for approval submitted to the DAEO must reflect that the required notifications were made by the employee. All DAEO approvals must be in writing.

(b) Approval under paragraph (a) of this section shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.
(c) Vice presidents or other officers of TVA may, after consultation with the Designated Agency Ethics Official, exempt specified classes of employees from this section based upon a determination that the official duties of employees in the class are such that their outside employment activities are not likely to raise issues of compliance with 5 CFR part 2635.

(ii) Nothing in this section prohibits an RD employee, or a spouse or minor child of an RD employee, from owning Patronage Capital that the employee receives simply by reason of being a member of a nonprofit entity, such as an electric, telecommunications, or water cooperative. For purposes of this section, Patronage Capital is defined as amounts received for providing a service in excess of the amounts required for operating costs and expenses.
(d)
Prohibited real estate purchases.
Except in cases where a waiver has been granted pursuant to paragraph (g) of
this section, no RD employee, or spouse or minor child of an RD employee may personally, or through the participation of another person, knowingly purchase real estate or personal property: Mortgaged or pledged to the Government through RD; held in the RD inventory; for sale under forfeiture to RD; or from an RD program participant.

Exceptions.

Prohibited outside employment.
No RD employee may provide personal consulting services for any person or entity with an application on file with, grant from, or outstanding loan or loan guaranty with RD, if the application, grant, or outstanding loan or loan guaranty could be affected directly by decisions of the particular RD office in which the RD employee serves.
(g)
Waiver
—(1)
Approving officials.
A written request for an exception to the prohibitions found in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section may be submitted in advance of the transaction by the RD employee (whether on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of the employee's own spouse or minor child) to:
(i) The RD State Director, for RD State-level employees; or
(ii) The Deputy Administrator for Operations and Management, for RD State Directors and National Office employees.
(2)
Standards.
The RD State Director or Deputy Administrator for Operations and Management may grant a written waiver from this prohibition based on a determination made with the concurrence of the USDA Office of Ethics that all three of the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) The waiver is not inconsistent with part 2635 of this title, this part, or 7 U.S.C. 1986, nor otherwise prohibited by law, and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which agency programs are administered;
(ii) The transaction:
(A) Appears free of duress or favoritism;
(B) Does not involve a contractual relationship or obligation that exceeds 365 consecutive calendar days; and
(C) Is in the best interests of the RD program participant; and
(iii) A denial of the request would likely cause significant hardship to the RD program participant.
(3)
Additional conditions.
A waiver under this paragraph may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written disqualification. Approval of a waiver under this paragraph does not exempt the employee from complying with other applicable programmatic requirements under 7 CFR part 3550.9.
(h)
Additional prior approval requirement for outside employment.
(1) Any RD employee wishing to engage in outside employment as defined in paragraph (b) of § 8301.102 and who is not otherwise required to obtain approval therefor under that section, shall obtain prior written approval in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of § 8301.102 if the outside employment is covered under paragraph (h)(2) or paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
(2) Outside employment is subject to the prior approval requirement of this
paragraph if it involves any of the following activities, if conducted in the area serviced by the RD office in which the employee serves:
(i) Sale, appraisal, or assessment of real estate;
(ii) Performance of real estate brokerage services;
(iii) Service as a title attorney or title insurance representative;

(viii) Membership in grazing associations, un-incorporated Economic Opportunity cooperatives, rental housing groups, and closely-held labor housing organizations;
(ix) Insurance sales; or
(x) Land speculation.
(3) Outside employment is also subject to the prior approval requirements of this paragraph if it is with or for a person whom the RD employee knows, or reasonably should know, is both:

(ii) Directly affected by decisions made by the particular RD office in which the RD employee serves.

et seq.
(b)
Exceptions.
(1) This section does not prohibit an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, from investing in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund which, in its prospectus, does not indicate the objective or practice of concentrating its investments in the securities of any company or other person engaged in mining activities subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, provided that the employee neither:
(i) Exercises control over the financial interests held in the fund; nor
(ii) Has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in the fund.

(A) Ownership or control was acquired prior to the employee's commencement of employment, through a change in marital status, or through circumstances beyond the employee's control and without the appearance of attempting to circumvent the prohibitions in this section, such as acquisition by inheritance, gift, or merger, acquisition or other change in corporate ownership, provided that: (
1
) The employee makes full, written disclosure to the designated agency ethics official within 30 days after the security is acquired or the employment is commenced; and

(c)
Divestiture.
The designated agency ethics official may require an employee to divest a security the employee is otherwise authorized to retain under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, based on a determination of substantial conflict under § 2635.403(b) of this title.
(d)
Waivers.
The designated agency ethics official may grant a written waiver from the prohibition contained in this section based on a determination that the waiver is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to avoid the appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which Commission programs are administered. A waiver under this paragraph may be accompanied by appropriate conditions, such as requiring execution of a written statement of disqualification. Notwithstanding the grant of any waiver, an employee remains subject to the disqualification requirements of 5 CFR 2635.402 and 2635.502.

Waivers.
(a)
General.
The DAEO may waive any provision of this part upon finding that the waiver will not result in conduct inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that application of the provision is not necessary to ensure public confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which the programs of FHFA are administered. Each waiver shall be in writing and supported by a statement of the facts and findings upon which it is based and may impose appropriate conditions, including but not limited to requiring the employee to execute a written disqualification statement or an agreement not to acquire additional securities.
(b)
Waiver of prohibitions relating to ownership or control of securities.
The DAEO may grant a waiver permitting the employee or the employee's spouse or minor children to own or control, directly or indirectly, any security prohibited under § 9001.104, if, in addition to the standards under paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) A security for which a waiver has been granted pursuant to § 9001.103; and
(2) An interest in a publicly-traded or publicly-available diversified mutual fund or other collective diversified investment fund, including a widely-held pension or other retirement fund if:
(i) Neither the employee, the employee's spouse, nor the employee's minor children exercise or have the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held by the fund; and
(ii) The fund does not indicate in its prospectus the objective or practice of concentrating its investments in securities of a regulated entity or regulated entities generally, and less than 25 percent of the total holdings of the fund are comprised of securities owned, issued, guaranteed, securitized, or collateralized by one or more regulated entities.
(d)
Reporting and divestiture.
An employee must provide, in writing, to the DAEO any financial interest prohibited under paragraph (a) of this section acquired prior to the effective date of this part or the commencement of employment with FHFA or without specific intent, as through gift, inheritance, or marriage, within 30 calendar days from the effective date of this part, commencement of employment with FHFA, or acquisition of such interest. Such financial interest must be divested within 90 calendar days from the date reported unless a waiver is granted in accordance with § 9001.103.

Nonetheless, special Government employees remain subject to other statutory and regulatory provisions governing their outside activities, including 18 U.S.C. 203(c) and 205(c), as well as applicable provisions of 5 CFR part 2635.
(2) An employee, other than a special Government employee, who before the effective date of this part or commencement of employment with FHFA commenced engaging in outside employment that is not prohibited under paragraph (a) of this section must request written approval from his or her supervisor and the concurrence of the DAEO within 30 calendar days of the effective date of this part or commencement of employment with FHFA. The employee may continue engaging
in the outside employment while the request is under review.
(c)
Definition of outside employment.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section,
outside employment
means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services, whether or not for compensation. It includes, but is not limited to, services as an officer, director, employee, agent, advisor, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes writing when done under an arrangement with another person or entity for production or publication of the written product. The definition does not include positions as trustee for a family trust for which the only beneficiaries are the employee, the employee's spouse, the employee's minor or dependent children, or any combination thereof. The definition also does not include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civic organization, unless:
(1) The employee will receive compensation other than reimbursement of expenses;
(2) The organization's activities are devoted substantially to matters relating to the employee's official duties as defined in 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(i)(B) through (E) and the employee will serve as officer or director of the organization; or
(3) The activities will involve the provision of consultative or professional services.
Consultative services
means the provision of personal services by an employee, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which requires advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a course of specialized instruction and study in an institution of higher education, hospital, or similar facility.
Professional services
means the provision of personal services by an employee, including the rendering of advice or consultation, which involves application of the skills of a profession as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(1) or involves a fiduciary relationship as defined in 5 CFR 2636.305(b)(2).

# Note to § 9001.105(
c

# ):
There is a special approval requirement set out in both 18 U.S.C. 203(d) and 205(e), respectively, for certain representational activities otherwise covered by the conflict of interest restrictions on compensation and activities of employees in claims against and other matters affecting the Government. Thus, an employee who wishes to act as agent or attorney for, or otherwise represent his or her parents, spouse, children, or any person for whom, or any estate for which, he or she is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary in such matters must obtain the approval required by law of the Government official responsible for the employee's appointment in addition to the regulatory approval required in this section.
(d)
Procedure for requesting approval and concurrence
—(1) The approval required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be requested by e-mail or other form of written correspondence in advance of engaging in outside employment as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) The request for approval to engage in outside employment shall set forth, at a minimum:
(i) The name of the employer or organization;
(ii) The nature of the activity or other work to be performed;
(iii) The title of the position; and
(iv) The estimated duration of the outside employment.
(3) Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or in the employee's official position within FHFA, the employee must, within seven calendar days of the change, submit a revised request for approval and concurrence.
(e)
Standard for concurrence.
The DAEO may concur with the supervisor's approval required by paragraph (b) of this section only upon his or her written determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
(f)
Issuance of instructions.
The DAEO may issue written instructions governing the submission of requests for approval of and concurrence with outside employment under paragraph (d) of this section. The instructions may exempt categories of employment from the prior approval and concurrence requirement of paragraph (b) of this section based on a determination by the DAEO that employment within those
categories of employment will generally be approved and is not likely to involve conduct prohibited by Federal law or regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635 and this part.
§ 9001.106
Restrictions resulting from employment of family and household members.
(a)
Disqualification of employee.
An employee may not participate in any particular matter in which a regulated entity is a party if the regulated entity employs as an employee or a consultant his or her spouse, child, parent, or sibling, or member of his or her household unless the DAEO has authorized the employee to participate in the matter using the standard set forth in 5 CFR 2635.502(d).
(b)
Reporting certain relationships.
Within 30 calendar days of the spouse, child, parent, sibling, or member of the employee's household being employed by the regulated entity, the employee shall provide in writing notice of such employment to the DAEO.

(a)
Director and Deputy Directors.

(b)
Financial interests in Bank members and other financial institutions.
If an employee or the spouse or minor children of the employee directly or indirectly owns a financial interest in a member of a Bank or in a financial institution such as a mortgage bank, mortgage broker, bank, thrift, or other financial institution that originates, insures, or services mortgages that are owned, guaranteed, securitized, or collateralized by a regulated entity, the employee is cautioned not to violate the statutory prohibition against financial conflicts of interest set forth in 18 U.S.C. 208. The government-wide
de minimis
and other exceptions set forth in 5 CFR 2640.202 are applicable to the ownership or control of interests in such financial institutions. Employees are encouraged to seek a determination from the DAEO as to whether the financial interest in the member of the Bank or in the financial institution creates a financial conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest and whether the employee should disqualify himself or herself from participating in an official capacity in a particular matter involving the financial institution.
§ 9001.108
Prohibited recommendations.
Employees shall not make any recommendation or suggestion, directly or indirectly, concerning the acquisition, sale, or divestiture of securities of a regulated entity.
§ 9001.109
Prohibited purchase of assets.

# Procedures for Disclosure of Records Under the Freedom of Information Act
§ 9301.1
In general.
This information is furnished for the guidance of the public and in compliance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. This subpart should be read in conjunction with the FOIA. The Freedom of Information Act applies to third-party requests for documents concerning the general activities of the government and of SIGAR in particular. When a U.S. citizen or an individual lawfully admitted for permanent residence requests access to his or her own records, it is considered a Privacy Act request. Such records are maintained by SIGAR under the individual's name or personal identifier. Although requests are considered either FOIA requests for Privacy Act requests, agencies process requests in accordance with both laws, which provides the greatest degree of lawful access while safeguarding an individual's privacy.
[77 FR 38171, June 27, 2012]
§ 9301.2
Authority and functions.
Section 1229 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Public Law 110-181, established the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). SIGAR's mission under Sections 1229 and 842 of Public Law 110-181, is to provide independent oversight of the treatment, handling, and expenditure of funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the reconstruction of Afghanistan; detect and deter fraud, waste, and abuse of U.S. funds; and promote actions to increase program economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.
§ 9301.3
Organization.
SIGAR maintains its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, and field offices in Kabul and elsewhere in Afghanistan.

# Procedures
§ 9301.4
Availability of records.
SIGAR provides records to individual requesters in response to FOIA requests. Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for public inspection and copying are accessible on SIGAR's Web site,
http://www.sigar.mil.
SIGAR will also identify records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and then post these records.
[77 FR 38171, June 27, 2012]
§ 9301.5
Accessing records without request
Certain SIGAR records, including the agency's Quarterly Report, audit reports, testimony, oversight plans, press releases, other public issuances, and records that are required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) to be made publicly available are available electronically from SIGAR's homepage at
http://www.sigar.mil.
SIGAR encourages requesters to visit its Web site before making a request for records under § 9301.6.
[82 FR 712, Jan. 4, 2017]
§ 9301.6
Requesting records.
(a)
Written requests required.
For records not available as described under § 9301.5, requesters wishing to obtain information from SIGAR should submit a written request to SIGAR's FOIA Officer. Requests should be addressed to FOIA Officer, Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202. As there may be delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the request via facsimile to (703) 601-3804 or by email to
sigar.pentagon.gen-coun.mbx.foia@mail.mil.
(b)
Contents of requests.
Requests should be as specific as possible and should reasonably specify the records sought so that the records can be located with a reasonable amount of effort. The request should identify the desired record or describe it, and include information such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record, where possible. The request should also include a statement of the requester's willingness to pay fees, or request a fee waiver. The words “FOIA REQUEST” or “REQUEST FOR RECORDS” should be clearly marked on the cover letter, letter, and/or envelope.
(c)
Response to requests
—(1)
Processing.
SIGAR will provide an individualized tracking number, and estimated date of completion, and a brief description of the subjects of the request in an acknowledgement letter to the requester. The FOIA Officer shall determine within 20 days (except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays) after receiving a request for records, whether it is appropriate to grant or deny the request. The 20-day period may be tolled once if the FOIA Officer requests information from the requestor or if additional time is necessary to clarify issues with the requestor regarding a fee assessment.
(i)
Request granted.
If the FOIA Officer decides to grant the request, either in-full or in-part, the FOIA Officer shall promptly provide the requester written notice of the decision. The FOIA Officer shall include with the notice both the requested records and a copy of the decision. The notice shall also describe the procedure for filing an appeal.
(ii)
Adverse determinations.
If the FOIA Officer denies the request, in full or part, or applies exemptions to withhold requested documents, the FOIA Officer shall provide the requester written notice of the adverse determination together with the approximate number of pages of information withheld and the exemption under which the information was withheld. SIGAR will indicate, if technically feasible, the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion is made at the place in the record where the deletion was made. SIGAR will also indicate the exemption under which a deletion is made on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemptions. The notice shall also describe the procedure for filing an appeal. SIGAR will further notify the requester of their right to seek assistance from SIGAR's FOIA Public Liaison or dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services in the case of an adverse determination.
(iii)
Consultations and referrals:
When SIGAR receives a request for a record in its possession, it will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government, is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA and, if so, whether it should be disclosed as a matter of administrative discretion. If SIGAR determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the
request, then it will do so. If SIGAR determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it will either:
(A) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or
(B) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to the agency that originated the record (but only if that agency is subject to the FOIA). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.
(2)(i)
Expedited processing.
At the time a requester submits an initial request for records the requester may ask the FOIA Officer in writing to expedite processing of the request. The request for expedited processing must be accompanied by a written statement, which shall state that it is true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief, explaining why expedited processing is warranted. The FOIA Officer shall generally grant requests for expedited processing of requests for records, and appeals of denials under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, whenever the FOIA Officer determines that:
(A) Failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably pose a threat to a person's life or physical safety; or
(B) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, there is an urgency to inform the public about Government activity that is the specific subject of the FOIA request.
(ii) The FOIA Officer shall ordinarily decide within ten calendar days after receiving a request for expedited processing whether to grant it and shall notify the requester of the decision. If the FOIA Officer grants a request for expedited processing, the FOIA Officer shall process the request as soon as practicable. If the FOIA Officer denies a request for expedited processing, SIGAR shall act expeditiously on any appeal of that denial.
(3)
Extension for unusual circumstances
—
(i)
In general.
If the FOIA Officer determines that unusual circumstances exist, the FOIA Officer may extend for no more than ten days (except Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays) the time limits described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by providing written notice of the extension to the requester. The FOIA Officer shall include with the notice a brief statement of the reason for the extension and the date the FOIA Officer expects to make the determination. If the extension goes beyond ten working days, the FOIA Officer will include a notification of the requester's right to seek dispute resolutions services from the Office of Government Information Services.
(ii)
Additional procedures.
The FOIA Officer shall provide written notice to the requester if the FOIA Officer decides that the determination cannot be made within the time limit described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. The notice shall afford the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request to the extent necessary for the FOIA Officer to process it within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange a longer period for processing the request.
(d)
Appeals
—(1)
Initiating appeals.
Requesters not satisfied with the FOIA Officer's written decision may request SIGAR's FOIA Appellate Authority to review the decision. Appeals must be delivered in writing within 90 days of the date of the decision and shall be addressed to the FOIA Appellate Authority, Office of Privacy, Records
Disclosure, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202. As there may be delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to Fax appeals to (703) 601-3804 or email to
sigar.pentagon.gencoun.mbx.foia@mail.mil.
An appeal shall include a statement specifying the records that are the subject of the appeal and explaining why the Appellate Authority should grant the appeal.
(2)
Appeal decisions.
The Appellate Authority shall decide the appeal within 20 days (except Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays) from the date it receives the appeal. If the Appellate Authority denies the appeal in full or part, the Appellate Authority shall
promptly notify the requester in writing of the Appellate Authority's decision and the provisions for judicial review. If the Appellate Authority grants the appeal, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester in writing and shall make available to the requester copies of the releasable records once the requester pays any fees that SIGAR assesses under §§ 9301.8 through 9301.10.
(3)
Dispute resolution.
A response to an appeal will advise the requester that the 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer dispute resolution services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a nonexclusive alternative to litigation. Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. A requester may contact OGIS in any of the following ways: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740; Email:
ogis@nara.gov;
Telephone: 202-741-5770; Facsimile: 202-741-5769; Toll-free: 1-877-684-6448.

(2) The requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion.
(i) [Reserved]
(ii) When the FOIA Officer requires a requester to make an advance payment, the 20-day period described in § 9301.6(c)(1) shall begin when the FOIA Officer receives the payment.
(f)
No assessment of fee.
SIGAR shall not charge a fee to any requester if:
(1) The cost of collecting the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself; or
(2) SIGAR fails to comply with any time limit under the FOIA for responding to a request for records where no unusual or exceptional circumstances apply.
(3) SIGAR determines that unusual circumstances apply to the processing of a request, provides timely notice to the requester, and delay is excused for an additional ten days, but SIGAR still fails to respond within the timeframe established by the additional delay. This provision applies only to search fees or duplication fees for educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media requesters. However, the following exceptions shall apply:
(i) Notwithstanding § 9301.8(f)(3), if SIGAR determines that unusual circumstances apply and that more than 5000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, SIGAR may continue to charge search fees, or duplication fees for requesters in preferred status, for as long as necessary, after timely written notice has been made to the requester and SIGAR has discussed with the requester how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone, or made three good-faith attempts to do so.

§ 9301.9
Fees for categories of requesters.
SIGAR shall assess fees for certain categories of requesters as follows:
(a)
Commercial use requesters.
In responding to commercial use requests, SIGAR shall assess fees that recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing and duplicating records.
(b)
Educational institutions.
SIGAR shall provide records to requesters in this category for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To qualify for inclusion in this fee category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scholarly research, not an individual goal.
(c)
Representatives of the news media.
SIGAR shall provide records to requesters in this category for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.
(d)
All other requesters.
SIGAR shall charge requesters who do not fall within paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section fees that recover the full direct cost of searching for and duplicating records, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time.
§ 9301.10
Other charges.
SIGAR may apply other charges, including the following:
(a)
Special charges.
SIGAR shall recover the full cost of providing special services, such as sending records by an overnight delivery service, to the extent that SIGAR elects to provide them.
(b)
Interest charges.
SIGAR may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the FOIA Officer sent the billing. Interest shall be charged at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of billing.
(c)
Aggregating requests.
When the FOIA Officer reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests within a 30-day period for the purpose of avoiding fees, the FOIA Officer shall aggregate those requests and charge accordingly.
[77 FR 34180, June 11, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 38172, June 27, 2012]
§ 9301.11
Payment and waiver.
(a)
Remittances.
Payment shall be made in the form of check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States. At the time the FOIA Officer notifies a requestor of the applicable fees, the Officer shall inform the requestor of where to send the payment.
(b)
Waiver.
SIGAR may waive all or part of any fee provided for in §§ 9301.8 through 9301.9 when the FOIA Officer deems that as a matter of administrative discretion or disclosure of the information is in the general public's interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Requesters may request a waiver in their initial FOIA request letter. Requests for a fee waiver should explain how the information requested contributes to the public's understanding of the operations or activities of the government. In determining whether a fee should be waived, the FOIA Officer may consider whether:
(1) The subject matter specifically concerns identifiable operations or activities of the government;
(2) The information is already in the public domain;
(3) Disclosure of the information would contribute to the understanding of the public-at-large as opposed to a narrow segment of the population;
(4) Disclosure of the information would significantly enhance the public's understanding of the subject matter;
(5) Disclosure of the information would further a commercial interest of the requester; and
(6) The public's interest is greater than any commercial interest of the requester.

# Subpart B—Privacy Act

# Authority:
Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1896, codified at 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) (agency rules).
§ 9301.12
Purpose and scope.
The purpose of this subpart is to provide certain safeguards for an individual against the invasion of his or her personal privacy by SIGAR. This subpart is promulgated pursuant to the requirements applicable to all federal agencies contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
§ 9301.13
Rules for determining if an individual is the subject of a record.
(a) Individuals desiring to know if a specific system of records maintained by SIGAR contains a record pertaining to them should address their inquiries to the Privacy Officer, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202. As there may be delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the request via facsimile to (703) 601-3804 or by email to
sigar.pentagon.gen-coun.mbx.privacy@mail.mil.
The written
inquiry should contain a specific reference to the system of records maintained by the SIGAR listed in the SIGAR Notice of Systems of Records, or it should describe the type of record in sufficient detail reasonably to identify the system of records. Notice of SIGAR systems of records subject to the Privacy Act will be published in the
Federal Register,
posted on the SIGAR public facing Web site, and copies of the notices will be available upon request to the Privacy Officer when so published. A compilation of such notices will also be made and published by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
(b) At a minimum, the request should contain sufficient identifying information to allow SIGAR to determine if there is a record pertaining to the individual making the request in a particular system of records. In instances when the requester's identification is insufficient to ensure disclosure to the individual to whom the information pertains in view of the sensitivity of the information, SIGAR reserves the right to solicit from the person requesting access to a record additional identifying information.
(c) Ordinarily the person requesting will be informed whether the named system of records contains a record pertaining to such person within 10 days of such a request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal Federal holidays). Such a response will also contain or reference the procedures which must be followed by the individual making the request in order to gain access to the record.
(d) Whenever a response cannot be made within the 10 days, the Privacy Officer will inform the person making the request the reasons for the delay and the date on which a response may be anticipated.
§ 9301.14
Requests for access.
(a)
Requirement for written requests.
An individual desiring to gain access to a record pertaining to him or her in a system of records maintained by SIGAR must submit his or her request in writing in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Individuals employed by the SIGAR may make their requests on a regularly scheduled workday (Monday through Friday, excluding legal Federal holidays) between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Such requests for access by individuals employed by SIGAR need not be made in writing.
(b)
Procedures
—(1)
Content of the request.
The request for access to a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the Privacy Officer at the address cited above, and shall name the system of records or contain a concise description of such system of records. The request should state that the request is pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974. In the absence of such a statement, if the request is for a record pertaining to the person requesting access which is maintained by SIGAR in a system of records, the request will be considered under both the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Freedom of Information Act, depending on which would allow greater access to the records requested. The request should contain necessary information to verify the identity of the person requesting access (see paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section). In addition, such person should include any other information which may assist in the rapid identification of the record for which access is being requested (e.g., maiden name, dates of employment, etc.) as well as any other identifying information contained in and required by the SIGAR Notice of Systems of Records.
(i) If the request for access follows a prior request under § 9301.1, the same identifying information need not be included in the request for access if a reference is made to that prior correspondence or a copy of the SIGAR response to that request is attached. If the individual specifically desires a copy of the record, the request should so specify under § 9301.4.
(ii) [Reserved]
(2)
SIGAR action on request.
A request for access will ordinarily be answered within 10 days, except when the Privacy Officer determines otherwise, in which case the person making the request will be informed of the reasons for the delay and an estimated date by which the request will be answered. When the request can be answered within 10 days, it shall include the following:
(i) A statement that there is a record as requested or a statement that there is not a record in the systems of records maintained by SIGAR;
(ii) A statement as to whether access will be granted only by providing a copy of the record through the mail; or the address of the location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In the event the person requesting access is unable to meet the specified date and time, alternative arrangements may be made with the Privacy Officer;
(iii) A statement, when appropriate, that examination in person will be the sole means of granting access only when the Privacy Officer has determined that it would not unduly impede the right of access of the person making the request.
(iv) The amount of fees charged, if any (see §§ 9301.6 and 9301.7). (Fees are applicable only to requests for copies);
(v) The name, title, and telephone number of the SIGAR official having operational control over the record; and
(vi) The documentation required by SIGAR to verify the identity of the person making the request. At a minimum, SIGAR verification standards include the following:
(A)
Current or former SIGAR Employees.
Current or former SIGAR employees requesting access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SIGAR may, in addition to the other requirements of this section, and at the sole discretion of the official having operational control over the record, have his or her identity verified by visual observation. If the current or former SIGAR employee cannot be so identified by the official having operational control over the records, identification documentation will be required. The employee's common access card, annuitant identification, driver licenses, or the “employee copy” of any official personnel document in the record are examples of acceptable identification validation.
(B)
Other than current or former SIGAR employees.
Individuals other than current or former SIGAR employees requesting access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SIGAR must produce identification documentation of the type described in paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, prior to being granted access. The extent of the identification documentation required will depend on the type of record for which access is requested. In most cases, identification verification will be accomplished by the presentation of two forms of identification. Any additional requirements will be specified in the system of records notices published by SIGAR pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4).
(C)
Access granted by mail.
For records to be made accessible by mail, the Privacy Officer shall, to the extent possible, establish identity by a comparison of signatures in situations where the data in the record is not so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual to whom they pertain. No identification documentation will be required for the disclosure to a person making a request of information under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552. When, in the opinion of the Privacy Officer the granting of access through the mail could reasonably be expected to result in harm or embarrassment if disclosed to a person other than the individual to whom the record pertains, a notarized statement of identity or some similar assurance of identity will be required.
(D)
Unavailability of identification documentation.
If an individual is unable to produce adequate identification documentation the individual will be required to sign a statement asserting identity and acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine of up to $5,000. In addition, depending upon the sensitivity of the records to which access is sought, the official having operational control over the records may require such further reasonable assurances as may be considered appropriate; e.g., statements of other individuals who can attest to the identity of the person making the request.
(E)
Access by the parent of a minor, or by a legal guardian.
A parent of a minor, upon presenting suitable personal identification, may act on behalf of the minor to gain access to any
record pertaining to the minor maintained by SIGAR in a system of records. A legal guardian may similarly act on behalf of an individual declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon the presentation of the documents authorizing the legal guardian to so act, and upon suitable personal identification of the guardian.
(F) Granting access when accompanied by another individual. When an individual requesting access to his or her record in a system of records maintained by SIGAR wishes to be accompanied by another individual during the course of the examination of the record, the individual making the request shall submit to the official having operational control of the record, a signed statement authorizing that person access to the record.
(G)
Granting access to individuals other than the subject of the record.
SIGAR will not disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974.
(H)
Denial of access for inadequate identification documentation.
If the official having operation control over the records in a system of records maintained by SIGAR determines that an individual seeking access has not provided sufficient identification documentation to permit access, the official shall consult with the Privacy Officer prior to finally denying the individual access.
(vii)
Medical records.
The records in a system of records which are medical records shall be disclosed to the individual to whom they pertain in such manner and following such procedures as the Privacy Officer shall direct. When SIGAR in consultation with a physician, determines that the disclosure of medical information could have an adverse effect upon the individual to whom it pertains, SIGAR may transmit such information to a physician named by the individual.
(viii)
Exceptions.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle an individual the right to access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of litigation.
§ 9301.15
Access to the accounting of disclosures from records.
Rules governing the granting of access to the accounting of disclosures are the same as those for granting access to the records (including verification of identity) outlined in § 9301.14.
§ 9301.16
Requests for copies of records.
Rules governing requests for copies of records are the same as those for the granting of access to the records (including verification of identity) outlined in § 9301.14. (See also § 9301.19 for rules regarding fees.)
§ 9301.17
Requests to amend records.
(a)
Requirement for written requests.
Individuals desiring to amend a record that pertains to them in a system of records maintained by SIGAR must submit their request in writing in accordance with the procedures set forth herein unless this requirement is waived by the official having responsibility for the system of records. Records not subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 will not be amended in accordance with these provisions. However, individuals who believe that such records are inaccurate may bring this to the attention of SIGAR.
(b)
Procedures.
(1)(i) The request to amend a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the Privacy Officer. Included in the request shall be the name of the system and a brief description of the record proposed for amendment. In the event the request to amend the record is the result of the individual's having gained access to the record in accordance with the provisions concerning access to records as set forth in this paragraph, copies of previous correspondence between the individual and SIGAR will serve in lieu of a separate description of the record.
(ii) When the individual's identity has been previously verified pursuant to § 9301.14(b)(2)(vi), further verification of identity is not required as long as
the communication does not suggest that a need for verification has reappeared. If the individual's identity has not been previously verified, SIGAR may require identification validation as described in § 9301.14(b)(2)(vi). Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of a request to amend a record should contact the Privacy Officer at the address cited above.
(iii) The exact portion of the record the individual seeks to have amended should be clearly indicated. If possible, the desired proposed alternative language should also be set forth, or at a minimum, the facts which the individual believes are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete should be set forth with such particularity as to permit SIGAR to understand the basis for the request and to make an appropriate amendment to the record.
(iv) The request should also set forth the reasons why the individual believes his record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. In order to avoid the retention by SIGAR of personal information merely to permit verification of records, the burden of persuading SIGAR to amend a record will be upon the individual. The individual must furnish sufficient facts or credible documentation to persuade the official in charge of the system of the inaccuracy, irrelevancy, untimeliness, or incompleteness of the record.
(2)
SIGAR action on the request.
To the extent possible, a decision upon a request to amend a record will be made within 10 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal Federal holidays. In the event a decision cannot be made within this time frame, the individual making the request will be informed within 10 days of the expected date for a decision. The decision upon a request for amendment will include the following:
(i) The decision of SIGAR whether to grant in whole, or deny any part of the request to amend the record.
(ii) The reasons for the determination for any portion of the request which is denied.
(iii) The name and address of the official with whom an appeal of the denial may be lodged.
(iv) The name and address of the official designated to assist, as necessary, and upon request of, the individual making the request in the preparation of the appeal.
(v) A description of the review of the appeal within SIGAR (see § 9301.18).
(vi) A description of any other procedures which may be required of the individual in order to process the appeal.
§ 9301.18
Request for review.
(a) Individuals wishing to request a review of the decision by SIGAR with regard to an initial request to amend a record in accordance with the provisions of § 9301.17, should submit the request for review in writing and, to the extent possible, include the information specified in § 9301.17(a). Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of their request for review should contact the Privacy Officer at the address provided herein.
(b) The request for review should contain a brief description of the record involved or in lieu thereof, copies of the correspondence from SIGAR in which the request to amend was denied, and also should state the reasons why the individual believes that the disputed information should be amended. The request for review should make reference to the information furnished by the individual in support of his claim and the reasons, as required by § 9301.17, set forth by SIGAR in its decision denying the amendment. In order to avoid the unnecessary retention of personal information, SIGAR reserves the right to dispose of the material concerning the request to amend a record if no request for review in accordance with this section is received by SIGAR within 180 days of the mailing by SIGAR of its decision upon an initial request. A request for review received after the 180 day period may, at the discretion of the Privacy Officer, be treated as an initial request to amend a record.
(c) The request for review should be addressed to the Appellate Authority, Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202. As there may be delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the request via facsimile to (703) 601-3804 or by email to
sigar.pentagon.gen-coun.mbx.privacy@mail.mil.
(d) Final determinations on requests for reviews within SIGAR will be made by the Appellate Authority. Additional information may be requested by the Appellate Authority from the person requesting a review if necessary to make a determination.
(e) The Appellate Authority will inform the person making the request in writing of the decision on the request for review within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal Federal holidays) from the date of receipt by SIGAR of the individual's request for review, unless the Appellate Authority extends the 30 day period for good cause. The extension and the reasons therefore will be sent by SIGAR to the individual within the initial 30 day period. Included in the notice of a decision being reviewed, if the decision does not grant in full the request for review, will be a description of the steps the individual may take to obtain judicial review of such a decision, and a statement that the individual may file a concise statement with SIGAR setting forth the individual's reasons for his disagreement with the decision upon the request for review. The SIGAR Privacy Officer has the authority to determine the “conciseness” of the statement, taking into account the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues. Upon the filing of a proper concise statement by the individual, any subsequent disclosure of the information in dispute will have the information in dispute clearly noted and a copy of the concise statement furnished, setting forth its reasons for not making the requested changes, if SIGAR chooses to file such a statement. A copy of the individual's statement, and if it chooses, SIGAR's statement, will be sent to any prior transferee of the disputed information who is listed on the accounting required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(c).
§ 9301.19
Schedule of fees.
(a)
Prohibitions against charging fees.
Individuals will not be charged for:
(1) The search and review of the record;
(2) Any copies of the record produced as a necessary part of the process of making the record available for access; or
(3) Any copies of the requested record when it has been determined that access can only be accomplished by providing a copy of the record through the mail.
(b)
Waiver.
The Privacy Officer may, at no charge, provide copies of a record if it is determined that the production of the copies is in the interest of the Government.
(c)
Fee schedule and method of payment.
Fees will be charged as provided below except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(1)
Duplication of records.
Records will be duplicated at a rate of $.10 per page for copying of 4 pages or more. There is no charge for copying fewer pages.
(2) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this section will amount to more than $25, the person making the request shall be notified of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. In instances where the estimated fees will greatly exceed $25, an advance deposit may be required. The notice or request for an advance deposit shall extend an offer to the person requesting to consult with the Privacy Officer in order to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the fees, yet still meet the needs of individuals making the request.
(3) Fees must be paid in full prior to issuance of requested copies. In the event the person requesting is in arrears for previous requests copies will not be provided for any subsequent request until the arrears have been paid in full.
(4) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Treasury of the United States and mailed or delivered to the Privacy Officer, Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202.
(5) A receipt for fees paid will be given upon request.
§ 9301.20
Exemptions.
Systems of records maintained by SIGAR are authorized to be exempted from certain provisions of the Privacy
Act under the general and specific exemptions set forth in the Act. In utilizing these exemptions, SIGAR is exempting only those portions of systems that are necessary for the proper functioning of SIGAR and that are consistent with the Privacy Act. Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the information collected, e.g., public source materials, the applicable exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by SIGAR, in the sole discretion of SIGAR, as appropriate.
(a)
General exemptions.
(1) Individuals may not have access to records maintained by SIGAR that were provided by another agency that has determined by regulation that such information is subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(1). If such exempt records are the subject of an access request, SIGAR will advise the requester of their existence and of the name and address of the source agency, unless that information is itself exempt from disclosure.
(2) The systems of records maintained by the Investigations Directorate (SIGAR-08), are subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). All records contained in record system SIGAR-08, Investigations Records, are exempt from all provisions of the Privacy Act except sections (b), (c)(1) and (2), (e)(4)(A) through (F), (e)(6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i) to the extent to which they meet the criteria of section (j)(2). These exemptions are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the investigative, judicial, and protective processes. These exemptions are necessary to ensure the proper functions of the law enforcement activity, to protect confidential sources of information, to fulfill promises of confidentiality, to prevent interference with the enforcement of criminal laws, to avoid the disclosure of investigative techniques, to avoid the endangering of the life and safety of any individual, to avoid premature disclosure of the knowledge of potential criminal activity and the evidentiary bases of possible enforcement actions, and to maintain the integrity of the law enforcement process.
(3) The systems of records maintained by the Investigations Directorate (SIGAR-08) are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f) pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (2), and (5). These exemptions are necessary to protect material required to be kept secret in the interest of national defense and foreign policy; to prevent individuals that are the subject of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process; to ensure the proper functioning and integrity of law enforcement activities; to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques; to maintain the confidence of foreign governments in the integrity of the procedures under which privileged or confidential information may be provided; to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources and law enforcement personnel; and to ensure the proper functioning of the investigatory process, to ensure effective determination of suitability, eligibility, and qualification for employment and to protect the confidentiality of sources of information.

means an employee's statement in any form, including testifying before a court or other tribunal or board, giving depositions, interviews, telephonic, televised, videoconference or videotaped statements, and providing written responses to interrogatories, admission requests or other discovery.
(c)
SIGAR policy.
(1) SIGAR was established by Section 1229 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Public Law 110-181 (January 28, 2008), as a wartime or overseas contingency operation oversight agency of the United States Government's Executive Branch. SIGAR's Inspector General is appointed by the President of the United States. See Pub. L. 110-181, Section 1229(c). SIGAR performs oversight of Afghanistan reconstruction and security programs, operations and contracts to prevent
and detect waste, fraud and abuse pursuant to Sections 1229 and 842 of Public Law 110-181. The records of an inspector general frequently contain sensitive law enforcement information that is protected from disclosure or obtained under guarantees of confidentiality.
(2) In appropriate cases, the agency counsel shall notify the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) of the demand and coordinate with the DOJ to file any appropriate motions or other pleadings.
(3) No current or former employee shall, in response to a demand, produce any SIGAR documents, provide testimony regarding any information relating to or based upon SIGAR documents, or disclose any information or produce materials acquired as part of the performance of that employee's official duties or official status, in a legal proceeding in which the United States is not a party, without the prior written authorization of the General Counsel.
See United States ex rel. Touhy
v.
Ragen,
340 U.S. 462 (1951); and 5 U.S.C. 301 (“The head of an Executive department or military department may prescribe regulations for the government of his department, the conduct of its employees, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use, and preservation of its records, papers, and property. This section does not authorize withholding information from the public or limiting the availability of records to the public.”)
(d)
Procedures for demand for testimony or production of documents.
(1) A written demand directed to SIGAR for the testimony of a SIGAR employee or for the production of documents shall be served in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, or applicable state procedures, as appropriate. If the demand is served by the U.S. mails, it should be addressed to the General Counsel, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202-3940. If the demand is served by overnight delivery service or courier, it should be directed to the General Counsel, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, 2530 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202-3940. SIGAR's acceptance of a demand shall not constitute an admission or waiver of any objection with respect to the propriety of jurisdiction, service of process, venue, or any other defense in law or equity available under applicable law.
(2) A subpoena or other demand for testimony directed to an employee or former employee shall be served in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or applicable State procedure; and a copy of the subpoena or demand shall be delivered to the General Counsel.
(3)(i)
Touhy
Request. In court cases in which the United States or SIGAR is not a party, where the giving of testimony or the production of documents by SIGAR, or a current or former employee is desired, a verified statement (declaration under penalty of perjury) by the litigant or his counsel, setting forth the information with respect to which the testimony or production is desired (“
Touhy
Request”), must be submitted in order to obtain a decision concerning whether such testimony or production will be authorized by SIGAR. The
Touhy
Request should include: the title of the legal proceeding, the court or other forum, the requesting party's interest in the legal proceeding, a statement whether other evidence reasonably suited to the requester's needs is not otherwise available, and, if testimony is requested, the subject matter and intended use of the testimony, a statement whether document(s) could be provided in lieu of testimony to satisfy the request, and a statement that the requester will submit a check for costs of duplication at commercially reasonable rates to SIGAR if the request is granted. The purpose of these requirements is to assist the General Counsel in making a fair and informed decision under governing law regarding whether testimony or the production of document should be authorized and under what conditions, if any. Permission to testify or produce documents will be limited to the areas of proposed testimony described in the
Touhy
Request.
(ii) Agency counsel may consult or negotiate with an attorney for a party or the party, if not represented by an
attorney, to refine or limit a demand so that compliance is less burdensome or to obtain information necessary to make the determination required by paragraph (e) of this section. Failure of the requester to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an informed determination under this subpart may serve as a basis for denying the
Touhy
Request.
(iii) A determination under this section to comply or not to comply with the
Touhy
Request is without prejudice to the agency's assertion of privilege, lack of relevance, technical deficiency, or any other objection to the demand.
(4)(i) Employees shall immediately refer all inquiries and demands made to SIGAR or its employees to the General Counsel.
(ii) An employee who receives a demand shall forward the demand to the General Counsel, who will determine the agency's response to the demand under this section.
(e)
Factors to be considered by the General Counsel with respect to a Touhy Request.
(1) In deciding whether to authorize the release of official information or the testimony of SIGAR personnel concerning official information (hereafter referred to as the “disclosure”), the General Counsel shall consider the following factors:
(i) Whether the demand is unduly burdensome to the agency or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery, evidence and procedure governing the litigation in which the demand arose, balanced against the need for the specific testimony or documents sought;
(ii) Whether the demand is appropriate under the relevant substantive law of privilege and disclosure of Government information, or seeks information or documents protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b), the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, or the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.;
(iii) Whether the demand would interfere with SIGAR's statutory mandate stated in the “National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008,” Pub. L. 110-181 (Jan. 28, 2008), Section 1229 (122 Stat. 378-85), as amended; Pub. L. 110-181, Section 842 (122 Stat. 234-36), 10 U.S.C. 2302 note; or the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.;
(iv) Whether the demand would be in the public interest;
(v) The extent to which the time of employees for conducting official agency business would be compromised;
(vi) Whether the request demonstrates that the information requested is relevant and material to the action pending, genuinely necessary to the proceeding, unavailable from other sources, and reasonable in scope; and
(vii) Whether other similar requests are likely to have a deleterious cumulative effect on the expenditure of agency time and resources.
(2) Among those demands and requests in response to which compliance will ordinarily not be authorized are those with respect to which any of the following factors exists:
(i) The requested disclosure elicits information or documents protected by a statute, Executive Order or regulation, including but not limited to Section 7(b) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App. 3, section 7(b), or other prohibition from disclosure;
(ii) The requested disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source, confidential informant or undercover agent, or disclose trade secrets or similar confidential commercial or financial information.
(iii) The integrity of the administrative and deliberative processes of SIGAR would be jeopardized;
(iv) The requested disclosure would not be appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the pending litigation or matter in which the demand arose;
(v) The requested disclosure is not appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege; or
(vi) The requested disclosure, except when production is in camera, would reveal information properly classified or other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure.
(3) All decisions granting or denying a
Touhy
Request must be in writing and, if a denial, provide the grounds for
the decision in summary form based on one or more of the factors listed above.
(f)
Requests for opinion or expert testimony.
(1) Pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.805, an employee shall not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony in any proceeding before a court or agency of the United States in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest, except on behalf of the United States or a party represented by the Department of Justice, without written approval of agency counsel.
(2) Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique circumstances, the General Counsel may, in writing, grant authorization for an employee, or former employee, to appear and testify.
(3) Any expert or opinion testimony by a former employee of SIGAR shall be excepted from the restriction under 5 CFR 2635.805 where the testimony involves only general expertise gained while employed at SIGAR.
(g)
Procedures when agency counsel directs an employee not to testify or provide documents.
(1) If agency counsel determines that an employee or former employee should not comply with a subpoena or other request for testimony or the production of documents, agency counsel will so inform the employee and the requesting party who submitted the demand.
(2) If, despite the determination of the agency counsel that testimony should not be given or documents not be produced, a court of competent jurisdiction or other tribunal orders the employee or former employee to testify and/or produce documents, the employee shall promptly notify the General Counsel of such Order.
(i) If agency counsel determines that no further legal review of, appeal from, or challenge to, the Order will be sought, agency counsel shall promptly inform the employee or former employee of said determination.
(ii) If SIGAR determines to challenge an Order directing testimony or the production of documents in litigation in which the United States is not a party, the employee should not comply with the Order. The employee should appear at the time and place as commanded in the order or subpoena. If legal counsel cannot appear on behalf of the employee, the employee should produce a copy of this section and respectfully inform the Court or other legal tribunal that he/she has been advised by the General Counsel not to provide the requested testimony or documents pursuant to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in
United States ex rel. Touhy
v.
Ragen,
340 U.S. 462 (1951), and this section. Agency counsel will coordinate with the DOJ to file such motions or other pleadings that may be deemed appropriate in the circumstances, such as, for example, a notice to remove the case from state court to Federal court, or a motion to quash or modify the subpoena, or a motion for a protective order.
(h)
Fees.
In the event that a Touhy Request is granted, SIGAR may charge reasonable fees to parties seeking official information or records. Such fees are calculated to reimburse the Government for the expense of providing such information or records, and may include the costs of time expended by SIGAR employees to process and respond to the request; attorney time for reviewing the request and any responsive records and for related legal work in connection with the request; and reasonable expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information or records.

Definitions.
For purposes of this part:
CFPB Ethics Regulations
means the supplemental ethics standards set forth in this part.

means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power or authority to manage, direct, or oversee.
Credit
has the meaning set forth in 12 U.S.C. 5481(7) and as further defined in regulations promulgated by the Bureau to implement that statute. A person may have credit without any outstanding balance owed.

(2) Claimed as a “dependent” on the employee's income tax return.
Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO)
means the official within the Bureau that the Director has appointed to coordinate and manage the ethics program at the Bureau, under 5 CFR 2638.104(a). For purposes of this part, the term “DAEO” also includes the Alternate DAEO appointed under 5 CFR 2638.104(d), and a designee of the DAEO or Alternate DAEO unless a particular provision says an authority is reserved to the DAEO.

Vested legal or beneficial interest
means a present right or title to property, which carries with it an existing right of alienation, even though the right to possession or enjoyment may be postponed to some uncertain time in the future.

[82 FR 35883, Aug. 2, 2017]
§ 9401.103
Prior approval for outside employment.
(a)
General requirement.
Before engaging in outside employment, an employee must obtain written approval from the employee's supervisor and the concurrence of the DAEO, except to the extent that the Bureau has issued an instruction or internal directive pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section exempting an activity or class of activities from this requirement.
(b)
Definition of employment.
For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment, business relationship, or activity involving the provision of personal services by the employee, regardless of whether the services are compensated. It includes without limitation, personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, advisor, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, speaker, or writer.

# Note to § 9401.103(
b

# ):
Both 18 U.S.C. 203(d) and 205(e) require special approval for certain representational activities in claims against and other matters affecting the interests of the Government. Thus, an employee who wishes to act as agent or attorney for or otherwise represent his or her parents, spouse, child, or a person for whom or for an estate for which he or she is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary in such matters as described in those statutes shall obtain the approval of the Government official responsible for the employee's appointment in addition to the regulatory approval required in this section.
(c)
Standard for approval.
Approval will be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute, the OGE Standards, or the CFPB Ethics Regulations in this part.
(d)
Renewed request for approval.
Upon a significant change in either the nature, scope, or duties of the employee's outside employment or in the employee's official Bureau position, the employee shall submit a new request for approval.
(e)
DAEO responsibilities.
The DAEO may issue instructions or internal directives governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment and designating appropriate officials to act on such requests. The instructions or internal directives may exempt categories of employment from the prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that employment within those categories generally would be approved and is not likely to involve prohibited conduct or create an appearance of lack of impartiality.
§ 9401.104
Additional rules concerning outside employment for covered employees.
(a)
Prohibited outside employment with an entity supervised by the Bureau.
A covered employee shall not engage in compensated outside employment for an entity supervised by the Bureau or for an officer, director, or employee of such entity. For purposes of this section, “employment” has the same meaning as set forth in § 9401.103(b).
(b)
Use of professional licenses related to real estate.
A covered employee who holds a license related to real estate, mortgage brokerage, property appraisals, or real property insurance is prohibited from using such license for the production of income. The DAEO, in consultation with senior management in the Division in which the employee works, may grant a limited waiver to this prohibition based on a written finding that the specific transaction which requires use of the license will not create an appearance of loss of impartiality or use of public office for private gain.
(c)
Definition of covered employee.
For purposes of this section, “covered employee” means:
(1) An employee in the Division of Supervision, Enforcement, and Fair Lending;
(2) An employee serving in an attorney position;
(3) An employee in the Office of Research, serving as a section chief at Bureau pay band 71 or above or as a senior economist in the Compliance Analytics and Policy Section;
(4) An employee serving in the Office of Consumer Response in an investigations position;
(5) An employee required to file a Public Financial Disclosure Report (OGE Form 278e) under 5 CFR part 2634; or
(6) Any other Bureau employee specified in a Bureau order or directive whose duties and responsibilities, as determined by the DAEO, require application of the prohibition on outside employment contained in this section to ensure public confidence that the Bureau's programs are conducted impartially and objectively.
[82 FR 35885, Aug. 2, 2017]
§ 9401.105
Additional rules concerning outside employment for Bureau attorneys.
(a)

Waivers.

The DAEO, in consultation with senior management in the Division in which the employee works, may issue a written waiver permitting the employee or the employee's spouse or minor child to own or control a particular security that otherwise would be prohibited by this section, after considering all relevant factors. Relevant factors include, without limitation, whether:

(ii) The employee's spouse received the security as part of a compensation package in connection with employment or prior to marriage to the employee;
(2) The employee makes a prompt and complete written disclosure of the security to the DAEO;
(3) The disqualification of the employee from participating in particular matters pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, as specified in the written waiver, would not unduly interfere with the full performance of the employee's duties; and
(4) The granting of the waiver would not unduly undermine the public's confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which:
(i) The employee performs the employee's official Bureau duties; and
(ii) The Division in which the employee works executes its programs and functions.
(f)
Covered third party entities.
Immediately after becoming aware that a covered third party entity owns or controls a security that an employee would be prohibited from owning or controlling under paragraph (a) of this section, the employee shall report the interest in writing to the DAEO. The DAEO may require the employee to terminate the relationship with the covered third party entity, disqualify himself or herself from certain particular matters, or take other action as necessary to avoid a statutory violation, a violation of the OGE Standards, or the CFPB Ethics Regulations, including an appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality. For purposes of this paragraph, “covered third party entity” includes:
(1) A partnership in which the employee or the employee's spouse or minor child is a general partner;
(2) A partnership or closely held corporation in which the employee or the employee's spouse or minor child individually or jointly holds more than a 10 percent equity interest;

(2) Overdraft protection on checking accounts and similar accounts; and
(3) The provision of telephone, cable, gas, electricity, water, or other similar utility services provided on credit (

(f)
Waivers.
The DAEO, after consultation with senior management in the Division in which the employee works, may grant a written waiver from the prohibition in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section or the disqualification requirement in paragraph (d) of this section, based on a determination that participation in matters otherwise prohibited by this section would not be prohibited by law (18 U.S.C. 208) or create an appearance of loss of impartiality or use of public office for private gain, and would not otherwise be inconsistent with the OGE Standards or the CFPB Ethics Regulations.

§ 9601.101
General
(a)
Purpose.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), other than special government employees as defined in 5 CFR 2635.102(l) and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635 (Office of Government Ethics (OGE) Standards).

Other regulations, guidance and procedures.
In addition to 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, NCUA employees are required to comply with implementing guidance and procedures issued by the NCUA in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105(c). NCUA employees are also subject to other government-wide ethics regulations including, but not limited to: Regulations concerning financial disclosure contained in 5 CFR part 2634, regulations concerning executive branch financial interests and conflicts contained in 5 CFR part 2640, and regulations concerning post-employment restrictions contained in 5 CFR part 2641. Certain senior NCUA examiners are also subject to post-employment restrictions contained in NCUA's Regulation found at 12 CFR part 796. Employees should contact an NCUA ethics official if they have questions about any provision of this regulation or other ethics-related matters.
§ 9601.102
Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this part:
(a)
Employment.
(1) For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment, business relationship, or activity involving the provision of personal services by the employee, whether or not for compensation. It includes, but is not limited to, services as an officer, director, employee, agent, advisor, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes a writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written product.
(2) The definition of employment does not include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civic organization, unless:

Thus, an employee who wishes to act as agent or attorney for, or otherwise represent his parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or any estate for which, he is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary in such matters must obtain the approval required by law of the Government official responsible for the employee's appointment in addition to the regulatory approval of this section.

(2) Any employee, other than a special government employee, who, before the effective date of this part or commencement of employment with NCUA, began engaging in outside employment must, within 30 calendar days of the effective date of this part or 30 days of commencement of employment with NCUA, either terminate such employment if it is in violation of § 9601.103 or request written approval from his or her supervisor and the concurrence of the DAEO in accordance with this section. The employee may continue engaging in the outside employment while the request for approval is under review.
(b)
Procedure for requesting approval.
(1) Employees shall request the approval required by paragraph (a) of this section by email or other form of written correspondence in advance of engaging in outside employment as defined in § 9601.102. The employee requesting approval shall submit the request to his/her supervisor.

[78 FR 22769, Apr. 17, 2013, as amended at 79 FR 12657, Mar. 6, 2014]
§ 9601.105
DAEO's responsibilities.
The NCUA DAEO may issue Instructions governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment. The Instructions may exempt categories of employment from prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that employment within those categories of employment would generally be approved and is not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635. The DAEO may include in these Instructions examples of outside employment that are permissible or impermissible consistent with this part and 5 CFR part 2635, including examples of other credit union-related entities.

# Subpart A—General Provisions

# Editorial Note:
At 73 FR 58435, Oct. 7, 2008, the application of subpart A to part 9701 was rescinded.
§ 9701.101
Purpose.
(a) This part contains regulations governing the establishment of a new human resources management system within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 9701. As permitted by section 9701, these regulations waive and replace various statutory provisions that would otherwise be applicable to affected DHS employees. These regulations are issued jointly by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
(b) The system established under this part is designed to be mission-centered, performance-focused, flexible, contemporary, and excellent; to generate respect and trust through employee involvement; to be based on the principles of merit and fairness embodied in the statutory merit system principles; and to comply with all other applicable provisions of law.
§ 9701.102
Eligibility and coverage.
(a) All civilian employees of the Department are eligible for coverage under one or more subparts of this part except those covered by a provision of law outside the waivable chapters of title 5, U.S. Code, identified in § 9701.104. For example, Transportation
Security Administration employees, employees appointed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Secret Service Uniformed Division members, Coast Guard Academy faculty members, and Coast Guard military members are not eligible for coverage under any classification or pay system established under subpart B or C of this part. Refer to subparts B through G of this part for specific information regarding the coverage of each subpart.
(b)(1) Subpart A of this part becomes applicable to all eligible employees on March 3, 2005.
(2) The Secretary or designee may, at his or her sole and exclusive discretion and after coordination with OPM, establish the effective date for applying subparts E, F, and G of this part to all eligible employees. Unless otherwise determined by the Secretary and the Director, subparts E, F, and G of this part will become applicable to all eligible employees no later than August 1, 2005.
(3) With respect to subparts B, C, and D of this part, the Secretary or designee may, at his or her sole and exclusive discretion and after coordination with OPM, apply one or more of these subparts to a specific category or categories of eligible civilian employees at any time. With respect to any given category of civilian employees, the Secretary or designee may apply some of these subparts, but not others, and such coverage determinations may be made effective on different dates (e.g., in order to phase in coverage under a new classification, pay, and performance management system).
(4) DHS will notify affected employees and labor organizations in advance of the application of one or more subparts of this part to them.
(c) Until the Secretary or designee makes a determination under paragraph (b) of this section to apply the provisions of one or more subparts of this part to a particular category or categories of eligible DHS employees, those DHS employees will continue to be covered by the applicable Federal laws and regulations that would apply to them in the absence of this part. All personnel actions affecting DHS employees must be based on the Federal laws and regulations applicable to them on the effective date of the action.
(d) Any new DHS classification, pay, or performance management system covering Senior Executive Service (SES) members must be consistent with the policies and procedures established by the Governmentwide SES pay-for-performance system authorized by 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter VIII, and applicable implementing regulations issued by OPM. If the Secretary determines that SES members employed by DHS should be covered by classification, pay, or performance management provisions that differ substantially from the Governmentwide SES pay-for-performance system, the Secretary and the Director must issue joint regulations consistent with all of the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 9701.
(e) At his or her sole and exclusive discretion, the Secretary or designee may, after coordination with OPM, rescind the application under paragraph (b) of this section of one or more subparts of this part to a particular category of employees and prescribe implementing directives for converting that category of employees to coverage under applicable title 5 provisions. DHS will notify affected employees and labor organizations in advance of a decision to rescind the application of one or more subparts of this part to them.
(f) The Secretary or other authorized DHS official may exercise an independent legal authority to establish a parallel system that follows some or all of the requirements in this part for a category of employees who are not eligible for coverage under this part.

has Governmentwide implications or consequences, DHS will not proceed until the matter is resolved. The coordination process is intended to give due deference to the flexibilities afforded DHS by the Homeland Security Act and the regulations in this part, without compromising OPM's institutional responsibility, as codified in 5 U.S.C. chapter 11 and Executive Order 13197 of January 18, 2001, to provide Governmentwide oversight in human resources management programs and practices.

§ 9701.105
Continuing collaboration.
(a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 9701(e)(1)(D), this section provides employee representatives with an opportunity to participate in the development of implementing directives. This process is not subject to the requirements established by subpart E of this part, including but not limited to §§ 9701.512 (regarding conferring on procedures for the exercise of management rights), 9701.517(a)(5) (regarding enforcement of the duty to consult or negotiate), 9701.518 (regarding the duty to bargain, confer, and consult), or 9701.519 (regarding impasse procedures).
(b)(1) For the purpose of this section, the term “employee representatives” includes representatives of labor organizations with exclusive recognition rights for units of DHS employees, as well as representatives of employees who are not within a unit for which a labor organization has exclusive recognition.
(2) Consistent with 5 U.S.C. 9701(e)(2)(A), (B), and (D), DHS will determine the number of employee representatives to be engaged in the continuing collaboration process.
(3) Each national labor organization with multiple collective bargaining units accorded exclusive recognition will determine how its units will be represented within the limitations imposed by DHS.
(c)(1) Within timeframes specified by DHS, employee representatives will be provided with an opportunity to submit written comments and/or to discuss their views with DHS officials on proposed final draft implementing directives.
(2) As the Department determines necessary, employee representatives will be provided with an opportunity to discuss their views with DHS officials and/or to submit written comments at initial identification of implementation issues and conceptual design and/or at review of draft recommendations or alternatives.
(d) Employee representatives will be provided with access to information, including research, to make their participation in the continuing collaboration process productive.

(g) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 9701(e)(2), any procedures necessary to carry out this section will be established by the Secretary and the Director jointly as internal rules of Departmental procedure which will not be subject to review.
§ 9701.106
Relationship to other provisions.
(a)(1) The provisions of title 5, U.S. Code, are waived or modified to the extent authorized by 5 U.S.C. 9701 to conform to the provisions of this part.
(2) This part must be interpreted in a way that recognizes the critical mission of the Department. Each provision of this part must be construed to promote the swift, flexible, effective day-to-day accomplishment of this mission, as defined by the Secretary or designee. The interpretation of the regulations in this part by DHS and OPM must be accorded great deference.
(b) For the purpose of applying other provisions of law or Governmentwide regulations that reference provisions under chapters 43, 51, 53, 71, 75, and 77 of title 5, U.S. Code, the referenced provisions are not waived but are modified consistent with the corresponding regulations in this part, except as otherwise provided in this part (including paragraph (c) of this section) or in DHS implementing directives. Applications of this rule include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) If another provision of law or Governmentwide regulations requires coverage under one of the chapters modified or waived under this part (
i.e.
, chapters 43, 51, 53, 71, 75, and 77 of title 5, U.S. Code), DHS employees are deemed to be covered by the applicable chapter notwithstanding coverage under a system established under this part. Selected examples of provisions that continue to apply to any DHS employees (notwithstanding coverage under subparts B through G of this part) include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) Foreign language awards for law enforcement officers under 5 U.S.C. 4521-4523;
(ii) Pay for firefighters under 5 U.S.C. 5545b;
(iii) Differentials for duty involving physical hardship or hazard under 5 U.S.C. 5545(d);
(iv) Recruitment, relocation, and retention payments under 5 U.S.C. 5753-5754;

(2) In applying the back pay law in 5 U.S.C. 5596 to DHS employees covered by subpart G of this part (dealing with appeals), the reference in section 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii) to 5 U.S.C. 7701(g) (dealing with attorney fees) is considered to be a reference to a modified section 7701(g) that is consistent with § 9701.706(h).
(3) In applying the back pay law in 5 U.S.C. 5596 to DHS employees covered by subpart E of this part (dealing with labor relations), the reference in section 5596(b)(5) to section 7116 (dealing with unfair labor practices) is considered to be a reference to a modified section 7116 that is consistent with § 9701.517.
(c) When a specified category of employees is covered by a classification
and pay system established under subparts B and C of this part, the following provisions do not apply:
(1) Time-in-grade restrictions that apply to competitive service GS positions under 5 CFR part 300, subpart F;
(2) Supervisory differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5755; and
(3) Law enforcement officer special rates and geographic adjustments under sections 403 and 404 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101-509).

et seq.,
29 U.S.C. 621
et seq.,
29 U.S.C. 791

§ 9701.107
Program evaluation.
(a) DHS will establish procedures for evaluating the regulations in this part and their implementation. DHS will provide designated employee representatives with an opportunity to be briefed and a specified timeframe to provide comments on the design and results of program evaluations.
(b) Involvement of employee representatives under this section will occur at the following stages:
(1) Identification of the scope, objectives, and methodology to be used in program evaluation; and
(2) Review of draft findings and recommendations.
(c) Involvement in the evaluation process does not waive the rights of any party under applicable law or regulations.

conditions of employment
in § 9701.504, any classification system established under this subpart is not subject to collective bargaining. This bar on collective bargaining applies to all aspects of the classification system, including but not limited to coverage determinations, the design of the classification structure, and classification methods, criteria, and administrative procedures and arrangements.

# Classification Structure
§ 9701.211
Occupational clusters.
For the purpose of classifying positions, DHS may, after coordination with OPM, establish occupational clusters based on factors such as mission or function; nature of work; qualifications or competencies; career or pay progression patterns; relevant labor-market features; and other characteristics of those occupations or positions. DHS must document in implementing directives the criteria and rationale for grouping occupations or positions into occupational clusters.
§ 9701.212
Bands.
(a) For purposes of identifying relative levels of work and corresponding pay ranges, DHS may, after coordination with OPM, establish one or more bands within each occupational cluster.
(b) Each occupational cluster may include, but is not limited to, the following bands:
(1) Entry/Developmental—work that involves gaining the competencies needed to perform successfully in a Full Performance band through appropriate formal training and/or on-the-job experience.
(2) Full Performance—work that involves the successful completion of any required entry-level training and/or developmental activities necessary to independently perform the full range of non-supervisory duties of a position in an occupational cluster.
(3) Senior Expert—work that involves an extraordinary level of specialized knowledge or expertise upon which DHS relies for the accomplishment of critical mission goals and objectives; reserved for a limited number of non-supervisory employees.
(4) Supervisory—work that may involve hiring or selecting employees, assigning work, managing performance, recognizing and rewarding employees, and other associated duties.
(c) DHS must document in implementing directives the definitions for each band which specify the type and range of difficulty and responsibility, qualifications, competencies, or other characteristics of the work encompassed by the band.
(d) DHS must, after coordination with OPM, establish qualification standards and requirements for each occupational cluster, occupational series, and/or band. DHS may use the qualification standards established by OPM or, after coordination with OPM, may establish different qualification standards. This paragraph does not
waive or modify any DHS authority to establish qualification standards or requirements under 5 U.S.C. chapters 31 and 33 and OPM implementing regulations.

# Classification Process
§ 9701.221
Classification requirements.
(a) DHS must develop a methodology for describing and documenting the duties, qualifications, and other requirements of categories of jobs, and DHS must make such descriptions and documentation available to affected employees.
(b) An authorized agency official must—
(1) Assign occupational series to jobs consistent with occupational series definitions established by OPM under 5 U.S.C. 5105 and 5346 or by DHS, after coordination with OPM; and
(2) Apply the criteria and definitions required by § 9701.211 and § 9701.212 to assign jobs to an appropriate occupational cluster and band.
(c) DHS must establish procedures for classifying jobs and may make such inquiries or investigations of the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements of jobs as it considers necessary for the purpose of this section.
(d) Classification decisions become effective on the date designated by the authorized agency official who makes the decision.
(e) DHS must establish a plan to periodically review the accuracy of classification decisions.
§ 9701.222
Reconsideration of classification decisions.
(a) An individual employee may request that DHS or OPM reconsider the pay system, occupational cluster, occupational series, or band assigned to his or her current official position of record at any time.
(b) DHS will, after coordination with OPM, establish implementing directives for reviewing requests for reconsideration, including nonreviewable issues, rights of representation, and the effective date of any corrective actions. OPM will, after consulting with DHS, establish separate policies and procedures for reviewing reconsideration requests.
(c) An employee may request OPM to review a DHS determination made under paragraph (a) of this section. If an employee does not request an OPM reconsideration decision, DHS's classification determination is final and not subject to further review or appeal.
(d) OPM's final determination on a request made under this section is not subject to further review or appeal.

# Transitional Provisions
§ 9701.231
Conversion of positions and employees to the DHS classification system.
(a) This section describes the transitional provisions that apply when DHS positions and employees are converted to a classification system established under this subpart. Affected positions and employees may convert from the GS system, a prevailing rate system, the SL/ST system, or the SES system, as provided in § 9701.202. For the purpose of this section, the terms “convert,” “converted,” “converting,” and “conversion” refer to positions and employees that become covered by the classification system as a result of a coverage determination made under § 9701.102(b) and exclude employees who are reassigned or transferred from a noncovered position to a position already covered by the DHS system.
(b) DHS will issue implementing directives prescribing policies and procedures for converting the GS or prevailing rate grade of a position to a band and for converting SL/ST and SES positions to a band upon initial implementation of the DHS classification system. Such procedures must include provisions for converting an employee who is retaining a grade under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter VI, immediately prior to conversion. As provided in § 9701.373, DHS must convert employees to the system without a reduction in their rate of pay (including basic pay and any applicable locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304, special rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305, locality rate supplement under § 9701.332, or special rate supplement under § 9701.333).
§ 9701.232
Special transition rules for Federal Air Marshal Service.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart, if DHS transfers Federal Air Marshal Service positions from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to another organization within DHS, DHS may cover those positions under a classification system that is parallel to the classification system that was applicable to the Federal Air Marshal Service within TSA. DHS may, after coordination with OPM, modify that system. DHS will issue implementing directives on converting Federal Air Marshal Service employees to any new classification system that may subsequently be established under this subpart, consistent with the conversion rules in § 9701.231.

# Subpart C—Pay and Pay Administration

# Editorial Note:
At 73 FR 58435, Oct. 7, 2008, the application of subpart C to part 9701 was rescinded.

# General
§ 9701.301
Purpose.
(a) This subpart contains regulations establishing pay structures and pay administration rules for covered DHS employees to replace the pay structures and pay administration rules established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 9701. These regulations are designed to provide DHS with the flexibility to allocate available funds strategically in support of DHS mission priorities and objectives. Various features that link pay to employees' performance ratings are designed to promote a high-performance culture within DHS.
(b) Any pay system prescribed under this subpart must be established in conjunction with the classification system described in subpart B of this part.
(c) The pay system established under this subpart, working in conjunction with the performance management system established under subpart D of this part, is designed to incorporate the following features:
(1) Adherence to merit principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. 2301;
(2) A fair, credible, and transparent employee performance appraisal system;
(3) A link between elements of the pay system established in this subpart, the employee performance appraisal system, and the Department's strategic plan;
(4) Employee involvement in the design and implementation of the system (as specified in § 9701.105);
(5) Adequate training and retraining for supervisors, managers, and employees in the implementation and operation of the pay system established in this subpart;
(6) Periodic performance feedback and dialogue among supervisors, managers, and employees throughout the appraisal period, and setting timetables for review;
(7) Effective safeguards so that the management of the system is fair and equitable and based on employee performance; and
(8) A means for ensuring that adequate resources are allocated for the design, implementation, and administration of the performance management system that supports the pay system established under this subpart.
§ 9701.302
Coverage.
(a) This subpart applies to eligible DHS employees in the categories listed in paragraph (b) of this section, subject to a determination by the Secretary or designee under § 9701.102(b).
(b) The following employees are eligible for coverage under this subpart:
(1) Employees who would otherwise be covered by the General Schedule pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter III;
(2) Employees who would otherwise be covered by a prevailing rate system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV;
(3) Employees in senior-level (SL) and scientific or professional (ST) positions who would otherwise be covered by 5 U.S.C. 5376; and
(4) Members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) who would otherwise be covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter VIII, subject to § 9701.102(d).
§ 9701.303
Waivers.
(a) When a specified category of employees is covered by the pay system established under this subpart, the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, and related regulations, are waived with respect to that category of employees, except as provided in § 9701.106 and paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
(b) The following provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 53 are not waived:
(1) Section 5307, dealing with the aggregate limitation on pay;
(2) Sections 5311 through 5318, dealing with Executive Schedule positions;
(3) Section 5371, insofar as it authorizes OPM to apply the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 74 to DHS employees in health care positions covered by section 5371 in lieu of any DHS pay system established under this subpart or the following provisions of title 5, U.S. Code: Chapters 51, 53, and 61, and subchapter V of chapter 55.

(d) Section 5379 is modified. DHS may, after coordination with OPM, establish and administer a student loan repayment program for DHS employees, except that DHS may not make loan payments for any noncareer appointees to the SES (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(7)) or for any employee occupying a position that is excepted from the competitive service because of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. Notwithstanding § 9701.302(a), any DHS employee otherwise covered by section 5379 is eligible for coverage under the provisions established under this paragraph, subject to a determination by the Secretary or designee under § 9701.102(b).
(e) In approving the coverage of employees who would otherwise be covered by a prevailing rate system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV, DHS may limit the waiver so that affected employees remain entitled to environmental or other differentials established under 5 U.S.C. 5343(c)(4) and night shift differentials established under 5 U.S.C. 5343(f) if such employees are grouped in separate occupational clusters (established under subpart B of this part) that are limited to employees who would otherwise be covered by a prevailing rate system.
(f) Employees in SL/ST positions and SES members who are covered by a basic pay system established under this subpart are considered to be paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376 and 5382, respectively, for the purpose of applying 5 U.S.C. 5307(d).

# Overview of Pay System
§ 9701.311
Major features.
Through the issuance of implementing directives, DHS will establish a pay system that governs the setting and adjusting of covered employees' rates of pay. The DHS pay system will include the following features:
(a) A structure of rate ranges linked to various bands for each occupational cluster, in alignment with the classification structure described in subpart B of this part;
(b) Policies regarding the setting and adjusting of basic pay rate ranges based on mission requirements, labor market conditions, and other factors, as described in §§ 9701.321 and 9701.322;
(c) Policies regarding the setting and adjusting of supplements to basic pay based on local labor market conditions and other factors, as described in §§ 9701.331 through 9701.334;
(d) Policies regarding employees' eligibility for pay increases based on adjustments in rate ranges and supplements, as described in §§ 9701.323 through 9701.325 and 9701.335 through 9701.337;
(e) Policies regarding performance-based pay adjustments, as described in §§ 9701.341 through 9701.346;
(f) Policies on basic pay administration, including movement between occupational clusters, as described in §§ 9701.351 through 9701.356;
(g) Policies regarding special payments that are not basic pay, as described in §§ 9701.361 through 9701.363; and
(h) Linkages to employees' performance ratings of records, as described in subpart D of this part.
§ 9701.312
Maximum rates.
(a) DHS may not pay any employee an annual rate of basic pay in excess of
the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) DHS may establish the maximum annual rate of basic pay for members of the SES at the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule if DHS obtains the certification specified in 5 U.S.C. 5307(d).
§ 9701.313
Homeland Security Compensation Committee.
(a) DHS will establish a Homeland Security Compensation Committee to provide options and/or recommendations for consideration by the Secretary or designee on strategic compensation matters such as Departmental compensation policies and principles, the annual allocation of funds between market and performance pay adjustments, and the annual adjustment of rate ranges and locality and special rate supplements. The Compensation Committee will consider factors such as turnover, recruitment, and local labor market conditions in providing options and recommendations for consideration by the Secretary. The Secretary's or designee's determination with regard to those options and/or recommendations is final and not subject to further review.
(b) The Compensation Committee will be chaired by the DHS Undersecretary for Management. The Compensation Committee has 14 members, including 4 officials of labor organizations granted national consultation rights (NCR) in accordance with § 9701.518(d)(2). An OPM official will serve as an
ex officio
member of the Compensation Committee. DHS will provide technical staff to support the Compensation Committee.
(c) DHS will establish procedures governing the membership and operation of the Compensation Committee.
(d) An individual will be selected by the Chair to facilitate Compensation Committee meetings. The facilitator will be selected from a list of nominees developed jointly by representatives of the Department and NCR labor organizations, the latter acting as a single party, according to procedures and time limits established by implementing directives. Nominees must be known for their integrity, impartiality, and expertise in facilitation and compensation. If the Department and the labor organizations are unable to reach agreement on a joint list of nominees, they will enlist the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to assist them. If the parties are unable to reach agreement with FMCS assistance, each party will prepare a list of up to three nominees and provide those separate lists to FMCS; FMCS may add up to three additional nominees. From that combined list of nominees, the Department and the labor organizations, the latter acting as a single party, will alternately strike names from the list until five names remain; those five nominees will be submitted to the Chair for consideration. The Chair may request that the parties develop an additional list of nominees. If the representatives of the Department's NCR labor organizations, acting as a single party, do not participate in developing the list of nominees in accordance with this section, the Chair will select the facilitator.
(e) After considering the views of all Compensation Committee members, the Chair prepares and provides options and/or recommendations to the Secretary or designee. Members may present their views on the final recommendations in writing as part of the final recommendation package. The Secretary or designee will make the final decision and notify the Compensation Committee. This process is not subject to the requirements established by §§ 9701.512 (regarding conferring on procedures for the exercise of management rights), 9701.517(a)(5) (regarding enforcement of the duty to consult or negotiate), 9701.518 (regarding the duty to bargain, confer, and consult), or 9701.519 (regarding impasse procedures).
(f) The Secretary retains the right to make determinations regarding the annual allocation of funds between market and performance pay adjustments, the annual adjustment of rate ranges and locality and special rate supplements, or any other matter recommended by the Compensation Committee, and to make such determinations effective at any time.
§ 9701.314
DHS responsibilities.
DHS responsibilities in implementing this subpart include the following:
(a) Providing OPM with information regarding the implementation of the programs authorized under this subpart at OPM's request;
(b) Participating in any interagency pay coordination council or group established by OPM to ensure that DHS pay policies and plans are coordinated with other agencies; and
(c) Fulfilling all other responsibilities prescribed in this subpart.

# Setting and Adjusting Rate Ranges
§ 9701.321
Structure of bands.
(a) DHS may, after coordination with OPM, establish ranges of basic pay for bands, with minimum and maximum rates set and adjusted as provided in § 9701.322. Rates must be expressed as annual rates.
(b) For each band within an occupational cluster, DHS will establish a common rate range that applies in all locations.
§ 9701.322
Setting and adjusting rate ranges.
(a) Within its sole and exclusive discretion, DHS may, after coordination with OPM, set and adjust the rate ranges established under § 9701.321 on an annual basis. In determining the rate ranges, DHS and OPM may consider mission requirements, labor market conditions, availability of funds, pay adjustments received by employees of other Federal agencies, and any other relevant factors.
(b) DHS may, after coordination with OPM, determine the effective date of newly set or adjusted band rate ranges. Unless DHS determines that a different effective date is needed for operational reasons, these adjustments will become effective on or about the date of the annual General Schedule pay adjustment authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5303.
(c) DHS may establish different rate ranges and provide different rate range adjustments for different bands.
(d) DHS may adjust the minimum and maximum rates of a band by different percentages.
§ 9701.323
Eligibility for pay increase associated with a rate range adjustment.
(a) When a band rate range is adjusted under § 9701.322, employees covered by that band are eligible for an individual pay increase. An employee who meets or exceeds performance expectations (
i.e.,
has a rating of record above the unacceptable performance level for the most recently completed appraisal period) must receive an increase in basic pay equal to the percentage value of any increase in the minimum rate of the employee's band resulting from a rate range adjustment under § 9701.322. The pay increase takes effect at the same time as the corresponding rate range adjustment, except as provided in §§ 9701.324 and 9701.325. For an employee receiving a retained rate, the amount of the increase under this paragraph is determined under § 9701.356.
(b) If an employee does not have a rating of record for the most recently completed appraisal period, he or she must be treated in the same manner as an employee who meets or exceeds performance expectations and is entitled to receive an increase based on the rate range adjustment, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) An employee whose rating of record is unacceptable is prohibited from receiving a pay increase as a result of a rate range adjustment, except as provided by §§ 9701.324 and 9701.325. Because the employee's pay remains unchanged, failure to receive a pay increase is not considered an adverse action under subpart F of this part.
§ 9701.324
Treatment of employees whose rate of basic pay does not fall below the minimum rate of their band.
An employee who does not receive a pay increase under § 9701.323 because of an unacceptable rating of record and whose rate of basic pay does not fall below the minimum rate of his or her band as a result of that rating will receive such an increase if he or she demonstrates performance that meets or exceeds performance expectations, as reflected by a new rating of record issued under § 9701.409(b). Such an increase will be made effective on the
first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the date the new rating of record is issued.
§ 9701.325
Treatment of employees whose rate of basic pay falls below the minimum rate of their band.
(a) In the case of an employee who does not receive a pay increase under § 9701.323 because of an unacceptable rating of record and whose rate of basic pay falls below the minimum rate of his or her band as a result of that rating, DHS must—
(1) If the employee demonstrates performance that meets or exceeds performance expectations within 90 days after the date of the rate range adjustment, issue a new rating of record under § 9701.409(b) and adjust the employee's pay prospectively by making the increase effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the date the new rating of record is issued; or
(2) Initiate action within 90 days after the date of the rate range adjustment to demote or remove the employee in accordance with the adverse action procedures established in subpart F of this part.
(b) If DHS fails to initiate a removal or demotion action under paragraph (a)(2) of this section within 90 days after the date of a rate range adjustment, the employee becomes entitled to the minimum rate of his or her band rate range on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the 90th day following the date of the rate range adjustment.

# Locality and Special Rate Supplements
§ 9701.331
General.
The basic pay ranges established under §§ 9701.321 through 9701.323 may be supplemented in appropriate circumstances by locality or special rate supplements, as described in §§ 9701.332 through 9701.335. These supplements are expressed as a percentage of basic pay and are set and adjusted as described in § 9701.334. As authorized by § 9701.356, DHS implementing directives will determine the extent to which §§ 9701.331 through 9701.337 apply to employees receiving a retained rate.
§ 9701.332
Locality rate supplements.
(a) For each band rate range, DHS may, after coordination with OPM, establish locality rate supplements that apply in specified locality pay areas. Locality rate supplements apply to employees whose official duty station is located in the given area. DHS may provide different locality rate supplements for different occupational clusters or for different bands within the same occupational cluster in the same locality pay area.
(b) For the purpose of establishing and modifying locality pay areas, 5 U.S.C. 5304 is not waived. A DHS decision to use the locality pay area boundaries established under 5 U.S.C. 5304 does not require separate DHS regulations. DHS may, after coordination with OPM and in accordance with the public notice and comment provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, publish Departmental regulations (6 CFR Chapter I) in the
Federal Register
that establish and adjust different locality pay areas within the 48 contiguous States or establish and adjust new locality pay areas outside the 48 contiguous States. These regulations are subject to the continuing collaboration process described in § 9701.105. As provided by 5 U.S.C. 5304(f)(2)(B), judicial review of any DHS regulation regarding the establishment or adjustment of locality pay areas is limited to whether or not the regulation was promulgated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553.
(c) Locality rate supplements are considered basic pay for only the following purposes:
(1) Retirement under 5 U.S.C. chapter 83 or 84;
(2) Life insurance under 5 U.S.C. chapter 87;
(3) Premium pay under 5 U.S.C. chapter 55, subchapter V, or similar payments under other legal authority;
(4) Severance pay under 5 U.S.C. 5595;
(5) Application of the maximum rate limitation set forth in § 9701.312;
(6) Determining the rate of basic pay upon conversion to the DHS pay system established under this subpart, consistent with § 9701.373(b);
(7) Other payments and adjustments authorized under this subpart as specified by DHS implementing directives;
(8) Other payments and adjustments under other statutory or regulatory authority that are basic pay for the purpose of locality-based comparability payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304; and
(9) Any provisions for which DHS locality rate supplements must be treated as basic pay by law.
§ 9701.333
Special rate supplements.
DHS will, after coordination with OPM, establish special rate supplements that provide higher pay levels for subcategories of employees within an occupational cluster if DHS determines that such supplements are warranted by current or anticipated recruitment and/or retention needs. In exercising this authority, DHS will issue necessary implementing directives. Any special rate supplement must be treated as basic pay for the same purposes as locality rate supplements, as described in § 9701.332(c), and for the purpose of computing cost-of-living allowances and post differentials in nonforeign areas under 5 U.S.C. 5941.
§ 9701.334
Setting and adjusting locality and special rate supplements.
(a) Within its sole and exclusive discretion, DHS may, after coordination with OPM, set and adjust locality and special rate supplements. In determining the amounts of the supplements, DHS and OPM may consider mission requirements, labor market conditions, availability of funds, pay adjustments received by employees of other Federal agencies, and any other relevant factors.
(b) DHS may, after coordination with OPM, determine the effective date of newly set or adjusted locality and special rate supplements. Established supplements will be reviewed for possible adjustment on an annual basis in conjunction with rate range adjustments under § 9701.322.
§ 9701.335
Eligibility for pay increase associated with a supplement adjustment.
(a) When a locality or special rate supplement is adjusted under § 9701.334, an employee to whom the supplement applies is entitled to the pay increase resulting from that adjustment if the employee meets or exceeds performance expectations (
i.e.
, has a rating of record above the unacceptable performance level for the most recently completed appraisal period). This includes an increase resulting from the initial establishment and setting of a special rate supplement. The pay increase takes effect at the same time as the applicable supplement is set or adjusted, except as provided in §§ 9701.336 and 9701.337.
(b) If an employee does not have a rating of record for the most recently completed appraisal period, he or she must be treated in the same manner as an employee who meets or exceeds performance expectations and is entitled to any pay increase associated with a supplement adjustment, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) An employee who has an unacceptable rating of record is prohibited from receiving a pay increase as a result of an increase in an applicable locality or special rate supplement, except as provided by §§ 9701.336 and 9701.337. Because the employee's pay remains unchanged, failure to receive a pay increase is not considered an adverse action under subpart F of this part.
§ 9701.336
Treatment of employees whose pay does not fall below the minimum adjusted rate of their band.
An employee who does not receive a pay increase under § 9701.335 because of an unacceptable rating of record and whose rate of basic pay (including a locality or special rate supplement) does not fall below the minimum adjusted rate of his or her band as a result of that rating will receive such an increase if he or she demonstrates performance that meets or exceeds performance expectations, as reflected by a new rating of record issued under § 9701.409(b). Such an increase will be made effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the date the new rating of record is issued.
§ 9701.337
Treatment of employees whose rate of pay falls below the minimum adjusted rate of their band.
(a) In the case of an employee who does not receive a pay increase under
§ 9701.335 because of an unacceptable rating of record and whose rate of basic pay (including a locality or special rate supplement) falls below the minimum adjusted rate of his or her band as a result of that rating, DHS must—
(1) If the employee demonstrates performance that meets or exceeds performance expectations within 90 days after the date of the locality or special rate supplement adjustment, issue a new rating of record under § 9701.409(b) and adjust the employee's pay prospectively by making the increase effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the date the new rating of record is issued; or
(2) Initiate action within 90 days after the date of the locality or special rate supplement adjustment to demote or remove the employee in accordance with the adverse action procedures established in subpart F of this part.
(b) If DHS fails to initiate a removal or demotion action under paragraph (a)(2) of this section within 90 days after the date of a locality or special rate supplement adjustment, the employee becomes entitled to the minimum adjusted rate of his or her band rate range on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the 90th day following the date of the locality or special rate supplement adjustment.

# Performance-Based Pay
§ 9701.341
General.
Sections 9701.342 through 9701.346 describe various types of performance-based pay adjustments that are part of the pay system established under this subpart. Generally, these within-band pay increases are directly linked to an employee's rating of record (as assigned under the performance management system described in subpart D of this part). These provisions are designed to provide DHS with the flexibility to allocate available funds based on performance as a means of fostering a high-performance culture that supports mission accomplishment. While performance measures primarily focus on an employee's contributions (as an individual or as part of a team) in accomplishing work assignments and achieving mission results, performance also may be reflected in the acquisition and demonstration of required competencies.
§ 9701.342
Performance pay increases.
(a)
Overview.
(1) The DHS pay system provides employees in a Full Performance or higher band with increases in basic pay based on individual performance ratings of record as assigned under a performance management system established under subpart D of this part. The DHS pay system uses pay pool controls to allocate pay increases based on performance points that are directly linked to the employee's rating of record, as described in this section. Performance pay increases are a function of the amount of money in the performance pay pool, the relative point value placed on ratings, and the distribution of ratings within that performance pay pool.
(2) The rating of record used as the basis for a performance pay increase is the one assigned for the most recently completed appraisal period (subject to the requirements of subpart D of this part), except that if the supervisor or other rating official determines that an employee's current performance is inconsistent with that rating, the supervisor or other rating official may prepare a more current rating of record, consistent with § 9701.409(b). If an employee does not have a rating of record, DHS will use the modal rating received by other employees covered by the same pay pool during the most recent rating cycle for the purpose of determining the employee's performance pay increase.
(b)
Performance pay pools.
(1) DHS will establish pay pools for performance pay increases.
(2) Each pay pool covers a defined group of DHS employees, as determined by DHS.
(3) An authorized agency official(s) may determine the distribution of funds among pay pools and may adjust those amounts based on overall levels of organizational performance or contribution to the Department's mission.
(4) In allocating the monies to be budgeted for performance pay increases, the Secretary or designee must take into account the average value of within-grade and quality step increases
under the General Schedule, as well as amounts that otherwise would have been spent on promotions among positions placed in the same band.
(c)
Performance point values.
(1) DHS will establish point values that correspond to the performance rating levels established under subpart D of this part, so that a point value is attached to each rating level. For example, in a four-level rating program, the point value pattern could be 4-2-1-0, where 4 points are assigned to the highest (outstanding) rating and 0 points to an unacceptable rating. Performance point values will determine performance pay increases.
(2) DHS will establish a point value pattern for each pay pool. Different pay pools may have different point value patterns.
(3) DHS must assign zero performance points to an unacceptable rating of record.
(d)
Performance payout.
(1) DHS will determine the value of a performance point, expressed as a percentage of an employee's rate of basic pay (exclusive of locality or special rate supplements under §§ 9701.332 and 9701.333) or as a fixed dollar amount.
(2) To determine an individual employee's performance payout, DHS will multiply the point value determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section by the number of performance points assigned to the rating.
(3) To the extent that the adjustment does not cause the employee's rate of basic pay to exceed the maximum rate of the employee's band rate range, DHS will pay the performance payout as an adjustment in the employee's annual rate of basic pay. Any excess amount may be granted as a lump-sum payment, which may not be considered basic pay for any purpose.
(4) DHS may, after coordination with OPM, determine the effective date of adjustments in basic pay made under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(5) For an employee receiving a retained rate under § 9701.356, DHS will issue implementing directives to provide for granting a lump-sum performance payout that may not exceed the amount that may be received by an employee in the same pay pool with the same rating of record whose rate of pay is at the maximum rate of the same band.
(e)
Proration of performance payouts.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding the proration of performance payouts for employees who, during the period between performance pay adjustments, are—
(1) Hired or promoted;
(2) In a leave-without-pay status (except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section); or
(3) In other circumstances where proration is considered appropriate.
(f)
Adjustments for employees returning after performing honorable service in the uniformed services.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding how it sets the rate of basic pay prospectively for an employee who leaves a DHS position to perform service in the uniformed services (as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4303 and 5 CFR 353.102) and returns through the exercise of a reemployment right provided by law, Executive order, or regulation under which accrual of service for seniority-related benefits is protected (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 4316). DHS will credit the employee with intervening rate range adjustments under § 9701.323(a), as well as developmental pay adjustments under § 9701.345 (as determined by DHS in accordance with its implementing directives), and performance pay adjustments under this section based on the employee's last DHS rating of record. For employees who have no such rating of record, DHS will use the modal rating received by other employees covered by the same pay pool during the most recent rating cycle. An employee returning from qualifying service in the uniformed services will receive the full amount of the performance pay increase associated with his or her rating of record.
(g)
Adjustments for employees returning to duty after being in workers' compensation status.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding how it sets the rate of basic pay prospectively for an employee who returns to duty after a period of receiving injury compensation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, subchapter I (in a leave-without-pay status or as a separated employee). DHS will credit the employee with intervening rate range adjustments
under § 9701.323(a), as well as developmental pay adjustments under § 9701.345 (as determined by DHS in accordance with its implementing directives), and performance pay adjustments under this section based on the employee's last DHS rating of record. For employees who have no such rating of record, DHS will use the modal rating received by other employees covered by the same pay pool during the most recent rating cycle. An employee returning to duty after receiving injury compensation will receive the full amount of the performance pay increase associated with his or her rating of record.
§ 9701.343
Within-band reductions.
Subject to the adverse action procedures set forth in subpart F of this part, DHS may reduce an employee's rate of basic pay within a band for unacceptable performance or conduct. A reduction under this section may not be more than 10 percent or cause an employee's rate of basic pay to fall below the minimum rate of the employee's band rate range. Such a reduction may be made effective at any time.
§ 9701.344
Special within-band increases.
DHS may issue implementing directives regarding special within-band basic pay increases for employees within a Full Performance or higher band established under § 9701.212 who possess exceptional skills in critical areas or who make exceptional contributions to mission accomplishment or in other circumstances determined by DHS. Increases under this section are in addition to any performance pay increases made under § 9701.342 and may be made effective at any time. Special within-band increases may not be based on length of service.
§ 9701.345
Developmental pay adjustments.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding pay adjustments within the Entry/Developmental band. These directives may require employees to meet certain standardized assessment or certification points as part of a formal training/developmental program. In administering Entry/Developmental band pay progression plans, DHS may link pay progression to the demonstration of required knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs)/competencies. DHS may set standard timeframes for progression through an Entry/Developmental band while allowing an employee to progress at a slower or faster rate based on his or her performance, demonstration of required competencies, and/or other factors.
§ 9701.346
Pay progression for new supervisors.
DHS will issue implementing directives requiring an employee newly appointed to or selected for a supervisory position to meet certain assessment or certification points as part of a formal training/developmental program. In administering performance pay increases for these employees under § 9701.342, DHS may take into account the employee's success in completing a formal training/developmental program, as well as his or her performance.

# Pay Administration
§ 9701.351
Setting an employee's starting pay.
DHS will, after coordination with OPM, issue implementing directives regarding the starting rate of pay for an employee, including—
(a) An individual who is newly appointed or reappointed to the Federal service;
(b) An employee transferring to DHS from another Federal agency; and
(c) A DHS employee who moves from a noncovered position to a position already covered by this subpart.
§ 9701.352
Use of highest previous rate.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding the discretionary use of an individual's highest previous rate of basic pay received as a Federal employee or as an employee of a Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) in setting pay upon reemployment, transfer, reassignment, promotion, demotion, placement in a different occupational cluster, or change in type of appointment. For this purpose, basic pay may include a locality-based payment or supplement under circumstances approved by DHS.
If an employee in a Coast Guard NAFI position is converted to an appropriated fund position under the pay system established under this subpart, DHS must use the existing NAFI rate to set pay upon conversion.
§ 9701.353
Setting pay upon promotion.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, upon an employee's promotion, DHS must provide an increase in the employee's rate of basic pay equal to at least 8 percent. The rate of basic pay after promotion may not be less than the minimum rate of the higher band.
(b) DHS will issue implementing directives providing for an increase other than the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section in the case of—
(1) An employee promoted from an Entry/Developmental band to a Full Performance band (consistent with the pay progression plan established for the Entry/Developmental band);
(2) An employee who was demoted and is then repromoted back to the higher band; or
(3) Employees in other circumstances specified by DHS implementing directives.
(c) An employee receiving a retained rate (
i.e.,
a rate above the maximum of the band) before promotion is entitled to a rate of basic pay after promotion that is at least 8 percent higher than the maximum rate of the employee's current band (except in circumstances specified by DHS implementing directives). The rate of basic pay after promotion may not be less than the minimum rate of the employee's new band rate range or the employee's existing retained rate of basic pay. If the maximum rate of the employee's new band rate range is less than the employee's existing rate of basic pay, the employee will continue to be entitled to the existing rate as a retained rate.
(d) DHS may determine the circumstances under which and the extent to which any locality or special rate supplements are treated as basic pay in applying the promotion increase rules in this section.
§ 9701.354
Setting pay upon demotion.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding how to set an employee's pay when he or she is demoted. The directives must distinguish between demotions under adverse action procedures (as defined in subpart F of this part) and other demotions (e.g., due to expiration of a temporary promotion or canceling of a promotion during a new supervisor's probationary period). A reduction in basic pay upon demotion under adverse action procedures may not exceed 10 percent unless a larger reduction is needed to place the employee at the maximum rate of the lower band.
§ 9701.355
Setting pay upon movement to a different occupational cluster.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding how to set an employee's pay when he or she moves voluntarily or involuntarily to a position in a different occupational cluster, including rules for determining whether such a movement is to a higher or lower band for the purpose of setting pay upon promotion or demotion under §§ 9701.353 and 9701.354, respectively.
§ 9701.356
Pay retention.
(a) Subject to the requirements of this section, DHS will, after coordination with OPM, issue implementing directives regarding the application of pay retention. Pay retention prevents a reduction in basic pay that would otherwise occur by preserving the former rate of basic pay within the employee's new band or by establishing a retained rate that exceeds the maximum rate of the new band.
(b) Pay retention must be based on the employee's rate of basic pay in effect immediately before the action that would otherwise reduce the employee's rate. A retained rate must be compared to the range of rates of basic pay applicable to the employee's position.
(c) In applying § 9701.323 (regarding pay increases provided at the time of a rate range adjustment under § 9701.322), any increase in the rate of basic pay for an employee receiving a retained rate is equal to one-half of the percentage value of any increase in the minimum rate of the employee's band.
§ 9701.357
Miscellaneous.
(a) Except in the case of an employee who does not receive a pay increase under §§ 9701.323 or 9701.335 because of an unacceptable rating of record, an employee's rate of basic pay may not be less than the minimum rate of the employee's band (or the adjusted minimum rate of that band).
(b) Except as provided in § 9701.356, an employee's rate of basic pay may not exceed the maximum rate of the employee's band rate range.
(c) DHS must follow the rules for establishing pay periods and computing rates of pay in 5 U.S.C. 5504 and 5505, as applicable. For employees covered by 5 U.S.C. 5504, annual rates of pay must be converted to hourly rates of pay in computing payments received by covered employees.
(d) DHS will issue implementing directives regarding the movement of employees to or from a band with a rate range that is increased by a special rate supplement.
(e) For the purpose of applying the reduction-in-force provisions of 5 CFR part 351, DHS must establish representative rates for all band rate ranges.
(f) If a DHS employee moves from the pay system established under this subpart to a GS position within DHS having a higher level of duties and responsibilities, DHS may issue implementing directives that provide for a special increase prior to the employee's movement in recognition of the fact that the employee will not be eligible for a promotion increase under the GS system.

# Special Payments
§ 9701.361
Special skills payments.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding additional payments for specializations for which the incumbent is trained and ready to perform at all times. DHS may determine the amount of the payments and the conditions for eligibility, including any performance or service agreement requirements. Payments may be made at the same time as basic pay or in periodic lump-sum payments. Special skills payments are not basic pay for any purpose and may be terminated or reduced at any time without triggering pay retention or adverse action procedures.
§ 9701.362
Special assignment payments.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding additional payments for employees serving on special assignments in positions placing significantly greater demands on the employee than other assignments within the employee's band. DHS may determine the amount of the payments and the conditions for eligibility, including any performance or service agreement requirements. Payments may be made at the same time as basic pay or in periodic lump-sum payments. Special assignment payments are not basic pay for any purpose and may be terminated or reduced at any time without triggering pay retention provisions or adverse action procedures.
§ 9701.363
Special staffing payments.
DHS will issue implementing directives regarding additional payments for employees serving in positions for which DHS is experiencing or anticipates significant recruitment and/or retention problems. DHS may determine the amount of the payments and the conditions for eligibility, including any performance or service agreement requirements. Payments may be made at the same time as basic pay or in periodic lump-sum payments. Special staffing payments are not basic pay for any purpose and may be terminated or reduced at any time without triggering pay retention or adverse action procedures.

# Transitional Provisions
§ 9701.371
General.
(a) Sections 9701.371 through 9701.374 describe the transitional provisions that apply when DHS employees are converted to a pay system established under this subpart. An affected employee may convert from the GS system, a prevailing rate system, the SL/ST system, or the SES system, as provided in § 9701.302. For the purpose of this section and §§ 9701.372 through 9701.374, the terms “convert,” “converted,” “converting,” and “conversion” refer to employees who become
covered by the pay system without a change in position (as a result of a coverage determination made under § 9701.102(b)) and exclude employees who are reassigned or transferred from a noncovered position to a position already covered by the DHS system.
(b) DHS will issue implementing directives prescribing the policies and procedures necessary to implement these transitional provisions.
§ 9701.372
Creating initial pay ranges.
(a) DHS must, after coordination with OPM, set the initial band rate ranges for the DHS pay system established under this subpart. The initial ranges will link to the ranges that apply to converted employees in their previously applicable pay system (taking into account any applicable special rates and locality payments or supplements).
(b) For employees who are law enforcement officers as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5541(3) and who were covered by the GS system immediately before conversion, the initial ranges must provide rates of basic pay that equal or exceed the rates of basic pay these officers received under the GS system (taking into account any applicable special rates and locality payments or supplements).
§ 9701.373
Conversion of employees to the DHS pay system.
(a) When a pay system is established under this subpart and applied to a category of employees, DHS must convert employees to the system without a reduction in their rate of pay (including basic pay and any applicable locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304, special rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305, locality rate supplement under § 9701.332, or special rate supplement under § 9701.333).
(b) When an employee receiving a special rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305 before conversion is converted to an equal rate of pay under the DHS pay system that consists of a basic rate and a locality or special rate supplement, the conversion will not be considered as resulting in a reduction in basic pay for the purpose of applying subpart F of this part.
(c) If another personnel action (e.g., promotion, geographic movement) takes effect on the same day as the effective date of an employee's conversion to the new pay system, DHS must process the other action under the rules pertaining to the employee's former system before processing the conversion action.
(d) An employee on a temporary promotion at the time of conversion must be returned to his or her official position of record prior to processing the conversion. If the employee is temporarily promoted immediately after the conversion, pay must be set under the rules for promotion increases under the DHS system.
(e) The Secretary has discretion to make one-time pay adjustments for GS and prevailing rate employees when they are converted to the DHS pay system. DHS will issue implementing directives governing any such pay adjustment, including rules governing employee eligibility, pay computations, and the timing of any such pay adjustment.
(f) The Secretary has discretion to convert entry/developmental employees in noncompetitive career ladder paths to the pay progression plan established for the Entry/Developmental band to which the employee is assigned under the DHS pay system. DHS will issue implementing directives governing any such conversion, including rules governing employee eligibility, pay computations, and the timing of any such conversion. As provided in paragraph (a) of this section, DHS must convert employees without a reduction in their rate of pay.
§ 9701.374
Special transition rules for Federal Air Marshal Service.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart, if DHS transfers Federal Air Marshal Service positions from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to another organization within DHS, DHS may cover those positions under a pay system that is parallel to the pay system that was applicable to the Federal Air Marshal Service within TSA. DHS may, after coordination with OPM, modify that system. DHS will issue implementing directives on converting Federal Air Marshal Service employees to
any new pay system that may subsequently be established under this subpart, consistent with the conversion rules in § 9701.373.

This subpart applies to eligible DHS employees, subject to a determination by the Secretary or designee under § 9701.102(b), except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. DHS employees who would otherwise be covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 are eligible for coverage under this subpart. In addition, this subpart applies to an employee whose employment has ceased because of an unfair labor practice under § 9701.517 of this subpart and who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment.
(b)
Employees excluded.
This subpart does not apply to—
(1) An alien or noncitizen of the United States who occupies a position outside the United States;
(2) A member of the uniformed services as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2101(3);
(3) A supervisor or a management official;
(4) Any person who participates in a strike in violation of 5 U.S.C. 7311;
(5) Employees of the United States Secret Service, including the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division;
(6) Employees of the Transportation Security Administration; or
(7) Any employee excluded pursuant to § 9701.514 or any other legal authority.
§ 9701.506
Impact on existing agreements.
(a) Any provision of a collective bargaining agreement that is inconsistent with this part and/or its implementing directives is unenforceable on the effective date of coverage under the applicable subpart or directive. In accordance with procedures and time limits established by the HSLRB under § 9701.509, an exclusive representative may appeal to the HSLRB the Department's determination that a provision is unenforceable. Provisions that are identified by the Department as unenforceable remain unenforceable unless held otherwise by the HSLRB on appeal. The Secretary or designee, in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may continue all or part of a particular provision(s) with respect to a specific category or categories of employees
and may cancel such continued provisions at any time; such determinations are not precedential.
(b) Upon request by an exclusive representative, the parties will have 60 days after the effective date of coverage under the applicable subpart and/or implementing directive to bring into conformance those remaining negotiable terms directly affected by the terms rendered unenforceable by the applicable subpart and/or implementing directive. If the parties fail to reach agreement by that date, they may utilize the negotiation impasse provisions of § 9701.519 to resolve the matter. Agreements reached under this section are subject to approval under § 9701.515(d). Nothing in this paragraph will delay the effective date of an implementing directive.
§ 9701.507
Employee rights.
Each employee has the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee must be protected in the exercise of such right. Except as otherwise provided under this subpart, such right includes the right—
(a) To act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative and the right, in that capacity, to present the views of the labor organization to heads of agencies and other officials of the executive branch of the Government, the Congress, or other appropriate authorities; and
(b) To engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees under this subpart.
§ 9701.508
Homeland Security Labor Relations Board.
(a)
Composition.
(1) The Homeland Security Labor Relations Board is composed of at least three members who will be appointed by the Secretary for terms of 3 years, except that the appointments of the initial HSLRB members will be for terms of 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. The Secretary may extend the term of any member beyond 3 years when necessary to provide for an orderly transition and/or appoint the member for an additional term. The Secretary, in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may appoint additional members to the HSLRB; in so doing, he or she will make such appointments to ensure that the HSLRB consists of an odd number of members.
(2) Members of the HSLRB must be independent, distinguished citizens of the United States who are well known for their integrity and impartiality. Members must have expertise in labor relations, law enforcement, or national/homeland or other related security matters. At least one member of the Board must have experience in labor relations. Members must be able to acquire and maintain an appropriate security clearance. Members may be removed by the Secretary on the same grounds as an FLRA member.
(3) An individual chosen to fill a vacancy on the HSLRB will be appointed for the unexpired term of the member who is replaced.
(b)
Appointment of the Chair.
The Secretary, at his or her sole and exclusive discretion, will appoint one member to serve as Chair of the HSLRB.
(c)
Appointment procedures for non-Chair HSLRB members.
(1) The appointments of the two non-Chair HSLRB members will be made by the Secretary after he or she considers any lists of nominees submitted by labor organizations that represent employees in the Department of Homeland Security.
(2) The submission of lists of recommended nominees by labor organizations must be in accordance with timelines and requirements set forth by the Secretary, who may provide for additional consultation in order to obtain further information about a recommended nominee. The ability of the Secretary to appoint HSLRB members may not be delayed or otherwise affected by the failure of any labor organization to provide a list of nominees that meets the timeframe and requirements established by the Secretary.
(d)
Appointment of additional non-Chair HSLRB members.
If the Secretary determines that additional members are needed, he or she may, subject to the criteria set forth in paragraph
(a)(2) of this section, appoint the additional members according to the procedures established by paragraph (c) of this section.
(e)
Filling a HSLRB vacancy.
A HSLRB vacancy will be filled according to the procedure in effect at the time of the appointment.
(f)
Procedures of the HSLRB.
(1) The HSLRB will establish procedures for the fair, impartial, and expeditious assignment and disposition of cases. To the extent practicable, the HSLRB will use a single, integrated process to address all matters associated with a negotiations dispute, including unfair labor practices, negotiability disputes, and bargaining impasses. The HSLRB may, pursuant to its regulations, use a combination of mediation, factfinding, and any other appropriate dispute resolution method to resolve all such disputes at the earliest practicable time and with a minimum of process. Such proceedings will be conducted by the HSLRB, a HSLRB member, or employee of the HSLRB. Individual HSLRB members may decide a particular dispute. However, at the motion of a party upon its initial request for HSLRB assistance or upon the HSLRB's own motion at any time, the full HSLRB (or, where the Secretary appoints more than three members, a three-person panel of the HSLRB) may decide a particular dispute involving a matter of first impression or a major policy.
(2) In cases where the full HSLRB acts, a vote of the majority of the HSLRB (or a three-person panel of the HSLRB) will be dispositive. A vacancy on the HSLRB does not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the HSLRB. The vote of the Chair will be dispositive in the event of a tie.
(g)
Finality of HSLRB decisions.
Decisions of the HSLRB are final and binding. However, in cases involving unfair labor practices and/or negotiability disputes decided by a single member, a party may seek review of that decision with the full HSLRB, according to rules prescribed by the HSLRB. In such cases the initial decision is stayed pending the final decision by the full HSLRB.
(h)
Review of a HSLRB decision.
(1) In order to obtain judicial review of a HSLRB decision, a party must request a review of the record of a HSLRB decision by the Authority by filing such a request in writing within 15 days after the issuance of the decision. Within 15 days after the Authority's receipt of the request for a review of the record, any response must be filed. A party may each submit, and the Authority may grant for good cause shown, a request for a single extension of time not to exceed a maximum of 15 additional days. The Authority will establish, in conjunction with the HSLRB, standards for the sufficiency of the record and other procedures, including notice to the parties. The Authority must defer to findings of fact and interpretations of this part made by the HSLRB and sustain the HSLRB's decision unless the requesting party shows that the HSLRB's decision was—
(i) Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;
(ii) Based on error in applying the HSLRB's procedures that resulted in substantial prejudice to a party affecting the outcome; or
(iii) Unsupported by substantial evidence.
(2) The Authority must complete its review of the record and issue a final decision within 30 days after receiving the party's timely response to such request for review. This 30-day time limit is mandatory, except that the Authority may extend its time for review by a maximum of 15 additional days if it determines that—
(i) The case is unusually complex; or
(ii) An extension is necessary to prevent any prejudice to the parties that would otherwise result.
(3) No extension beyond that provided by paragraph (h)(2) of this section is permitted.
(4) If the Authority does not issue a final decision within the mandatory time limit established by paragraph (h) of this section, the Authority will be considered to have denied the request for review of the HSLRB's decision, which will constitute a final decision of the Authority and is subject to judicial review in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7123.
§ 9701.509
Powers and duties of the HSLRB.
(a) The HSLRB may, to the extent provided in this subpart and in accordance with regulations prescribed by the HSLRB—

The HSLRB must conduct any review of an arbitral award in accordance with the same standards set forth in 5 U.S.C. 7122(a), which is not waived for the purpose of this subpart but which is modified to apply to this section and to read “HSLRB” wherever the term “Authority” appears;
(4) Resolve negotiation impasses in accordance with § 9701.519;
(5) Conduct
de novo
review of legal conclusions involving all matters within the HSLRB's jurisdiction;

(7) Assume jurisdiction over any matter concerning Department employees that has been submitted to FLRA pursuant to § 9701.510, if the HSLRB determines that the matter affects homeland security.
(b) The HSLRB may issue binding Department-wide opinions, which may be appealed as if they were decisions of the HSLRB in accordance with § 9701.508(h).
(c) In issuing opinions under paragraph (b) of this section, the HSLRB may elect to consult with the Authority.
(d)(1) In any matter filed with the HSLRB, if the responding party believes that the HSLRB lacks jurisdiction, that party must timely raise the issue with the HSLRB and simultaneously file a copy of its response with the Authority in accordance with regulations established by the HSLRB. The HSLRB's determination with regard to its jurisdiction in a particular matter is final and not subject to review by the Authority.
(2) If a matter involves one or more issues that are appropriately before the HSLRB and one or more issues that are appropriately before the Authority, the matter must be filed with the HSLRB in accordance with its procedures. The HSLRB will have primary jurisdiction over the matter. The HSLRB will decide those issues within its jurisdiction and will promptly transfer the matter to the Authority for resolution of any remaining issues.
§ 9701.510
Powers and duties of the Federal Labor Relations Authority.
(a) The Federal Labor Relations Authority may, to the extent provided in this subpart and in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Authority, make the following determinations with respect to the Department:
(1) Determine the appropriateness of units pursuant to the provisions of § 9701.514;
(2) Supervise or conduct elections to determine whether a labor organization has been selected as an exclusive representative by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit and otherwise administer the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7111 relating to the according of exclusive recognition to labor organizations, which are not waived for the purpose of this subpart but which are modified to apply to this section;
(3) Conduct hearings and resolve complaints of unfair labor practices under § 9701.517(a)(1) through (4) and (b)(1) through (4), and in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7118, which is not waived for this purpose but which is modified to apply to this section;
(4) Resolve exceptions to arbitrators' awards otherwise in its jurisdiction and not involving the exercise of management rights under § 9701.511, the
duty to bargain, as defined in § 9701.518, and matters under § 9701.521(f); and
(5) Review HSLRB decisions and issue final decisions pursuant to § 9701.508(h).
(b) In any matter filed with the Authority, if the responding party believes that the Authority lacks jurisdiction, that party must timely raise the issue with the Authority and simultaneously file a copy of its response with the HSLRB in accordance with regulations established by the Authority. The Authority must promptly transfer the case to the HSLRB, which will determine whether the matter is within the HSLRB's jurisdiction. If the HSLRB determines that the matter is not within its jurisdiction, the HSLRB will return the matter to the Authority for appropriate action. The HSLRB's determination with regard to its jurisdiction in a particular matter is final and not subject to review by the Authority.
(c) Judicial review of any Authority decision is as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 7123, which is not waived.
§ 9701.511
Management rights.
(a) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, nothing in this subpart may affect the authority of any management official or supervisor of the Department—
(1) To determine the mission, budget, organization, number of employees, and internal security practices of the Department;
(2) To hire, assign, and direct employees in the Department; to assign work, make determinations with respect to contracting out, and to determine the personnel by which Departmental operations may be conducted; to determine the numbers, types, grades, or occupational clusters and bands of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project or tour of duty, and the technology, methods, and means of performing work; to assign and deploy employees to meet any operational demand; and to take whatever other actions may be necessary to carry out the Department's mission; and
(3) To lay off and retain employees, or to suspend, remove, reduce in grade, band, or pay, or take other disciplinary action against such employees or, with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source.
(b) Management is prohibited from bargaining over the exercise of any authority under paragraph (a) of this section or the procedures that it will observe in exercising the authorities set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, management will confer with an exclusive representative over the procedures it will observe in exercising the authorities set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, in accordance with the process set forth in § 9701.512.
(d) If an obligation exists under § 9701.518 to bargain, confer, or consult regarding the exercise of any authority under paragraph (a) of this section, management must provide notice to the exclusive representative concurrently with the exercise of that authority and an opportunity to present its views and recommendations regarding the exercise of such authority under paragraph (a) of this section. However, nothing in this section prevents management from exercising its discretion to provide notice as far in advance of the exercise of that authority as appropriate. Further, nothing in paragraph (d) of this section establishes an independent right to bargain, confer, or consult.
(e) To the extent otherwise required by § 9701.518 and at the request of an exclusive representative, the parties will bargain at the level of recognition (unless otherwise delegated below that level, at their sole and exclusive discretion) over—
(1) Appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and procedures which management officials and supervisors will observe in exercising any authority under paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and
(2)(i) Appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, provided that the effects of such exercise have a significant and substantial impact on the bargaining unit, or on those employees in that part of the bargaining unit affected by the action or event, and are expected to exceed or have exceeded 60 days. Appropriate arrangements within the duty to bargain include proposals on matters such as—
(A) Personal hardships and safety measures; and
(B) Reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by employees as the direct result of the exercise of authorities under this section, to the extent such reimbursement is in accordance with applicable law and governing regulations.
(ii) Appropriate arrangements within the duty to bargain do not include proposals on matters such as—
(A) The routine assignment to specific duties, shifts, or work on a regular or overtime basis; and
(B) Compensation for expenses not actually incurred, or pay or credit for work not actually performed.
(f) Nothing in this section will delay or prevent the Department from exercising its authority. Any agreements reached with respect to paragraph (e)(2) of this section will not be precedential or binding on subsequent acts, or retroactively applied, except at the Department's sole, exclusive, and unreviewable discretion.
§ 9701.512
Conferring on procedures for the exercise of management rights.
(a) As provided by § 9701.511(c), management, at the level of recognition, will confer with an appropriate exclusive representative to consider its views and recommendations with regard to procedures that management will observe in exercising its rights under § 9701.511(a)(1) and (2). This process is not subject to the requirements established by §§ 9701.517(a)(5) (regarding enforcement of the duty to consult or negotiate), 9701.518 (regarding the duty to bargain and consult), and 9701.519 (regarding impasse procedures). Nothing in this section requires that the parties reach agreement on any covered matter. The parties may, upon mutual agreement, provide for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or another third party to assist in this process. Neither the HSLRB nor the Authority may intervene in this process.
(b) The parties will meet at reasonable times and places but for no longer than 30 days, including any voluntary third party assistance, unless the parties mutually agree to extend this period.
(c) Nothing in the process established under this section will delay the exercise of a management right under § 9701.511(a)(1) and (2).
(d) Management retains the sole, exclusive, and unreviewable discretion to determine the procedures that it will observe in exercising the authorities set forth in § 9701.511(a)(1) and (2) and to deviate from such procedures, as necessary.
§ 9701.513
Exclusive recognition of labor organizations.
The Department must accord exclusive recognition to a labor organization if the organization has been selected as the representative, in a secret ballot election, by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit as determined by the Authority, who cast valid ballots in the election.
§ 9701.514
Determination of appropriate units for labor organization representation.
(a) The Authority will determine the appropriateness of any unit. The Authority must determine in each case whether, in order to ensure employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed under this subpart, the appropriate unit should be established on a Department, plant, installation, functional, or other basis and will determine any unit to be an appropriate unit only if the determination will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit and will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the Department, consistent with the Department's mission and organizational structure.
(b) A unit may not be determined to be appropriate under this section solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized, nor may a unit be determined to be appropriate if it includes—
(1) Except as provided under 5 U.S.C. 7135(a)(2), which is not waived for the purpose of this subpart, any management official or supervisor;
(2) A confidential employee;
(3) An employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity;
(4) An employee engaged in administering the provisions of this subpart;
(5) Both professional employees and other employees, unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit;
(6) Any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects national security; or
(7) Any employee primarily engaged in investigation or audit functions relating to the work of individuals employed by the Department whose duties directly affect the internal security of the Department, but only if the functions are undertaken to ensure that the duties are discharged honestly and with integrity.
(c) Pursuant to 6 U.S.C. 412(b)(2), a unit to which continued recognition was provided upon transfer to DHS may not include an employee whose primary duty has materially changed to consist of intelligence, counterintelligence, or investigative work directly related to terrorism investigation.
(d) Any employee who is engaged in administering any provision of law or this subpart relating to labor-management relations may not be represented by a labor organization—
(1) Which represents other individuals to whom such provision applies; or
(2) Which is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which represents other individuals to whom such provision applies.
(e) Two or more units in the Department for which a labor organization is the exclusive representative may, upon petition by the Department or labor organization, be consolidated with or without an election into a single larger unit if the Authority considers the larger unit to be appropriate. The Authority will certify the labor organization as the exclusive representative of the new larger unit.
§ 9701.515
Representation rights and duties.
(a)(1) A labor organization which has been accorded exclusive recognition is the exclusive representative of the employees in the unit it represents and is entitled to act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees in the unit. An exclusive representative is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership.
(2) An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit must be given the opportunity to be represented at—
(i) Any formal discussion between Department representative(s) and bargaining unit employees, the purpose of which is to discuss and/or announce new or substantially changed personnel policies, practices, or working conditions. This right does not apply to meetings between Department representative(s) and bargaining unit employees for the purpose of discussing operational matters where any discussion of personnel policies, practices or working conditions—
(A) Constitutes a reiteration or application of existing personnel policies, practices, or working conditions;
(B) Is incidental or otherwise peripheral to the announced purpose of the meeting; or
(C) Does not result in an announcement of a change to, or a promise to change, an existing personnel policy(s), practice(s), or working condition(s);
(ii) Any discussion between one or more Department representatives and one or more bargaining unit employees concerning any grievance;
(iii) Any examination of a bargaining unit employee by a representative of the Department in connection with an investigation if the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee and the employee requests such representation; or
(iv) Any discussion between a representative of the Department and a
bargaining unit employee in connection with a formal complaint of discrimination only if the employee, at his or her sole discretion, requests such representation.
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, if the Supreme Court determines that the definition of “grievance” in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(9) includes a formal complaint of discrimination filed by a bargaining unit employee, the definition of
grievance
in § 9701.504, and its application to this section, will be interpreted and applied consistent with that decision.
(4) The Department must annually inform its employees of their rights under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
(5) Except in the case of grievance procedures negotiated under this subpart, the rights of an exclusive representative under this section may not be construed to preclude an employee from—
(i) Being represented by an attorney or other representative of the employee's own choosing, other than the exclusive representative, in any other grievance or appeal action; or
(ii) Exercising other grievance or appellate rights established by law, rule, or regulation.
(b) The duty of the Department or appropriate component(s) of the Department and an exclusive representative to negotiate in good faith under paragraph (a) of this section includes the obligation—
(1) To approach the negotiations with a sincere resolve to reach a collective bargaining agreement;
(2) To be represented at the negotiations by duly authorized representatives prepared to discuss and negotiate on conditions of employment;
(3) To meet at reasonable times and convenient places as frequently as may be necessary, and to avoid unnecessary delays;
(4) If agreement is reached, to execute on the request of any party to the negotiation, a written document embodying the agreed terms, and to take such steps as are necessary to implement such agreement; and
(5) In the case of the Department or appropriate component(s) of the Department, to furnish information to an exclusive representative, or its authorized representative, when—
(i) Such information exists, is normally maintained, and is reasonably available;
(ii) The exclusive representative has requested such information and demonstrated a particularized need for the information in order to perform its representational functions in grievance proceedings or in negotiations; and
(iii) Disclosure is not prohibited by law.
(c) Disclosure of information in paragraph (b)(5) of this section does not include the following:
(1) Disclosure prohibited by law or regulations, including, but not limited to, the regulations in this part, Governmentwide rules and regulations, Departmental implementing directives and other policies and regulations, and Executive orders;
(2) Disclosure of information if adequate alternative means exist for obtaining the requested information, or if proper discussion, understanding, or negotiation of a particular subject within the scope of collective bargaining is possible without recourse to the information;
(3) Internal Departmental guidance, counsel, advice, or training for managers and supervisors relating to collective bargaining;
(4) Any disclosure that would compromise the Department's mission, security, or employee safety; and
(5) Home addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, or any other information not related to an employee's work.
(d)(1) An agreement between the Department or appropriate component(s) of the Department and the exclusive representative is subject to approval by the Secretary or designee.
(2) The Secretary or designee must approve the agreement within 30 days after the date the agreement is executed if the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of these regulations and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation.
(3) If the Secretary or designee does not approve or disapprove the agreement within the 30-day period specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the agreement must take effect and is
binding on the Department or component(s), as appropriate, and the exclusive representative, but only if consistent with law, the regulations in this part, Governmentwide rules and regulations, Departmental implementing directives and other policies and regulations, and Executive orders.
(4) A local agreement subject to a national or other controlling agreement at a higher level may be approved under the procedures of the controlling agreement or, if none, under Departmental regulations. Bargaining will be at the level of recognition except where delegated.
(5) Provisions in existing collective bargaining agreements are unenforceable if an authorized agency official determines that they are contrary to law, the regulations in this part, Governmentwide rules and regulations, Departmental implementing directives (as provided by § 9701.506) and other policies and regulations, or Executive orders.
§ 9701.516
Allotments to representatives.
(a) If the Department has received from an employee in an appropriate unit a written assignment which authorizes the Department to deduct from the pay of the employee amounts for the payment of regular and periodic dues of the exclusive representative of the unit, the Department must honor the assignment and make an appropriate allotment pursuant to the assignment. Any such allotment must be made at no cost to the exclusive representative or the employee. Except as provided under paragraph (b) of this section, any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of 1 year.
(b) An allotment under paragraph (a) of this section for the deduction of dues with respect to any employee terminates when—
(1) The agreement between the Department or Department component and the exclusive representative involved ceases to be applicable to the employee; or
(2) The employee is suspended or expelled from membership in the exclusive representative.
(c)(1) Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a petition has been filed with the Authority by a labor organization alleging that 10 percent of the employees in an appropriate unit in the Department have membership in the labor organization, the Authority must investigate the petition to determine its validity. Upon certification by the Authority of the validity of the petition, the Department has a duty to negotiate with the labor organization solely concerning the deduction of dues of the labor organization from the pay of the members of the labor organization who are employees in the unit and who make a voluntary allotment for such purpose.
(2)(i) The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply in the case of any appropriate unit for which there is an exclusive representative.
(ii) Any agreement under paragraph (c)(1) of this section between a labor organization and the Department or Department component with respect to an appropriate unit becomes null and void upon the certification of an exclusive representative of the unit.
§ 9701.517
Unfair labor practices.
(a) For the purpose of this subpart, it is an unfair labor practice for the Department—
(1) To interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this subpart;
(2) To encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment;
(3) To sponsor, control, or otherwise assist any labor organization, other than to furnish, upon request, customary and routine services and facilities on an impartial basis to other labor organizations having equivalent status;
(4) To discipline or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed a complaint or petition, or has given any information or testimony under this subpart;
(5) To refuse, as determined by the HSLRB, to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization, as required by this subpart;
(6) To fail or refuse, as determined by the HSLRB, to cooperate in impasse
procedures and impasse decisions, as required by this subpart; or
(7) To fail or refuse otherwise to comply with any provision of this subpart.
(b) For the purpose of this subpart, it is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization—
(1) To interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this subpart;
(2) To cause or attempt to cause the Department to discriminate against any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this subpart;
(3) To coerce, discipline, fine, or attempt to coerce a member of the labor organization as punishment, reprisal, or for the purpose of hindering or impeding the member's work performance or productivity as an employee or the discharge of the member's duties as an employee;
(4) To discriminate against an employee with regard to the terms and conditions of membership in the labor organization on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, preferential or nonpreferential civil service status, political affiliation, marital status, or handicapping condition;
(5) To refuse, as determined by the HSLRB, to consult or negotiate in good faith with the Department as required by this subpart;
(6) To fail or refuse, as determined by the HSLRB, to cooperate in impasse procedures and impasse decisions as required by this subpart;
(7)(i) To call, or participate in, a strike, work stoppage, or slowdown, or picketing of the Department in a labor-management dispute if such picketing interferes with an agency's operations; or
(ii) To condone any activity described in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section by failing to take action to prevent or stop such activity; or
(8) To otherwise fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this subpart.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(7) of this section, informational picketing which does not interfere with the Department's operations will not be considered an unfair labor practice.
(d) For the purpose of this subpart, it is an unfair labor practice for an exclusive representative to deny membership to any employee in the appropriate unit represented by the labor organization, except for failure to meet reasonable occupational standards uniformly required for admission or to tender dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring and retaining membership. This does not preclude any labor organization from enforcing discipline in accordance with procedures under its constitution or bylaws to the extent consistent with the provisions of this subpart.

(f) Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section. Except where an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure in connection with an adverse action under subpart F of this part, issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under this section, but not under both procedures.
(g) The expression of any personal view, argument, opinion, or the making of any statement which publicizes the fact of a representational election and encourages employees to exercise their right to vote in such an election, corrects the record with respect to any false or misleading statement made by any person, or informs employees of the Government's policy relating to labor-management relations and representation, may not, if the expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit or was not made under coercive conditions—

(2) Constitute grounds for the setting aside of any election conducted under any provision of this subpart.
§ 9701.518
Duty to bargain, confer, and consult.

In addition, the Department or appropriate component(s) of the Department and the exclusive representative may determine appropriate techniques, consistent with the operational rules of the HSLRB, to assist in any negotiation.
(b) If bargaining over an initial collective bargaining agreement or any successor agreement is not completed within 90 days after such bargaining begins, the parties may mutually agree to continue bargaining or mutually agree to refer the matter to an independent mediator/arbitrator for resolution. Alternatively, either party may refer the matter to the HSLRB for resolution in accordance with procedures established by the HSLRB. Either party may refer the matter to the Federal Mediation Conciliation Service (FMCS) for assistance at any time.
(c) If the parties bargain during the term of an existing collective bargaining agreement over a proposed change that is otherwise negotiable, and no agreement is reached within 30 days after such bargaining begins, the parties may mutually agree to continue bargaining or mutually agree to refer the matter to an independent mediator/arbitrator for resolution. Alternatively, either party may refer the matter to the HSLRB for resolution in accordance with procedures established by the HSLRB. Either party may refer the matter to the Federal Mediation Conciliation Service (FMCS) for assistance at any time.
(d)(1) Management may not bargain over any matters that are inconsistent with law or the regulations in this part, Governmentwide rules and regulations, Departmental implementing directives and other policies and regulations, or Executive orders.
(2) In promulgating Departmental policies and regulations that deal with otherwise negotiable subjects, the Department will utilize the process set forth in § 9701.512, except that the Department will confer with those labor organizations that request and have been accorded national consultation rights (NCR) established pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7113, which is not waived for these purposes, and consult with those organizations on other appropriate matters.
(3) Management has no obligation to bargain over a change to a condition of employment unless the change is otherwise negotiable pursuant to these regulations and is foreseeable, substantial, and significant in terms of both impact and duration on the bargaining unit, or on those employees in that part of the bargaining unit affected by the change.
(4) Management has no obligation to confer or consult as required by this section unless the change is foreseeable, substantial, and significant in terms of both impact and duration on the bargaining unit, or on those employees in that part of the bargaining unit affected by the change.
(5) Nothing in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section prevents or delays management from exercising the rights enumerated in § 9701.511.
(e) If a management official involved in collective bargaining with an exclusive representative alleges that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to any matter, the exclusive representative may appeal the allegation to the HSLRB in accordance with procedures established by the HSLRB.
§ 9701.519
Negotiation impasses.
(a) If the Department and exclusive representative are unable to reach an agreement under §§ 9701.515 or 9701.518, either party may submit the disputed issues to the HSLRB for resolution.
(b) If the parties do not arrive at a settlement after assistance by the HSLRB, the HSLRB may take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with this subpart to resolve the impasse.
(c) Pursuant to §§ 9701.508 and 9701.525, the HSLRB's regulations will provide for a single, integrated process to address all matters associated with a negotiations dispute, including unfair
labor practices, negotiability disputes, and bargaining impasses.

(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, any collective bargaining agreement must provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability. Except as provided in paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of this section, the procedures must be the exclusive administrative procedures for grievances which fall within its coverage.
(2) Any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.
(b)(1) Any negotiated grievance procedure referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must be fair and simple, provide for expeditious processing, and include procedures that—
(i) Assure an exclusive representative the right, in its own behalf or on behalf of any employee in the unit represented by the exclusive representative, to present and process grievances;
(ii) Assure such an employee the right to present a grievance on the employee's own behalf, and assure the exclusive representative the right to be present during the grievance proceeding; and
(iii) Provide that any grievance not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure is subject to binding arbitration, which may be invoked by either the exclusive representative or the Department.
(2) The provisions of a negotiated grievance procedure providing for binding arbitration in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section must, if or to the extent that an alleged prohibited personnel practice is involved, allow the arbitrator to order a stay of any personnel action in a manner similar to the manner described in 5 U.S.C. 1221(c) with respect to the Merit Systems Protection Board and order the Department to take any disciplinary action identified under 5 U.S.C. 1215(a)(3) that is otherwise within the authority of the Department to take.
(3) Any employee who is the subject of any disciplinary action ordered under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may appeal such action to the same extent and in the same manner as if the Department had taken the disciplinary action absent arbitration.
(c) The preceding paragraphs of this section do not apply with respect to any matter concerning—
(1) Any claimed violation of 5 U.S.C. chapter 73, subchapter III (relating to prohibited political activities);
(2) Retirement, life insurance, or health insurance;
(3) A suspension or removal under § 9701.613;
(4) A mandatory removal under § 9701.607;
(5) Any examination, certification, or appointment; and
(6) Any subject not within the definition of
grievance
in § 9701.504 (e.g., the classification or pay of any position), except for any other adverse action under subpart F of this part which is not otherwise excluded by paragraph (c) of this section.
(d) To the extent not already excluded by existing collective bargaining agreements, the exclusions contained in paragraph (c) of this section apply upon the effective date of this subpart, as determined under § 9701.102(b).
(e)(1) An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1) which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under the applicable statutory procedures, or the negotiated procedure, but not both.
(2) An employee is deemed to have exercised his or her option under paragraph (e)(1) of this section to raise the matter under the applicable statutory
procedures, or the negotiated procedure, at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory or regulatory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, whichever event occurs first.
(f)(1) For matters covered by subpart G of this part (except for mandatory removal offenses under § 9701.707), an aggrieved employee may raise the matter under the appeals procedure of § 9701.706 or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. An employee will be deemed to have exercised his or her option under this section when the employee timely files an appeal under the applicable appellate procedures or a grievance in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, whichever occurs first.
(2) An arbitrator hearing a matter appealable under subpart G of this part is bound by the applicable provisions of this part.
(3) Section 7121(f) of title 5, United States Code, is not waived, but is modified to provide that—
(i) Matters covered by subpart G are deemed to be matters covered by 5 U.S.C. 4303 and 7512 for the purpose of obtaining judicial review; and
(ii) Judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 7703 will apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by MSPB under § 9701.706, including the preponderance of the evidence standard.
(4) In order to ensure consistency, the Department and representatives of those labor organizations granted national consultation rights may establish a mutually acceptable panel of arbitrators who have been trained and qualified to hear adverse action grievances under this part.
(g)(1) An employee may grieve a performance rating of record that has not been appealed in connection with an action under subpart G of this part. Once an employee raises a performance rating issue in an appeal under subpart G of this part, any pending grievance or arbitration will be dismissed with prejudice.
(2) An arbitrator may cancel a performance rating upon a finding that management applied the employee's established performance expectations in violation of applicable law, Department rule or regulation, or provision of collective bargaining agreement in a manner prejudicial to the grievant. An arbitrator who has properly canceled an employee's appraisal may order management to change the grievant's rating only when the arbitrator is able to determine the rating that management would have given but for the violation. When an arbitrator is unable to determine what the employee's rating would have been but for the violation, the arbitrator must remand the case to management for re-evaluation. Except as otherwise provided by law, an arbitrator may not conduct an independent evaluation of the employee's performance or otherwise substitute his or her judgment for that of the supervisor.
(h)(1) This paragraph applies with respect to a prohibited personnel practice other than a prohibited personnel practice to which paragraph (e) of this section applies.
(2) An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section may elect not more than one of the procedures described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section with respect thereto. A determination as to whether a particular procedure for seeking a remedy has been elected must be made as set forth under paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
(3) The procedures for seeking remedies described in this paragraph are as follows:
(i) An appeal under subpart G of this part;
(ii) A negotiated grievance under this section; and
(iii) Corrective action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, subchapters II and III.
(4) For the purpose of this paragraph, an employee is considered to have elected one of the following, whichever election occurs first:
(i) The procedure described in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section if such employee has timely filed a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures;
(ii) The procedure described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section if such employee has timely filed a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure; or
(iii) The procedure described in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section if such employee has sought corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel by making an allegation under 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(1).
§ 9701.522
Exceptions to arbitration awards.
(a)(1) In the case of awards involving the exercise of management rights or the duty to bargain under §§ 9701.511 and 9701.518, either party to arbitration under this subpart may file with the HSLRB an exception to any arbitrator's award. The HSLRB may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as is consistent with this subpart.
(2) In the case of awards not involving the exercise of management rights or the duty to bargain under §§ 9701.511 and 9701.518, either party may file exceptions to an arbitration award with the Authority pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7122 (which is not waived for the purpose of this subpart but which is modified to apply to arbitration awards under this section) and the Authority's regulations.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, exceptions to awards relating to a matter described in § 9701.521(f) may not be filed with the Authority.
(b) If no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed under paragraph (a) of this section during the 30-day period beginning on the date of such award, the award is final and binding. Either party must take the actions required by an arbitrator's final award. The award may include the payment of back pay (as provided under 5 U.S.C. 5596 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart H).
(c) Nothing in this section prevents the HSLRB from determining its own jurisdiction without regard to whether any party has raised a jurisdictional issue.
§ 9701.523
Official time.
(a) Any employee representing an exclusive representative in the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement under this subpart must be authorized official time for such purposes, including attendance at impasse proceedings, during the time the employee otherwise would be in a duty status. The number of employees for whom official time is authorized under this section may not exceed the number of individuals designated as representing the Department for such purposes.
(b) Any activities performed by any employee relating to the internal business of the labor organization, including but not limited to the solicitation of membership, elections of labor organization officials, and collection of dues, must be performed during the time the employee is in a nonduty status.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Authority or the HSLRB, as appropriate, will determine whether an employee participating for, or on behalf of, a labor organization in any phase of proceedings before the Authority or the HSLRB will be authorized official time for such purpose during the time the employee would otherwise be in a duty status.
(d) Except as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this section, any employee representing an exclusive representative or, in connection with any other matter covered by this subpart, any employee in an appropriate unit represented by an exclusive representative, must be granted official time in any amount the Department and the exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.

§ 9701.606
Standard for action.

§ 9701.607
Mandatory removal offenses.
(a) The Secretary has the sole, exclusive, and unreviewable discretion to identify offenses that have a direct and substantial adverse impact on the Department's homeland security mission. Such offenses will be identified in advance as part of the Department's implementing directives, publicized via notice in the
Federal Register,
and made known to all employees on an annual basis.
(b) When a mandatory removal action is proposed under this section, employees will have the right to advance notice, an opportunity to respond, a written decision, and a review by the Mandatory Removal Panel as set forth in subpart G of this part.
(c) Prior to the issuance of a notice to the employee in question, the Secretary or designee will review and approve a proposed notice of removal on the grounds that the employee has committed a mandatory removal offense.
(d) The Secretary has the sole, exclusive, and unreviewable discretion to mitigate the removal penalty.
(e) Nothing in this section limits the discretion of the Department or any component thereof to remove employees for offenses other than those identified by the Secretary as mandatory removal offenses.
(f) Nothing in this subpart limits the discretion of the Department or any component thereof to remove an employee based on the revocation of that employee's security clearance.
§ 9701.608
Procedures.
An employee against whom an adverse action is proposed is entitled to the following:
(a) A proposal notice under § 9701.609;
(b) An opportunity to reply under § 9701.610; and
(c) A decision notice under § 9701.611.
§ 9701.609
Proposal notice.
(a)
Notice period.
The Department must provide at least 15 days advance written notice of a proposed adverse action. However, if there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, the Department must provide at least 5 days advance written notice.
(b)
Contents of notice.
(1) The proposal notice must inform the employee of the factual basis for the proposed action in sufficient detail to permit the employee to reply to the notice, and inform the employee of his or her right to review the Department's evidence supporting the proposed action. The Department may not use evidence that cannot be disclosed to the employee, his or her representative, or designated physician pursuant to 5 CFR 297.204.
(2) When some but not all employees in a given competitive level are being furloughed, the proposal notice must state the basis for selecting a particular employee for furlough, as well as the reasons for the furlough. The notice is not necessary for furlough without pay due to unforeseeable circumstances, such as sudden breakdowns in equipment, acts of God, or sudden emergencies requiring immediate curtailment of activities.
(c)
Duty status during notice period.
An employee will remain in a duty status in his or her regular position during the notice period. However, when the Department determines that the employee's continued presence in the workplace during the notice period may pose a threat to the employee or others, result in loss of or damage to Government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests, the Department may elect one
or a combination of the following alternatives:
(1) Assign the employee to duties where the Department determines the employee is no longer a threat to safety, the Department's mission, or Government property;
(2) Allow the employee to take leave, or place him or her in an appropriate leave status (annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay) or absence without leave if the employee has absented himself or herself from the worksite without approved leave; or
(3) Place the employee in a paid, non-duty status for such time as is necessary to effect the action.
§ 9701.610
Opportunity to reply.
(a) The Department must give employees at least 10 days, which must run concurrently with the notice period, to reply orally and/or in writing to a notice of proposed adverse action. However, if there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, the Department must give the employee at least 5 days, which must run concurrently with the notice period, to reply orally and/or in writing.
(b) The opportunity to reply orally does not include the right to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses.

(1) An individual whose activities as representative would cause a conflict between the interest or position of the representative and that of the Department,
(2) An employee of the Department whose release from his or her official position would give rise to unreasonable costs or whose work assignments preclude his or her release; or
(3) An individual whose activities as representative could compromise security.
(g)(1) An employee who wishes the Department to consider any medical condition that may be relevant to the proposed adverse action must provide medical documentation, as that term is defined at 5 CFR 339.104, during the opportunity to reply, whenever possible.
(2) When considering an employee's medical documentation, the Department may require or offer a medical examination pursuant to 5 CFR part 339, subpart C.

Suspension and removal.
(a) Notwithstanding other provisions of law or regulation, the Secretary may suspend an employee without pay when she or he considers suspension in the interests of national security. To the extent that the Secretary determines that the interests of national security permit, the suspended employee must be notified of the reasons for the suspension. Within 30 days after the notification, the suspended employee is entitled to submit to the official designated by the Secretary statements or affidavits to show why he or she should be restored to duty.

(2) An opportunity within 30 days thereafter, plus an additional 30 days if the charges are amended, to answer the charges and submit affidavits;
(3) A hearing, at the request of the employee, by a Department authority duly constituted for this purpose;

# Savings Provision
§ 9701.614
Savings provision.
This subpart does not apply to adverse actions proposed prior to the date of an affected employee's coverage under this subpart.

# Subpart G—Appeals

# Editorial Note:
At 73 FR 58435, Oct. 7, 2008, the application of subpart G to part 9701 was rescinded.
§ 9701.701
Purpose.
This subpart contains the regulations implementing the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 9701(a) through (c) and (f) concerning the Department's appeals system for certain adverse actions covered under subpart F of this part. These provisions require that the new appeals regulations provide Department employees fair treatment, are consistent with the protections of due process and, to the maximum extent practicable, provide for the expeditious handling of appeals.
§ 9701.702
Waivers.
When a specified category of employees is covered by an appeals system established under this subpart, the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7701 are waived with respect to that category of employees to the extent they are inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart. The
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7702 are modified as provided in § 9701.709 to use “MSPB or MRP” wherever the terms “Merit Systems Protection Board” or “Board” occur. The appellate procedures specified herein supersede those of MSPB to the extent MSPB regulations are inconsistent with this subpart. MSPB must follow the provisions in this subpart until conforming regulations are issued by MSPB.
§ 9701.703
Definitions.
In this subpart:
Adjudicating official
means an administrative law judge, administrative judge, or other employee designated by MSPB to decide an appeal.
Day
means calendar day.
Harmful error
means error by the Department in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused it to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. The burden is on the appellant to show that the error was harmful,
i.e.
, that it caused substantial harm or prejudice to his or her rights.
Mandatory removal offense (MRO)
means an offense that the Secretary determines in his or her sole, exclusive, and unreviewable discretion has a direct and substantial adverse impact on the Department's homeland security mission.
Mandatory Removal Panel (MRP)
means the three-person panel composed of officials appointed by the Secretary for fixed terms to decide appeals of removals based on a mandatory removal offense.
MSPB
means the Merit Systems Protection Board.
Petition for review
means a request for review of an initial decision of an adjudicating official.
Preponderance of the evidence
means the degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue.
§ 9701.704
Coverage.
(a) Subject to a determination by the Secretary or designee under § 9701.102(b), this subpart applies to employees who appeal furloughs of 30 days or less, demotions, reductions in pay, suspensions of 15 days or more, or removals, provided such employees are covered by § 9701.604.
(b) Appeals of suspensions shorter than 15 days and other lesser disciplinary measures are not covered under this subpart but may be grieved through a negotiated grievance procedure or an administrative grievance procedure, whichever is applicable.
(c) The appeal rights in 5 CFR 315.806 apply to the removal of an employee while serving a probationary, trial, or initial service period, except for a preference eligible employee in the competitive service who has completed the first year of an initial service period.
(d) Actions taken under § 9701.613 are not appealable to MSPB.
§ 9701.705
Alternative dispute resolution.
The Department and OPM recognize the value of using alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation, an ombudsman, or interest-based negotiation to address employee-employer disputes arising in the workplace, including those which may involve disciplinary actions. Such methods can result in more efficient and more effective outcomes than traditional, adversarial methods of dispute resolution. The Department will use alternative dispute resolution methods where appropriate. Such methods will be subject to collective bargaining to the extent permitted by subpart E of this part.
§ 9701.706
MSPB appellate procedures.
(a) A covered Department employee may appeal an adverse action identified under § 9701.704(a) to MSPB. Such an employee has a right to be represented by an attorney or other representative, and to a hearing if material facts are in dispute. However, separate procedures apply when the action is taken because of a mandatory removal offense or is in the interest of national security. (
See
§§ 9701.707 and 9701.613, respectively.)
(b) MSPB may decide any case appealed to it or may refer the case to an administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105 or other employee of MSPB designated by MSPB to decide such cases. MSPB or an adjudicating
official must make a decision at the close of the review and provide a copy of the decision to each party to the appeal and to OPM.
(c)(1) If an employee is the prevailing party in an appeal under this section, the employee must be granted the relief provided in the decision upon issuance of the decision, subject to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and such relief remains in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review unless—
(i) An adjudicating official determines that the granting of such relief is not appropriate; or
(ii) The relief granted in the decision provides that the employee will return or be present at the place of employment pending the outcome of any petition for review, and the Department, subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, determines in its sole, exclusive, and unreviewable discretion, that the return or presence of the employee is unduly disruptive to the work environment.
(2) If the Department makes a determination under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section that prevents the return or presence of an employee at the place of employment, such employee must receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment pending the outcome of any petition for review.
(3) Nothing in the provisions of this section may be construed to require that any award of back pay or attorney fees be paid before the decision is final.
(d) The decision of the Department must be sustained under paragraph (b) of this section if it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, unless the employee shows by a preponderance of the evidence—
(1) Harmful error in the application of Department procedures in arriving at the decision;
(2) That the decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(b); or
(3) That the decision was not in accordance with law.
(e) The Director of OPM may, as a matter of right at any time in the proceeding, intervene or otherwise participate in any proceeding under this section in any case in which the Director believes that an erroneous decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive.
(f) Except as provided in § 9701.709, any decision under paragraph (b) of this section is final unless a party to the appeal or the Director of OPM petitions MSPB for review within 30 days after receipt of the decision or MSPB reopens and reconsiders a case on its own motion. The Director may petition MSPB for review only if he or she believes the decision is erroneous and will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive. MSPB, for good cause shown, may extend the filing period.
(g) If MSPB or an adjudicating official is of the opinion that consolidation or joinder could result in more expeditious processing of appeals and would not adversely affect any party, MSPB or an adjudicating official may—
(1) Consolidate appeals filed by two or more appellants; or
(2) Join two or more appeals filed by the same appellant and hear and decide them concurrently.
(h)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section or as otherwise provided by law, MSPB or an adjudicating official may require payment by the Department of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee if the employee is the prevailing party and MSPB or an adjudicating official determines that payment by the Department is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the Department or any case in which the Department's action was clearly without merit.
(2) If the employee is the prevailing party and the decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), the payment of reasonable attorney fees must be in accordance with the standards prescribed in section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(k)).
(i)(1) MSPB or an adjudicating official may not require settlement discussions in connection with any appealed action under this section. If either party decides that settlement is not desirable, the matter will proceed to adjudication.
(2) Where the parties agree to engage in settlement discussions before MSPB or an adjudicating official, these discussions will be conducted by an official specifically designated by MSPB for that sole purpose. Nothing prohibits the parties from engaging in settlement discussions on their own.
(j) If an employee has been removed under subpart F of this part, neither the employee's status under any retirement system established by Federal statute nor any election made by the employee under any such system will affect the employee's appeal rights.
(k) The following provisions modify MSPB's appellate procedures applicable to appeals under this subpart:
(1) All appeals, including class appeals, will be filed no later than 20 days after the effective date of the action being appealed, or no later than 20 days after the date of service of the Department's decision, whichever is later.
(2) Either party may file a motion for representative disqualification at any time during the proceedings.
(3) The parties may seek discovery regarding any matter that is relevant to any of their claims or defenses. However, by motion, either party may seek to limit such discovery because the burden or expense of providing the material outweighs its benefit, or because the material sought is privileged, not relevant, unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be secured from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.
(i) Prior to filing a motion to limit discovery, the parties must confer and attempt to resolve any pending objection(s).
(ii) Neither party may submit more than one set of interrogatories, one set of requests for production of documents, and one set of requests for admissions. The number of interrogatories or requests for production or admissions may not exceed 25 per pleading, including subparts; in addition, neither party may conduct/compel more than 2 depositions.
(iii) Either party may file a motion requesting additional discovery. Such motion may be granted only if the party has shown necessity and good cause to warrant such additional discovery.
(4) Requests for case suspensions must be submitted jointly.
(5) When there are no material facts in dispute, the adjudicating official must render summary judgment on the law without a hearing. However, when material facts are in dispute and a hearing is held, a transcript must be kept.
(6) Given the Department's need to maintain an exceptionally high degree of order and discipline in the workplace, an arbitrator, adjudicating official, or MSPB may not modify the penalty imposed by the Department unless such penalty is so disproportionate to the basis for the action as to be wholly without justification. In cases of multiple charges, the third party's determination in this regard is based on the justification for the penalty as it relates to the sustained charge(s). When a penalty is mitigated, the maximum justifiable penalty must be applied.
(7) An initial decision must be made no later than 90 days after the date on which the appeal is filed. If that initial decision is appealed to MSPB, MSPB must render its decision no later than 90 days after the close of the record before MSPB on petition for review.
(8) If the Director seeks reconsideration of a final MSPB order, MSPB must render its decision no later than 60 days after receipt of the opposition to OPM's petition in support of such reconsideration. MSPB must state the reasons for its decision so that the Director can determine whether to seek judicial review and to facilitate expeditious judicial review.
(9) MSPB, in conjunction with the Department and OPM, will develop and issue voluntary expedited appeals procedures for Department cases.
(l) Failure of MSPB to meet the deadlines imposed by paragraphs (k)(7) and (k)(8) of this section in a case will not prejudice any party to the case and will not form the basis for any legal action by any party.
(m) Except as otherwise provided by 5 U.S.C. 7702 with respect to cases involving allegations of discrimination, judicial review of any final MSPB order or decision is as prescribed under 5 U.S.C. 7703.
§ 9701.707
Appeals of mandatory removal actions.
(a)
General.
Appeals of mandatory removal actions are governed by procedures set forth in this section. An employee may appeal such actions to the Mandatory Removal Panel (MRP) established under § 9701.708.
(b)
Procedures.
(1) The MRP will establish procedures for the fair, impartial, and expeditious assignment and disposition of cases, consistent with the requirements set forth in § 9701.706(k), as applicable, and for such other matters as may be necessary to ensure the operation of the MRP.
(2) The MRP will conduct a hearing, for which a transcript will be kept, to resolve any factual disputes and other relevant matters. All members will hear a particular appeal and will decide it based on a majority vote of the members. If only two members are serving, the vote of the Chair will be dispositive in the event of a tie.
(3) The appellant has the right to be represented by an attorney or other representative.
(4) The only action available to the MRP is to sustain or overturn a mandatory removal. The MRP does not have authority to mitigate the penalty. Only the Secretary may mitigate the penalty in these cases after the MRP has rendered its decision.
(5) The decision of the Department must be sustained if it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, unless the employee shows by a preponderance of the evidence—
(i) Harmful error in the application of Department procedures in arriving at the decision;
(ii) That the decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(b); or
(iii) That the decision was not in accordance with law.
(6)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section or as otherwise provided by law, the MRP may require payment by the Department of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee if the employee is the prevailing party and the Panel reviewing the initial appeal determines that payment by the Department is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the Department or any case in which the Department's action was clearly without merit.
(ii) If the employee is the prevailing party and the decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), the payment of reasonable attorney fees must be in accordance with the standards prescribed in § 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(k)).
(7) The MRP must issue a written decision (including dissenting opinions, where appropriate) in each case and serve each party and OPM with a copy. These decisions are final and binding.
(8) Failure of the MRP to meet applicable deadlines imposed under § 9701.706(k) in a case will not prejudice any party to the case and will not form the basis for any legal action by any party.
(c)
MSPB review.
(1) In order to obtain judicial review of an MRP decision, an employee, the Department, or OPM must request a review of the record of an MRP decision by MSPB by filing such a request in writing within 15 days after the issuance of the decision. Within 15 days after MSPB's receipt of the request for a review of the record, any response or OPM intervention must be filed. A party, or OPM, may each submit, and MSPB may grant for good cause shown, a request for a single extension of time not to exceed a maximum of 15 additional days. MSPB will establish, in conjunction with the MRP, standards for the sufficiency of the record and other procedures, including notice to the parties and OPM. MSPB must accept the findings of fact and interpretations of this part made by the MRP and sustain the MRP's decision unless the employee shows that the MRP's decision was—
(i) Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;
(ii) Caused by harmful error in the application of the MRP's procedures in arriving at such decision; or
(iii) Unsupported by substantial evidence.
(2) MSPB must complete its review of the record and issue a final decision within 30 days after receiving the party's timely response to such request for review or OPM's intervention brief,
whichever is filed later. This 30-day time limit is mandatory, except that MSPB may extend its time for review by a maximum of 15 additional days if it determines that—
(i) The case is unusually complex; or
(ii) An extension is necessary to prevent any prejudice to the parties that would otherwise result.
(3) No extension beyond that provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section is permitted.
(4) If MSPB does not issue a final decision within the mandatory time limit established by paragraph (c) of this section, MSPB will be considered to have denied the request for review of the MRP's decision, which will constitute a final decision of MSPB and is subject to judicial review in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7703.
(d)
Subsequent action.
(1) If either the MRP or MSPB sustains an employee's appeal based on a finding that the employee did not commit an MRO, the Department is not precluded from subsequently proposing an adverse action (other than an MRO) based on the same record evidence. Such a proposal must be issued—
(i) In accordance with applicable law and regulation, including the procedures set forth in § 9701.609; and
(ii) Normally within 15 days after the date of MSPB's decision, unless the Department establishes good cause for exceeding this time limit.
(2) Nothing in this section precludes the Department from taking a subsequent action against an employee based, in part, on additional evidence that was not part of the record in the initial proceeding before the MRP.
(e)
Judicial review.
Except as otherwise provided by 5 U.S.C. 7702 with respect to cases involving allegations of discrimination, judicial review of any final MSPB order or decision on an MRO is as prescribed under 5 U.S.C. 7703.
(f)
OPM intervention.
(1) The Director may, as a matter of right at any time in the proceeding before the MRP or MSPB, intervene or otherwise participate in any proceeding under this section in any case in which the Director believes that an erroneous decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive.
(2) Except as provided in § 9701.709, any decision under paragraph (c) of this section is final unless the Director petitions MSPB for review within 30 days after receipt of the decision. The Director may petition MSPB for review only if he or she believes the decision is erroneous and will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive. MSPB, for good cause shown, may extend the filing period.
(g)
Appeal rights of retirees.
If an employee has been removed under subpart F of this part, neither the employee's status under any retirement system established by Federal statute nor any election made by the employee under any such system will affect the employee's appeal rights.
§ 9701.708
Mandatory Removal Panel.
(a)
Composition.
(1) The Mandatory Review Panel is a standing panel composed of three members who will be appointed by the Secretary for terms of 3 years, except that the appointments of the initial MRP members will be for terms of 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. The Secretary may extend the term of any member beyond 3 years when necessary to provide for an orderly transition and/or appoint the member for an additional term.
(2) Members of the MRP must be independent, distinguished citizens of the United States who are well known for their integrity and impartiality. Members must have expertise in either labor or employee relations or law enforcement/homeland security matters. At least one member of the Board must have experience in labor relations. Members may be removed by the Secretary on the same grounds as an MSPB member.
(3) An individual chosen to fill a vacancy on the MRP will be appointed for the unexpired term of the member who is replaced.
(b)
Appointment of the Chair.
The Secretary, at his or her sole and exclusive discretion, will appoint one member to serve as Chair of the MRP.
(c)
Appointment procedures for non-Chair MRP members.
(1) The appointments of the two non-Chair MRP members will be made by the Secretary after he or she considers any lists of nominees submitted by labor organizations that represent employees in the Department of Homeland Security.
(2) The submission of lists of recommended nominees by labor organizations must be in accordance with timelines and requirements set forth by the Secretary, who may provide for additional consultation in order to obtain further information about a recommended nominee. The ability of the Secretary to appoint MRP members may not be delayed or otherwise affected by the failure of any labor organization to provide a list of nominees that meets the timeframe and requirements established by the Secretary.
§ 9701.709
Actions involving discrimination.
Section 7702 of title 5, U.S. Code, is modified to read “MSPB or MRP” wherever the terms “Merit Systems Protection Board” or “Board” are used.
§ 9701.710
Savings provision.
This subpart does not apply to adverse actions proposed prior to the date of an affected employee's coverage under this subpart.

# Source:
83 FR 49770, Oct. 3, 2018, unless otherwise noted.
§ 9800.101
General provisions.
(a)
In general.
This part contains the rules that the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Guidelines). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under part 9801 as well as under this part.
(b)
Centralized system.
CIGIE has a centralized system for processing FOIA requests, with one office receiving and coordinating the processing of all FOIA requests made to CIGIE.
(c)
Authority to grant or deny requests.
The Executive Director of CIGIE, or designee, is authorized to grant or deny any requests for records that are maintained by CIGIE. For purposes of any request for records maintained by the CIGIE Integrity Committee (IC) established under section 11(d) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. app. (Inspector General Act), the designees are the IC Chairperson and IC Vice Chairperson.
§ 9800.102
Requirements for making FOIA requests.
(a)
Requests generally.
(1) A request for CIGIE records under FOIA must be made in writing. The request must be sent by:
(i) Regular mail addressed to: FOIA Officer, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, 1717 H Street NW, Suite 825, Washington, DC 20006; or
(ii) By fax sent to the FOIA Officer at (202) 254-0162; or
(iii) By email to
FOIASTAFF@cigie.gov
.
(2) For the quickest handling, both the request letter and envelope or any fax cover sheet or email subject line should be clearly marked “FOIA Request.” Whether sent by mail, fax, email, or other prescribed electronic method, a FOIA request will not be considered to have been received by CIGIE until it reaches the FOIA office.
(3) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself, as a parent or guardian of a minor, or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, must comply with the verification of identity provisions set forth in part 9801.
(4) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, CIGIE can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.
(b)
Description of records sought.
Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable CIGIE personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist
CIGIE in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. Before making their requests, requesters may contact CIGIE's FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request CIGIE determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, CIGIE will inform the requester what additional information is needed to perfect the request or why the request is otherwise insufficient. CIGIE will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester that additional information is needed or that the request is otherwise insufficient. CIGIE may toll one time for this purpose. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with CIGIE's FOIA Public Liaison. If the requester does not provide the additional information within 30 days, the request will be closed.
(c)
Preferred format.
Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records sought. CIGIE will accommodate the request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.
(d)
Requester contact information.
Requesters must provide contact information, such as a telephone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to assist CIGIE in communicating with requester and providing released records.
§ 9800.103
Consultations, referrals, and coordination.
(a)
In general.
When reviewing records located by CIGIE in response to a request, CIGIE will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. As to any such record, CIGIE will proceed in one of the following ways:
(1)
Consultation.
When records originated with CIGIE, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or office of the Federal Government, CIGIE will typically consult with that other agency prior to making a release determination.
(2)
Referral.
(i) When CIGIE believes that a different agency of the Federal Government is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, CIGIE typically will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if CIGIE and the originating agency jointly agree that the former is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.
(ii) Whenever CIGIE refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.
(3)
Coordination.
The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if CIGIE, in responding to a request for records on a living third party, locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if CIGIE locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption,
CIGIE will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination will then usually be conveyed to the requester by CIGIE.
(b)
Timing of responses to received consultations and referrals.
All consultations and referrals received by CIGIE will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.
(c)
Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.
CIGIE may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.
(d)
Classified information.
On receipt of any request involving classified information, CIGIE must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable Executive order concerning the classification of records, CIGIE must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever CIGIE's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), CIGIE must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.
§ 9800.104
Timing of responses to requests.
(a)
In general.
Ordinarily, CIGIE will have 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from when a request is received to determine whether to grant or deny the request and will respond to requests according to their order of receipt in each track as addressed in paragraph (b) of this section. In determining which records are responsive to a request, CIGIE ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date on which it begins its search for them. If any other date is used, CIGIE will inform the requester of that date.
(b)
Multitrack processing.
(1) CIGIE processes requests using a multitrack processing system. There are four processing tracks: An expedited track, if the request qualifies; a simple track for relatively simple requests; a complex track for more complex and lengthy requests; and a remanded track, when a FOIA appeal is granted. After CIGIE assigns a request to a track for processing, CIGIE will notify the requester of that assignment.
(2) CIGIE may provide requesters in its complex track with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of the simple track.
(c)
Unusual circumstances.
Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in FOIA, and CIGIE extends the time limit on that basis, CIGIE will, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, CIGIE will, as described by FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing. CIGIE will make available its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. CIGIE will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution services.
(d)
Aggregating requests.
For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under FOIA, CIGIE may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, made either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. CIGIE will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.
(e)
Expedited processing.
(1) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:
(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;
(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;
(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or
(iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.
(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time.
(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, CIGIE may waive the formal certification requirement.
(4) CIGIE will notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request will be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.
§ 9800.105
Responses to requests.
(a)
In general.
CIGIE will, to the extent practicable, communicate with requesters having access to the internet using electronic means, such as email.
(b)
Acknowledgments of requests.
CIGIE will acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. CIGIE will include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.
(c)
Grants of requests.
Once CIGIE makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. CIGIE also will inform the requester of any fees charged under § 9800.109 and will disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. CIGIE will inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.
(d)
Adverse determinations of requests.
When CIGIE makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.
(e)
Content of denial.
The denial will include:
(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by CIGIE in denying the request;
(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and
(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 9800.107 and a description of the requirements set forth therein.
(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.
(f)
Markings on released documents.
Markings on released documents must be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part will be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted will also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.
(g)
Use of record exclusions.
(1) In the event that CIGIE identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), CIGIE will confer with the Department of Justice Office of Information Policy (OIP) to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.
(2) Should CIGIE invoke an exclusion, it will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.
§ 9800.106
Confidential commercial information.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Confidential commercial information
means commercial or financial information obtained by CIGIE from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).
(2)
Submitter
means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides information either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.
(b)
Designation of confidential commercial information.
A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations shall expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.
(c)
When notice to submitters is required.
(1) CIGIE will promptly provide written notice to a submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, CIGIE determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:
(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or
(ii) CIGIE has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.
(2) The notice will either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.
(d)
Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.
The notice requirements of this section will not apply if:
(1) CIGIE determines that the information is exempt under FOIA;
(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance
with the requirements of Executive Order 12600; or
(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, CIGIE will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.
(e)
Opportunity to object to disclosure.
(1) CIGIE will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide CIGIE a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of FOIA. To rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.
(2) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by CIGIE after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by CIGIE. Any information provided by a submitter under this part may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA.
(f)
Analysis of objections.
CIGIE will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.
(g)
Notice of intent to disclose.
Whenever CIGIE decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, CIGIE will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:
(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;
(2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and
(3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.
(h)
Notice of FOIA lawsuit.
Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, CIGIE will promptly notify the submitter.
(i)
Requester notification.
CIGIE will notify a requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.
§ 9800.107
Administrative appeals.
(a)
Appeals of adverse determinations.
A requester may appeal a determination denying a FOIA request in any respect to the CIGIE Chairperson c/o Office of General Counsel, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, 1717 H Street NW, Suite 825, Washington, DC 20006. The appeal must be in writing, and must be submitted either by:
(1) Regular mail sent to the address listed in this subsection, above; or
(2) By fax sent to the FOIA Officer at (202) 254-0162; or
(3) By email to
FOIAAPPEAL@cigie.gov.
(b)
Submission and content.
The Office of General Counsel must receive the appeal within 90 calendar days of the date of the letter denying the request. For the quickest possible handling, the appeal letter and envelope or any fax cover sheet or email subject line should be clearly marked “FOIA Appeal.” The appeal letter must clearly identify the CIGIE determination (including the assigned FOIA request number, if known) being appealed.
(c)
Adjudication of appeals.
(1) The CIGIE Chairperson or designee will act on all appeals under this section.
(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.
(3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, CIGIE will take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.
(d)
Decisions on appeals.
Ordinarily, CIGIE will have 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from receipt of the appeal to issue an appeal decision. 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii). CIGIE will provide its
decision on an appeal in writing. A decision that upholds CIGIE's determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If CIGIE's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, CIGIE will notify the requester of that determination in writing. CIGIE will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.
(e)
Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by the Office of Government Information Services.
Mediation is a voluntary process. If CIGIE agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by the Office of Government Information Services, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
(f)
When appeal is required.
Before seeking review by a court of CIGIE's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.
§ 9800.108
Preservation of records.
CIGIE will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this part, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code and the relevant approved records retention schedule. Records shall not be disposed of or destroyed while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under FOIA.
§ 9800.109
Fees.
(a)
In general.
CIGIE will charge for processing requests under FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, CIGIE may contact a requester for additional information. CIGIE will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. CIGIE ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
Commercial use request
is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. CIGIE's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. CIGIE will notify requester if requester is placed in the commercial use category.
(2)
Direct costs
are those expenses that an agency incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (
i.e.,
the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses, such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.
(3)
Duplication
is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.
(4)
Educational institution
is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at the educational institution. CIGIE may seek assurance from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
(5)
Noncommercial scientific institution
is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose
of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. CIGIE will notify requester if requester is placed in the noncommercial scientific institution category.
(6)
Representative of the news media
is any person or entity that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, CIGIE will also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. CIGIE will notify requester if requester is placed in the representative of the news media category.
(7)
Review
is the examination of a record located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 9800.106, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
(8)
Search
is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.
(c)
Charging fees.
In responding to FOIA requests, CIGIE will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, CIGIE will not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.
(1)
Search.
(i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees will be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. CIGIE may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.
(ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be as follows: Professional—$10.00; and clerical/administrative—$4.75.
(iii) Requesters will be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters will be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.
(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by an agency at a Federal records center operated by
National Archives and Records Administration, additional costs will be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by National Archives and Records Administration.
(2)
Duplication.
Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. CIGIE will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by CIGIE in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, CIGIE will provide one copy per request at a cost of five cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, CIGIE will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, CIGIE shall charge the direct costs.
(3)
Review.
Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,
i.e.,
the review conducted by CIGIE to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with CIGIE's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees shall be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(d)
Restrictions on charging fees.
(1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.
(2) If CIGIE fails to comply with FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) If CIGIE has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by FOIA, apply and CIGIE provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit will be excused for an additional 10 days.
(ii) If CIGIE has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by FOIA apply, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, CIGIE may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken. CIGIE will have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with FOIA and CIGIE will have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, CIGIE may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.
(iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits will be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.
(4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, CIGIE will provide without charge:
(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and
(ii) The first two hours of search.
(5) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.
(e)
Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.
(1) When CIGIE determines or
estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, CIGIE will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, CIGIE will advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.
(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees exceed $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. CIGIE is not required to accept payments in installments.
(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but CIGIE estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, CIGIE shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. CIGIE will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.
(4) CIGIE will make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
(f)
Charges for other services.
Although not required to provide special services, if CIGIE chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.
(g)
Charging interest.
CIGIE may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by CIGIE. CIGIE will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, Public Law 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749, as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.
(h)
Aggregating requests.
When CIGIE reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, CIGIE may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. CIGIE may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, CIGIE will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.
(i)
Advance payments.
(1) For requests other than those described in paragraph (i)(2) or (3) of this section, CIGIE will not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (
i.e.,
payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.
(2) When CIGIE determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. CIGIE may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.
(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to CIGIE or another agency within 30 days of the billing date, CIGIE may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and CIGIE may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before CIGIE begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where CIGIE has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.
(4) In cases in which CIGIE requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 days after the date of CIGIE's fee determination, the request will be closed.
(j)
Other statutes specifically providing for fees.
The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, CIGIE shall inform the requester of the contact information for that program.
(k)
Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.
(1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(2) CIGIE will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In deciding whether this standard is satisfied CIGIE will consider the factors described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
(ii) Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:
(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. CIGIE will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest
of the requester, CIGIE will consider the following criteria:
(A) CIGIE must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, CIGIE must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. CIGIE ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.
(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to CIGIE and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.
§ 9800.110
Public reading room.
CIGIE maintains an electronic public reading room on its website,
http://www.ignet.gov,
which contains the records that FOIA requires be regularly made available for public inspection and copying, as well as additional records of interest to the public. CIGIE is responsible for determining which of its records must be made publicly available, for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. CIGIE must ensure that its website of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. CIGIE's FOIA Public Liaison can assist individuals in locating records at CIGIE.
§ 9800.111
Other rights and services.
Nothing in this part shall be construed to entitle any person, as of right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under FOIA.

How addressed.
A requester seeking access to records pertaining to the requester in a CIGIE system of records should submit a written request that includes the words “Privacy Act Request” on both the envelope and at the top of the request letter to the Executive Director, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, 1717 H Street NW., Suite 825, Washington, DC 20006.
(b)
Description of records sought.
(1) A request should contain a specific reference to the CIGIE system of records from which access to the records is sought. Notices of CIGIE systems of records subject to the Privacy Act are published in the
Federal Register,
and copies of the notices are available on CIGIE's Web site at
www.ignet.gov,
or upon request from CIGIE's Office of General Counsel.
(2) If the written inquiry does not refer to a specific system of records, it must describe the records that are sought in enough detail to enable CIGIE personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort.
(3) The request should state whether the requester wants a copy of the record or wants to examine the record in person.
(c)
Verification of identity.
A requester seeking access to records pertaining to the requester must verify their identity in their request. The request must state the requester's full name, current address, and date and place of birth. The requester must sign the request and the signature must either be notarized or state, “Under penalty of perjury, I hereby declare that I am the person named above and I understand that any falsification of this statement is punishable under the provisions of Title 18, United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 1001 by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by imprisonment of not more than five years, or both; and that requesting or obtaining any record(s) under false pretenses is punishable under the provisions of Title 5, U.S.C., Section 552a(i)(3) as a misdemeanor and by a fine of not more than $5,000.” In order to help the identification and location of requested records, the requester may optionally include their social security number. No identification shall be required if the records are required by 5 U.S.C. 552 to be released.
(d)
Verification of guardianship.
When making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent for access to records about that individual, the requester must establish:

(2) The requester's identity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section;
(3) That the requester is the parent or guardian of that individual, which may be established by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing the requester's parentage or by providing a court order establishing the requester's guardianship; and
(4) That the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.
§ 9801.202
Response to requests.
A request for access will ordinarily be responded to within 10 days, except when CIGIE determines otherwise, in which case the request will be acknowledged within 10 days and the requester will be informed of the reasons for the delay and an estimated date by which a response will be issued. A response to a request for access should include the following:
(a) A statement that there is a record or records as requested or a statement that there is not a record in the system of records;
(b) The method of access (if a copy of all the records requested is not provided with the response);

Granting access.
(a)
Means of access.
(1) The methods for allowing access to records, when such access has been granted by CIGIE, are:
(i) Examination in person in a designated office during the hours specified by CIGIE; or
(ii) Providing copies of the records.
(2) When a requester has not indicated whether he wants a copy of the
record or wants to examine the record in person, CIGIE may choose the means of granting access. However, the means chosen should not unduly impede the requester's right of access. A requester may elect to receive a copy of the records after having examined them.
(b)
Accompanying individual.
If the requester is granted in person access to examine the records, the requester may be accompanied by another individual of the requester's choice during the course of the examination of the records. CIGIE may require the requester to submit a signed statement authorizing the accompanying individual's access to the records.
(c)
Certified copies.
CIGIE will not furnish certified copies of records. When copies are to be furnished, they may be provided as determined by CIGIE.
(d)
Original records.
When the requester seeks to obtain original documentation, CIGIE reserves the right to limit the request to copies of the original records.
§ 9801.204
Special procedures: Medical records.
In the event CIGIE receives a request pursuant to § 9801.201 for access to medical records (including psychological records) whose disclosure CIGIE determines would be harmful to the individual to whom they relate, it may refuse to disclose the records directly to the requester but shall transmit them to a physician designated by the requester.
§ 9801.205
Appeals from denials of requests for access to records.
(a)
How addressed.
A requester may submit a written appeal of the decision by CIGIE to deny an initial request for access to records or a no record response to the Chairperson, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, 1717 H Street NW., Suite 825, Washington, DC 20006. The words “Privacy Act Appeal” should be included on the envelope and at the top of the letter of appeal.
(b)
Deadline and content.
The appeal must be received by CIGIE within 60 days of the date of the letter denying the access request or reflecting the no record finding and should contain a brief description of the records involved or copies of the relevant correspondence from CIGIE. The appeal should attempt to refute the reasons given by CIGIE in support of its decision to deny the initial request for access or no record finding.
§ 9801.206
Response to appeal of a denial of access.
(a)
Access granted.
If the Chairperson or the Chairperson's designee determines that access to the records should be granted, the response will state how access will be provided if the records are not included with the response.
(b)
Denial affirmed.
Any decision that either partially or fully affirms the initial decision to deny access or no record finding shall inform the requester of the right to seek judicial review of the decision in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(g)).
(c)
When appeal is required.
If a requester wishes to seek review by a court of any adverse determination or denial of a request, the requester must first appeal it under § 9801.205.
§ 9801.207
Fees.
(a)
No fees for most services.
Services for which fees will not be charged:
(1) The search and review time expended by CIGIE to produce a record;
(2) The first copy of the records provided; and
(3) CIGIE making the records available to be personally reviewed by the requester.
(b)
Fees for additional copies.
When a requester requests additional copies of records, CIGIE will assess the requester a fee of $.20 per page. CIGIE will bill requester in arrears for such fees, except as follows:
(1) If the total fee for additional copies amounts to more than $25.00, the requester will be notified of the fee amount. Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, upon requester's written agreement to pay the assessed fees, CIGIE will provide the additional copies without prepayment of such fees (
i.e.,
payment will be accepted in arrears).
(2) An advance payment before additional copies of the records are made will be required if:
(i) CIGIE determines that the total fee to be assessed under this section exceeds $250.00. When such a determination is made, the requester will be notified of the determination and will be required to submit an advance payment of an amount up to the total fee. The amount of the advanced payment will be at the sole discretion of CIGIE and will be based, in part, on whether requester has a history of prompt payment of Privacy Act fees. If the required advanced payment is an amount less than the total fee, requester will be required to submit a written agreement to pay any fees not paid in advance; or
(ii) The requester has previously failed to pay a previously assessed Privacy Act fee in a timely fashion (
i.e.,
within 30 days of the date of the billing). In such cases, the requester will be required to pay the full amount outstanding plus any applicable interest as provided by paragraph (c) of this section and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the determined fee before CIGIE begins to process a new request for additional copies.
(c)
Interest charges.
For additional copies provided to requester that result in fees assessed, CIGIE will begin levying interest charges on an unpaid balance starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest will be assessed at the rate prescribed under 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.
(d)
Payment address.
Payment of fees should be made by either a personal check, bank draft or a money order that is payable to the Department of the Treasury of the United States and mailed or delivered to: Privacy Officer, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, 1717 H Street NW., Suite 825, Washington, DC 20006.
§ 9801.208
Requests for accounting of record disclosures.
(a)
How made and addressed.
Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept (as stated in paragraph (b) of this section), a requester may request an accounting of any disclosure that has been made by CIGIE to another person, organization, or agency of any record about the requester. This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. A requester seeking an accounting of record disclosures must follow the procedures set forth for access to records in § 9801.201(a), (b)(1) and (2), (c), and (d).
(b)
Where accountings are not required.
CIGIE is not required to provide accountings to requesters where they relate to:
(1) Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept, including disclosures that are made to officers and employees of CIGIE and disclosures that are made under the FOIA.

§ 9801.301
Requests for amendment of record.
(a)
How addressed.
A requester seeking to amend a record or records pertaining to requester in a CIGIE system of records should submit a written request that includes the words “Privacy Act Amendment Request” on both the envelope and at the top of the request letter to the Executive Director, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, 1717 H Street NW., Suite 825, Washington, DC 20006. Records not subject to the Privacy Act will not be amended in accordance with these provisions.
(b)
Contents of request.
A request to amend a record in a CIGIE system of records must include:
(1) The name of the system of records and a brief description of the record proposed for amendment. In the event the request to amend the record is the result of the requester having gained access to the record in accordance with the provisions concerning access to records as set forth in subpart B of this part, copies of previous correspondence between the requester and CIGIE will serve in lieu of a separate description of the record.
(2) The exact portion of the record the requester seeks to have amended should be indicated clearly. If possible, proposed alternative language should be set forth, or, at a minimum, the reasons why the requester believes the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete should be set forth with enough particularity to permit CIGIE to not only understand the requester's basis for the request, but also to make an appropriate amendment to the record.
(c)
Burden of proof.
The requester has the burden of proof when seeking the amendment of a record. The requester must furnish sufficient facts to persuade the appropriate system manager of the inaccuracy, irrelevance, untimeliness, or incompleteness of the record.
(d)
Identification requirement.
When the requester's identity has been previously verified pursuant to § 9801.201, further verification of identity is not required as long as the communication does not suggest a need for verification. If the requester's identity has not been previously verified, the appropriate system manager may require identification validation as described in § 9801.201.
[81 FR 86563, Dec. 1, 2016, as amended at 82 FR 51334, Nov. 6, 2017]

Time limit for acknowledging a request for amendment.
To the extent possible, CIGIE will acknowledge receipt of a request to amend a record or records within 10 working days.
(b)
Determination on an amendment request.
The decision of CIGIE in response to a request for amendment of a record in a system of records may grant in whole or deny any part of the request to amend the record.

To the extent an accounting of disclosure has been maintained, the system manager shall advise all previous recipients of the record that an amendment has been made and give the substance of the amendment. Where practicable, the system manager shall send a copy of the amended record to previous recipients.
(2) If CIGIE denies the request in whole or in part, the reasons for the denial will be stated in the response letter. In addition, the response letter will state:
(i) The name and address of the official with whom an appeal of the denial may be lodged; and
(ii) A description of any other procedures which may be required of the requester in order to process the appeal.
§ 9801.303
Appeal from adverse determination on amendment.
(a)
How addressed.
A requester may submit a written appeal of the decision by CIGIE to deny an initial request to amend a record in a CIGIE system of records to the Chairperson, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, 1717 H Street NW., Suite 825, Washington, DC 20006. The words “Privacy Act Appeal” should be included on the envelope and at the top of the letter of appeal.

Response to appeal of adverse determination on amendment; disagreement statements.
(a)
Response timing.
The Chairperson should make a final determination in writing not later than 30 days from the date the appeal was received. The 30-day period may be extended for good cause. Notice of the extension and the reasons therefor will be sent to the requester within the 30-day period.
(b)
Amendment granted.
If the Chairperson determines that the record(s) should be amended in accordance with the requester's request, the Chairperson will take the necessary steps to advise the requester and to direct the appropriate system manager:
(1) To amend the record(s); and
(2) To notify previous recipients of the record(s) for which there is an accounting of disclosure that the record(s) have been amended.
(c)
Denial affirmed.
If the appeal decision does not grant in full the request for amendment, the decision letter will notify the requester that the requester may:
(1) Obtain judicial review of the decision in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Act at 5 U.S.C. 552a(g); and
(2) File a statement setting forth their reasons for disagreeing with the decision.
(d)
Requester's disagreement statement.
A requester's disagreement statement must be concise. CIGIE has the authority to determine the “conciseness” of the statement, taking into account the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues.
(e)
Provision of requester's disagreement statement.
In any disclosure of information about which an individual has filed a proper statement of disagreement, CIGIE will clearly note any disputed portion(s) of the record(s) and will provide a copy of the statement to persons or other agencies to whom the disputed record or records has been disclosed and for whom an accounting of disclosure has been maintained. A concise statement of the reasons for not making the amendments requested may also be provided.

82 FR 51334, Nov. 6, 2017, unless otherwise noted.
§ 9801.401
Exemptions.
(a)
General policy.
Systems of records maintained by CIGIE are authorized to be exempted from certain provisions of the Privacy Act under the general and specific exemptions set forth in the Privacy Act. In utilizing these exemptions, CIGIE is exempting only those portions of systems that are necessary for the proper functioning of CIGIE and that are consistent with the Privacy Act. Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the information collected, e.g., public source materials, the applicable exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by CIGIE, at the sole discretion of CIGIE, as appropriate.
(b)
Specific system of records exempted under (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2).
The system of records maintained in connection with CIGIE's Integrity Committee, the Integrity Committee Management System (CIGIE-04), is subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and the specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) and (2). These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1) and (k)(2). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the information collected, e.g., public source materials, the applicable exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by CIGIE, at the sole discretion of CIGIE, as appropriate.
(1) Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), CIGIE-04 is exempt from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (c)(4); (d); (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G)-(H), (e)(5), and (e)(8); (f); and (g).
(2) Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) and (2), CIGIE-04 is exempt from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1) and (e)(4)(G)-(H); and (f).
(3) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
(i) From subsection (c)(3) because release of disclosure accounting could alert the subjects of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of the investigation and the fact that they are subjects of the investigation, and reveal investigative interest by not only CIGIE, through the IC, but also by external agencies such as the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice. Because release of such information to the subjects of an investigation would provide them with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, release could result in the destruction of documentary evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other activities that could impede or compromise the investigation. In addition, accounting for each disclosure could result in the release of properly classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy.
(ii) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.
(iii) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) because access to the records contained in this system of records could inform the subjects of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation of the existence of that investigation and of the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to their activities. Such awareness by the subjects could prevent the successful completion of an investigation and/or lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or fabricated testimony. In addition, granting access to such information could disclose security-sensitive or confidential business information or information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Finally, access to the records could result in the release of classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
(iv) From subsection (e)(1) because the application of this provision could impair investigations and interfere with the law enforcement responsibilities of CIGIE through the IC for the following reasons:
(A) It is not possible to detect relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of a civil, criminal, or other law enforcement investigation, case, or matter, including investigations in which use is made of classified information. Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be established.
(B) During the course of any investigation, CIGIE, through the IC, may obtain information concerning actual or potential violations of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, CIGIE should retain this information, as it may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.
(C) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of evidence during an investigation, information may be supplied to an investigator that relates to matters incidental to the primary purpose of the investigation but which may relate also to matters under the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be segregated.
(v) From subsection (e)(2) because, in some instances, the application of this provision would present a serious impediment to law enforcement for the following reasons:
(A) The subjects of an investigation would be placed on notice as to the existence of an investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection or
apprehension, to improperly influence witnesses, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony.
(B) In certain circumstances the subjects of an investigation cannot be required to provide information to investigators, and information relating to their illegal acts, violations of rules of conduct, or any other misconduct must be obtained from other sources.
(C) In any investigation it is necessary to obtain evidence from a variety of sources other than the subjects of the investigation.
(vi) From subsection (e)(3) because the application of this provision would provide the subjects of an investigation with substantial information which could impede or compromise the investigation.
(vii) From subsection (e)(4)(G)-(I) because this system of records is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).
(viii) From subsection (e)(5) because the application of this provision may prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate, relevant, timely, and complete at the moment it is collected. In the collection of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant, or incomplete when collected may take on added meaning or significance as an investigation progresses. The restrictions of this provision could interfere with the preparation of a complete investigative report, and thereby impede effective law enforcement.
(ix) From subsection (e)(8) because the application of this provision could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subjects of an investigation and could reveal investigative techniques, procedures, or evidence.
(x) From subsection (f) because CIGIE's rules are inapplicable to those portions of the system that are exempt and would place the burden on CIGIE of either confirming or denying the existence of a record pertaining to a requesting individual, which might in itself provide an answer to that individual relating to an ongoing investigation. The conduct of a successful investigation leading to the indictment of a criminal offender precludes the applicability of established agency rules relating to verification of record, disclosure of the record to that individual, and record amendment procedures for this record system.
(xi) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.
(c)
Specific system of records exempted under (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2).
The system of records maintained in connection with PRAC Accountability Data System (CIGIE-6), is subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and the specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) and (2). These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(1) and (k)(2). Where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the law enforcement process, and/or where it may be appropriate to permit individuals to contest the accuracy of the information collected, e.g., public source materials, the applicable exemption may be waived, either partially or totally, by CIGIE, at the sole discretion of CIGIE, as appropriate.
(1) Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), CIGIE-6 is exempt from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (c)(4); (d); (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G)-(H), (e)(5), and (e)(8); (f); and (g).
(2) Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) and (2), CIGIE-6 is exempt from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1) and (e)(4)(G)-(H); and (f).
(3) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
(i) From subsection (c)(3) because release of disclosure accounting could alert the subjects of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of the investigation and the fact that they are subjects of the investigation, and reveal investigative interest by not only CIGIE, through the PRAC, but
also by external agencies such as Federal Offices of Inspector General. Because release of such information to the subjects of an investigation would provide them with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, release could result in the destruction of documentary evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other activities that could impede or compromise the investigation. In addition, accounting for each disclosure could result in the release of properly classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy.
(ii) From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.
(iii) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) because access to the records contained in this system of records could inform the subjects of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation of the existence of that investigation and of the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to their activities. Such awareness by the subjects could prevent the successful completion of an investigation and/or lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or fabricated testimony. In addition, granting access to such information could disclose security-sensitive or confidential business information or information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Finally, access to the records could result in the release of classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
(iv) From subsection (e)(1) because the application of this provision could impair investigations and interfere with the law enforcement responsibilities of CIGIE through the PRAC for the following reasons:
(A) It is not possible to detect relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of a civil, criminal, or other law enforcement investigation, case, or matter, including investigations in which use is made of classified information. Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be established.
(B) During the course of any investigation, CIGIE, through the PRAC may obtain information concerning actual or potential violations of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the PRAC should retain this information, as it may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.
(C) In interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of evidence during an investigation, information may be supplied to an investigator that relates to matters incidental to the primary purpose of the investigation but which may relate also to matters under the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be segregated.
(v) From subsection (e)(2) because, in some instances, the application of this provision would present a serious impediment to law enforcement for the following reasons:
(A) The subjects of an investigation would be placed on notice as to the existence of an investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection or apprehension, to improperly influence witnesses, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony.
(B) In certain circumstances the subjects of an investigation cannot be required to provide information to investigators, and information relating to their illegal acts, violations of rules of conduct, or any other misconduct must be obtained from other sources.
(C) In any investigation it is necessary to obtain evidence from a variety of sources other than the subjects of the investigation.
(vi) From subsection (e)(3) because the application of this provision would
provide the subjects of an investigation with substantial information which could impede or compromise the investigation.
(vii) From subsection (e)(4)(G)-(I) because this system of records is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).
(viii) From subsection (e)(5) because the application of this provision may prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate, relevant, timely, and complete at the moment it is collected. In the collection of information for law enforcement purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant, or incomplete when collected may take on added meaning or significance as an investigation progresses. The restrictions of this provision could interfere with the preparation of a complete investigative report, and thereby impede effective law enforcement.
(ix) From subsection (e)(8) because the application of this provision could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subjects of an investigation and could reveal investigative techniques, procedures, or evidence.
(x) From subsection (f) because CIGIE's rules are inapplicable to those portions of the system that are exempt and would place the burden on CIGIE of either confirming or denying the existence of a record pertaining to a requesting individual, which might in itself provide an answer to that individual relating to an ongoing investigation. The conduct of a successful investigation leading to the indictment of a criminal offender precludes the applicability of established agency rules relating to verification of record, disclosure of the record to that individual, and record amendment procedures for this record system.
(xi) From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act.

§ 9901.1
Authority, purpose, and scope.
(a)
Authority.
This information is furnished for the guidance of the public and in compliance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. This subpart should be read in conjunction with FOIA.
(b)
Purpose.
(1) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, Public Law 112-239, Subtitle H, 126 Stat. 1632, 1787 (2013) (amended by National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, Pub. L. 113-66, Sec. 1095, 127 Stat. 672, 878 (2013)), established the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC). MCRMC's purpose, pursuant to its enabling statute, is to conduct a review of the military compensation and retirement systems and to make recommendations to modernize those systems to:
(i) Ensure the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force by sustaining the required human resources of that force during all levels of conflict and economic conditions;
(ii) Enable the quality of life for members of the Armed Forces and the other uniformed services and their families in a manner that fosters successful recruitment, retention, and careers for members of the Armed Forces and the other uniformed services; and
(iii) Modernize and achieve fiscal sustainability for the compensation and retirement systems for the Armed Forces and the other uniformed services for the 21st century.
(2) The Commission will make its recommendations only after it examines all laws, policies and practices of the Federal Government that result in any direct payment of authorized or appropriated funds to current and former members (veteran and retired) of the uniformed services, including the reserve components of those services, and the spouses, family members, children, survivors, and other persons authorized to receive such payments as a result of their connection to Service members.
(c)
Agency.
MCRMC is an independent establishment of the Federal government as defined by Sections 104 and 105 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, and a temporary organization under section 3161 of such title. The Commission is composed of nine members, appointed by the President and Congressional leadership. Members of this Commission are deemed to be Federal employees. MCRMC maintains its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.
(d)
Records on individuals.
MCRMC does not maintain any of its own systems of records on individuals. Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Defense, Director of Administration
Management and MCRMC, the Department of Defense, Washington Headquarters Services is responsible for MCRMC personnel records management including compliance with the Privacy Act.
[79 FR 54567, Sept. 12, 2014, as amended at 79 FR 63497, Oct. 24, 2014]
§ 9901.2
Proactive disclosure of records.
(a)
Proactive disclosure.
Subject to the application of FOIA exemptions, 5 U.S.C. 552(b), records that are required by FOIA to be made available for public inspection and copying and records identified by the agency as records of interest to the public, including Commission hearing schedules, testimony, minutes, press releases, and documents
provided to the Commission, are available on the MCRMC Web site at
http://www.mcrmc.gov.
(b)
Final report.
The Commission's final report will be available on its Web site.
(c)
Released records.
The Commission will post records released in response to FOIA requests on its Web site.
§ 9901.3
Requests for records.
(a)
Generally.
Many documents are available on the MCRMC Web site and MCRMC encourages requesters to visit the Web site before making a request for records pursuant to this subpart. MCRMC will provide records to individual requesters in response to FOIA requests for records not available on its Web site.
(b)
Electronic or written requests required.
For records not available on the Web site, requesters wishing to obtain information from MCRMC should submit a request on the MCRMC Web site. If a computer is not available to the requester, a written request may be made to the MCRMC FOIA Officer. Such requests should be addressed to: FOIA Officer, Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission, Post Office Box 13170, Arlington, VA 22209. As there may be delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the request via facsimile to (703) 697-8330 or email to
foia@mcrmc.gov.
MCRMC will communicate with the requester by email unless he or she specifies otherwise.
(c)
Contents of request.
Requests must include the following:
(1) A statement that the request is being made under FOIA, the requester's full name and address, a telephone number at which the requester can be reached during normal business hours, and an email address for the requester, if the requester has one;
(2) A description of the records sought in enough detail to allow the records to be located with a reasonable amount of effort. The request must identify/describe the records sought and include information such as date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the records sought, where possible;
(3) If submitting the request as an
educational institution,
a
non-commercial scientific institution,
or a
representative of the news media,
the request must specifically identify the organization on which the status is based, and if a free-lance representative of the news media, the requester should submit a history of past publications and/or demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news-media entity;
(4) A fee waiver, if applicable; and
(5) If the request is made by mail, the words “FOIA REQUEST” or “REQUEST FOR RECORDS” must be clearly marked on the cover letter, letter, and envelope.
(d)
Perfected requests.
MCRMC will process only perfected requests. A perfected request must meet all of the requirements of this subpart.
[79 FR 63498, Oct. 24, 2014]
§ 9901.4
Timing.
(a)
Acknowledgment of request.
MCRMC will provide an acknowledgment notice with an individualized tracking number and a summary of the records requested to each requester within 10 working days after receiving a request.
(b)
Response time.
Every effort will be made to respond to the request within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of receiving the request.
(c)
Appeal.
MCRMC will make a decision with respect to an appeal of a denial of a request for records within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt of the appeal.
(d)
Clarification/Additional information.
If a request for records does not reasonably describe the records sought, MCRMC will contact the requester to seek additional information. Requesters may discuss their request with the MCRMC FOIA Public Liaison and modify the request. The MCRMC FOIA Public Liaison may be reached via telephone at (703) 692-2080 or by U.S. Mail at FOIA Public Liaison, Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission, Post Office Box 13170, Arlington, VA 22209. As there may be delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the request via facsimile to (703) 697-8330 or email to
foia@mcrmc.gov.
MCRMC may make one
request for clarification/additional information to the requester for information and suspend the 20-day period while awaiting such information. When a requester fails to clarify by providing additional information, MCRMC will notify the requester that the request has not been properly made and that no further action will be taken on the request. The requester may appeal such a decision under the procedures set forth in subpart 9901.7.
(e)
Expedited processing.
A request for expedited processing must accompany the initial request for records. It must be a written statement of compelling need for expedited processing, stating that the facts are true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. In determining whether processing should be expedited, the FOIA Officer may consider whether:
(1) Failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to a person's life or physical safety; or
(2) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, there is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal government activity.
(f)
Extension for unusual circumstances.
If MCRMC determines that unusual circumstances exist, the time limits described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subpart may be extended by no more than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sunday, and legal public holidays) by providing written notice of the extension to the requester. The time limit may be extended if the request cannot be processed within the time limits of this subpart due to the need to search, collect, and examine a voluminous amount of records, coordinate, or consult with another agency. The requester will be given an opportunity to limit the scope of the request or to arrange with MCRMC an alternative time frame for processing the request. The FOIA Officer shall include with the notice of extension a brief statement of the reason for the extension and the date the FOIA Officer expects to make a determination.
§ 9901.5
Response to requests.
(a)
Authority to grant or deny requests.
The MCRMC FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or deny any request for MCRMC records.
(b)
Grant of request.
If the MCRMC FOIA Officer grants a request, in full or in part, the FOIA Officer shall promptly provide the requester written notice of the decision. The requester will be notified whether the request has been assigned to the Standard or Complex track, pursuant to paragraph (d) of subpart 9901.6.
(c)
Request denial.
If the FOIA Officer denies a fee waiver request or finds there are no responsive records subject to FOIA, the FOIA Officer will notify the requester of that fact. If the FOIA Officer denies the request, in full or part, the FOIA Officer will provide the requester written notice of the denial, which will include a description of the material withheld, the FOIA exemption under which the information was withheld, and the approximate number of pages of information withheld. When a portion of a record is withheld, the amount of information redacted and the claimed exemption will be noted at the place in the record where the redaction was made. The notice will also describe the procedure for filing an appeal.
(d)
Referral of records.
When a responsive record that originated in another agency is located, the responsive record will be referred to its originating agency for response.
(e)
Referral of request.
The requester will be notified when all or part of a request is referred to another agency and will be given contact information for the FOIA office of the agency to which the request and responsive record were referred.
§ 9901.6
Production of records.
(a)
Generally.
MCRMC will apply a presumption of openness when processing FOIA requests and will only withhold exempt information if it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of the statutory exemptions or if disclosure is prohibited by law. Before withholding information, MCRMC will conduct a foreseeable harm analysis,
which clearly identifies the harm that would occur with disclosure.
(b)
Large requests.
If a request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, MCRMC will provide the requester with interim responses, releasing the information on a rolling basis.
(c)
Copies.
MCRMC will maintain copies of records that have been the subject of any pending or closed request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA, to include all correspondence pertaining to the subject request, until disposition is authorized under the National Archives and Records Administration's General Records Schedule 14.
(d)
Multi-Track processing.
(1) MCRMC uses a multi-track system to process FOIA requests. This means that a FOIA request is processed based on its complexity. When MCRMC receives a request it will be assigned to the
Standard
or
Complex
track.
(i)
Standard Track.
Requests that are routine and require little search time, review, or analysis are assigned to the Standard Track. MCRMC will respond to these requests in the order in which they are received and make every effort to respond no later than 20 working days after receipt of the request.
(ii)
Complex Track.
Requests that are non-routine are assigned to the Complex Track if the response may:
(A) Be voluminous;
(B) Require an unusually high level of effort for search, review, or duplication; or
(C) Cause an undue disruption to the day-to-day activities of MCRMC in carrying out its statutory responsibilities.
(2) The requester will be notified if the request is assigned to the Complex Track and will be given an estimate of the time for response. MCRMC will respond to Complex Track requests as soon as practicable. MCRMC may discuss with the requester the possibility of reformulating the request to reduce processing time.
§ 9901.7
Appeals.
(a)
Initiating appeals.
Requesters not satisfied with the FOIA Officer's decision may request review of the decision by the MCRMC FOIA Appellate Authority. The appeal must be received within 60 days of the date of the FOIA Officer's decision. Appeals may be made through the MCRMC Web site at the FOIA tab or in writing, addressed to: FOIA Appellate Authority, Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission, Post Office Box 13170, Arlington, VA 22209. As there may be delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the request via facsimile to (703) 697-8330 or email to
foia@mcrmc.gov.
The requester may wish to explain why the Appellate Authority should grant the appeal, to the extent that an explanation could assist the Appellate Authority in making a decision on the appeal.
(b)
Appeal decisions.
MCRMC's Chief FOIA Officer will decide the appeal within 20 days (except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date it receives the appeal. If the appeal is denied, MCRMC will notify the requester in writing of the decision and the provisions for judicial review. If the appeal is granted, the Chief FOIA Officer will notify the requester in writing.
(c)
Mediation.
A response to an appeal will advise the requester of the 2007 FOIA amendments, which created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which offers mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. A requester may contact OGIS at: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740; email:
ogis@nara.gov;
telephone: (202) 741-5770; facsimile: (202) 741-5769; toll free telephone: (877) 684-6448.
§ 9901.8
Fees.
(a)
Generally.
MCRMC may charge reasonable fees that recoup the allowable direct costs incurred in responding to FOIA requests. MCRMC may assess charges for time spent searching for records even if MCRMC is unable to locate the records or if the records are located and determined to be exempt from disclosure.
(1)
Timing.
MCRMC may toll the response time limit while awaiting information from the requester regarding fee assessment. Time limits resume
upon MCRMC's receipt of a response from the requester.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart:
(1)
All other request
means a request from or on behalf of a person who does not qualify as a
commercial use requester,
an
educational institution
requester, a
non-commercial scientific institution
requester, or a
representative of the news media requester.
(2)
Commercial use request
means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the requester's or other person's commercial, trade, or profit interests.
(3)
Direct costs
means those costs incurred searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) documents in response to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, salaries of employees who perform the work and costs of conducting large-scale computer searches. Direct costs do not include, for example, overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.
(4)
Duplication
means to copy records in response to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audio-visual materials, or electronic records, among others.
(5)
Educational institution
is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. Records requested with the intention of fulfilling credit requirements or completion of individual research goals do not qualify as a request by an educational institution.
(6)
Non-commercial scientific institution
means an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis and operates solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
(7)
Representative of the news media
means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.
(8)
Review
means to examine a record to determine whether any portion of the record may be withheld, and to process a record for disclosure.
(9)
Search
means to look for and retrieve records for a FOIA request, to include looking page-by-page or line-by-line to identify responsive material within individual records. Search includes time spent looking for records even if responsive records are not found.
(c)
Reduction of fees.
(1) MCRMC will not charge fees for any request where the fees would total less than $50.
(2) MCRMC will provide, except for
commercial use requesters,
without charge, the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media) and the first two hours of a search.
(3) MCRMC shall not assess search fees if the agency fails to comply with time limits set forth in subpart 9901.4 if no unusual circumstances, as defined in subpart 9901.4, apply to the processing of the request.
(d)
Waiver of fees.
MCRMC shall waive all or part of any fee provided for in this subpart where the FOIA Officer determines that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and the records sought are not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Requests for a fee waiver must explain how the information requested contributes to the public interest. In determining whether a fee should be waived, the FOIA Officer shall consider whether the requester has demonstrated that:
(1) The subject matter of the request specifically concerns identifiable operations or activities of the Government;
(2) The information is already in the public domain;
(3) Disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester; and
(4) Disclosure of the information would significantly enhance the public's understanding of the subject matter.
(e)
Categories of requesters.
Subject to the limitations of this subpart, MCRMC will assess fees for categories of requesters as follows:
(1)
Commercial use requesters
pay for search, review, and duplication.
(2)
Educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions
and
representatives of the news media
pay only for duplication (excluding charges for the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent).
(3)
All other requesters
pay for search (excluding the first two hours) and duplication (excluding charges for the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent).
(f)
Charges.
In responding to FOIA requests, MCRMC will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been requested and granted under this subpart. The fee amounts provided below account for direct costs.
(1)
Search and review.
For each quarter hour spent by MCRMC searching for requested records, including electronic searches, or reviewing records, the fee will be $10.77.
(2)
Duplication.
Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of this subpart. MCRMC will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular format where it is readily reproducible in that form or format. Where photocopies are supplied, MCRMC will provide one copy per request at a cost of five cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other electronic media, MCRMC will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, MCRMC will charge the direct costs.
(3)
Special charges.
MCRMC shall recover the full cost of providing special services, such as sending records by an overnight delivery service, to the extent that MCRMC elects to provide them, as special services are not required by FOIA.
(4)
Aggregating requests.
When the FOIA Officer reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is/are attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the FOIA Officer may aggregate those requests and charge fees accordingly.
(5)
Advance payment.
When a requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion or MCRMC has determined that the fee will exceed $250, MCRMC may require advance payment of fees.
(6)
Remittances.
Payment shall be made in the form of check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States. At the time the FOIA Officer notifies a requester of the applicable fees, the FOIA Officer shall inform the requester of where to send the payment.

§ 10000.1
Purpose and scope.
The regulations in this part implement the provisions of the FOIA.
§ 10000.2
Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this part:
Chairperson
means the Chairperson of the Council, as appointed by the President, or any person to whom the Council has delegated authority for the matter concerned.
Chief FOIA Officer
means the senior official to whom the Council delegated responsibility for efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA, currently delegated to the General Counsel.
Commercial use request
means a FOIA request from or on behalf of a requester that seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers their commercial, trade, or profit interests, including pursuit of those interests through litigation.
Confidential business information
means trade secrets or confidential or privileged commercial or financial information submitted to the Council by a person that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.
Council
means the National Council on Disability, established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 780
et seq.
), as amended, and amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Pub. L. 113-128) in 2014.
Direct costs
are those expenses that an agency incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (
i.e.,
the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.
Educational institution
means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, an educational institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but rather are sought to further scholarly research. To fall within this fee category, the request must serve the scholarly research goals of the institution rather than an individual research goal.
(1)
Example 1.
A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.
(2)
Example 2.
A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.
(3)
Example 3.
A student who makes a request in furtherance of the completion of a course of instruction would be presumed to be carrying out an individual research goal, rather than a scholarly research goal of the institution and would not qualify as part of this fee category.
Fee waiver
means the waiver or reduction of fees if a requester can demonstrate meeting the statutory standard that the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
FOIA
means the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. The FOIA applies to requests for agency records.
FOIA Officer
means the individual to whom the Council has delegated authority to carry out the Council's day-to-day FOIA administration, currently delegated to the Council's Attorney Advisor.
FOIA Public Liaison
means the individual designated by the Chairperson to assist FOIA requesters with concerns about the Council's processing of their FOIA request, including assistance in resolving disputes, currently delegated to the Council's Attorney Advisor.
Non-commercial scientific institution
means an organization operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any product or research, and not operated on a commercial basis.
Person
includes an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than an agency.
Record
means any writing, drawing, map, recording, diskette, DVD, CD-ROM, tape, film, photograph, or other documentary material, regardless of medium, by which information is preserved, including documentary material stored electronically.
Redact
means delete or mark over.
Representative of the news media
is any person or entity organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the Internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, components shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.
Requester category
means one of the three categories defined by the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Fee Guidelines) in which requesters will be placed for the purpose of determining what if any fees for search, review, or duplication may be assessed. They are:
(1) Commercial requesters;
(2) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or representatives of the news media; and
(3) All other requesters.
Submitter
means any person or entity from whom the Council obtains confidential or privileged business information, directly or indirectly.
Unusual circumstances
exist when:
(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from physically separate facilities;
(2) The need to search for, collect and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or
(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.
[80 FR 49118, Aug. 17, 2015, as amended at 81 FR 93792, Dec. 22, 2016]
§ 10000.3
Availability of records.
Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for public inspection and copying may be accessed through the Agency's Web site at
www.ncd.gov.
The Council is responsible for determining which of its records are required to be made publicly available, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. The Council shall ensure that its Web site of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. The Council's FOIA Public Liaison can assist individuals in locating records particular to a component.
§ 10000.4
Categories of exemptions.
(a) The FOIA does not require disclosure of matters that are:
(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are, in fact, properly classified under executive order;
(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Council;
(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b, as amended), provided that such statute:
(i)(A) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or
(B) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and
(ii) If enacted after October 28, 2009, specifically cites to Exemption 3 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3);
(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters, which would not be available at law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Council;
(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:
(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;
(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or impartial adjudication;
(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a state, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution that furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;
(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.
(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or
(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.
§ 10000.5
Request for records.
(a) You may request copies of records under this part by email to
FOIA@ncd.gov
or in writing addressed to FOIA Officer, National Council on Disability, 1331 F Street NW., Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004.
(b) Your request shall reasonably describe the records sought with sufficient specificity, and when possible, include names, dates, and subject matter, in order to permit the FOIA Officer to
locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. If the FOIA Officer cannot locate responsive records based on your written description, you will be notified and advised that further identifying information is necessary before the request can be fulfilled. Although requests are considered either FOIA or Privacy Act requests, the Council processes requests for records in accordance with both laws so as to provide the greatest degree of lawful access while safeguarding an individual's personal privacy.
(c) Your request should specify your preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records you seek. We will accommodate your request if the record is readily available in that form or format. When you do not specify the form or format of the response, we will provide responsive records in the form or format most convenient to us.
§ 10000.6
Responsibility for responding to requests.
(a)
In general.
The Council delegates authority to grant or deny FOIA requests in whole or in part to the Chief FOIA Officer. When conducting a search for responsive records, the FOIA Officer generally will search for records in existence on the date of the search. If another date is used, the FOIA Officer shall inform the requester of the date used.
(b)
Responses.
The Chief FOIA Officer will notify you of his or her determination to grant or deny your FOIA request in the time frame stated in § 10000.8. The Council will release reasonably segregable non-exempt information. For any adverse determination, including those regarding any disputed fee matter; a denial of a request for a fee waiver; or a determination to withhold a record, in whole or in part, that a record does not exist or cannot be located; or to deny a request for expedited processing; the notice shall include the following information:
(1) FOIA case number and date of the original request;
(2) The name(s) of any person responsible for the determination to deny the request in whole or in part;
(3) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied in denying the request. The Chief FOIA Officer will indicate, if technically feasible, the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which a deletion is made on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption;
(4) An estimate of the volume of information withheld, if applicable. This estimate does not need to be provided if it is ascertainable based on redactions in partially disclosed records or if the disclosure of the estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption; and
(5) A statement of the right to seek dispute resolution services from NCD's FOIA Public Liaison and the Office of Government Information Services.
(c)
Consultation, referral, and coordination.
When reviewing records located by the Council in response to a request, the Council shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government or entity is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA and, if so, whether it should be released as a matter of discretion. As to any such record, the Council shall proceed in one of the following ways:
(1)
Consultation.
When records originated with the Council, but contain within them information of interest to another agency, the Council should typically consult with that other agency prior to making a release determination.
(2)
Referral.
(i) When the Council believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Council typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record, as long as the referral is to an agency that is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Council and the originating agency jointly agree that the former is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.
(ii) Whenever the Council refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it shall document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.
(3)
Coordination.
The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if the Council responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if the Council locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the Council should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the Council.
[80 FR 49118, Aug. 17, 2015, as amended at 81 FR 93792, Dec. 22, 2016]
§ 10000.7
Administrative appeals.
(a) You may appeal an adverse determination related to your FOIA request, or the Council's failure to respond to your FOIA request within the prescribed time limits, by email at
FOIA@ncd.gov,
or write
to the Executive Director, National Council on Disability, 1331 F Street NW., Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004.
(b) Your appeal must be in writing and must be postmarked or electronically received by the Executive Director within 90 days of the date of the letter denying your request, in whole or in part.For the most expeditious handling, your appeal letter and envelope should be marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” and reference the request number.
(c) The Executive Director shall respond to all administrative appeals in writing and within the time frame stated in § 10000.8(d). If the decision affirms, in whole or in part, the Chief FOIA Officer's determination, the letter shall contain a statement of the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied, and will inform you of the FOIA's provisions for court review. If the Executive Director reverses or modifies the Chief FOIA Officer's determination, in whole or in part, you will be notified in writing and your request will be reprocessed in accordance with that decision. The Council may work with Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to resolve disputes between FOIA requestors and the Council. A requester may also seek dispute resolution services from NCD's FOIA Public Liaison and OGIS. Facsimile is also available at 202-741-5769.
[80 FR 49118, Aug. 17, 2015, as amended at 81 FR 93792, Dec. 22, 2016]
§ 10000.8
Timeframe for Council's response to a FOIA request or administrative appeal.
(a)
In general.
The Council ordinarily shall respond to requests according to their order of receipt.
(b)
Multi-track processing.
(1) The Council may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, including through limits based on the number of pages involved. If the Council does so, it shall advise requesters in its slower track(s) of the limits of its faster track(s).
(2) Using multitrack processing, the Council may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing
within the specified limits of the Council's faster track(s). In doing so, the Council will contact the requester by telephone, letter, or email, whichever is more efficient in each case.
(c)
Initial decisions.
The Council shall determine whether to comply with a FOIA request within 20 working days after our receipt of the request, unless the time frame for response is extended due to unusual circumstances as further described in paragraph (f) of this section. A request is received by the Council, for purposes of commencing the 20-day timeframe for its response, on the day it is properly received by the FOIA Officer. The request must meet all requirements described by these regulations and the FOIA before the 20-day timeframe commences.
(d)
Administrative appeals.
The Executive Director shall determine whether to affirm or overturn a decision subject to administrative appeal within 20 working days after receipt of the appeal, unless the time frame for response is extended in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(e)
Tolling timelines.
We may toll the 20-day timeframe set forth in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section:
(1) One time to await information that we reasonably requested from you, as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(iii)(I);
(2) As necessary to clarify with you any fee-related issue.
(3) If we toll the time frame for response under paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section, the tolling period ends upon our receipt of your response.
(f)
Unusual circumstances.
In the event of unusual circumstances, we may extend the time frame for response provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section by providing you with written notice of the unusual circumstances and the date on which a determination is expected to be made. Where the extension is for more than ten working days, we will provide you with an opportunity either to modify your request so that it may be processed within the statutorily-prescribed time limits or to arrange an alternative time period for processing your request or modified request.
(g)
Aggregating requests.
When we reasonably believe that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, involving clearly related matters, can be viewed as a single request that involves unusual circumstances, we may aggregate the requests for the purposes of fees and processing activities.
(h)
Expedited processing.
You may request that the Council expedite processing of your FOIA request. To receive expedited processing, you must demonstrate a compelling need for such processing.
(1) For requests for expedited processing, a “compelling need” involves:
(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
(ii) A request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, with a time urgency to inform the public of actual or alleged federal government activity.
(2) Your request for expedited processing must be in writing and may be made at the time of the initial FOIA request or at any later time.
(3) Your request for expedited processing must include a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. If you are a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, you must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the federal government activity involved in the request.
(4) The Chief FOIA Officer will decide whether to grant or deny your request for expedited processing and notify the requester within ten calendar days of receipt. You will be notified in writing of the determination. Appeals of adverse decisions regarding expedited processing shall be processed expeditiously.
[80 FR 49118, Aug. 17, 2015, as amended at 81 FR 93792, Dec. 22, 2016]
§ 10000.9
Business information.
(a)
Designation of confidential business information.
In the event a FOIA request is made for confidential business information previously submitted to
the Government by a commercial entity or on behalf of it (hereinafter “submitter”), the regulations in this section apply. When submitting confidential business information, you must use a good-faith effort to designate, by use of appropriate markings, at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of your submission that you consider to be exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Your designation will expire ten years after the date of submission unless you request, and provide justification for, a longer designation period.
(b)
Notice to submitters.
(1) Whenever you designate confidential business information as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, or the Council has reason to believe that your submission may contain confidential business information, we will provide you with prompt written notice of a FOIA request that seeks your business information. The notice shall:
(i) Give you an opportunity to object to disclosure of your information, in whole or in part;
(ii) Describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions containing the information; and
(iii) Inform you of the time frame in which you must respond to the notice.
(2) In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.
(c)
Opportunity to object to disclosure.
The Council shall allow you a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section. If you object to the disclosure of your information, in whole or in part, you must provide us with a detailed written statement of your objection. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any FOIA exemption and, when relying on FOIA Exemption 4, it must explain why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged and confidential. If you fail to respond within the time frame specified in the notice, the Council will conclude that you have no objection to disclosure of your information. The Council will only consider information that we receive within the time frame specified in the notice.
(d)
Notice of intent to disclose.
The Council will consider your objection and specific grounds for non-disclosure in deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever the Council decides to disclose business information over your objection, we will provide you with written notice that includes:
(1) A statement of the reasons why each of your bases for withholding were not sustained;
(2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and
(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time after the notice.
(e)
Exceptions to the notice requirement.
The notice requirements of paragraphs (c) and
(d) of this section shall not apply if:
(1) The Council determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;
(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public;
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600;
(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (a) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the Council shall, within a reasonable time prior to the date the disclosure will be made, give the submitter written notice of the final decision to disclose the information.
(f)
Requester notification.
The Council shall notify a requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.
§ 10000.10
Fees.
(a) We will charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs we incur in processing your FOIA request. Fees may be charged for search, review or
duplication. We will use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with your request.
(b) With regard to manual searches for records, we will charge the salary rate(s) (calculated as the basic rate of pay plus 16 percent of that basic rate to cover benefits) of the employee(s) performing the search.
(c) In calculating charges for computer searches for records, we will charge at the actual direct cost of providing the service, including the cost of operating the central processing unit directly attributable to searching for records potentially responsive to your FOIA request and the portion of the salary of the operators/programmers performing the search.
(d) Review fees shall be charged for requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed only for the initial review—that is the review undertaken the first time we analyze the applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. Records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. We may assess the costs for such subsequent review. Review fees are charged at the same rates as those charged for a search.
(e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00:
(1) When the Council determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the Council shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Council shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication or equivalent at no charge. For example, 100 pages burned to a single CD would be considered equivalent to 100 pages of duplication. And, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.
(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Council is not required to accept payments in installments.
(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the Council estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the Council shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Council shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.
(4) The Council shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
(f) We will charge you the full costs of providing you with the following services:
(1) Certifying that records are true copies; or
(2) Sending records by special methods such as express or certified mail.
(g) We may assess interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st calendar day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest shall be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717
and will accrue from the date of the billing.
(h) We will not charge a search fee for requests by educational institutions, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media. A search fee will be charged for a commercial use requests.
(i) Except for a commercial use request, we will not charge you for the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search.
(j) If the Council fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, may not charge duplication fees.
(k) After processing, actual fees must be equal to or exceed $25, for the Council to require payment of fees.
(l) You may not file multiple requests, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely for the purpose of avoiding payment of fees. When the Council reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, has submitted requests that constitute a single request involving clearly related matters, we may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly.
(m) We may not require you to make payment before we begin work to satisfy the request or to continue work on a request, unless:
(1) We estimate or determine that the allowable charges that you may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250; or
(2) You have previously failed to pay a fee charged within 30 days of the date of billing.
(n) Upon written request, we may waive or reduce fees that are otherwise chargeable under this part. If you request a waiver or reduction in fees, you must demonstrate that a waiver or reduction in fees is in the public interest because disclosure of the requested records is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in your commercial interest.
(1) In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government, the Council shall consider all four of the following factors:
(i) The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
(ii) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
(iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. However, components shall not make value judgments about whether the information at issue is “important” enough to be made public.
(2) To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Council shall consider the following factors:
(i) The Council shall identify any commercial interest of the requester, as defined in § 10000.2, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure.
Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
(ii) A waiver or reduction of fees is justified where the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The Council ordinarily shall presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.
(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the component and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

(j) Specifically concerned with the Council's issuance of a subpoena, or its participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Council of a particular case or formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.

(c) A person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting may request in writing that the Council close that portion for any of the reasons referred to in § 10002.5(e) through (g).

(d) For every meeting closed, the General Counsel shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant basis for closing the meeting. If the General Counsel invokes the bases set forth in § 10002.5(a) or (c), he or she shall rely upon the classification or designation assigned to the information by the originating agency. A copy of such certification, together with a statement by the presiding officer setting forth the time and place of the meeting and the persons present, shall be retained by the Council as part of the transcript, recording, or minutes required by § 10002.8.
§ 10002.7
Changes following public announcement.
(a) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the public announcement described in § 10002.4. The Council must publicly announce such change at the earliest practicable time.
(b) The subject matter of a meeting or the determination of the Council to open or close a meeting, or a portion thereof, to the public may be changed following public announcement only if:
(1) A majority of all members determine by recorded vote that Council business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible; and
(2) The Council publicly announces such change and the vote of each member thereon at the earliest practicable time.

Alternatively, for any meeting closed pursuant to § 10002.5(h) or (j), the Council may maintain a set of minutes adequate to record fully the proceedings, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote.
§ 10002.9
Public availability and retention of transcripts, recordings, and minutes, and applicable fees.
(a) The Council shall make available, in a place easily accessible, such as
www.ncd.gov,
to the public the transcript, electronic recording, or minutes of a meeting, except for items of discussion or testimony related to matters the Council determines may be withheld under § 10002.6.
(b) Copies of the nonexempt portions of the transcripts or minutes shall be provided upon receipt of the actual costs of the transcription or duplication.
(c) The Council shall maintain meeting transcripts, recordings, or minutes of each meeting closed to the public for a period ending at the later of two years following the date of the meeting, or one year after the conclusion of any Council proceeding with respect to the closed meeting.

§ 10201.101
General.
(a)
Purpose.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch at 5 CFR part 2635.
(b)
Other regulations, guidance, and procedures.
In addition to the standards in 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, all OSC employees are required to comply with implementing guidance and procedures issued by OSC in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105(c). OSC employees are also subject to all other government-wide regulations concerning executive branch ethics including without limitation, financial disclosure regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634, regulations concerning financial interests contained in 5 CFR part 2640, post-employment conflict of interest restrictions contained in 5 CFR part 2641, outside earned income limitations and employment and affiliation restrictions applicable to certain noncareer employees contained in 5 CFR part 2636, and the regulations concerning executive branch employee responsibilities and conduct contained in 5 CFR part 735.
§ 10201.102
Prior approval for outside employment or activity.
(a)
General requirement.
Before engaging in any outside employment or activity, whether or not for compensation, an OSC employee must obtain written approval from the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) or the Alternate Designated Agency Ethics Official (ADAEO), except to the extent that OSC has issued an internal instruction pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section exempting certain employment or activities from this requirement.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
a

# ).
18 U.S.C. 203(d) and 205(e) require special approval for certain representational activities in claims against the Federal Government and other matters affecting the interests of the government.
(b)
Definition of
“
outside employment or activity”.
For purposes of this section, “outside employment or activity” means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of services by the employee, whether for compensation or not for compensation. It includes, but is not limited to, serving as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, or teacher. The definition does not include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organization unless such activities involve the provision of professional services or advice, or are for compensation other than reimbursement of expenses.

# Note 2 to paragraph (
b

# ).
Employees who wish to engage in compensated speaking or writing in a personal capacity are subject to, among other things, the provisions of 5 CFR 2635.703 (concerning use of nonpublic information) and 5 CFR 2635.807 (concerning receipt of compensation for teaching, speaking, and writing related to one's duties), and are encouraged to seek guidance from an agency ethics official before engaging in such activities. Certain covered non-career employees are also subject to further restrictions on receipt of outside compensation pursuant to section 502 of the Ethics in Government Act (5 U.S.C. app.). In addition, OSC attorneys should consult their applicable state bar rules of professional conduct.
(c)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted by the DAEO or ADAEO upon a determination that the outside employment or activity is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.
(d)
Implementation guidance.
The DAEO or ADAEO may issue internal instructions governing the submission
of requests for approval of outside employment or activity. The instructions may exempt categories of employment or activities from the prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that those categories generally would be approved and are not likely to involve prohibited conduct or create an appearance of lack of impartiality.

§ 10300.101
General.
(a)
Purpose.
In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), other than special government employees as defined in 5 CFR 2635.102(l), and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch in 5 CFR part 2635 (Office of Government Ethics (OGE) Standards).
(b)
Cross-references.
In addition to the standards in 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, FMCS employees are required to comply with implementing guidance and procedures issued by the FMCS in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105(c). FMCS employees are also subject to the regulations concerning executive branch financial disclosures contained in 5 CFR part 2634, the regulations concerning executive branch financial interests contained in 5 CFR part 2640, regulations concerning post-employment restrictions contained in 5 CFR part 2641, and the regulations concerning executive branch employee responsibilities and conduct contained in 5 CFR part 735. Employees should contact an FMCS ethics official if they have questions about any provision of this regulation or other ethics-related matters.
§ 10300.102
Definitions.
For purposes of this part:
Outside employment or activity
means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship, compensated or uncompensated, involving the provision of personal services by the employee. It includes, but is not limited to:
(1) Personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, professor, speaker, or writer.
(2) Active participation, including voluntary participation as defined in 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1)(v), with a prohibited source.
(3) It does not include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service, or civic organization, unless such activities are for compensation other than reimbursement of expenses; such activities involve the provision of professional services or advice; or the organization's activities are devoted substantially to matters relating to the employee's official duties as defined in 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)(i)(B) through (E).

# Note 1 to § 10300.102.
There is a special approval requirement set out in both 18 U.S.C. 203(d) and 205(e) for certain representational activities otherwise covered by the conflict-of-interest restrictions on compensation and activities of employees in claims against and other matters affecting the Government. Thus, an employee who wishes to act as an agent or attorney for, or otherwise represent the employee's parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or any estate for which, the employee is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary in such matters, must obtain the approval required by law of the government official responsible for the employee's appointment, in addition to the regulatory approval required in this section.
§ 10300.103
Prior approval for outside employment and outside activities.
(a)
General requirement.
Before engaging in any outside employment or outside activity, as it is defined in § 10300.102, an employee of the FMCS, other than a special government employee, must obtain written approval.
(b)
Procedure for requesting approval.
The employee must first obtain written
approval from the employee's immediate supervisor and then the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO). If the employee does not obtain written approval from the employee's immediate supervisor, the employee may request review by the DAEO. Decisions by the DAEO are final and non-appealable.
(c)
Standard for approval.
Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment or outside activity is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.
(d)
Revised requests.
Upon a significant change in the nature or scope of the outside employment or outside activity or in the employee's official position with the FMCS, the employee must, within 7 calendar days of the change, submit a revised request for approval. If there are no significant changes in the nature or scope of the outside employment or outside activity or in the employee's official position with the FMCS, the employee does not need to reapply after the FMCS' initial approval.
(e)
Implementation guidance.
The DAEO may issue instructions or manual issuances governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment or outside activities. The instructions or manual issuances may exempt categories of employment and activities from the prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that employment or activity within those categories of employment or activities would generally be approved and is not likely to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635. The DAEO may include in these instructions or issuances examples of outside employment and activities that are permissible or impermissible consistent with this part and 5 CFR part 2635.

# Subpart A—Freedom of Information Act Policies and Procedures
§ 10400.1
Purpose and scope.
The regulations in this part prescribe procedures by which individuals may obtain access to agency records of the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, as well as the procedures IPEC must follow in response to requests for records under the FOIA. The regulations should be read together with the FOIA and the “Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines” issued by the Office of Management and Budget. All requests for access to information contained within a system of records pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, shall be processed in accordance with these regulations. Nothing in this part shall be construed to entitle any person to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA or the Privacy Act.
§ 10400.2
The Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator—organization and functions.
The Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator was created by Title III of the Pro IP Act of 2008, 15 U.S.C. 8111
et seq.
The mission of IPEC is to advise the President and coordinate with Cabinet departments and agencies on the development of the United States' overall intellectual property policy and strategy, to promote innovation and creativity, and to ensure effective intellectual property protection and enforcement, domestically and abroad. IPEC is headed by the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator.
§ 10400.3
Definitions.
For the purpose of this part, all the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act apply.
Commercial use request
is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. IPEC's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. IPEC will notify requesters of their placement in this category.
Direct costs
means the expenses (excluding overhead) actually expended for searching, reviewing (for commercial-use requests), or duplicating in response to a FOIA request. Direct costs
include 116% of the salary of the employee performing work (
i.e.,
the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners.
Disclose
and
disclosure
refer to making records available, upon request, for examination and copying, or furnishing a copy of records.
Duplicate
and
duplication
mean the process of making a copy of a document. Such copies may take the form of paper, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation.
Educational institution
is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at the educational institution. IPEC may seek verification from the requester that the request furthers scholarly research, and IPEC will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
Fee waiver
means the waiver or reduction of processing fees if a requester can demonstrate that certain statutory standards are satisfied, including that the information is in the public interest and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
FOIA public liaison
means a supervisory agency official who assists requesters in reducing processing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.
Noncommercial scientific institution
is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. IPEC will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
OGIS
means the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration. OGIS offers FOIA dispute resolution services, which is a voluntary process. If IPEC agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, IPEC will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
Records
and any other terms used in this part in reference to information includes any information that would be an agency record subject to the requirements of this part when maintained in any format, including electronic format.
Representative of the news media
and
news media requester
is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or information that would be of interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; IPEC can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. IPEC will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
Request
means a letter or other written communication seeking records or information under FOIA.
Requester category
means one of the four categories that IPEC will place requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be
charged fees for search, review, and duplication. The categories are: commercial use requests; requests by non-commercial scientific or educational institutions; news media requesters; and all other requesters.
Review
means the process of examining documents that are located during a search to determine if any portion should lawfully be withheld. It is the process of determining disclosability. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 10400.18, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
Search
is the process of looking for, manually or by automated means, agency records for the purpose of locating those records responsive to a request.
Working day
means a Federal working day, and thus does not include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays.
§ 10400.4
Access to information.
The Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator makes available information pertaining to matters issued, adopted, or promulgated by IPEC, that are within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Such “reading room” information is located at
https://www.whitehouse.gov/ipec.
Included in that information are IPEC's proactive disclosures. Proactive disclosures are records that have been requested three or more times, or that have been released to a requester and that IPEC determines have become, or are likely to become, the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records.
§ 10400.5
Records requiring consultation, referral, and coordination.
Requests for records that are in IPEC's custody, and for which other agencies (or other Federal Government offices) have an interest, shall be reviewed by IPEC. IPEC will then either consult with the other agencies or offices regarding the records; refer the records to the other agencies for further processing; or coordinate with the other agencies when a referral is not appropriate.
(a)
Consultation.
When records originated with IPEC, and contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, IPEC will consult with that agency or office prior to making a release determination.
(b)
Referral
—(1)
Determination.
When IPEC believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, IPEC will refer to that agency the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if IPEC and the originating agency jointly agree that IPEC is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.
(2)
Documentation.
Whenever IPEC refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, IPEC must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.
(3)
Coordination.
The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. In order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, IPEC will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. IPEC will convey, to the
requester, the release determination for the record.
(c)
Classified information.
On receipt of any request involving classified information, IPEC must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, IPEC will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever a record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), IPEC will refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.
(d)
Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.
IPEC will handle all consultations and referrals received by IPEC according to the date that the (consulting or referring) agency received the perfected FOIA request.
(e)
Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.
IPEC may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.
§ 10400.6
How to request records—form and content.
(a) A request for records must describe the records that it seeks in sufficient detail and in writing to enable IPEC to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, each request must reasonably describe the record(s) sought, including by referencing the type of document; a specific event or action; the title or name, author, recipient, subject matter, date or time period, and/or location of the record; and any other pertinent data that would assist in identifying the record(s) sought. If after receiving a request IPEC determines that the request does not reasonably describe the record(s) sought, IPEC will inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Before or after submitting their requests, requesters may contact IPEC's FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the record(s) they seek and for assistance in describing the record(s).
(b)(1) If an individual is making a request for records that are about the individual, the requester must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in § 10400.21(f).
(2) If a request for records pertains to a third party, the requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or an unsworn declaration under 26 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester. As an exercise of administrative discretion, IPEC may require the requester to provide additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure. If the records that are requested pertain to an individual who is deceased, the requester should submit proof of death such as a copy of the death certificate or an obituary.
(c) Requesters may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records they seek. IPEC will accommodate formatting requests if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.
(d) Whenever it is appropriate to do so, IPEC automatically processes a Privacy Act request for access to records under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA, following the rules contained in this part. IPEC processes a request under both the FOIA and Privacy Act so that requesters will receive the maximum amount of information available by law.
(e) Requests must be received by IPEC through methods specified on the FOIA page of IPEC's website:
https://www.whitehouse.gov/ipec.
Requests may be emailed at any time to
ipecfoia@ipec.eop.gov
or mailed to Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, Executive Office of the President, Washington, DC 20503, Attn: FOIA Officer. Emailed requests are strongly preferred.
(f) The words “FOIA REQUEST” or “REQUEST FOR RECORDS” should be clearly marked on all FOIA request communications.
(g) The requester must provide contact information, such as the requester's phone number, email address or mailing address, so that IPEC will be able to communicate with the requester about the request and provide released records. If IPEC cannot contact the requester, or the requester does not respond within 30 working days to our request for clarification, IPEC will close the request.
(h) To protect our computer systems, IPEC reserves the right to not open attachments to emailed requests. Please include the request within the body of the email, along with such additional information that is relevant, such as information in support of a request for expedited processing, for a fee categorization, or for a fee waiver. If after receiving a request IPEC determines that it does not include sufficient information on which to grant, or deny, a request for expedited process, a fee categorization, or a fee waiver, IPEC will so inform the requester and provide the requester an opportunity to submit additional information in support of such request.
§ 10400.7
Responses—form and content.
(a)
Determinations.
(1) In determining which records are responsive to a request, IPEC will include only records that were in its possession as of the date of the search. If any other date is used, IPEC will inform the requester of that date.
(2) Under the FOIA, an agency is to make an initial determination acknowledging and granting, partially granting, or denying a request for records within 20 working days after the agency receives a FOIA request (an agency may extend this period for “unusual circumstances”;
see
§ 10400.9). The FOIA Officer or designee will determine whether to grant the request and will provide written notification to the person making the request. The notification shall also advise the person making the request of any fees assessed under §§ 10400.11 through 10400.16. IPEC will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison.
(b)
Tracking number.
IPEC will assign a request an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process the request. IPEC may assign, at our discretion, such a tracking number for a request that will take less than 10 working days to process.
(c)
Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.
Upon request, IPEC will provide an estimated date by which IPEC expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, IPEC may provide interim responses, including on a rolling basis.
(d)
Use of record exclusions.
A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request. In the event that IPEC identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), IPEC will confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion, and IPEC will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.
(e)
Adverse determinations.
If IPEC makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it must notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.
(f)
Content of denial.
The denial must be signed by the FOIA Officer or designee and must include:
(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the agency in denying the request;
(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;
(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the FOIA Appeals Officer (the IPEC Legal Advisor or a designee) within 90 calendar days of the date of the response (the requirements for making an appeal are specified in § 10400.10); and
(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the IPEC's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.
§ 10400.8
Expedited and multi-track processing, and aggregation of requests for processing.
(a)
Expedited processing.
(1) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. IPEC must process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:
(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally, and the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.
(2) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person who is primarily engaged in information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. The formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative discretion.
(3) Within 10 calendar days of IPEC's receipt of a request for expedited processing, IPEC will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited processing is granted, the request will be given priority and will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.
(b)
Multi-track processing.
IPEC will ordinarily respond to requests in order of their receipt. However, IPEC may use multi-track processing in responding to requests. Multi-track processing means placing requests in a track based on the estimated amount of work or time involved in processing the request. Thus, simple requests that require a limited review would be placed in one processing track, and more voluminous and complex requests would be placed in other processing tracks. Requests in each track are processed on a first-in, first-out basis and, if a request is placed in a track, IPEC will inform the requester of the track placement. Track one is for requests that have received expedited processing under this section. Track two is for requests of simple-to-moderate complexity that do not involve voluminous records and do not require consultation or coordination with other entities or submitter review under § 10400.18. Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records, require lengthy or numerous consultations or coordination, raise unique or novel legal questions, or require submitter review under § 10400.18. In the case of requests in tracks two and three, IPEC may provide requesters the opportunity to
limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing. IPEC will do so by contacting the requester by letter, telephone, email, or facsimile (whichever is more efficient in each case). When providing a requester with the opportunity to limit the scope of a request, IPEC shall also advise the requester of IPEC's FOIA Public Liaison to aid in the resolution of any dispute arising between the requester and IPEC as well as the requester's right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.
(c)
Aggregating requests.
IPEC may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, involve related matters and constitute a single request that otherwise would involve “unusual circumstances” under § 10400.9. For example, IPEC may aggregate multiple requests for similar information filed by a single requester within a short period of time. In addition, as discussed in § 10400.16, IPEC may aggregate requests for fee purposes.
§ 10400.9
Extension of time.
(a) In unusual circumstances, IPEC may extend the time limits prescribed in §§ 10400.7 and 10400.8 by written notice to the FOIA requester. The notice will state the reasons for the extension.
(b) The phrase “unusual circumstances” means:
(1) The requested records are located in establishments that are separated from the office processing the request;
(2) A single request seeks a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records; or
(3) Another agency has a substantial interest in the determination of the request.
(c) Whenever IPEC cannot meet the 20 working-day time limit under § 10400.7 for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” and IPEC extends the time limit on that basis, IPEC shall promptly notify the requester (before the expiration of the 20 working-day period) in writing of the unusual circumstances involved, that an extension of 10 working days has been made, and of the date by which IPEC estimates that it will complete the processing of the request (if completion is not estimated to occur within the 10 working-day extension period). For those requests for which the extension exceeds 10 working days, IPEC will provide the requester an opportunity to modify the request (so that it may be processed within an extension of 10 working days) or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. IPEC will make available its designated FOIA contact or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. IPEC will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.
§ 10400.10
Appeal procedures.
(a) An appeal to the IPEC must explain the reasoning and factual basis for the appeal. It must be received by email at
ipecfoia@ipec.eop.gov
or another method specified on the FOIA page of IPEC's website within 90 calendar days of the date of the response. The appeal must be in writing, addressed to the FOIA Appeals Officer, Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, Executive Office of the President, Washington, DC 20503, Attn: Legal Advisor. The communication should clearly be labeled as a “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”
(b) The FOIA Appeals Officer (the Legal Advisor or a designee) will decide the appeal within 20 working days. If the FOIA Appeals Officer denies an appeal in whole or in part, the written determination will contain the reason for the denial, the name and title of the person responsible for the denial, any FOIA exemptions applied, and the provisions for judicial review of the denial and ruling on appeal provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). The denial will also inform the requestor of the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS as a non-exclusive alternate to litigation. If IPEC agrees to participate in voluntary dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
§ 10400.11
Fees to be charged—general.
IPEC will assess a fee to process FOIA requests in accordance with the provisions of this section and the “Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines” issued by the Office of Management and Budget. IPEC shall ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. IPEC will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under § 10400.15, or the total fee to be charged is less than $25.00. IPEC will notify the requester if IPEC estimates that charges will exceed $25.00 including a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication and whether applicable entitlements to duplication and search at no charge have been provided. IPEC will not process the request until the requester either commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees that it is willing to pay.
(a)
Search for records.
IPEC will charge $77.00 per hour, which is a blended hourly rate for all personnel that respond to FOIA requests plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits.
(b)
Review of records.
IPEC will charge $77.00 per hour, which is a blended hourly rate for all personnel that responded to FOIA requests plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits. Records or portions of records withheld under an exemption subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed to determine the applicability of exemptions not considered. The cost for a subsequent review is assessable.
(c)
Duplication of records.
IPEC will charge duplication fees to all requesters. IPEC will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular format if IPEC can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. If IPEC provides photocopies, IPEC will make one copy per request at the cost of $.10 per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks or other media, IPEC will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where IPEC must scan paper documents in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, IPEC will charge the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, IPEC will charge the direct costs. IPEC will provide the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media) without charge except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use.
(d)
Other charges.
IPEC will recover the costs of providing other services such as certifying records or sending records by special methods.
§ 10400.12
Fees to be charged—miscellaneous provisions.
(a) Payment for FOIA services may be made by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States. IPEC will provide the requester with instructions on how to make the payment. IPEC will provide a receipt for fees paid upon request. IPEC will not refund fees paid for services actually rendered.
(b) IPEC may require advance payment (or a satisfactory written assurance of full payment) where the estimated fee exceeds $250, or a requester previously failed to pay within 30 calendar days of the billing date. IPEC will not process the request until the requester either makes the advance payment or provides a satisfactory written assurance.
(c) IPEC may assess interest charges beginning the 31st day of billing. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of Title 31, United States Code, and will accrue from the date of the billing.
(d) IPEC may assess search charges where records are not located or where records are exempt from disclosure.
§ 10400.13
Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.
(a) For fees, there are four categories of FOIA requesters: commercial use requests; educational and non-commercial scientific institution requests; requests from representatives of the news media; and all other requesters.
(b) The specific levels of fees for each of these categories are:
(1)
Commercial use request.
IPEC will recover the full direct cost of providing search, review, and duplication services. Commercial use requests will not
receive free search-time or free duplication of documents.
(2)
Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requests.
IPEC will charge the cost of duplication, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. Requesters must demonstrate the request is authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought for scholarly or scientific research not a commercial use.
(3)
Requests from representatives of the news media.
IPEC will charge the cost of duplication, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. Requesters must meet the criteria in § 10400.3, and the request must not be made for a commercial use. A request that supports the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered a commercial use.
(4)
All other requesters.
IPEC will recover the full direct cost of the search and the duplication of records, excluding the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time.
§ 10400.14
Restrictions on charging fees.
(a) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.
(b) If IPEC fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in § 10400.13(b)(2) and (3), may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
(c) If IPEC determines that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.
(d) If IPEC determines that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the agency may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in § 10400.13(b)(2) and (3), may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken. IPEC must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and the agency must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, IPEC may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.
(e) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
(f) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.
(g) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.
§ 10400.15
Waiver or reduction of fees.
Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees:
(a) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(b) IPEC must furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In deciding whether this standard is satisfied the agency must consider the factors described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section:
(1) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
(2) Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:
(i) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
(ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. IPEC will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
