§ 1.9001-1
Change from retirement to straight-line method of computing depreciation.
(a)
In general.
The Retirement-Straight Line Adjustment Act of 1958 (72 Stat. 1669), which is contained in
section 94 of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, approved September 2, 1958, provides various adjustments to be made by certain railroads which changed from the retirement to the straight-line method of computing the allowance of deductions for the depreciation of those roadway assets which are defined in this section as retirement-straight line property. The adjustments are available to all eligible taxpayers who make an irrevocable election to have the provisions of the Retirement-Straight Line Adjustment Act of 1958 apply. This election shall be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by this section. If an election is made in accordance with this section, then the provisions of the Act and of §§ 1.9001 to 1.9001-4, inclusive, shall apply. An election made in accordance with this section shall not be considered a change in accounting method for purposes of section 481 of the Code.

(2) An election may be made in accordance with the provisions of this section even though the taxpayer has, at the time of election, litigated some or all of the issues covered by the provisions of the Act and has received from the courts a determination which is less favorable to the taxpayer than the treatment provided by the Act. Once an election has been made in accordance with the provisions of this section, the taxpayer may not receive the benefit of more favorable treatment, as a result of litigation, than that provided by the Act on the issues involved.
(3) The election to have the provisions of the Act apply shall be made by filing a statement to that effect, on or before January 11, 1960, with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the taxpayer's income tax return for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1955, was filed.

Subsection (d)(1) of the Act requires an adjustment to be made as of the 1956 adjustment date for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, on all retirement-straight line property held on March 1, 1913, by the taxpayer or a predecessor for which cost was or is claimed as basis and which was either (i) retired before the changeover date by the taxpayer or a predecessor or (ii) held on the changeover date by the taxpayer or a predecessor. This adjustment for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, shall be made in accordance with the conditions and limitations described in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph and shall be allocated, in the manner prescribed in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, among all retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date. The term “cost”, when used in this paragraph with reference to the basis of property, shall be construed to mean the amount paid for the property or, if that amount could not be determined, then such other amount as was accepted by the Commissioner as “cost” for basis purposes.
(2)
Depreciation sustained on property retired before the changeover date.
Pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(A) of the Act,
an adjustment to the basis of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made as of that date for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, on all retirement-straight line property held on March 1, 1913, by the taxpayer or a predecessor for which cost was claimed as the basis and which was retired before the changeover date by the taxpayer or a predecessor, except that:
(i) The adjustment shall be made only if a deduction was allowed in computing net income by reason of the retirement and the deduction so allowed was computed on the basis of the cost of the property unadjusted for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, and
(ii) In the case of any such property retired during any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1929, the adjustment shall not exceed that portion of the amount attributable to depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, which resulted, by reason of the deduction so allowed, in a reduction of taxes under the Code or under prior income, war-profits or excess-profits tax laws.
(3)
Depreciation sustained on property held on the changeover date.
Pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(B) of the Act, an adjustment to the basis of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made as of that date for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, on all retirement-straight line property held on March 1, 1913, by the taxpayer or a predecessor for which cost was or is claimed as basis and which was held on the changeover date by the taxpayer or a predecessor. This subparagraph shall not apply, however, to any such property which (i) was disposed of on or after the changeover date by reason of sale, casualty, or abnormal retirement in the nature of special obsolescence, and (ii) is property to which paragraph (c) of this section and subsection (d)(2) of the Act apply.
(4)
Manner of allocating adjustment.
Pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of the Act, the amount of the adjustment required under this paragraph for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, which is attributable to a particular kind or class of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made with respect to that kind or class of such property. If the adjustment required under this paragraph for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, is attributable to retirement-straight property of a particular kind or class no longer held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date, then the part of the adjustment to be allocated to any retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the adjustment as the unadjusted basis of the property so held bears to the entire unadjusted basis of all retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date.
(c)
Adjustment for part of terms-letter reserve applicable to property disposed of on or after changeover date and before 1956 adjustment date.
Pursuant to subsection (d)(2) of the Act, an adjustment to the basis of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made as of that date for that part of the terms-letter reserve which was applicable to any retirement-straight line property disposed of by sale, casualty, or abnormal retirement in the nature of special obsolescence, but only if the sale occurred in, or a deduction by reason of such casualty or abnormal retirement was allowed for Federal income-tax purposes for a period on or after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date. This paragraph shall apply even though, in computing the adjusted basis of the property for purposes of determining gain or loss on the sale, casualty, or abnormal retirement, the basis of the retirement-straight line property was not reduced by the part of the terms-letter reserve applicable to the property. If necessary, the adjustment required by this paragraph shall be allocated, in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, among all retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date.
(d)
Adjustment for depreciation allowable under the terms-letter for periods on and after the changeover date and before the 1956 adjustment date.
Pursuant to
subsection (d)(3) of the Act, an adjustment to the basis of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made as of that date for the entire amount of depreciation allowable under the terms-letter for all periods on and after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date. This adjustment shall include all such depreciation allowable with respect to any retirement-straight line property which was disposed of on or after the changeover date and before the 1956 adjustment date.
(e)
Illustration of basis adjustments required for taxable years beginning on or after the 1956 adjustment date.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example, which is based upon the assumption that multiple asset accounts are used:

# Example.
(1) Assume that on its changeover date, January 1, 1943, the taxpayer or its predecessor held retirement-straight line property with an unadjusted cost basis of $10,000. The terms-letter reserve established as of January 1, 1943, with respect to such property was $3,000. Depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, on retirement-straight line property held on that date by the taxpayer or its predecessor, for which cost was or is claimed as basis, amounts to $800. Of this total depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, $200 is attributable to retirement-straight line property retired before January 1, 1943, under circumstances requiring the adjustment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and $600 is attributable to retirement-straight line property held on January 1, 1943, by the taxpayer or its predecessor. On December 31, 1954, retirement-straight line property costing $1,500 was permanently retired under circumstances giving rise to an abnormal retirement in the nature of special obsolescence. The terms-letter reserve applicable to this retired property was $450, of which $120 represents depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913. On December 31, 1954, retirement-straight line property costing $1,000 was also permanently retired under circumstances giving rise to a normal retirement. None of the property retired on December 31, 1954, had any market or salvage value on that date. Depreciation allowable under the terms-letter on retirement-straight line property for all periods on and after January 1, 1943, and before January 1, 1956 (the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date), amounts to $2,155, of which $345 is applicable to the property retired as an abnormal retirement.
(2) The reserve for depreciation as of January 1, 1956, contains a credit balance of $3,360, determined as follows but without regard to the Act:
(i) Credits to reserve:
Terms-letter reserve as of January 1, 1943

(5) The $6,010 adjusted basis as of January 1, 1956, of the retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on that date is to be recovered over the estimated remaining useful life of that property. The remaining useful life of the property will be reviewed regularly, and appropriate adjustments in the rates will be made as necessary in order to spread the remaining cost less estimated salvage over the estimated remaining useful life of the property. See § 1.167(a)-1.
§ 1.9001-3
Basis adjustments for taxable years between changeover date and 1956 adjustment date.
(a)
In general.
(1) Subsection (e) of the Act provides the adjustments required to be made in determining the adjusted basis of any retirement-straight line property as of any time on or after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date. This adjusted basis shall be used for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for taxable years beginning on or after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date, except as provided in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. The adjustments so required, which are set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, shall not be used in determining the adjusted basis of property for taxable years beginning before the changeover date or on or after the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date.
(2) In order to arrive at the adjusted basis as of any specific date occurring on or after the changeover date and before the 1956 adjustment date, the taxpayer shall start with the unadjusted basis of all retirement-straight line property held on the changeover date by the taxpayer or its predecessor and shall, as of that specific date and with respect to both the asset and reserve accounts, (i) make the adjustments prescribed by this section and subsection (e) of the Act and (ii) also make those adjustments required, in accordance with the method of accounting regularly used, for additions, retirements, and other dispositions of property. For an illustration of adjustments required in accordance with the method of accounting regularly used, see the example in paragraph (d) of this section.
(3) The adjustments required by subsection (e) of the Act shall be made in lieu of the adjustments for depreciation otherwise required by section 1016(a) (2) and (3) of the Code and by the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws.
(4) Although this section, and subsection (e) of the Act, shall apply in determining the excess-profits tax, they shall not apply in determining adjusted basis for the purpose of computing equity capital for any day under section 437(c) (relating to the Excess Profits Tax Act of 1950) (64 Stat. 1137) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. For the adjustments to be made in computing equity capital under such section, see paragraph (c) of § 1.9001-4.
(b)
Adjustment for terms-letter reserve.
Pursuant to subsection (e)(1) of the Act, the basis of any retirement-
straight line property shall be adjusted, as of any specific applicable date occurring on or after the changeover date and before the 1956 adjustment date, for the amount of the terms-letter reserve applicable to such property.
(c)
Adjustment for depreciation allowable under the terms-letter.
Pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of the Act, the basis of any retirement-straight line property shall be adjusted, as of any specific applicable date occurring on or after the changeover date and before the 1956 adjustment date, for depreciation applicable to such property and allowable under the terms-letter.
(d)
Illustration of basis adjustments required for taxable years beginning on or after the changeover date and before the 1956 adjustment date.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example, which is based upon the assumption that multiple asset accounts are used:

# Example.
(1) The facts are assumed to be the same as those in the example under paragraph (e) of § 1.9001-2, except that the adjusted basis of retirement-straight line property is determined as of January 1, 1955, and the depreciation allowable under the terms-letter from the changeover date to December 31, 1954, is $2,100.
(2) The adjusted basis on January 1, 1955, of the retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on that date is $4,195, determined as follows and in accordance with this section:

Statutory provisions; Dealer Reserve Income Adjustment Act of 1960 (74 Stat. 124).
Section 1.
Short title.
This Act may be cited as the “Dealer Reserve Income Adjustment Act of 1960”.
Sec. 2.
Persons to whom this Act applies.
This Act shall apply to any person who, for his most recent taxable year ending on or before June 22, 1959:
(1) Computed, or was required to compute, taxable income under an accrual method of accounting.
(2) Treated any dealer reserve income, which should have been taken into account (under the accrual method of accounting) for such taxable year, as accruable for a subsequent taxable year, and
(3) Before September 1, 1960, makes an election under section 3(a) or 4(a) of this Act.
Sec. 3.
Election to have section 481 apply—(a) General rule.
If:
(1) For the year of the change (determined under subsection (b)), the treatment of dealer reserve income by any person to whom this Act applies is changed to a method proper under the accrual method of accounting (whether or not such person initiated the change),
(2) Such person makes an election under this subsection, and
(3) Such person does not make the election provided by section 4(a),
then, for purposes of section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the change described in paragraph (1) shall be treated as a change in method of accounting not initiated by the taxpayer.
(b)
Year of change, etc.
In applying section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for purposes of this section, the “year of the change” in the case of any person is:
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the first taxable year ending after June 22, 1959, or
(2) The earliest taxable year (whether the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies to such year) for which:
(A) On or before June 22, 1959:
(i) The Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate issued a notice of deficiency, or a written notice of a proposed deficiency, with respect to dealer reserve income, or
(ii) Such person filed with the Secretary or his delegate a claim for refund or credit with respect to dealer reserve income, and

For purposes of this section, section 481 of such Code shall be treated as applying to any year of the change to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies.
Sec. 4.
Election to have section 481 not apply; payment in installments
—(a)
General rule.
If a person to whom this Act applies makes an election under this subsection, then for purposes of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and the corresponding provisions of prior law) a change in the treatment of dealer reserve income to a method proper under the accrual method of accounting shall be treated as not a change in method of accounting in respect of which section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies. Any election under this subsection shall apply to all taxable years ending on or before June 22, 1959 (whether the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the corresponding provisions of prior law apply), for which the assessment of any deficiency, or
for which refund or credit of any overpayment, whichever is applicable, was not, on June 21, 1959, prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law.
(b)
Election to pay tax in installments
—(1)
Eligibility.
If the net increase in tax (as defined in paragraph (2)) which results solely from the effect of the election provided by subsection (a) exceeds $2,500, then the taxpayer may elect (at the time the election is made under subsection (a)) to pay in two or more (but not to exceed 10) equal annual installments any portion of such net increase which (on the date of such election) is unpaid.
(2)
Net increase in tax defined.
For purposes of this section, the term “net increase in tax” means the amount (if any) by which:
(A) The sum of the increases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election applies and which is attributable to the election, exceeds
(B) The sum of the decreases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election applies and which is attributable to the election.
For purposes of this paragraph, interest for the period before the date of the election shall be computed as provided in Chapter 67 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws).
(c)
Due date for installments.
If an election is made under subsection (b), the first installment shall be paid on or before the date prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for payment of the tax for the taxable year in which the election was made, and each succeeding installment shall be paid on or before the date which is one year after the date prescribed by this subsection for payment of the preceding installment.
(d)
Effect of subsequent redetermination of tax
—(1)
Redetermination.
If:
(A) The taxpayer makes an election under subsection (b), and
(B) There is a redetermination of the taxpayer's tax for any taxable year to which the election provided by subsection (a) applies,
then the net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2) shall be redetermined.
(2)
Effect of increase.
If the redetermination described in paragraph (1)(B) results in an increase in the net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2)), the resulting increase shall be prorated to all the installments. The part of such resulting increase so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has not arrived shall be collected at the same time as, and as a part of, such installment. The part of such resulting increase so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has arrived shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.
(3)
Effect of decrease.
For treatment of a decrease in the net increase in tax as the result of a redetermination described in paragraph (1)(B), see section 6403 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to overpayment of installment).
(e)
Suspension of interest
—(1)
In general.
If an election under subsection (a) applies and there is a net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2)), no interest shall be imposed on any underpayment (and no interest shall be paid on any overpayment) attributable to such election for the period beginning on the date of such election and ending on the date prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for payment of the tax for the taxable year in which the election was made.
(2)
No interest during installment period.
If an election under subsection (b) applies, no interest shall be imposed for the period on or after the date fixed for payment of the first installment unless payment of unpaid installments is accelerated under subsection (f) or (g).
(3)
Interest where payment is accelerated.
If payment is accelerated under subsection (f) or (g), interest determined in accordance with the provisions of section 6601 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 on the entire unpaid tax shall be payable:

(B) If payment is accelerated under subsection (g), from the date fixed for paying the unpaid installment to the date such tax is paid.
(f)
Termination of installment payment privilege.
The extension of time provided by this section for payment of tax shall cease to apply, and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, if:
(1) In the case of a taxpayer who is an individual, he dies or ceases to engage in a trade or business,
(2) In the case of a taxpayer who is a partner, the entire interest of such partner is transferred or liquidated or the partnership terminates, or
(3) In the case of a taxpayer which is a corporation, the taxpayer ceases to engage in a trade or business, unless the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments is required to be taken into account by the acquiring corporation under section 5(d).
(g)
Failure to pay installment.
If any installment under this section is not paid on or before the date fixed for its payment by this section (including any extension of time for payment of such installment), the unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.
(h)
Suspension of running of periods of limitation.
The running of the periods of limitation provided by section 6502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or corresponding provision of prior law) for the collection of any amount of tax payable in installments under this section shall be suspended for the period of any extension of time for payment granted under this section.

[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8369, Sept. 1, 1960]
§ 1.9002-1
Purpose, applicability, and definitions.
(a)
In general.
The Dealer Reserve Income Adjustment Act of 1960 (74 Stat. 124) contains transitional provisions relating to adjustments to income resulting from a change in the income tax treatment of dealer reserve income. The purpose of the Act is to provide eligible taxpayers who elect to have its provisions apply with two alternatives for accounting for the adjustments to income resulting from a change to a proper method of reporting dealer reserve income. The Act also provides certain taxpayers with an election to pay in installments any net increase in tax. Eligible taxpayers must make any election under the provisions of the Act prior to September 1, 1960. If any election is made, then the applicable provisions of the Act and §§ 1.9002-1 to 1.9002-8, inclusive, shall apply.
(b)
Eligibility to elect.
In order to be eligible to make any of the elections provided by the Act, a taxpayer must
have, for his most recent taxable year ending on or before June 22, 1959, (1) computed, or been required to compute, taxable income under an accrual method of accounting, and (2) treated dealer reserve income (or portions thereof) which should have been taken into account (under the accrual method of accounting) for such most recent taxable year as accruable for a subsequent taxable year. Thus, the elections provided by the Act are not available to a person who, for his most recent taxable year ending on or before June 22, 1959, reported dealer reserve income under a method proper under the accrual method of accounting or who was not required to compute taxable income under the accrual method of accounting. An election may be made even though the taxpayer is litigating his liability for income tax based upon his treatment of dealer reserve income, whether in The Tax Court of the United States or any other court, and an election filed by a taxpayer who is litigating his liability for income tax based upon his treatment of dealer reserve income does not constitute a waiver of his right to continue pending litigation until final judicial determination. He must, however, comply with the provisions of the Act and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Definitions.
For purposes of the Act and §§ 1.9002-1 to 1.9002-8, inclusive:
(1)
The Act.
The term
the Act
means the Dealer Reserve Income Adjustment Act of 1960 (74 Stat. 124).
(2)
Dealer reserve income.
The term
dealer reserve income
means:
(i) That part of the consideration derived by any person from the sale or other disposition of customers' sales contracts, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness (or derived from customers' finance charges connected with such sales or other dispositions) which is:
(
a
) Attributable to the sale by such person to such customers, in the ordinary course of his trade or business, of real property or tangible personal property, and
(
b
) Held in a reserve account, by the financial institution to which such person disposed of such evidences of indebtedness, for the purpose of securing obligations of such person or of such customers, or both; and
(ii) That part of the consideration:
(
a
) Derived by any person from a sale described in subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph in respect of which part or all of the purchase price of the property sold is provided by a financial institution to or for the customer to whom such property is sold, or
(
b
) Derived by such person from finance charges connected with the financing of such sale, which is held in a reserve account by such financial institution for the purpose of securing obligations of such person or of such customer, or both. Thus, the term includes amounts held in a reserve account by a financial institution in transactions in which the customer becomes obligated to the institution as well as such amounts so held by a financial institution in transactions in which the taxpayer is the obligee on the contract, note, or other evidence of indebtedness. For purposes of the definition of the term “dealer reserve income” it is immaterial whether or not the taxpayer guarantees the customer's obligation in excess of the reserve retained by the financial institution. The term does not include the consideration derived from transactions relating to the sale of intangible property such as stocks, bonds, copyrights, patents, etc. Further, the term does not include consideration derived by the taxpayer from transactions relating to the sale of property by a person not the taxpayer or to casual sales of property not in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
(3)
Financial institution.
The term
financial institution
means any person regularly engaged in the business of acquiring evidences of indebtedness of the kind described in section 5(a)(1) of the Act, or of financing sales of the kind described in section 5(a)(2) of the Act, or both. It thus includes banking institutions, finance companies, building and loan associations, and other similar type organizations, as well as an individual or partnership regularly engaged in the described business.
(4)
Taxpayer.
The term
taxpayer
means any person to whom the Act applies.
(5)
Other terms.
All other terms which are not specifically defined shall have the same meaning as when used in the Code except where otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly intended.
[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8371, Sept. 1, 1960]
§ 1.9002-2
Election to have the provisions of section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 apply.
(a)
In general.
Section 3(a) of the Act provides that if the income tax treatment of dealer reserve income by the taxpayer is changed (whether or not such change is initiated by the taxpayer) to a proper method under the accrual method of accounting, then the taxpayer may elect to have such change treated as a change in method of accounting not initiated by the taxpayer to which the provisions of section 481 of the Code apply. This election may be made only when the alternative election under section 4(a) of the Act has not been exercised.
(b)
Year of change.
Where an election has been made under section 3(a) of the Act to have section 481 of the Code apply, then for purposes of applying section 481 of the Code the year of change shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 3(b) of the Act. Section 3(b) provides that the year of change is the earlier of (1) the first taxable year ending after June 22, 1959, or (2) the earliest taxable year for which, on or before June 22, 1959,
(i) There was issued a notice of deficiency or written notice of a proposed deficiency attributable to the erroneous treatment of dealer reserve income, or
(ii) The taxpayer filed a claim for refund or credit with respect to the treatment of such income,
and in respect of which the assessment of any deficiency, or the refund or credit of any overpayment, was not prevented on June 21, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The written notice of proposed deficiency includes a 15- or 30-day letter issued under established procedure or other similar written notification.
(c)
Application to pre-1954 Code years.
If the earliest year described in paragraph (b) of this section is a year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 in respect of which assessment of any deficiency or refund or credit of any overpayment was not prevented on June 21, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law, section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall be treated as applying in the same manner it would have applied had it been enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
(d)
Examples.
The operation of this section in determining the year of change may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
D, a taxpayer on the calendar year basis who employs the accrual method of accounting, voluntarily changed to the proper method of accounting for dealer reserve income for the taxable year 1959. A statutory notice of deficiency, however, was issued prior to June 23, 1959, relating to the erroneous treatment of such income for the taxable year 1956, which was the earliest taxable year in respect of which assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment was not prevented on June 21, 1959. Prior to September 1, 1960, D properly exercises his election under section 3 of the Act to have the change in the treatment of dealer reserve income treated as a change in method of accounting not initiated by the taxpayer to which section 481 of the Code applies. Under these facts, 1956 is the year of the change for purposes of applying section 481. Accordingly, the net amount of any adjustment found necessary as a result of the change in the treatment of dealer reserve income which is attributable to taxable years subject to the 1954 Code shall be taken into account for the year of change in accordance with section 481. The net amount of the adjustments attributable to pre-1954 Code years is to be disregarded. The income of each taxable year succeeding the year of change in respect of which the assessment of any deficiency or refund or credit of any overpayment is not prevented will be recomputed under the proper method of accounting initiated by the change.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as set forth in example (1), except that no notice of a proposed deficiency of any type has been issued, and assume further that no claim for refund has been filed. Since there was no earlier year open on June 21, 1959, for which the taxpayer either was notified of a proposed deficiency attributable to the erroneous treatment of dealer reserve income or for which he had filed a claim for refund or credit with respect to the treatment of such income, the year of change is 1959, the first taxable year ending after June 22, 1959. Accordingly, the net amount of any adjustment found necessary as a result of the change in
the treatment of dealer reserve income which is attributable to taxable years subject to the 1954 Code shall be taken into account for the year of the change in accordance with section 481. The net amount of the adjustments attributable to pre-1954 Code years is to be disregarded.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as set forth in example (1), except that a refund claim specifying adjustments relative to dealer reserve income was timely filed for the taxable year 1951, which was the earliest taxable year for which a refund or credit of an overpayment or assessment of a deficiency was not prevented on June 21, 1959. Under this factual situation, the year of change for purposes of applying section 481 would be 1951. Section 481 would be applied to 1951 and be given effect for that year in the same manner as it would have applied had it been enacted as a part of the 1939 Code and as if the change to the proper method of accounting had not been initiated by the taxpayer. Any adjustment with regard to dealer reserve income attributable to pre-1951 years is disregarded. The income of each taxable year succeeding the year of change in respect of which the assessment of any deficiency or refund or credit of any overpayment is not prevented will be recomputed under the proper method of accounting initiated by the change.
[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8371, Sept. 1, 1960]
§ 1.9002-3
Election to have the provisions of section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 not apply.
Section 4(a) of the Act provides that in the treatment of dealer reserve income by the taxpayer is changed to a method proper under the accrual method of accounting, then the taxpayer may elect to have such change treated as not a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 apply. This election shall apply to all taxable years ending on or before June 22, 1959, for which the assessment of any deficiency, or for which refund or credit of any overpayment, was not prevented on June 21, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law. This election may be made only if the alternative election under section 3(a) of the Act has not been exercised. If an election is made under section 4(a) of the Act, taxable income (or net income in the case of a taxable year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies) shall be recomputed under a proper method of accounting for dealer reserve income for each taxable year to which the election applies, without regard to section 481.
[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8372, Sept. 1, 1960]
§ 1.9002-4
Election to pay net increase in tax in installments.
(a)
Election.
If an election is made under section 4(a) of the Act and if the net increase in tax determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section exceeds $2,500, the taxpayer may also make an election under section 4(b) of the Act prior to September 1, 1960, to pay any portion of such net increase in tax, unpaid on the date of the election, in 2 or more, but not to exceed 10, equal annual installments. If the taxpayer making the election under section 4(a) of the Act is a partnership or a small business corporation electing under Subchapter S, Chapter 1 of the Code, the determination as to whether the net increase in tax exceeds $2,500 shall be made separately as to each partner or shareholder, respectively, with regard to his individual liability. Thus, if a partnership makes an election under section 4(a) of the Act, and partners A and B had a net increase in tax of $3,000 and $2,000, respectively, as a result of dealer reserve income adjustments to partnership income, partner A may elect under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the net increase in 2 or more, but not exceeding 10, equal annual installments to the extent that such tax was unpaid on the date of the election. Partner B may not make the election since his net increase in tax does not exceed $2,500.
(b)
Net increase in tax.
(1) The term “net increase in tax” means the amount by which the sum of the increases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election under section 4(a) of the Act applies and which is attributable to the election exceeds the sum of the decreases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election under such section applies and which is attributable to the election.
(2) In determining the net increase in tax, the tax and interest for each taxable year to which the election applies is computed by taking into account all adjustments necessary to reflect the change to the proper treatment of dealer reserve income. If the computation
results in additional tax for a taxable year, then interest is computed under section 6601 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) on such additional tax for the taxable year involved from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax for such taxable year to the date the election is made. The interest so computed is then added to the additional tax determined for such taxable year. The sum of these two items (tax plus interest) represents the increase in tax for such taxable year. If the computation of the tax after taking into account the appropriate dealer reserve income adjustments results in a reduction in tax for any taxable year to which the election applies, interest under section 6611 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) is computed from the date of the overpayment of the tax for such year to the date of the election. The amount of the interest so computed is then added to the reduction in tax to determine the total decrease in tax for such year. The net increase in tax is then determined by adding together the total increases in tax for each year to which the election applies and from the resulting total subtracting the sum of the total decreases in tax for each year. If the total increases in tax for all such years do not exceed the total decreases in tax, there is no net increase in tax for purposes of section 4(b) of the Act. For purposes of determining the net increase in tax, net operating losses affecting the computation of tax for any prior taxable year not otherwise affected shall be taken into account.
(c)
Time for paying installments.
If the election under this section is made to pay the unpaid portion of the net increase in tax in installments, the first installment shall be paid on or before the date prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Code for payment of the tax for the taxable year in which such election is made. Each succeeding installment shall be paid on or before the date which is one year after the date prescribed for the payment of the preceding installment.
(d)
Termination of installment privilege
—(1)
For nonpayment of installment.
The extension of time provided by section 4(b) of the Act for payment of the net increase in tax in installments shall terminate, and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the district director if any installment under such section is not paid by the taxpayer on or before the date fixed for its payment, including any extension of time for payment of any such installment.
(2)
For other reasons.
The extension of time provided by section 4(b) of the Act for payment of the net increase in tax in installments shall terminate, and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the district director if:
(i) In the case of an individual, he dies or ceases to engage in any trade or business,
(ii) In the case of a partner, his entire interest in the partnership is transferred or liquidated or the partnership terminates, or
(iii) In the case of a corporation, it ceases to engage in a trade or business, unless the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments is required to be taken into account by an acquiring corporation under section 5(d) of the Act.
The installment privilege is not terminated under this subparagraph even though the taxpayer terminates the trade or business in respect of which the dealer reserve income is attributable provided the taxpayer continues in a trade or business. Further, the privilege is not terminated by a transfer of a part of a partnership interest so long as the partner retains any interest in the partnership. Also, the privilege is not terminated by a transaction falling within the provisions of section 381(a) of the Code if, under section 5(d) of the Act, the acquiring corporation is required to take into account the unpaid portion of the net increase in tax. In such a case the privilege may be continued by the acquiring corporation in the same manner and under the same conditions as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation.
(e)
Redetermination of tax subsequent to exercise of installment election.
Section 4(d) of the Act provides that where a taxpayer has elected to pay the net increase in tax in installments and
thereafter it becomes necessary to redetermine the taxpayer's tax for any taxable year to which the election provided by section 4(a) of the Act applies, then the net increase in tax shall be redetermined. Where the redetermination does not involve adjustments affecting the treatment of dealer reserve income, then the net increase in tax previously computed will not be disturbed. The net increase in tax is limited to the amount of tax computed under section 4(b)(2) of the Act as a result of the change in treatment accorded dealer reserve income. If the redetermination of tax for any taxable year to which the election applies results in an addition to the net increase in tax previously computed, then such addition shall be prorated to all of the installments whether paid or unpaid. The part of the addition, prorated to installments which are not yet due, shall be collected at the same time as, and as a part of, such installments. The part of the addition prorated to installments, the time for payment of which has arrived, shall be paid upon notice and demand from the district director. Under section 4(g) of the Act, failure to make such payment within 10 days after issuance of notice and demand will terminate the installment privilege. The imposition of interest on the addition to the net increase in tax as a result of the redetermination will be determined in the same manner as interest on the previously computed net increase in tax. Thus, no interest will be imposed on the amount of the addition to the net increase in tax prorated to installments not yet due unless the installment privilege is terminated under subsection (f) or (g) of section 4 of the Act. If a reduction in the net increase in tax results from a redetermination of tax for any taxable year to which the election applies, the entire amount of such reduction shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 6403 of the Code (relating to overpayment of installments), be prorated to the installments which are not yet due, resulting in a pro rata reduction in each of such installments. Where the redetermination does not involve adjustments pertaining to dealer reserve income, then any resulting deficiency pertaining to the year to which the election applies will be assessed and collected, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) without regard to any election made under the Act.
(f)
Periods of limitation.
Section 4(h) of the Act provides that where there is an extension of time for payment of tax under the provisions of section 4(b) of the Act, the running of the periods of limitation provided by section 6502 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) for collection of such tax is suspended for the period of time for which the extension is granted.
[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8372, Sept. 1, 1960]
§ 1.9002-5
Special rules relating to interest.
(a)
In general.
Where an election is made under section 4(a) of the Act interest is computed under section 6601 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) on any increase in tax attributable to such election for each taxable year involved for the period from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax for such year (determined without regard to any extensions of time for filing the return) through the date preceding the date on which the election is made. Where the election under section 4(a) of the Act results in a decrease in tax for any year to which the election applies, interest is computed in accordance with section 6611 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) from the date of overpayment through the date preceding the date on which the election is made. Where there is a net increase in tax as a result of the election under section 4(a) of the Act, no interest shall be imposed on any underpayment (and no interest shall be paid on any overpayment) attributable to the dealer reserve income adjustment for any year to which the election applies for the period commencing with the date such election is made and ending on the date prescribed for filing the return (determined without regard to extensions of time) for the taxable year in which the election is made. This rule applies regardless of whether the election under section 4(b) of the Act is made. If there is no net increase in tax, interest on any underpayment
or overpayment attributable to the dealer reserve income adjustment for any taxable year to which the election applies for the period commencing with the date of the election shall be determined in accordance with §§ 301.6601-1 and 301.6611-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(b)
Installment period
—(1)
Where payment is not accelerated.
If the election under section 4(b) of the Act is made to pay the net increase in tax in installments, no interest will be imposed on such net increase in tax for the period beginning with the due date fixed under section 4(c) of the Act for the first installment payment and ending with the date fixed under such section for the last installment payment unless payment of the unpaid installments is accelerated under other provisions of the Act. See subsections (f) and (g) of section 4 of the Act.
(2)
Where payment is accelerated.
Where payment of the unpaid installments is accelerated because of the termination of the installment privilege, interest will be computed under section 6601 of the Code on the entire unpaid net increase in tax for the applicable period set forth below:
(i) In the case of acceleration under section 4(f) of the Act for reasons other than nonpayment of an installment, from the date of the notice and demand for payment of the unpaid tax to the date of payment; or
(ii) In the case of acceleration under section 4(g) of the Act for nonpayment of an installment, from the date fixed for payment of the installment to the date of payment.
When payment is accelerated under section 4(f) of the Act, however, no interest will be charged where payment of the unpaid installments is made within 10 days of issuance of the notice and demand for such payment.
[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8373, Sept. 1, 1960]
§ 1.9002-6
Acquiring corporation.
Section 5(d) of the Act provides that for purposes of such Act in the case of the acquisition of the assets of a corporation by another corporation in a distribution or transfer described in section 381(a) of the Code the acquiring corporation shall be treated as if it were the distributor or transferor corporation.
[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8373, Sept. 1, 1960]
§ 1.9002-7
Statute of limitations.
(a)
Extension of period for assessment and refund or credit.
Under section 5(e) of the Act, if an election is made to have the Act apply, and if the assessment of any deficiency, or the refund or credit of any overpayment attributable to the election, for any taxable year to which the Act applies was not prevented on June 21, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, relating to closing agreements and compromises), but would be so prevented prior to September 1, 1961, the period within which such assessment, or such refund or credit, may be made with respect to such taxable year shall not expire prior to September 1, 1961. An election under either section 3 or 4 of the Act will be considered to be a consent to the extension of the period of limitation for purposes of assessment for any year to which the Act applies. Thus, for example, if, as the result of an election under section 4(a) of the Act, assessment of a deficiency for the taxable year 1955 was not prevented by the statute of limitations, a judicial decision that had become final, or otherwise, on June 21, 1959, but would (except for section 5(e) of the Act) be prevented on a later date, as for instance September 1, 1959, then for purposes of applying section 4 of the Act, assessment may be made at any time prior to September 1, 1961, with respect to such year if the taxpayer made an election under the Act prior to September 1, 1960. Section 5(e) of the Act will, in no event, operate to shorten the period of limitation otherwise applicable with respect to any taxable year.
(b)
Years closed by closing agreement or compromise.
For purposes of the Act, if the assessment of any deficiency or a refund or credit of any overpayment for any taxable year was not prevented on June 21, 1959, but is prevented on the date of an election under section 3 or 4 of the Act by the operation of the provisions of chapter 74 of the Code (relating to closing agreements and compromises), assessment, refund, or credit
will, nevertheless, be considered as being prevented on June 21, 1959.
[T.D. 6490, 25 FR 8373, Sept. 1, 1960]
§ 1.9002-8
Manner of exercising elections.
(a)
By whom election is to be made
—(1)
In general.
Generally, the taxpayer to whom the Act applies will exercise the elections provided therein. In the case of a partnership or a corporation electing under the provisions of subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, the election shall be exercised by the persons specified in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, respectively.
(2)
Partnerships.
In the case of a partnership, the election under section 3 or 4(a) of the Act shall be exercised by the partnership. If an election is made by the partnership under section 4(a) of the Act, any election under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the net increase in tax in installments shall be made by each partner separately. The determination as to whether the net increase in tax resulting from the election under section 4(a) of the Act exceeds $2,500 shall be made with reference to the increase or decrease in the tax of each partner attributable to the adjustment to his distributive share of the partnership income resulting from the election.
(3)
Subchapter S corporations.
In the case of an electing small business corporation under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, the election under section 3 or 4(a) of the Act shall be made by such corporation. An election under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the net increase in tax in installments shall, to the extent the net increase in tax resulting from the election is attributable to adjustments to income for taxable years for which the corporation was not an electing small business corporation, be made by the corporation. The determination as to whether the net increase in tax for such taxable years exceeds $2,500 shall be made with reference to the increase or decrease in tax of the corporation. Any election under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the net increase in tax in installments shall, to the extent the increase in tax is attributable to years for which the corporation was an electing small business corporation, be made by the shareholders separately. The determination in such a case as to whether the net increase in tax for such taxable years exceeds $2,500 shall be made with reference to the increases or decreases in the tax of each shareholder attributable to the adjustments to taxable income of the electing small business corporation resulting from the election.
(b)
Time and manner of making elections
—(1)
In general.
Any election made under the Act shall be made by the taxpayers described in paragraph (a) of this section before September 1, 1960, by filing a statement with the district director with whom such taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made is required to be filed. A copy of the statement of election shall be attached to and filed with such taxpayer's income tax return for such taxable year.
(2)
Election to have section 481 apply.
An election under section 3 of the Act shall be made in the form of a statement which shall include the following:
(i) A clear indication that an election is being made under section 3 of the Act;
(ii) Information sufficient to establish eligibility to make the election; and
(iii) The year of change as defined in section 3(b) of the Act.
An amended income tax return reflecting the increase or decrease in tax attributable to the election shall be filed for the year of change together with schedules showing how the tax was recomputed under section 481 of the Code. If income tax returns have been filed for any taxable years subsequent to the year of change, amended returns reflecting the proper treatment of dealer reserve income for such years shall also be filed. In the case of partnerships and electing small business corporations under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, amended returns shall be filed by the partnership or electing small business corporation, as well as by the partners or shareholders, as the case may be. Any amended return shall be filed with the office of the district director with whom the taxpayer files his income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made and, if practicable, on the same date the
statement of election is filed, but amended returns shall be filed in no event later than November 30, 1960, unless an extension of time is granted under section 6081 of the Code. Whenever the amended returns do not accompany the statement of election, a copy of the statement shall be submitted with the amended returns.
(3)
Election not to have section 481 apply.
An election under section 4(a) of the Act shall be made in the form of a statement which shall include the following:
(i) A clear indication that an election is being made under section 4(a) of the Act;
(ii) Information sufficient to establish eligibility to make the election; and
(iii) The taxable years to which the election applies.
Amended income tax returns reflecting the increase or decrease in tax attributable to the election shall be filed for the taxable years to which the election applies. If income tax returns have been filed for any subsequent taxable years, amended returns reflecting the proper treatment of dealer reserve income for such years shall also be filed. In the case of partnerships and electing small business corporations under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, amended returns shall be filed by the partnership or electing small business corporation, as well as by the partners or shareholders, as the case may be. Any amended return shall be filed with the office of the district director with whom the taxpayer files his income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made and, if practicable, on the same date the statement of election is filed, but amended returns shall be filed in no event later than November 30, 1960, unless an extension of time is granted under section 6081 of the Code. Whenever the amended returns do not accompany the statement of election, a copy of the statement shall be submitted with the amended return.
(4)
Election to pay tax in installments.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, if the taxpayer making the election under section 4(a) of the Act also desires to make the election under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the increase in tax in installments, then the statement of election shall include the following additional information:
(
a
) A clear indication that an election is also being made under section 4(b) of the Act;
(
b
) A summary of the total increases and decreases in tax, together with interest thereon, in sufficient detail to establish eligibility to make the election; and

(
d
) The office of the district director and the date on which the election under section 4(a) of the Act was filed by such partnership or corporation.
The statement of election under section 4(b) of the Act shall be accompanied by a copy of the statement of election under section 4(a) of the Act made by the partnership or electing small business corporation under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, as the case may be.
(c)
Effect of election.
An election made under section 3 or 4 of the Act shall become irrevocable on September 1, 1960, and shall be binding on the taxpayer for all taxable years to which it applies.

Election to have the provisions of section 613(c) (2) and (4) of the 1954 Code, as amended, apply for past years.
(a)
In general.
Section 4 of the Act of September 14, 1960 (Pub. L. 86-781, 74 Stat. 1017), amended section 302(c) of the Public Debt and Tax Rate Extension Act of 1960 to permit certain taxpayers for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, to apply the provisions of section 302(b) of that Act. Section 302(b) of the Act amended section 613(c) (2) and (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to read in part as follows:
Sec. 613.
Percentage Depletion.
* * *
(c)
Definition of gross income from property.
For purposes of this section:
(2)
Mining.
The term “mining” includes not merely the extraction of the ores or minerals from the ground but also the treatment processes considered as mining described in paragraph (4) (and the treatment processes necessary or incidental thereto), and so much of the transportation of ores or minerals (whether or not by common carrier) from the
point of extraction from the ground to the plants or mills in which such treatment processes are applied thereto as is not in excess of 50 miles unless the Secretary or his delegate finds that the physical and other requirements are such that the ore or mineral must be transported a greater distance to such plants or mills.
(4)
Treatment processes considered as mining.
The following treatment processes where applied by the mine owner or operator shall be considered as mining to the extent they are applied to the ore or mineral in respect of which he is entitled to a deduction for depletion under section 611:
(F) In the case of calcium carbonates and other minerals when used in making cement—all processes (other than preheating of the kiln feed) applied prior to the introduction of the kiln feed into the kiln, but not including any subsequent process;
(b)
Election.
Under section 302(c)(2) of the Act, the taxpayer, in the case of calcium carbonates or other minerals when used by him in making cement, may elect to apply the provisions of section 613(c) (2) and (4) of the 1954 Code as amended in lieu of the corresponding provisions of prior law. The taxpayer must make the election in accordance with § 1.9003-4 on or before November 15, 1960, and the election shall become irrevocable on November 15, 1960.
(c)
Years to which the election is applicable.
If the election described in paragraph (b) of this section is made by the taxpayer, the provisions of section 613(c) (2) and (4) as amended by section 302(b) of the Act apply to all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which:
(1) The assessment of any deficiency,
(2) Refund or credit of any overpayment,
(3) Commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
is not prevented on September 14, 1960, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The election also applies to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which an assessment of a deficiency has been made but not collected on or before September 14, 1960.
[T.D. 6492, 25 FR 8905, Sept. 16, 1960]
§ 1.9003-2
Effect of election.
(a)
In general.
If a taxpayer makes the election described in paragraph (b) of § 1.9003-1, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of section 302(b) of the Act with respect to all taxable years to which the election applies. Thus, subparagraph (F) of section 613(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended must be applied in determining gross income from mining for the taxable years to which the election applies (including years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) whether or not the taxpayer is litigating the issue. Further, the election shall apply to all calcium carbonates or other minerals mined and used by the taxpayer in making cement.
(b)
Effect on gross income from mining.
The election is only determinative of what constitutes “mining” for purposes of computing percentage depletion and has no effect on the method employed in determining the amount of gross income from mining. In applying the election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and the effect that adjustments to any such items shall have on other taxable years. The provisions of section 302(b) of the Act are applicable with respect to taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for purposes of applying sections 450 and 453 of that Code.
[T.D. 6492, 25 FR 8905, Sept. 16, 1960]
§ 1.9003-3
Statutes of limitation.
Under section 302(c)(2) of the Act, the period within which the assessment of any deficiency or the credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the election may be made shall not expire sooner than 1 year after November 15, 1960. Thus, if assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, whichever is applicable, is not prevented on September 14, 1960, the time for making assessment or credit or refund shall not expire for at least 1 year after November 15, 1960, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary. Even though assessment of a deficiency is prevented on September 14, 1960, if commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Code may be made on such date, then any deficiency resulting from the election may be assessed
at any time within 1 year after November 15, 1960. If the taxpayer makes the election he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the provisions of section 302(c)(2) of the Act extending the time for assessing a deficiency attributable to the election. Section 302(c)(2) of the Act does not shorten the period of limitations otherwise applicable. An agreement may be entered into under section 6501(c)(4) of the Code and corresponding provisions of prior law to extend the period for assessment.

§ 1.9003-4
Manner of exercising election.
(a)
By whom election is to be made.
Generally, the taxpayer whose tax liability is affected by the election shall make the election. In the case of a partnership, or a corporation electing under the provisions of subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, the election shall be exercised by the partnership or such corporation, as the case may be.
(b)
Time and manner of making election.
The election shall be made on or before November 15, 1960, by filing a statement with the district director with whom the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made is required to be filed. The statement shall include the following:
(1) A clear indication that an election is being made under section 302(c)(2) of the Act, and
(2) The taxable years to which the election applies.
Amended income tax returns reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the election shall be filed for the taxable years to which the election applies. In the case of partnerships and electing small business corporations under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, amended returns shall be filed by the partnership or electing small business corporations, as well as by the partners or shareholders, as the case may be. Any amended return shall be filed with the office of the district director with whom the taxpayer files his income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made and, if practicable, on the same date the statement of election is filed, but amended returns shall be filed in no event later than February 28, 1961, unless an extension of time is granted under section 6081 of the Code. Whenever the amended returns do not accompany the statement of election, a copy of the statement shall be submitted with the amended returns. The amended returns shall be accompanied by payment of the additional tax (together with interest thereon) resulting from the election.

§ 1.9004-1
Election relating to the determination of gross income from the property for taxable years beginning prior to 1961 in the case of certain clays and shale.
(a)
In general.
The Act of September 26, 1961 (Pub. L. 87-312, 75 Stat. 674), provides that certain taxpayers may elect to apply the provisions thereof to all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, with respect to which the election is effective. The Act prescribes special rules for the application of section 613 (a) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) in the case of shale and certain clays used by the mine owner or operator in the manufacture of certain clay and shale products.
(b)
Election.
The election to apply the provisions of the Act may be made only by a mine owner or operator with respect to brick and tile clay, fire clay, or shale which he mined and used in the manufacture of building or paving brick, drainage and roofing tile, sewer pipe, flower pots, and kindred products. The election must be made in accordance with § 1.9004-4 on or before December 11, 1961, and the election shall become irrevocable on December 11, 1961.
(c)
Years to which the election is applicable.
If the election described in paragraph (b) of this section is made by the taxpayer, the provisions of the Act shall be effective for all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which the:
(1) Assessment of a deficiency,
(2) Refund or credit of an overpayment, or
(3) Commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
is not prevented on September 26, 1961, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The election is also effective for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which an assessment of a deficiency has been made but not collected on or before September 26, 1961.

§ 1.9004-2
Effect of election.
(a)
In general.
If a taxpayer makes the election described in paragraph (b) of § 1.9004-1, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the Act with respect to all the clay and shale described in that paragraph for all taxable years for which the election is effective whether or not the taxpayer is litigating the issue for any of such years. Thus, in applying section 613 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) to those years:
(1) The “gross income from the property” for purposes of section 613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) shall be 50 percent of the amount for which the mineowner or operator sold, during the taxable year, the building or paving brick, drainage and roofing tile, sewer pipe, flower pots, and kindred products manufactured from the clay and shale described in paragraph (b) of § 1.9004-1, but shall not exceed an amount equal to $12.50 multiplied by the number of short tons of all such clay or shale mined and used by the mineowner or operator in the manufacture of the products sold during the taxable year; and
(2) The “taxable income from the property” (computed without allowance for depletion) for purposes of section 613(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) shall be 50 percent of the taxable income from the manufactured products sold during the taxable year (computed without allowance for depletion).
(b)
Effect on depletion rates and other items.
The election shall have no effect on the applicable rate of percentage depletion for the taxable years to which the election is effective. In applying the election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and the effect that adjustments to any such items shall have on other taxable years. The provisions of the Act are applicable with respect to taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for purposes of applying sections 450 and 453 of that Code.

§ 1.9004-3
Statutes of limitation.
The period within which the assessment of any deficiency or the credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the election may be made shall not expire sooner than one year after December 11, 1961. Thus, if assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, whichever is applicable, is not prevented on September 26, 1961, the time for making assessment or credit or refund shall not expire for at least one year after December 11, 1961, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary. Even though assessment of a deficiency is prevented on September 26, 1961, if commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 may be made on such date, then any deficiency resulting from the election may be assessed at any time within 1 year after December 11, 1961. If a taxpayer makes the election, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the provisions of the Act extending the time for assessing a deficiency attributable to the election. The Act does not shorten the periods of limitation otherwise applicable. An agreement may be entered into under section 6501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and corresponding provisions of
prior law to extend the period for assessment.

For purposes of this paragraph, exceptional, unusual, or nominal sales or selling prices shall be disregraded. If the mine owner or operator makes no sales of, or makes only exceptional, unusual, or nominal sales of, such quartzite or clay after application of only the processes described in paragraph (1), then in lieu of the price provided for in subparagraph (A) or (B) there shall be used the average lowest recognized selling price for the taxable year for such quartzite or clay in the marketing area of the mine owner or operator published in a trade journal or other industry publication.
(b)
Years to which applicable.
An election made under subsection (c) to have the provisions of this section apply shall be effective on and after January 1, 1951, for all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which:

An election by a taxpayer under subsection (c) shall be considered as a consent to the application of the provisions of this subsection.
(e)
Terms; applicability of other laws.
Except where otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly intended, terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as when used in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) and all provisions of law shall apply with respect to this section as if this section were a part of such Code (or corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939).

§ 1.9005-1
Election relating to the determination of gross income from the property for taxable years beginning prior to 1961 in the case of clay and quartzite used in making refractory products.
(a)
In general.
Section 2 of the Act of September 26, 1961 (Pub. L. 87-321, 75 Stat. 683), provides that certain taxpayers may elect to apply the provisions of such section to all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, with respect to which the election is effective. Section 2 of the Act prescribes special rules for the application of section 613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) in the case of quartzite and clay used by the mine owner or operator in the production of refractory products.
(b)
Election.
The election to apply the provisions of section 2 of the Act may be made only in the case of quartzite and clay used in the production of products generally recognized as refractory products by the refractories industry. Examples of such products are clay firebrick, silica brick, and refractory bonding mortars. The election may be made only by a taxpayer who both mined the clay or quartzite and used it in the production of refractory products. The election must be made in accordance with § 1.9005-4 on or before February 14, 1962, and the election shall become irrevocable on that date.
(c)
Years to which the election is applicable.
If the election described in paragraph (b) of this section is made by the taxpayer, the provisions of section 2 of the Act shall be effective on and after January 1, 1951, for all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which the:
(1) Assessment of a deficiency,
(2) Refund or credit of an overpayment, or
(3) Commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
was not prevented on September 26, 1961, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The election is also effective on and after January 1, 1951, for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1961, in respect of which an assessment of a deficiency has been made but not collected on or before September 26, 1961.

[T.D. 6583, 26 FR 12078, Dec. 16, 1961]
§ 1.9005-2
Effect of election.
(a)
In general.
If a taxpayer makes the election described in paragraph (b) of § 1.9005-1, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of section 2 of the Act with respect to all the clay and quartzite described in that paragraph for all taxable years for which the election is effective whether or not the taxpayer is litigating the issue for any of such years. Thus, in applying section 613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) to those years:
(1) The term “ordinary treatment processes” shall include crushing, grinding, and separating the mineral from waste, but shall not include any subsequent process; and
(2) The gross income from mining for each short ton of quartzite or clay mined by the taxpayer and used by him in the production of all refractory products sold during the taxable year shall be equal to 87
1/2
percent of the lesser of:
(i) The average lowest published or advertised price, or
(ii) The average lowest actual selling price at which the mine owner or operator offered to sell or sold any such quartzite or clay during the taxable year.
(b)
Rules for applying paragraph (a) of this section.
(1) The price described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and any price described in this paragraph shall be determined with reference to quartzite or clay in the form and condition of such products after the application of only the processes described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and before transportation from the plant in which such processes were applied.
(2) If quartzite and clay were mined and used by the taxpayer in the production of refractory products, a separate price shall be used with respect to each mineral.
(3) There shall be used for each mineral the lowest price at which it was sold or offered for sale by the taxpayer during the taxable year. Thus, only one price shall be used with respect to each mineral regardless of variations in type or grade.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph, exceptional, unusual, or nominal sales of quartzite or clay shall be disregarded. Thus, for example, if the taxpayer made an accommodation sale during the taxable year at other than the regular price, such sale is to be disregarded.
(5) If the taxpayer made no sales during the taxable year of quartzite or clay in the form and condition described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, or if his sales were exceptional, unusual, or nominal, there shall be used the lowest recognized selling price for the taxpayer's marketing area for quartzite or clay (of the same grade and type as that used by him) which was published for the taxable year in a trade journal or other industry publication.
(6) If subparagraph (5) of this paragraph does not apply for the reason that there is no recognized selling price published in a trade journal or other industry publication for the taxpayer's marketing area, there shall be used the lowest price at which quartzite or clay comparable to that used by the taxpayer was sold or offered for sale during the taxable year in that area by other producers similarly circumstanced as the taxpayer or, if appropriate, the lowest price paid by
the taxpayer for purchased quartzite or clay.
(7) If the lowest selling price otherwise applicable under the preceding provisions of this paragraph fluctuated during the taxable year, the two or more lowest selling prices shall be averaged according to the number of days during the taxable year that each such price was in effect.
(c) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
Taxpayer A, a calendar year taxpayer, mined quartzite and clay and used them in the production of recognized refractory products. During the taxable year, the lowest price for which A sold clay after the application of crushing and grinding was $13.75 per short ton. He also sold some ground clay of a different type at $20.00 per short ton. A sold quartzite after the application of crushing and grinding for various prices, depending upon type, ranging from $14.00 per short ton to $20.00 per short ton. During the taxable year, the prices for the various types of ground clay and quartzite did not change. None of the sales by A of ground clay or quartzite were exceptional, unusual, or nominal.
(ii)
Determination of gross income from mining.
If A makes the election described in paragraph (b) of § 1.9005-1, the gross income from mining per short ton of clay mined by A and used in the production of refractory products sold during the taxable year is $12.03 (87
1/2
percent of $13.75), and the gross income from mining per short ton of quartzite mined by A and used in the production of refractory products sold during the taxable year is $12.25 (87
1/2
percent of $14.00). To determine his gross income from mining, A must compute the sum of:
(a) $12.03 multiplied by the number of short tons of clay which were mined by A (whether or not during the taxable year) and which were used by A in the production of refractory products (refractory bonding mortar, fire brick, etc.) sold during the taxable year; plus
(b) $12.25 multiplied by the number of short tons of quartzite which were mined by A (whether or not during the taxable year) and which were used by A in the production of refractory products sold during the taxable year.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that on October 1 of the taxable year A's lowest price for clay after the application of crushing and grinding increased to $14.40 per short ton. In this case, the average lowest price for which A sold ground clay during the taxable year must be determined by taking into account the price adjustment of October 1. Under these circumstances, the average lowest price for the ground clay would be $13.91, that is $13.75 × 273/365 plus $14.40 × 92/365.
(d)
Effect on depletion rates and other items.
The election shall have no effect on the applicable rate of percentage depletion for the taxable years for which the election is effective. In applying the election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and the effect that adjustments to any such items shall have on other taxable years. The provisions of section 2 of the Act are applicable with respect to taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for purposes of applying sections 450 and 453 of that Code. The election shall have no effect on the determination of the treatment processes which are to be considered as mining or on the determination of gross income from mining for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1960.

[T.D. 6583, 26 FR 12078, Dec. 16, 1961]
§ 1.9005-3
Statutes of limitation.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the period within which the assessment of any deficiency attributable to the election may be made, or within which the credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the election may be made, shall not expire sooner than one year after the last day for making the election. Thus, if assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, whichever is applicable, was not prevented on September 26, 1961, the time for making assessment or credit or refund shall not expire for at least one year after the last day for making the election. Even though assessment of a deficiency was prevented on September 26, 1961, if commencement of a suit for recovery of a refund under section 7405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 may have been made on such date, then any deficiency resulting from the election may be assessed at any time within one year after the last day for making the
election. If a taxpayer makes the election, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the provisions of section 2 of the Act extending the time for assessing a deficiency attributable to the election. Section 2 of the Act does not shorten the period of limitations otherwise applicable. An agreement may be entered into under section 6501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and corresponding provisions of prior law to extend the period for assessment.

(2) The taxable years to which the election applies.
Amended income tax returns reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the election shall be filed for the taxable years to which the election applies. In the case of partnerships and electing small business corporations under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, amended returns shall be filed by the partnership or electing small business corporation, as well as by the partners or shareholders, as the case may be. Any amended return shall be filed with the office of the district director with whom the taxpayer files his income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made, and, if practicable, on the same date the statement of election is filed, but amended returns shall be filed in no event later than May 31, 1962, unless an extension of time is granted under section 6081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

Further, all provisions of law contained in the Code (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) shall apply to the extent that they can apply. Thus, all the provisions of subtitle F of the Code (and the corresponding provisions of prior law) shall apply to the extent they can apply, including the provisions of law relating to assessment, collection, credit or refund, and limitations. For purposes of this section and §§ 1.9005-1 to 1.9005-4, inclusive, the term “Act” means the Act of September 26, 1961 (Pub. L. 87-321, 75 Stat. 683).

# Tax Reform Act of 1969
§ 1.9006
Statutory provisions; Tax Reform Act of 1969.
Section 946 of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 729) provides as follows:
Sec. 946.
Interest and penalties in case of certain taxable years
—(a)
Interest on underpayment.
Notwithstanding section 6601 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, in the case of any taxable year ending before the date of the enactment of this Act, no interest on any
underpayment of tax, to the extent such underpayment is attributable to the amendments made by this Act, shall be assessed or collected for any period before the 90th day after such date.
(b)
Declarations of estimated tax.
In the case of a taxable year beginning before the date of the enactment of this Act, if any taxpayer is required to make a declaration or amended declaration of estimated tax, or to pay any amount or additional amount of estimated tax, by reason of the amendments made by this Act, such amount or additional amount shall be paid ratably on or before each of the remaining installment dates for the taxable year beginning with the first installment date on or after the 30th day after such date of enactment. With respect to any declaration or payment of estimated tax before such first installment date, sections 6015, 6154, 6654, and 6655 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall be applied without regard to the amendments made by this Act. For purposes of this subsection, the term “installment date” means any date on which, under section 6153 or 6154 of such Code (whichever is applicable), an installment payment of estimated tax is required to be made by the taxpayer.
[T.D. 7088, 36 FR 3052, Feb. 17, 1971]
§ 1.9006-1
Interest and penalties in case of certain taxable years.
(a)
Interest on underpayment.
The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was amended in many important respects by the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Certain of these amendments affect taxable years ending prior to December 30, 1969 (the date of enactment of the Act) and thereby may cause underpayments of tax by a number of taxpayers for those years. Under section 6601(a) of the Code, interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum is imposed upon the amount of any such underpayment. The effect of section 946(a) of the Act is to prevent the assessment or collection of interest on an underpayment of tax for any taxable year ending before December 30, 1969, if such underpayment is attributable to any amendment made by such Act, for the period from the due date for payment until March 30, 1970. Thus, the taxpayer is afforded an interest-free period of 90 days from the date of enactment of such Act within which to account for the changes in the law affecting him and to remit the amount of such underpayment. If, on or after March 30, 1970, the amount of any underpayment (or portion thereof) attributable to an amendment made by the Act remains unpaid, then, as of such date, such underpayment (or portion thereof) shall be subject to interest as provided by section 6601 of the Code, to be computed from such date. However, if a corporation or farmers' cooperative elects to pay its final tax in two installments under section 6152 of the Code and if the second installment is due after March 30, 1970, then, in order to escape the imposition of interest under section 6601, such corporation or cooperative need pay only one-half of the additional tax arising from an amendment made by the Act before March 30, 1970, with the remaining one-half payable as part of the second installment on the regular due date for that installment. In the case of an underpayment of tax which is only partly attributable to an amendment made by the Act, section 946(a) of such Act shall apply only to the extent that such underpayment is so attributable.
(b)
Declarations and payments of estimated tax.
(1) In the case of a taxable year beginning before December 30, 1969, section 946(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 provides transitional rules with respect to the payment of estimated tax and, in the case of an individual, the filing of a declaration of estimated tax. Under such section 946(b) in the case of such a year, if any taxpayer is required to make a declaration or amended declaration of estimated tax, or to pay any amount or additional amount of estimated tax, by reason of the amendments made by the Act, such amount or additional amount shall be paid ratably on or before each of the remaining installment dates for the taxable year beginning with the first installment date on or after February 15, 1970. For purposes of section 946(b) of such Act and this section, the term “installment date” means any date on which, under section 6153 or 6154 of the Code (whichever is applicable), an installment payment of estimated tax is required to be made by the taxpayer.
(2) With respect to any declaration or payment of estimated tax before February 15, 1970, sections 6015, 6153, 6154, 6654, and 6655 of the Code shall be applied without regard to the amendments made by such Act. Therefore,
any underpayment which occurs solely by reason of the amendments made by such Act shall not be treated as an underpayment in the case of installment dates before February 15, 1970. Similarly, in the case of a taxpayer all of whose installment dates occur prior to February 15, 1970, no payment of estimated tax need be made to reflect the amendments made by such Act.
(3) The following example illustrates the application of the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph:

# Example.
A, a fiscal year taxpayer with a taxable year from July 1, 1969, through June 30, 1970, had, without regard to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, a total tax liability, which would have been shown on his return, of $500. A is not a farmer or fisherman described in section 6037(b). A's tax liability is increased by $20 to $520, attributable to an amendment made by such Act. A makes an installment payment of estimated tax of $90 on each of the following four installment dates: October 15, 1969; December 15, 1969; March 15, 1970; and July 15, 1970. Assume that A is unaffected by the exceptions provided in section 6654(d). Therefore, A is underpaid by $10 on both October 15 and December 15, and by $18 on both March 15 and July 15. Such underpayments are computed as follows:
(a) October 15 and December 15 installment dates:
(1) Tax without regard to Tax Reform Act of 1969
$500
(2) 80% of item (1)
400
(3) Minimum payment to avoid underpayment, determined without regard to Act:
October 15, 1969 (25% of item (2))
100
December 15, 1969 (25% of item (2))
100
(4) Actual payment:
October 15, 1969
90
December 15, 1969
90
(5) Amount of underpayment:
October 15, 1969 ($100−$90)
10
December 15, 1969 ($100−$90)
10
(b) March 15 and July 15 installment dates:
(1) Tax with regard to Act
520
(2) 80% of item (1)
416
(3) Less total of minimum payments to avoid underpayment, determined without regard to Act for October 15, 1969 and December 15, 1969 ($100 + $100)
200
(4) Difference of items (2) and (3)
216
(5) Minimum payment to avoid underpayment, determined with regard to Act:
March 15 (50% of $216)
108
July 15 (50% of $216)
108
(6) Actual payment:
March 15
90
July 15

§ 1.9200-1
Deduction for motor carrier operating authority.
(a)
In general.
Section 266 of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-34, 95 Stat. 265) provides that, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, an ordinary deduction shall be allowed in computing the taxable income of all taxpayers who either held one or more motor carrier operating authorities on July 1, 1980, or later acquired a motor carrier operating authority pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980. The deduction for each motor carrier operating authority is to be allowed ratably over a 60-month period and is equal to the adjusted basis of the motor carrier operating authority on July 1, 1980. Except as provided in this section, no deduction is allowable for any diminution in value of any motor carrier operating authority caused by administrative or legislative actions to decrease restrictions on entry into the interstate motor carrier business.
(b)
Person entitled to claim deduction.
In general, the deduction provided by this section for a particular motor carrier operating authority may be claimed only by the taxpayer which held the authority on July 1, 1980. However, if another person acquired the motor carrier operating authority after July 1, 1980, pursuant to a binding contract in effect on that date, the deduction for such authority may be claimed only by the acquirer and may not be claimed by the taxpayer which held the authority on July 1, 1980. A taxpayer, otherwise entitled to claim a deduction under this section, who sells a motor carrier operating authority after July 1, 1980 may not claim an amortization deduction for such authority for any month which begins after the date of such sale. In addition, acquisition of a motor carrier operating authority after July 1, 1980, if not pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980, will not entitle the acquirer to a deduction under this section, unless the operating authority is acquired pursuant
to a transaction to which section 381 applies.
(c)
Allowance of deduction
—(1)
Determination of period for deduction
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the 60-month period for taking the deduction provided by this section for a particular motor carrier operating authority begins with the month of July 1980, or, if later, the month in which the motor carrier operating authority was acquired pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980.
(ii)
Election.
In lieu of beginning the 60-month period as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the taxpayer may elect to begin the 60-month period with the first month of the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after July 1, 1980. This election, if made, shall apply to the deduction for all motor carrier operating authorities either held by the taxpayer on July 1, 1980, or later acquired by the taxpayer by the end of the first month of the first taxable year beginning after July 1, 1980, pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980. Any such election will not apply to the determination of the period for amortizing the bases of authorities acquired by the taxpayer after the end of the first month of the first taxable year beginning after July 1, 1980.
(2)
Amount of monthly deduction.
In the case of each motor carrier operating authority for which the taxpayer is entitled (under paragraph (b) of this section) to claim a deduction, the deduction for each month during the 60-month period relating to the motor carrier operating authority is equal to the adjusted basis (determined under paragraph (e) of this section) of the motor carrier operating authority divided by 60.
(d)
Definition of motor carrier-operating authority.
For purposes of § 1.9200-2 and this section, the term “motor carrier operating authority” means a certificate or permit held by a motor common carrier or motor contract carrier of property and issued pursuant to the Revised Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 10921-10933 (Supp. III 1979). The terms “motor common carrier” and “motor contract carrier” shall be defined as in 49 U.S.C. 10102 (Supp. III 1979) and do not include persons meeting the definition of freight forwarder contained in 49 U.S.C. 10102 (Supp. III 1979).
(e)
Adjusted basis of motor carrier operating authority
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the adjusted basis of a motor carrier operating authority for which a deduction is allowed under this section is the adjusted basis of the motor carrier operating authority as determined under sections 1012 and 1016 in the hands of the taxpayer who is entitled to claim the deduction under paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Special rule in case of certain stock acquisitions
—(i)
Election by holder.
A corporation entitled to claim a deduction under paragraph (b) of this section for a motor carrier operating authority may elect to allocate a portion of the cost basis of a qualified acquiring party in the stock of an acquired corporation, to the basis of the authority. A qualified acquiring party is a corporation (or a noncorporate person or group of noncorporate persons described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section) that after June 21, 1952, and on or before July 1, 1980 (or after July 1, 1980 under a binding contract in effect on such date) acquired by purchase, within the meaning of section 334(b)(3) and during a period of not more than 12 months, 80 percent or more of the stock (as described in section 334(b)(2)(B)) of a corporation (the acquired corporation) which held the authority directly or indirectly on the date which is the end of the period of 12 months or less within which such 80 percent of the acquired corporation's stock was purchased. The election to allocate basis in an acquired corporation's stock to the basis in an authority may be made only if 80 percent of all classes of the acquired corporation's stock (other than nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends) was acquired by purchase (within the meaning of section 334(b)(3)) during a period of not more than 12 months, as described in section 334(b)(2)(B). If the qualified acquiring party is a corporation, the taxpayer holding the authority on July 1, 1980, may elect the basis allocation of this paragraph only if it is a member of
the affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) of which the qualified acquiring party is a member. If there is more than one acquisition of stock that might permit an election to allocate basis under this paragraph (e)(2)(i), the taxpayer may elect to allocate to the authority only the basis in the acquired corporation's stock held by the qualified acquiring party which became a qualified acquiring party as a result of the last of such acquisitions.
(ii)
Certain noncorporate persons treated as qualified parties.
For purposes of paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (vi) of this section, the term “qualified acquiring party” shall include a noncorporate person or group of noncorporate persons which, after June 21, 1952 and on or before July 1, 1980, acquired in one purchase, stock in a corporation (the acquired corporation) which at the time of acquisition held, directly or indirectly, a motor carrier operating authority. In order to be treated as a qualified acquiring party under this paragraph, a noncorporate person or group of noncorporate persons must have held stock constituting control (within the meaning of section 368(c)) of the acquired corporation on July 1, 1980. A group of noncorporate persons consists of two or more noncorporate persons who, acting together on the same date, made the required purchase of stock in the acquired corporation.
(iii)
Portion of stock basis allocable to basis of authority when stock of direct holder of authority is acquired.
If the qualified acquiring party acquired the stock of a corporation directly holding the authority, the portion of the stock basis allocable to the basis of the authority is the amount that would have been properly allocable under section 334(b)(2) if the qualified acquiring party were a corporation that had received the authority in a distribution of all the acquired corporation's assets in a complete liquidation of the acquired corporation immediately after the acquisition of the acquired corporation's stock. If the acquired corporation's stock was acquired on more than one date, the date on which the liquidation is deemed to have occurred shall be the date which is the date of the last acquisition by purchase of stock of the acquired corporation within the 12-month period described in section 334(b)(2)(B).
(iv)
Portion of stock basis allocable to basis of authority when stock of indirect holder of authority is acquired.
If the qualified acquiring party acquired the stock of a corporation indirectly holding the authority (such as by owning all of the stock of a subsidiary that directly holds the authority), a portion of the qualified acquiring party's cost basis in the stock of the acquired corporation may be allocated to the basis in the operating authority. The portion allocable is the amount that would have been properly allocable under section 334(b)(2) if, immediately before the liquidation of the acquired corporation on the date of the last acquisition by purchase of stock of the acquired corporation within the 12-month period described in section 334(b)(2)(B), the authority had been transferred in such a way (such as by liquidating the subsidiary that directly holds the authority) that the qualified acquiring party would have received direct ownership of the authority upon the liquidation of the acquired corporation immediately after the acquisition.
(v)
Other assets to be accounted for.
For purposes of paragraphs (e)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section, in determining the portion of stock basis properly allocable to the operating authority under section 334(b)(2), the portion of the qualified acquiring party's basis in the acquired corporation's stock that would have been allocable following the liquidation to other assets of the acquired corporation, including intangible assets such as goodwill and going concern value, must be taken into account.
(vi)
Adjustments to basis in acquired corporation's stock and other assets.
If a taxpayer makes the election provided by paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the qualified acquiring party's basis in the stock of the acquired corporation shall be decreased, effective as of July 1, 1980, by the amount determined by the following formula:
ER25SE06.013
In addition, if the aggregate basis of the assets of the acquired corporation other than the authority as of July 1, 1980 (reduced by the liabilities secured by such assets) exceeds the qualified acquiring party's basis in the stock of the acquired corporation remaining after application of the preceding sentence, then the bases of such assets shall be reduced proportionately so that their aggregate basis as of such date (minus secured liabilities) is equal to such remaining stock basis. If the acquired corporation held the authority indirectly, appropriate basis reductions shall be made to reflect the transfers deemed to have occurred under paragraph (e)(iv) of this section.
(vii)
Pre-TEFRA law applies.
References made in this section to section 334 of the Code relate to such section as it existed before amendment by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.
(f)
Adjustment to basis of motor carrier operating authority.
A taxpayer's basis in a motor carrier operating authority must be reduced by the amount of any amortization deductions allowable to the taxpayer under this section.
(g)
Examples.
The principles of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Corporation X acquired all the stock of corporation Y for $130,000 in 1970. Y's assets at the time of acquisition consisted of a motor carrier operating authority valued at $180,000 in which it has a basis of $60,000, trucks with a fair market value of $70,000 and an aggregate basis of $30,000, and goodwill valued at $30,000. Y has $50,000 of liabilities secured by the trucks and $100,000 of unsecured liabilities. Both X and Y use a June 30 fiscal year for tax purposes.
(ii) Y is the only taxpayer eligible to claim a deduction under § 1.9200-1(b). If X sold its Y stock to Z in October 1980 (other than pursuant to a binding contract in effect on July 1, 1980), Y would continue to be the only taxpayer eligible to claim the deduction. However, if Y sold the operating authority to W in February 1981, neither Y nor W would be eligible to claim the monthly deduction for the remainder of the 60-month period. Also, Y would realize gain or loss on the sale after reducing its basis in the authority by any amortization claimed for the period prior to the sale.
(iii) Y must begin the 60-month period in July 1980 unless it elects under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to begin the 60-month period with the first month of the first taxable year beginning after July 1, 1980, which in Y's case would be July 1981.
(iv) Y's allowable monthly deduction is equal to its adjusted basis in the operating authority of $60,000, divided by 60, or $1,000. However, Y may elect under § 1.9200-1(e)(2) to allocate to its basis in the authority a portion of X's basis in Y stock, since X is a qualified acquiring party under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section and Y is a member of an affiliated group of which X is a member. Assuming Y makes the election, Y may allocate to the basis of the authority the amount of X's basis in Y stock that would have been allocable under section 334(b)(2) if X had received the authority in a distribution of all of Y's assets in a complete liquidation of Y immediately after X acquired Y's stock.
Therefore, for purposes of the allocation, X's $130,000 cost basis in Y stock is deemed to be increased by Y's $100,000 of unsecured liabilities to $230,000. Of the $230,000 deemed basis, $180,000 is allocated to the authority, $30,000 to goodwill, and $20,000 to the trucks. Y's allowable monthly amortization deduction would be $180,000 divided by 60, or $3,000. X's $130,000 cost basis in its Y stock must be decreased to $62,174 as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section. Y's $30,000 aggregate basis in its trucks remains unchanged.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that Y's aggregate basis in the trucks is $120,000. If Y makes the election under § 1.9200-1(e)(2), the same allocation as in Example (1) would occur. However, in addition to the decrease in X's basis in its Y stock to $62,174, the $120,000 aggregate basis in the trucks must be reduced to $112,174 (so that the $112,174 basis minus secured liabilities of $50,000 is equal to X's $62,174 remaining stock basis).

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that X pays a negotiated purchase price of $120,000 for the Y stock, in order to take into account an anticipated
tax liability of $10,000, relating to potential section 1245 recapture. If Y makes the election under § 1.9200-1(e)(2), then for purposes of allocating X's basis in Y stock, X's cost basis is deemed to be increased by Y's $100,000 of unsecured liabilities as well as the $10,000 of potential tax liability resulting from section 1245 recapture, to $230,000. The $10,000 of potential recapture tax is treated as a general liability and the deemed basis is allocated among Y's assets as in Example (1). In order to take into account the potential recapture tax liability, such amount must be based on the same fair market values that are used to determine the amount of the stock basis allocable to the operating authority.

§ 1.9200-2
Manner of taking deduction.
(a)
In general.
The deduction provided by § 1.9200-1 shall be taken by multiplying the amount of the monthly deduction determined under § 1.9200-1 (c)(2) for each motor carrier operating authority by the number of months in the taxable year for which the deduction is allowable, and entering the resulting amount at the appropriate place on the taxpayer's return for each year in which the deduction is properly claimed. Additionally, any taxpayer who has claimed the deduction provided by § 1.9200-1 must (unless it has already filed a statement containing the required information) attach a statement to the next income tax return of the taxpayer which has a filing due date on or after June 4, 1984. The statement shall provide, in addition to the taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification number, the following information for each motor carrier operating authority for which a deduction was claimed:
(1) The taxable year of the taxpayer for which the deduction was first claimed;
(2) Whether the taxpayer's deduction was determined using the adjusted basis of the authority under section 1012 or an allocated stock basis under § 1.9200-1(e)(2); and
(3) If an allocation of stock basis has been made under § 1.9200-1(e)(2), the calculations made in determining the amount of basis to be allocated to the authority.
(b)
Filing and amendment of returns.
A taxpayer who has filed its return for the taxable year that includes July 1, 1980, claiming the deduction allowed under § 1.9200-1, may amend its return for such year in order to elect under § 1.9200-1(c)(1)(ii) to begin the 60-month period in the subsequent taxable year. A taxpayer eligible to take the deduction under § 1.9200-1 who has filed its returns for both the taxable year that includes July 1, 1980, and the following taxable year without claiming the deduction, may claim the deduction by filing amended returns or claims for refund for the taxable year in which the taxpayer elects to begin the 60-month period, and for subsequent taxable years. If a taxpayer first claims the deduction on an amended return under the preceding sentence, the statement required by paragraph (a) of this section must be attached to such amended return.
(c)
Deduction taken for operating authority other than under § 1.9200-1.
If a deduction other than the deduction allowed under § 1.9200-1 was taken in any taxable year for the reduction in value of a motor carrier operating authority caused by administrative or legislative actions to decrease restrictions on entry into the interstate motor carrier business, the taxpayer should file an amended return for such taxable year which computes taxable income without regard to such deduction.

§ 1.9300-1
Reduction in taxable income for housing displaced individuals.
(a)
In general.
For a taxable year beginning in the applicable taxable year (as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section), a taxpayer who is a natural person may reduce taxable income by $500 for each displaced individual (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) to whom the taxpayer provides
housing free of charge in, or on the site of, the taxpayer's principal residence for a period of at least 60 consecutive days. A taxpayer may claim the reduction in taxable income for any applicable taxable year in which a consecutive 60-day period ends. A taxpayer may not claim the reduction in taxable income unless the taxpayer includes the taxpayer identification number of the displaced individual on the taxpayer's income tax return.
(b)
Provision of housing
—(1)
Principal residence.
For purposes of this section, the term principal residence has the same meaning as in section 121 and the associated regulations.
See
§ 1.121-1(b)(1) and (b)(2).
(2)
Legal interest required.
A taxpayer is treated as providing housing for purposes of this section only if the taxpayer is an owner or lessee (including a co-owner or co-lessee) of the principal residence.
(3)
Compensation for providing housing.
No reduction in taxable income is allowed under this section to a taxpayer who receives rent or any reimbursement or compensation (whether in cash, services, or property) from any source for providing housing to the displaced individual. For this purpose, lodging, utilities, and other similar items are treated as housing, but telephone calls, food, clothing, transportation, and other similar items are not treated as housing.
(c)
Limitations
—(1)
Dollar limitation
—(i)
In general.
The reduction in taxable income under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed the maximum dollar limitation, and must be reduced by the total amount of all reductions under this section for all prior taxable years (except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section). The maximum dollar limitation is—
(A) $2,000 in the case of an unmarried individual; or
(B) $2,000 in the case of a husband and wife, whether the husband and wife file a joint income tax return or separate income tax returns; married taxpayers filing separate income tax returns may allocate this amount in $500 increments between their respective returns, provided that each spouse is otherwise eligible to claim that reduction in taxable income.
(ii)
Married individuals with separate principal residences.
The limitation in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section applies whether or not the married individuals occupy the same principal residence. A person is treated as married for purposes of this section if the individual is treated as married under section 7703.
(2)
Spouse or dependent of the taxpayer.
No reduction of taxable income is allowed for a displaced individual who is the spouse or a dependent of the taxpayer.
(3)
One reduction per displaced individual.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, a taxpayer may not reduce taxable income under paragraph (a) of this section for a displaced individual for whom the taxpayer or any taxpayer residing in the same principal residence has reduced taxable income under this section for any prior taxable year.
(4)
Taxpayers occupying the same principal residence.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, for all taxable years, only one taxpayer occupying the same principal residence may reduce taxable income for a particular displaced individual.
(5)
Limitations applied separately to each disaster.
The limitations of this paragraph (c) apply separately to each disaster area. Thus, a taxpayer may reduce taxable income by $2,000 for providing housing to Midwestern disaster displaced individuals even though the taxpayer reduced taxable income for providing housing to one or more Hurricane Katrina displaced individuals. For this purpose, all areas within the Midwestern disaster area are treated as one disaster area.
(d)
Substantiation.
A taxpayer claiming a reduction of taxable income under this section must maintain records sufficient to show entitlement to the reduction as provided in forms, instructions, publications or other guidance published by the IRS.
(e) The Commissioner may apply this section in additional guidance of general applicability, see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter, to other disaster areas to which Congress extends relief under section 302 of the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005.

Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples. In each example, a taxpayer provides housing within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section in, or on the site of, the taxpayer's principal residence for a period of at least 60 consecutive days (the 60th day being in the applicable taxable year) for each displaced individual, none of whom is a spouse or dependent of the taxpayer. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A provides housing to N, a Hurricane Katrina displaced individual, from September 1, 2005, until March 10, 2006. Under paragraphs (a) and (c)(3) of this section, A may reduce A's taxable income by $500 on A's income tax return for calendar year 2005 or 2006 (but not both) for providing housing to N.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that A and A's unmarried roommate B are co-lessees of their principal residence. Both A and B provide housing to N. Under paragraphs (a) and (c)(4) of this section, either A or B, but not both, may reduce taxable income by $500 for 2005 or 2006 for providing housing to N. If A or B reduces taxable income for 2005 for providing housing to N, neither A nor B may reduce taxable income for 2006 for providing housing to N.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that in 2009 A and B provide housing to N, who in 2009 is a Midwestern disaster displaced individual. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the limitation of paragraph (c)(4) of this section applies separately to each disaster. Therefore, either A or B may reduce taxable income by $500 for 2009 for providing housing to N.

# Example 4.
During 2008, unmarried roommates and co-lessees C and D provide housing to eight Midwestern disaster displaced individuals. Under paragraphs (a) and (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, C may reduce taxable income by $2,000 on C's 2008 income tax return for providing housing to any four of these displaced individuals and D may reduce taxable income by $2,000 on D's 2008 income tax return for providing housing to the other four displaced individuals.

# Example 5.
(i) In 2008, a married couple, H and W, provide housing to a Midwestern disaster displaced individual, O. H and W file their 2008 income tax return as married filing jointly. Under paragraphs (a) and (c)(4) of this section, H and W may reduce taxable income by $500 on their 2008 income tax return for providing housing to O.
(ii) In 2009, H and W provide housing to O and to another Midwestern disaster displaced individual, P. H and W file their 2009 income tax returns as married filing separately. Because H and W reduced their 2008 taxable income for providing housing to O, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, neither H nor W may reduce taxable income on their 2009 income tax returns for providing housing to O. Under paragraphs (a) and (c)(4) of this section, either H or W but not both, may reduce taxable income by $500 on his or her 2009 income tax return for providing housing to P.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5,
except that in 2009 H and W provide housing to five Midwestern disaster displaced individuals in addition to O. H and W together may reduce taxable income on their 2009 income tax returns by a total of $2,000 for the Midwestern disaster displaced individuals (other than O). Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section, H and W may allocate the $2,000 in increments of $500 between their separate returns. For example, either one may reduce taxable income by $500 and the other may reduce taxable income by $1,500, or H and W each may reduce taxable income by $1,000.
(h)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies for taxable years ending after December 11, 2006.
