informing the public of such action and the effective date of any part 71 program as set forth in § 71.4(a), (b), (c), or (d)(1)(ii). The publication of this part in the
Federal Register
on July 1, 1996 serves as the notice for the part 71 permit programs described in § 71.4(d)(1)(i) and (e). The EPA will also publish a notice in the
Federal Register
of any delegation of a portion of the part 71 program to a State, eligible Tribe, or local agency pursuant to the provisions of § 71.10. In addition to notices published in the
Federal Register
under this paragraph (g), the Administrator will, to the extent practicable, post a notice on a public Web site identified by the Administrator of the part 71 program effectiveness or delegation, and will send a letter to the Tribal governing body for an Indian Tribe or the Governor (or his or her designee) of the affected area to provide notice of such effectiveness or delegation.
(h)
Effect of limited deficiency in the State or Tribal program.
The Administrator may administer and enforce a part 71 program in a State or within Indian country even if only limited deficiencies exist either in the initial program submittal for a State or eligible Tribe under part 70 of this chapter or in an existing State or Tribal program that has been approved under part 70 of this chapter.
(i)
Transition plan for initial permits issuance.
If a full or partial part 71 program becomes effective in a State or within Indian country prior to the issuance of part 70 permits to all part 70 sources under an existing program that has been approved under part 70 of this chapter, the Administrator shall take final action on initial permit applications for all part 71 sources in accordance with the following transition plan.
(1) All part 71 sources that have not received part 70 permits shall submit permit applications under this part within 1 year after the effective date of the part 71 program.
(2) Final action shall be taken on at least one-third of such applications annually over a period not to exceed 3 years after such effective date.
(3) Any complete permit application containing an early reduction demonstration under section 112(i)(5) of the Act shall be acted on within 12 months of receipt of the complete application.
(4) Submittal of permit applications and the permitting of affected sources shall occur in accordance with the deadlines in title IV of the Act and 40 CFR parts 72 through 78.
(j)
Delegation of part 71 program.
The Administrator may promulgate a part 71 program in a State or Indian country and delegate part of the responsibility for administering the part 71 program to the State or eligible Tribe in accordance with the provisions of § 71.10; however, delegation of a part of a part 71 program will not constitute any type of approval of a State or Tribal operating permits program under part 70 of this chapter. Where only selected portions of a part 71 program are administered by the Administrator and the State or eligible Tribe is delegated the remaining portions of the program, the Delegation Agreement referred to in § 71.10 will define the respective roles of the State or eligible Tribe and the Administrator in administering and enforcing the part 71 operating permits program.
(k)
EPA administration and enforcement of part 70 permits.
When the Administrator administers and enforces a part 71 program after a determination and notice under § 70.10(b)(1) of this chapter that a State or Tribe is not adequately administering and enforcing an operating permits program approved under part 70 of this chapter, the Administrator will administer and enforce permits issued under the part 70 program until part 71 permits are issued using the procedures of part 71. Until such time as part 70 permits are replaced by part 71 permits, the Administrator will revise, reopen, revise, terminate, or revoke and reissue part 70 permits using the procedures of part 71 and will assess and collect fees in accordance with the provisions of § 71.9.
(l)
Transition to approved part 70 program.
The Administrator will suspend the issuance of part 71 permits promptly upon publication of notice of approval of a State or Tribal operating permits program that meets the requirements of part 70 of this chapter. The Administrator may retain jurisdiction over the part 71 permits for which the administrative or judicial review process is not complete and will address this issue in the notice of State program approval. After approval of a State or Tribal program and the suspension of issuance of part 71 permits by the Administrator:
(1) The Administrator, or the permitting authority acting as the Administrator's delegated agent, will continue to administer and enforce part 71 permits until they are replaced by permits issued under the approved part 70 program. Until such time as part 71 permits are replaced by part 70 permits, the Administrator will revise, reopen, revise, terminate, or revoke and reissue part 71 permits using the procedures of the part 71 program. However, if the Administrator has delegated authority to administer part 71 permits to a delegate agency, the delegate agency will revise, reopen, terminate, or revoke and reissue part 71 permits using the procedures of the approved part 70 program. If a part 71 permit expires prior to the issuance of a part 70 permit, all terms and conditions of the part 71 permit, including any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 71.6(f), shall remain in effect until the part 70 permit is issued or denied, provided that a timely and complete application for a permit renewal was submitted to the permitting authority in accordance with the requirements of the approved part 70 program.
(2) A State or local agency or Indian Tribe with an approved part 70 operating permits program may issue part 70 permits for all sources with part 71 permits in accordance with a permit issuance schedule approved as part of the approved part 70 program or may issue part 70 permits to such sources at the expiration of the part 71 permits.
(m)
Exemption for certain territories.
Upon petition by the Governor of Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, the Administrator may exempt any source or class of sources in such territory from the requirement to have a part 71 permit under this chapter. Such an exemption does not exempt such source or class of sources from any requirement of section 112 of the Act, including the requirements of section 112 (g) or (j).
(1) Such exemption may be granted if the Administrator finds that compliance with part 71 is not feasible or is unreasonable due to unique geographical, meteorological, or economic factors of such territory, or such other local factors as the Administrator deems significant. Any such petition shall be considered in accordance with section 307(d) of the Act, and any exemption granted under this paragraph (m) shall be considered final action by the Administrator for the purposes of section 307(b) of the Act.
(2) The Administrator shall promptly notify the Committees on Energy and Commerce and on Interior and Insular Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Environment and Public Works and on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate upon receipt of any petition under this paragraph (m) and of the approval or rejection of such petition and the basis for such action.
(n)
Retention of records.
The records for each draft, proposed, and final permit application, renewal, or modification shall be kept by the Administrator for a period of 5 years.
[61 FR 34228, July 1, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 8262, Feb. 19, 1999; 67 FR 38330, June 3, 2002; 81 FR 71630, Oct. 18, 2016]
§ 71.5
Permit applications.
(a)
Duty to apply.
For each part 71 source, the owner or operator shall submit a timely and complete permit application in accordance with this section.
(1)
Timely application.
(i) A timely application for a source which does not have an existing operating permit issued by a State under the State's approved part 70 program and is applying for a part 71 permit for the first time is one that is submitted within 12 months after the source becomes subject to the permit program or on or before such earlier date as the permitting authority may establish. Sources required to submit applications earlier than 12 months after the source becomes subject to the permit program will be notified of the earlier submittal date at least 6 months in advance of the date.
(ii) Part 71 sources required to meet the requirements under section 112(g) of the Act, or to have a permit under the preconstruction review program approved into the applicable implementation plan under part C or D of title I of the Act, shall file a complete application to obtain the part 71 permit or permit revision within 12 months after commencing operation or on or before such earlier date as the permitting authority may establish. Sources required to submit applications earlier than 12 months after the source becomes subject to the permit program will be notified of the earlier submittal date at least 6 months in advance of the date. Where an existing part 70 or 71 permit would prohibit such construction or change in operation, the source must obtain a permit revision before commencing operation.
(iii) For purposes of permit renewal, a timely application is one that is submitted at least 6 months but not more that 18 months prior to expiration of the part 70 or 71 permit.
(iv) Applications for initial phase II acid rain permits shall be submitted to the permitting authority by January 1, 1996 for sulfur dioxide, and by January 1, 1998 for nitrogen oxides.
(2)
Complete application.
To be deemed complete, an application must provide all information required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, except that applications for permit revision need supply such information only if it is related to the proposed change. To be found complete, an initial or renewal application must remit payment of fees owed under the fee schedule established pursuant to § 71.9(b). Information required under paragraph (c) of this section must be sufficient to evaluate the subject source and its application and to determine all applicable requirements. A responsible official must certify the submitted information consistent with paragraph (d) of this section. Unless the permitting authority determines that an application is not complete within 60 days of receipt of the application, such application shall be deemed to be complete, except as otherwise provided in § 71.7(a)(4). If, while processing an application that has been determined or deemed to be complete, the permitting authority determines that additional information is necessary to evaluate or take final action on that application, it may request such information in writing and set a reasonable deadline for a response. The source's ability to operate without a permit, as set forth in § 71.7(b), shall be in effect from the date the application is determined or deemed to be complete until the final permit is issued, provided that the applicant submits any requested additional information by the deadline specified by the permitting authority.
(3)
Confidential information.
An applicant may assert a business confidentiality claim for information requested by the permitting authority using procedures found at part 2, subpart B of this chapter.
(b)
Duty to supplement or correct application.
Any applicant who fails to submit any relevant facts or who has submitted incorrect information in a permit application shall, upon becoming
aware of such failure or incorrect submittal, promptly submit such supplementary facts or corrected information. In addition, an applicant shall provide additional information as necessary to address any requirements that become applicable to the source after the date it filed a complete application but prior to release of a draft permit.
(c)
Standard application form and required information.
The permitting authority shall provide sources a standard application form or forms. The permitting authority may use discretion in developing application forms that best meet program needs and administrative efficiency. The forms and attachments chosen, however, shall include the elements specified below. An application may not omit information needed to determine the applicability of, or to impose, any applicable requirement, or to evaluate the fee amount required under the schedule established pursuant to § 71.9.
(1) Identifying information, including company name and address (or plant name and address if different from the company name), owner's name and agent, and telephone number and names of plant site manager/contact.
(2) A description of the source's processes and products (by SIC Code) including those associated with any proposed AOS identified by the source.
(3) The following emissions-related information:
(i) All emissions of pollutants for which the source is major, and all emissions of regulated air pollutants. A permit application shall describe all emissions of regulated air pollutants emitted from any emissions unit, except where such units are exempted under this paragraph (c). The permitting authority shall require additional information related to the emissions of air pollutants sufficient to verify which requirements are applicable to the source, and other information necessary to collect any permit fees owed under the fee schedule established pursuant to § 71.9(b).
(ii) Identification and description of all points of emissions described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section in sufficient detail to establish the basis for fees and applicability of requirements of the Act.
(iii) Emissions rates in tpy and in such terms as are necessary to establish compliance consistent with the applicable standard reference test method. For emissions units subject to an annual emissions cap, tpy can be reported as part of the aggregate emissions associated with the cap, except where more specific information is needed, including where necessary to determine and/or assure compliance with an applicable requirement.
(iv) The following information to the extent it is needed to determine or regulate emissions: fuels, fuel use, raw materials, production rates, and operating schedules.
(v) Identification and description of air pollution control equipment and compliance monitoring devices or activities.
(vi) Limitations on source operation affecting emissions or any work practice standards, where applicable, for all regulated pollutants at the part 71 source.
(vii) Other information required by any applicable requirement (including information related to stack height limitations developed pursuant to section 123 of the Act).
(viii) Calculations on which the information in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) through (vii) of this section is based.
(4) The following air pollution control requirements:
(i) Citation and description of all applicable requirements; and
(ii) Description of or reference to any applicable test method for determining compliance with each applicable requirement.
(5) Other specific information that may be necessary to implement and enforce other applicable requirements of the Act or of this part or to determine the applicability of such requirements.
(6) An explanation of any proposed exemptions from otherwise applicable requirements.
(7) Additional information as determined to be necessary by the permitting authority to define proposed AOSs identified by the source pursuant to § 71.6(a)(9) or to define permit terms and conditions implementing any AOS under § 71.6(a)(9) or implementing
§ 71.6(a)(10) or § 71.6(a)(13). The permit application shall include documentation demonstrating that the source has obtained all authorization(s) required under the applicable requirements relevant to any proposed AOSs, or a certification that the source has submitted all relevant materials to the appropriate permitting authority for obtaining such authorization(s).
(8) A compliance plan for all part 71 sources that contains all the following:
(i) A description of the compliance status of the source with respect to all applicable requirements.
(ii) A description as follows:
(A) For applicable requirements with which the source is in compliance, a statement that the source will continue to comply with such requirements.
(B) For applicable requirements that will become effective during the permit term, a statement that the source will meet such requirements on a timely basis.
(C) For requirements for which the source is not in compliance at the time of permit issuance, a narrative description of how the source will achieve compliance with such requirements.
(D) For applicable requirements associated with a proposed AOS, a statement that the source will meet such requirements upon implementation of the AOS. If a proposed AOS would implicate an applicable requirement that will become effective during the permit term, a statement that the source will meet such requirements on a timely basis.
(iii) A compliance schedule as follows:
(A) For applicable requirements with which the source is in compliance, a statement that the source will continue to comply with such requirements.
(B) For applicable requirements that will become effective during the permit term, a statement that the source will meet such requirements on a timely basis. A statement that the source will meet in a timely manner applicable requirements that become effective during the permit term shall satisfy this provision, unless a more detailed schedule is expressly required by the applicable requirement.
(C) A schedule of compliance for sources that are not in compliance with all applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance. Such a schedule shall include a schedule of remedial measures, including an enforceable sequence of actions with milestones, leading to compliance with any applicable requirements for which the source will be in noncompliance at the time of permit issuance. This compliance schedule shall resemble and be at least as stringent as that contained in any judicial consent decree or administrative order to which the source is subject. Any such schedule of compliance shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with, the applicable requirements on which it is based.
(D) For applicable requirements associated with a proposed AOS, a statement that the source will meet such requirements upon implementation of the AOS. If a proposed AOS would implicate an applicable requirement that will become effective during the permit term, a statement that the source will meet such requirements on a timely basis. A statement that the source will meet in a timely manner applicable requirements that become effective during the permit term will satisfy this provision, unless a more detailed schedule is expressly required by the applicable requirement.
(iv) A schedule for submission of certified progress reports no less frequently than every 6 months for sources required to have a schedule of compliance to remedy a violation.
(v) The compliance plan content requirements specified in this paragraph shall apply and be included in the acid rain portion of a compliance plan for an affected source, except as specifically superseded by regulations promulgated under parts 72 through 78 of this chapter with regard to the schedule and method(s) the source will use to achieve compliance with the acid rain emissions limitations.
(9) Requirements for compliance certification, including the following:

(10) The use of nationally-standardized forms for acid rain portions of permit applications and compliance plans, as required by regulations promulgated under parts 72 through 78 of this chapter.
(11)
Insignificant activities and emissions levels.
The following types of insignificant activities and emissions levels need not be included in permit applications. However, for insignificant activities which are exempted because of size or production rate, a list of such insignificant activities must be included in the application. An application may not omit information needed to determine the applicability of, or to impose, any applicable requirement, or to calculate the fee amount required under the schedule established pursuant to § 71.9 of this part.
(i)
Insignificant activities:
(A) Mobile sources;
(B) Air-conditioning units used for human comfort that are not subject to applicable requirements under title VI of the Act and do not exhaust air pollutants into the ambient air from any manufacturing or other industrial process;

§ 71.6
Permit content.
(a)
Standard permit requirements.
Each permit issued under this part shall include the following elements:
(1) Emissions limitations and standards, including those operational requirements and limitations that assure compliance with all applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance. Such requirements and limitations may include ARMs identified by the source in its part 71 permit application
as approved by the permitting authority, provided that no ARM shall contravene any terms needed to comply with any otherwise applicable requirement or requirement of this part or circumvent any applicable requirement that would apply as a result of implementing the ARM.
(i) The permit shall specify and reference the origin of and authority for each term or condition, and identify any difference in form as compared to the applicable requirement upon which the term or condition is based.
(ii) The permit shall state that, where an applicable requirement of the Act is more stringent than an applicable requirement of 40 CFR parts 72 through 78, both provisions shall be incorporated into the permit and shall be enforceable by the Administrator.
(iii) If an applicable implementation plan allows a determination of an alternative emission limit at a part 71 source, equivalent to that contained in the plan, to be made in the permit issuance, renewal, or significant modification process, and the permitting authority elects to use such process, any permit containing such equivalency determination shall contain provisions to ensure that any resulting emissions limit has been demonstrated to be quantifiable, accountable, enforceable, and based on replicable procedures.
(2)
Permit duration.
The permitting authority shall issue permits for a fixed term of 5 years in the case of affected sources, and for a term not to exceed 5 years in the case of all other sources. Notwithstanding this requirement, the permitting authority shall issue permits for solid waste incineration units combusting municipal waste subject to standards under section 129(e) of the Act for a period not to exceed 12 years and shall review such permits at least every 5 years.
(3)
Monitoring and related recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
(i) Each permit shall contain the following requirements with respect to monitoring:
(A) All monitoring and analysis procedures or test methods required under applicable monitoring and testing requirements, including part 64 of this chapter and any other procedures and methods that may be promulgated pursuant to sections 114(a)(3) or 504(b) of the Act. If more than one monitoring or testing requirement applies, the permit may specify a streamlined set of monitoring or testing provisions provided the specified monitoring or testing is adequate to assure compliance at least to the same extent as the monitoring or testing applicable requirements that are not included in the permit as a result of such streamlining;
(B) Where the applicable requirement does not require periodic testing or instrumental or noninstrumental monitoring (which may consist of recordkeeping designed to serve as monitoring), periodic monitoring sufficient to yield reliable data from the relevant time period that are representative of the source's compliance with the permit, as reported pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section. Such monitoring requirements shall assure use of terms, test methods, units, averaging periods, and other statistical conventions consistent with the applicable requirement. Recordkeeping provisions may be sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B); and
(C) As necessary, requirements concerning the use, maintenance, and, where appropriate, installation of monitoring equipment or methods.
(ii) With respect to recordkeeping, the permit shall incorporate all applicable recordkeeping requirements and require, where applicable, the following:
(A) Records of required monitoring information that include the following:
(
1
) The date, place as defined in the permit, and time of sampling or measurements;
(
2
) The date(s) analyses were performed;
(
3
) The company or entity that performed the analyses;
(
4
) The analytical techniques or methods used;
(
5
) The results of such analyses; and
(
6
) The operating conditions as existing at the time of sampling or measurement;
(B) Retention of records of all required monitoring data and support information for a period of at least 5 years from the date of the monitoring
sample, measurement, report, or application. Support information includes all calibration and maintenance records and all original strip-chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, and copies of all reports required by the permit.
(iii) With respect to reporting, the permit shall incorporate all applicable reporting requirements and require the following:
(A) Submittal of reports of any required monitoring at least every 6 months. All instances of deviations from permit requirements must be clearly identified in such reports. All required reports must be certified by a responsible official consistent with § 71.5(d).
(B) Prompt reporting of deviations from permit requirements, including those attributable to upset conditions as defined in the permit, the probable cause of such deviations, and any corrective actions or preventive measures taken. Where the underlying applicable requirement contains a definition of prompt or otherwise specifies a time frame for reporting deviations, that definition or time frame shall govern. Where the underlying applicable requirement fails to address the time frame for reporting deviations, reports of deviations shall be submitted to the permitting authority based on the following schedule:
(
1
) For emissions of a hazardous air pollutant or a toxic air pollutant (as identified in an applicable regulation) that continue for more than an hour in excess of permit requirements, the report must be made with 24 hours of the occurrence.
(
2
) For emissions of any regulated air pollutant, excluding those listed in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, that continue for more than two hours in excess of permit requirements, the report must be made within 48 hours.
(
3
) For all other deviations from permit requirements, the report shall be contained in the report submitted in accordance with the timeframe given in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A).
(
4
) A permit may contain a more stringent reporting requirement than required by paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
), (
2
), or (
3
).
If any of the above conditions are met, the source must notify the permitting authority by telephone or facsimile based on the timetable listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(B) (
1
) through (
4
) of this section. A written notice, certified consistent with § 71.5(d), must be submitted within 10 working days of the occurrence. All deviations reported under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section must also be identified in the 6 month report required under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
(C) For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, deviation means any situation in which an emissions unit fails to meet a permit term or condition. A deviation is not always a violation. A deviation can be determined by observation or through review of data obtained from any testing, monitoring, or recordkeeping established in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section. For a situation lasting more than 24 hours which constitutes a deviation, each 24 hour period is considered a separate deviation. Included in the meaning of deviation are any of the following:
(
1
) A situation where emissions exceed an emission limitation or standard;
(
2
) A situation where process or emissions control device parameter values indicate that an emission limitation or standard has not been met;
(
3
) A situation in which observations or data collected demonstrates noncompliance with an emission limitation or standard or any work practice or operating condition required by the permit;
(
4
) A situation in which an exceedance or an excursion, as defined in part 64 of this chapter, occurs.
(4) A permit condition prohibiting emissions exceeding any allowances that the source lawfully holds under 40 CFR parts 72 through 78.
(i) No permit revision shall be required for increases in emissions that are authorized by allowances acquired pursuant to the acid rain program, provided that such increases do not require a permit revision under any other applicable requirement.
(ii) No limit shall be placed on the number of allowances held by the
source. The source may not, however, use allowances as a defense to noncompliance with any other applicable requirement.
(iii) Any such allowance shall be accounted for according to the procedures established in regulations 40 CFR parts 72 through 78.
(5) A severability clause to ensure the continued validity of the various permit requirements in the event of a challenge to any portions of the permit.
(6) Provisions stating the following:
(i) The permittee must comply with all conditions of the part 71 permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit renewal application.
(ii) Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit.
(iii) The permit may be modified, revoked, reopened, and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or of a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition.
(iv) The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege.
(v) The permittee shall furnish to the permitting authority, within a reasonable time, any information that the permitting authority may request in writing to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing, or terminating the permit or to determine compliance with the permit. Upon request, the permittee shall also furnish to the permitting authority copies of records required to be kept by the permit or, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, for information claimed to be confidential, the permittee may furnish such records directly to the Administrator along with a claim of confidentiality.
(7) A provision to ensure that a part 71 source pays fees to the Administrator consistent with the fee schedule approved pursuant to § 71.9.
(8)
Emissions trading.
A provision stating that no permit revision shall be required, under any approved economic incentives, marketable permits, emissions trading and other similar programs or processes for changes that are provided for in the permit.
(9) Terms and conditions for reasonably anticipated AOSs identified by the source in its application as approved by the permitting authority. Such terms and conditions:
(i) Shall require the source, contemporaneously with making a change from one operating scenario to another, to record in a log at the permitted facility a record of the AOS under which it is operating;
(ii) May extend the permit shield described in paragraph (f) of this section to all terms and conditions under each such AOS; and
(iii) Must ensure that the terms and conditions of each AOS meet all applicable requirements and the requirements of this part. The permitting authority shall not approve a proposed AOS into the part 71 permit until the source has obtained all authorizations required under any applicable requirement relevant to that AOS.
(10) Terms and conditions, if the permit applicant requests them, for the trading of emissions increases and decreases in the permitted facility, to the extent that the applicable requirements provide for trading such increases and decreases without a case-by-case approval of each emissions trade. Such terms and conditions:
(i) Shall include all terms required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section to determine compliance;
(ii) May extend the permit shield described in paragraph (f) of this section to all terms and conditions that allow such increases and decreases in emissions; and
(iii) Must meet all applicable requirements and requirements of this part.
(11)
Permit expiration.
A provision to ensure that a part 71 permit expires upon the earlier occurrence of the following events:
(i) twelve years elapses from the date of issuance to a solid waste incineration unit combusting municipal waste subject to standards under section 112(e) of the Act; or
(ii) five years elapses from the date of issuance; or
(iii) the source is issued a part 70 permit.
(12)
Off permit changes.
A provision allowing changes that are not addressed or prohibited by the permit, other than those subject to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 72 through 78 or those that are modifications under any provision of title I of the Act to be made without a permit revision, provided that the following requirements are met:
(i) Each such change shall meet all applicable requirements and shall not violate any existing permit term or condition;
(ii) Sources must provide contemporaneous written notice to the permitting authority (and EPA, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) of each such change, except for changes that qualify as insignificant under § 71.5(c)(11). Such written notice shall describe each such change, including the date, any change in emissions, pollutants emitted, and any applicable requirement that would apply as a result of the change;
(iii) The change shall not qualify for the shield under § 71.6(f);
(iv) The permittee shall keep a record describing changes made at the source that result in emissions of a regulated air pollutant subject to an applicable requirement, but not otherwise regulated under the permit, and the emissions resulting from those changes.

Operational flexibility.
Provisions consistent with paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section to allow changes within a permitted facility without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions): Provided, that the facility provides the Administrator (in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) and the permitting authority with written notification as required below in advance of the proposed changes, which shall be a minimum of 7 days.
(i) The permit shall allow the permitted source to make section 502(b)(10) changes without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions).
(A) For each such change, the written notification required above shall include a brief description of the change within the permitted facility, the date on which the change will occur, any change in emissions, and any permit term or condition that is no longer applicable as a result of the change.
(B) The permit shield described in § 71.6(f) shall not apply to any change made pursuant to this paragraph (a)(13)(i).
(ii) The permit may provide for the permitted source to trade increases and decreases in emissions in the permitted facility, where the applicable implementation plan provides for such emissions trades without requiring a permit revision and based on the 7-day notice prescribed in this paragraph (a)(13)(ii) of this section. This provision is available in those cases where the permit does not already provide for such emissions trading.
(A) Under this paragraph (a)(13)(ii), the written notification required above shall include such information as may be required by the provision in the applicable implementation plan authorizing the emissions trade, including at a minimum, when the proposed change will occur, a description of each such change, any change in emissions, the permit requirements with which the source will comply using the emissions trading provisions of the applicable implementation plan, and the pollutants emitted subject to the emissions trade. The notice shall also refer to the provisions with which the source will comply in the applicable implementation plan and that provide for the emissions trade.
(B) The permit shield described in § 71.6(f) shall not extend to any change
made under this paragraph (a)(13)(ii). Compliance with the permit requirements that the source will meet using the emissions trade shall be determined according to requirements of the applicable implementation plan authorizing the emissions trade.
(iii) The permit shall require the permitting authority, if a permit applicant requests it, to issue permits that contain terms and conditions, including all terms required under § 71.6 (a) and (c) to determine compliance, allowing for the trading of emissions increases and decreases in the permitted facility solely for the purpose of complying with a federally-enforceable emissions cap that is established in the permit independent of otherwise applicable requirements. The permit applicant shall include in its application proposed replicable procedures and permit terms that ensure the emissions trades are quantifiable and enforceable. The permitting authority shall not be required to include in the emissions trading provisions any emissions units for which emissions are not quantifiable or for which there are no replicable procedures to enforce the emissions trades. The permit shall also require compliance with all applicable requirements.
(A) Under this paragraph (a)(13)(iii), the written notification required above shall state when the change will occur and shall describe the changes in emissions that will result and how these increases and decreases in emissions will comply with the terms and conditions of the permit.
(B) The permit shield described in § 71.6(f) may extend to terms and conditions that allow such increases and decreases in emissions.
(b)
Federally-enforceable requirements.
All terms and conditions in a part 71 permit, including any provisions designed to limit a source's potential to emit, are enforceable by the Administrator and citizens under the Act.
(c)
Compliance requirements.
All part 71 permits shall contain the following elements with respect to compliance:
(1) Consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, compliance certification, testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit. Any document (including reports) required by a part 71 permit shall contain a certification by a responsible official that meets the requirements of § 71.5(d).
(2) Inspection and entry requirements that require that, upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the permittee shall allow the permitting authority or an authorized representative to perform the following:
(i) Enter upon the permittee's premises where a part 71 source is located or emissions-related activity is conducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of the permit;
(ii) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit;
(iii) Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under the permit; and
(iv) As authorized by the Act, sample or monitor at reasonable times substances or parameters for the purpose of assuring compliance with the permit or applicable requirements.
(3) A schedule of compliance consistent with § 71.5(c)(8).
(4) Progress reports consistent with an applicable schedule of compliance and § 71.5(c)(8) to be submitted at least semiannually, or at a more frequent period if specified in the applicable requirement or by the permitting authority. Such progress reports shall contain the following:
(i) Dates for achieving the activities, milestones, or compliance required in the schedule of compliance, and dates when such activities, milestones or compliance were achieved; and
(ii) An explanation of why any dates in the schedule of compliance were not or will not be met, and any preventive or corrective measures adopted.
(5) Requirements for compliance certification with terms and conditions contained in the permit, including emission limitations, standards, or work practices. Permits shall include each of the following:
(i) The frequency (not less than annually or such more frequent periods as
specified in the applicable requirement or by the permitting authority) of submissions of compliance certifications;
(ii) In accordance with § 71.6(a)(3), a means for monitoring the compliance of the source with its emissions limitations, standards, and work practices;
(iii) A requirement that the compliance certification include all of the following (provided that the identification of applicable information may cross-reference the permit or previous reports, as applicable):
(A) The identification of each term or condition of the permit that is the basis of the certification;
(B) The identification of the method(s) or other means used by the owner or operator for determining the compliance status with each term and condition during the certification period. Such methods and other means shall include, at a minimum, the methods and means required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If necessary, the owner or operator also shall identify any other material information that must be included in the certification to comply with section 113(c)(2) of the Act, which prohibits knowingly making a false certification or omitting material information;
(C) The status of compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit for the period covered by the certification, including whether compliance during the period was continuous or intermittent. The certification shall be based on the method or means designated in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section. The certification shall identify each deviation and take it into account in the compliance certification; and
(D) Such other facts as the permitting authority may require to determine the compliance status of the source.
(iv) A requirement that all compliance certifications be submitted to the Administrator as well as to the permitting authority.
(6) Such other provisions as the permitting authority may require.
(d)
General permits.
(1) The permitting authority may, after notice and opportunity for public participation provided under § 71.11, issue a general permit covering numerous similar sources. Any general permit shall comply with all requirements applicable to other part 71 permits and shall identify criteria by which sources may qualify for the general permit. To sources that qualify, the permitting authority shall grant the conditions and terms of the general permit. Notwithstanding the shield provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, the source shall be subject to enforcement action for operation without a part 71 permit if the source is later determined not to qualify for the conditions and terms of the general permit. General permits shall not be authorized for affected sources under the acid rain program unless otherwise provided in 40 CFR parts 72 through 78.
(2) Part 71 sources that would qualify for a general permit must apply to the permitting authority for coverage under the terms of the general permit or must apply for a part 71 permit consistent with § 71.5. The permitting authority may, in the general permit, provide for applications which deviate from the requirements of § 71.5, provided that such applications meet the requirements of title V of the Act, and include all information necessary to determine qualification for, and to assure compliance with, the general permit. Without repeating the public participation procedures required under § 71.11, the permitting authority may grant a source's request for authorization to operate under a general permit, but such a grant shall not be a final permit action for purposes of judicial review.
(e)
Temporary sources.
The permitting authority may issue a single permit authorizing emissions from similar operations by the same source owner or operator at multiple temporary locations. The operation must be temporary and involve at least one change of location during the term of the permit. No affected source shall be permitted as a temporary source. Permits for temporary sources shall include the following:
(1) Conditions that will assure compliance with all applicable requirements at all authorized locations;
(2) Requirements that the owner or operator notify the permitting authority at least 10 days in advance of each change in location; and
(3) Conditions that assure compliance with all other provisions of this section.
(f)
Permit shield.
(1) Except as provided in this part, the permitting authority may expressly include in a part 71 permit a provision stating that compliance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance with any applicable requirements as of the date of permit issuance, provided that:
(i) Such applicable requirements are included and are specifically identified in the permit; or
(ii) The permitting authority, in acting on the permit application or revision, determines in writing that other requirements specifically identified are not applicable to the source, and the permit includes the determination or a concise summary thereof.
(2) A part 71 permit that does not expressly state that a permit shield exists shall be presumed not to provide such a shield.
(3) Nothing in this paragraph or in any part 71 permit shall alter or affect the following:
(i) The provisions of section 303 of the Act (emergency orders), including the authority of the Administrator under that section;
(ii) The liability of an owner or operator of a source for any violation of applicable requirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance;
(iii) The applicable requirements of the acid rain program, consistent with section 408(a) of the Act; or
(iv) The ability of EPA to obtain information from a source pursuant to section 114 of the Act.
[61 FR 34228, July 1, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 54947, Oct. 22, 1997; 66 FR 12876, Mar. 1, 2001; 66 FR 55885, Nov. 5, 2001; 68 FR 38523, June 27, 2003; 74 FR 51440, Oct. 6, 2009; 79 FR 43667, July 28, 2014; 88 FR 47054, July 21, 2023]
§ 71.7
Permit issuance, renewal, reopenings, and revisions.
(a)
Action on application.
(1) A permit, permit modification, or renewal may be issued only if all of the following conditions have been met:
(i) The permitting authority has received a complete application for a permit, permit modification, or permit renewal, except that a complete application need not be received before issuance of a general permit under § 71.6(d);
(ii) Except for modifications qualifying for minor permit modification procedures under paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section, the permitting authority has complied with the requirements for public participation under this section or § 71.11, as applicable;
(iii) The permitting authority has complied with the requirements for notifying and responding to affected States under § 71.8(a);
(iv) The conditions of the permit provide for compliance with all applicable requirements and the requirements of this part; and
(v) In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, the Administrator has received a copy of the proposed permit and any notices required under § 71.10(d) and has not objected to issuance of the permit under § 71.10(g) within the time period specified therein.
(2) Except as provided under the initial transition plan provided for under § 71.4(i) or under 40 CFR part 72 or title V of the Act for the permitting of affected sources under the acid rain program, the permitting authority shall take final action on each permit application (including a request for permit modification or renewal) within 18 months after receiving a complete application.
(3) The permitting authority shall ensure that priority is given to taking action on applications for construction or modification under title I, parts C and D of the Act.
(4) The permitting authority shall promptly provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete. Unless the permitting authority requests additional information or otherwise notifies the applicant of incompleteness within 60 days of receipt of an application, the application shall be deemed complete. For modifications processed through minor permit modification procedures, such as those in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section, the permitting authority need not make a completeness determination.
(5) The permitting authority shall provide a statement that sets forth the legal and factual basis for the draft permit conditions (including references
to the applicable statutory or regulatory provisions). The permitting authority shall send this statement to any person who requests it, and to EPA, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10.
(6) The submittal of a complete application shall not affect the requirement that any source have a preconstruction permit under title I of the Act.
(b)
Requirement for a permit.
Except as provided in the following sentence, § 71.6(a)(13), and paragraphs (e)(1)(v) and e(2)(v) of this section, no part 71 source may operate after the time that it is required to submit a timely and complete application under this part, except in compliance with a permit issued under this part. If a part 71 source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance (including for renewal), the source's failure to have a part 71 permit is not a violation of this part until the permitting authority takes final action on the permit application, except as noted in this section. This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination made pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and as required by § 71.5(c), the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified in writing by the permitting authority any additional information identified as being needed to process the application.
(c)
Permit renewal and expiration.
(1) (i) Permits being renewed are subject to the same procedural requirements, including those for public participation, affected State review, and EPA review (in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) that apply to initial permit issuance.
(ii) Permit expiration terminates the source's right to operate unless a timely and complete renewal application has been submitted consistent with paragraph (b) of this section and § 71.5(a)(1)(iii).
(2) In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, if the permitting authority fails to act in a timely way on permit renewal, EPA may invoke its authority under section 505(e) of the Act to terminate or revoke and reissue the permit.
(3) If a timely and complete application for a permit renewal is submitted, consistent with § 71.5(a)(2), but the permitting authority has failed to issue or deny the renewal permit before the end of the term of the previous part 70 or 71 permit, then the permit shall not expire until the renewal permit has been issued or denied and any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 71.6(f) may extend beyond the original permit term until renewal; or all the terms and conditions of the permit including any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 71.6(f) shall remain in effect until the renewal permit has been issued or denied.
(d)
Administrative permit amendments.
(1) An “administrative permit amendment” is a permit revision that:
(i) Corrects typographical errors;
(ii) Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor administrative change at the source;
(iii) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee;
(iv) Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of a source where the permitting authority determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the permitting authority;
(v) Incorporates into the part 71 permit the requirements from preconstruction review permits authorized under an EPA-approved program, provided that such a program meets procedural requirements substantially equivalent to the requirements of §§ 71.7 and 71.8 (and § 71.10 in the case of a delegated program) that would be applicable to the change if it were subject to review as a permit modification, and compliance requirements substantially equivalent to those contained in § 71.6; or
(vi) Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator has determined to be similar to those in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(2) Administrative permit amendments for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by 40 CFR part 72.
(3)
Administrative permit amendment procedures.
An administrative permit amendment may be made by the permitting authority consistent with the following:
(i) The permitting authority shall take no more than 60 days from receipt of a request for an administrative permit amendment to take final action on such request, and may incorporate such changes without providing notice to the public or affected States provided that it designates any such permit revisions as having been made pursuant to this paragraph.
(ii) The permitting authority shall submit a copy of the revised permit to the Administrator in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10.
(iii) The source may implement the changes addressed in the request for an administrative amendment immediately upon submittal of the request.
(4) The permitting authority may, upon taking final action granting a request for an administrative permit amendment, allow coverage by the permit shield in § 71.6(f) for administrative permit amendments made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section which meet the relevant requirements of §§ 71.6, 71.7, and 71.8 for significant permit modifications.
(e)
Permit modifications.
A permit modification is any revision to a part 71 permit that cannot be accomplished under the provisions for administrative permit amendments under paragraph (d) of this section. A permit modification for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by 40 CFR part 72.
(1)
Minor permit modification procedures.
(i) Criteria. (A) Minor permit modification procedures may be used only for those permit modifications that:
(
1
) Do not violate any applicable requirement;
(
2
) Do not involve significant changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or recordkeeping requirements in the permit;
(
3
) Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of an emission limitation or other standard, or a source-specific determination for temporary sources of ambient impacts, or a visibility or increment analysis;
(
4
) Do not seek to establish or change a permit term or condition for which there is no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has assumed to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would otherwise be subject. Such terms and conditions include:
(
i
) A federally enforceable emissions cap assumed to avoid classification as a modification under any provision of title I; and
(
ii
) An alternative emissions limit approved pursuant to regulations promulgated under section 112(i)(5) of the Act;
(
5
) Are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act; and
(
6
) Are not required to be processed as a significant modification.
(B) Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(1)(i)(A) and (e)(2)(i) of this section, minor permit modification procedures may be used for permit modifications involving the use of economic incentives, marketable permits, emissions trading, and other similar approaches, to the extent that such minor permit modification procedures are explicitly provided for in an applicable implementation plan or in applicable requirements promulgated by EPA.
(ii)
Application.
An application requesting the use of minor permit modification procedures shall meet the requirements of § 71.5(c) and shall include the following:
(A) A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the change occurs;
(B) The source's suggested draft permit;
(C) Certification by a responsible official, consistent with § 71.5(d), that the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of minor permit modification procedures and a request that such procedures be used; and
(D) Completed forms for the permitting authority to use to notify affected States (and the Administrator in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) as required under §§ 71.8 and 71.10(d).
(iii)
EPA and affected State notification.
Within 5 working days of receipt of a complete permit modification application, the permitting authority shall meet its obligation under § 71.8(a) to notify affected States (and its obligation under § 71.10(d) to notify the Administrator in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) of the requested permit modification. In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, the permitting authority promptly shall send any notice required under § 71.8(b) to the Administrator.
(iv)
Timetable for issuance.
In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, the permitting authority may not issue a final permit modification until after EPA's 45-day review period or until EPA has notified the permitting authority that EPA will not object to issuance of the permit modification, whichever is first, although the permitting authority can approve the permit modification prior to that time. Within 90 days of the permitting authority's receipt of an application under minor permit modification procedures (or 15 days after the end of the Administrator's 45-day review period under § 71.10(g) in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, whichever is later), the permitting authority shall:
(A) Issue the permit modification as proposed;
(B) Deny the permit modification application;
(C) Determine that the requested modification does not meet the minor permit modification criteria and should be reviewed under the significant modification procedures; or
(D) Revise the draft permit modification (and, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, transmit to the Administrator the new proposed permit modification as required by § 71.10(d)).
(v)
Source's ability to make change.
The source may make the change proposed in its minor permit modification application immediately after it files such application. After the source makes the change allowed by the preceding sentence, and until the permitting authority takes any of the actions specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) (A) through (C) of this section, the source must comply with both the applicable requirements governing the change and the proposed permit terms and conditions. During this time period, the source need not comply with the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify. However, if the source fails to comply with its proposed permit terms and conditions during this time period, the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify may be enforced against it.
(vi)
Permit shield.
The permit shield under § 71.6(f) may not extend to minor permit modifications.
(2)
Group processing of minor permit modifications.
Consistent with this paragraph, the permitting authority may modify the procedure outlined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to process groups of a source's applications for certain modifications eligible for minor permit modification processing.
(i)
Criteria.
Group processing of modifications may be used only for those permit modifications:
(A) That meet the criteria for minor permit modification procedures under paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section; and
(B) That collectively are below the threshold level of 10 percent of the emissions allowed by the permit for the emissions unit for which the change is requested, 20 percent of the applicable definition of major source in § 71.2, or 5 tpy, whichever is least.
(ii)
Application.
An application requesting the use of group processing procedures shall meet the requirements of § 71.5(c) and shall include the following:
(A) A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the change occurs.
(B) The source's suggested draft permit.
(C) Certification by a responsible official, consistent with § 71.5(d), that the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of group processing procedures and a request that such procedures be used.
(D) A list of the source's other pending applications awaiting group processing, and a determination of whether the requested modification, aggregated
with these other applications, equals or exceeds the threshold set under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(E) Certification, consistent with § 71.5(d), that, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, the source has notified EPA of the proposed modification. Such notification need only contain a brief description of the requested modification.
(F) Completed forms for the permitting authority to use to notify affected States as required under § 71.8 (and the Administrator as required under § 71.10(d) in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10).
(iii)
EPA and affected State notification.
On a quarterly basis or within 5 business days of receipt of an application demonstrating that the aggregate of a source's pending applications equals or exceeds the threshold level set under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, whichever is earlier, the permitting authority promptly shall meet its obligation under § 71.8(a) to notify affected States (and its obligation under § 71.10(d) to notify EPA in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) of the requested permit modification. The permitting authority shall send any notice required under § 71.8(b) to the Administrator in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10.
(iv)
Timetable for issuance.
The provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall apply to modifications eligible for group processing, except that the permitting authority shall take one of the actions specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) (A) through (D) of this section within 180 days of receipt of the application (or, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, 15 days after the end of the Administrator's 45-day review period under § 71.10(g), whichever is later).
(v)
Source's ability to make change.
The provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section shall apply to modifications eligible for group processing.
(vi)
Permit shield.
The provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(vi) of this section shall also apply to modifications eligible for group processing.
(3)
Significant modification procedures
—(i)
Criteria.
Significant modification procedures shall be used for applications requesting permit modifications that do not qualify as minor permit modifications or as administrative amendments. Every significant change in existing monitoring permit terms or conditions and every relaxation of reporting or recordkeeping permit terms or conditions shall be considered significant. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude the permittee from making changes consistent with this part that would render existing permit compliance terms and conditions irrelevant.
(ii) Significant permit modifications shall meet all requirements of this part, including those for applications, public participation, review by affected States, and review by EPA (in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10), as they apply to permit issuance and permit renewal. The permitting authority shall design and implement this review process to complete review on the majority of significant permit modifications within 9 months after receipt of a complete application.
(f)
Reopening for cause.
(1) Each issued permit shall include provisions specifying the conditions under which the permit will be reopened prior to the expiration of the permit. A permit shall be reopened and revised under any of the following circumstances:
(i) Additional applicable requirements under the Act become applicable to a major part 71 source with a remaining permit term of 3 or more years. Such a reopening shall be completed not later than 18 months after promulgation of the applicable requirement. No such reopening is required if the effective date of the requirement is later than the date on which the permit is due to expire, unless the original permit or any of its terms and conditions have been extended pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii) Additional requirements (including excess emissions requirements) become applicable to an affected source under the acid rain program. Upon approval by the Administrator, excess emissions offset plans shall be deemed to be incorporated into the permit.
(iii) The permitting authority (or EPA, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) determines
that the permit contains a material mistake or that inaccurate statements were made in establishing the emissions standards or other terms or conditions of the permit.
(iv) The permitting authority (or EPA, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) determines that the permit must be revised or revoked to assure compliance with the applicable requirements.
(2) Proceedings to reopen and issue a permit shall follow the same procedures as apply to initial permit issuance and shall affect only those parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists, and shall be made as expeditiously as practicable.
(3) Reopenings under paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not be initiated before a notice of such intent is provided to the part 71 source by the permitting authority at least 30 days in advance of the date that the permit is to be reopened, except that the permitting authority may provide a shorter time period in the case of an emergency.
(g)
Reopenings for cause by EPA for delegated programs.
(1) In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, if the Administrator finds that cause exists to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue a permit pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the Administrator will notify the permitting authority and the permittee of such finding in writing.
(2) The permitting authority shall, within 90 days after receipt of such notification, forward to EPA a proposed determination of termination, modification, or revocation and reissuance, as appropriate. The Administrator may extend this 90-day period for an additional 90 days if he or she finds that a new or revised permit application is necessary or that the permitting authority must require the permittee to submit additional information.
(3) The Administrator will review the proposed determination from the permitting authority within 90 days of receipt.
(4) The permitting authority shall have 90 days from receipt of an EPA objection to resolve any objection that EPA makes and to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit in accordance with the Administrator's objection.
(5) If the permitting authority fails to submit a proposed determination pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section or fails to resolve any objection pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the Administrator will terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit after taking the following actions:
(i) Providing at least 30 days' notice to the permittee in writing of the reasons for any such action. This notice may be given during the procedures in paragraphs (g) (1) through (4) of this section.
(ii) Providing the permittee an opportunity for comment on the Administrator's proposed action and an opportunity for a hearing.
§ 71.8
Affected State review.
(a)
Notice of draft permits.
When a part 71 operating permits program becomes effective in a State or within Indian country, the permitting authority shall provide notice of each draft permit to any affected State, as defined in § 71.2 on or before the time that the permitting authority provides this notice to the public pursuant to § 71.7 or § 71.11(d) except to the extent § 71.7(e)(1) or (2) requires the timing of the notice to be different.
(b)
Notice of refusal to accept recommendations.
Prior to issuance of the final permit, the permitting authority shall notify any affected State in writing of any refusal by the permitting authority to accept all recommendations for the proposed permit that the affected State submitted during the public or affected State review period. The notice shall include the permitting authority's reasons for not accepting any such recommendation. The permitting authority is not required to accept recommendations that are not based on applicable requirements or the requirements of this part. In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, the permitting authority shall include such notice as part of the submittal of the proposed permit to the Administrator (or as soon as possible after the submittal for minor permit modification procedures allowed under § 71.7(e)(1) or (2)).
(c)
Waiver of notice requirements.
The Administrator may waive the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for any category of sources (including any class, type, or size within such category) other than major sources by regulation for a category of sources nationwide.
(d)
Notice provided to Indian Tribes.
The permitting authority shall provide notice of each draft permit to any federally recognized Indian Tribe:
(1) Whose air quality may be affected by the permitting action and is in an area contiguous to the jurisdiction in which the part 71 permit is proposed; or
(2) Is within 50 miles of the permitted source.

§ 71.9
Permit fees.
(a)
Fee requirement.
The owners or operators of part 71 sources shall pay annual fees, or the equivalent over some other period, that are sufficient to cover the permit program costs, in accordance with the procedures described in this section.
(b)
Permit program costs.
These costs include, but are not limited to, the costs of the following activities as they relate to a part 71 program:
(1) Reviewing and acting on any application for a permit, permit revision, or permit renewal, including the development of an applicable requirement as part of the processing of a permit, or permit revision or renewal;
(2) Processing permit reopenings;
(3) General administrative costs of the permit program, including transition planning, interagency coordination, contract management, training, informational services and outreach activities, assessing and collecting fees, the tracking of permit applications, compliance certifications, and related data entry;
(4) Implementing and enforcing the terms of any part 71 permit (not including any court costs or other costs associated with an enforcement action), including adequate resources to determine which sources are subject to the program;
(5) Emissions and ambient monitoring, modeling, analyses, demonstrations, preparation of inventories, and tracking emissions, provided these activities are needed in order to issue and implement part 71 permits; and
(6) Providing direct and indirect support to small business stationary sources in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under this part (to the extent that these services are not provided by a State Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program).
(c)
Establishment of fee schedule.
(1) For part 71 programs that are administered by EPA, each part 71 source shall pay an annual fee which is the sum of:
(i) $32 per ton (as adjusted pursuant to the criteria set forth in paragraph (n)(1) of this section) times the total tons of the actual emissions of each regulated pollutant (for fee calculation) emitted from the source, including fugitive emissions; and
(ii) Any GHG fee adjustment required under paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
(2) For part 71 programs that are fully delegated pursuant to § 71.10:
(i) Where the EPA has not suspended its part 71 fee collection pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the annual fee for each part 71 source shall be the sum of:
(A) $24 per ton (as adjusted pursuant to the criteria set forth in paragraph (n)(1) of this section) times the total tons of the actual emissions of each regulated pollutant (for fee calculation) emitted from the source, including fugitive emissions; and
(B) Any GHG fee adjustment required under paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
(ii) Where the delegate State collects fees from part 71 sources under State law which are sufficient to fund the delegated part 71 program, the EPA may suspend its collection of part 71 fees. The specific terms and conditions regarding the suspension of fee collection will be addressed in the applicable delegation agreement pursuant to § 71.10.
(3) For part 71 programs that are administered by EPA with contractor assistance, the per ton fee shall vary depending on the extent of contractor involvement and the cost to EPA of contractor assistance. The EPA shall establish a per ton fee that is based on the contractor costs for the specific
part 71 program that is being administered, using the following formula:
Cost per ton = (
E
× 32) + [(1 −
E
) × $
C
]
Where
E
represents EPA's proportion of total effort (expressed as a percentage of total effort) needed to administer the part 71 program, 1 −
E
represents the contractor's effort, and
C
represents the contractor assistance cost on a per ton basis.
C
shall be computed by using the following formula:
C
= [
B
+
T
+
N
] divided by 12,300,000
Where
B
represents the base cost (contractor costs), where
T
represents travel costs, and where
N
represents nonpersonnel data management and tracking costs. In addition, each part 71 source shall pay a GHG fee adjustment for each activity as required under paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
(4) For programs that are delegated in part, the fee shall be computed using the following formula:
Cost per ton = (
E
× 32) + (
D
× 24) + [(1 −
E
−
D
) × $
C
]
Where
E
and
D
represent, respectively, the EPA and delegate agency proportions of total effort (expressed as a percentage of total effort) needed to administer the part 71 program, 1 −
E
−
D
represents the contractor's effort, and
C
represents the contractor assistance cost on a per ton basis.
C
shall be computed using the formula for contractor assistance cost found in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and shall be zero if contractor assistance is not utilized. In addition, each part 71 source shall pay a GHG fee adjustment for each activity as required under paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
(5) The following emissions shall be excluded from the calculation of fees under paragraph (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section:
(i) The amount of a part 71 source's actual emissions of each regulated pollutant (for fee calculation) that the source emits in excess of four thousand (4,000) tpy;
(ii) A part 71 source's actual emissions of any regulated pollutant (for fee calculation) already included in the fee calculation; and
(iii) The insignificant quantities of actual emissions not required to be listed or calculated in a permit application pursuant to § 71.5(c)(11).
(6) “Actual emissions” means the actual rate of emissions in tpy of any regulated pollutant (for fee calculation) emitted from a part 71 source over the preceding calendar year. Actual emissions shall be calculated using each emissions unit's actual operating hours, production rates, in-place control equipment, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the preceding calendar year.
(7) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) (1) through (4) of this section, if the Administrator determines that the fee structures provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section do not reflect the costs of administering a part 71 program, then the Administrator shall by rule set a fee which adequately reflects permit program costs for that program.
(8)
GHG fee adjustment.
The annual fee shall be increased by a GHG fee adjustment for any source that has initiated an activity listed in the following table since the fee was last paid. The GHG fee adjustment shall be equal to the set fee provided in the table for each activity that has been initiated since the fee was last paid:
Activity
Set fee
GHG completeness determination (for initial permit or updated application)
$2,236
GHG evaluation for a permit modification or related permit action
364
GHG evaluation at permit renewal
520
(d)
Prohibition on fees with respect to emissions from affected units.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, during the years 1995 through 1999 inclusive, no fee for purposes of title V shall be required to be paid with respect to emissions from any affected unit under section 404 of the Act.
(e)
Submission of initial fee calculation work sheets and fees.
(1) Each part 71 source shall complete and submit an initial fee calculation work sheet as provided in paragraphs (e)(2), (f), and (g) of this section and shall complete and submit fee calculation work sheets thereafter as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Calculations of actual or estimated emissions and calculation of the fees owed by a source shall be computed by the source on fee calculation work sheets provided by EPA. Fee payment of the full amount must accompany each initial fee calculation work sheet.
(2) The fee calculation work sheet shall require the source to submit a report of its actual emissions for the preceding calendar year and to compute fees owed based on those emissions. For sources that have been issued part 70 or part 71 permits, actual emissions shall be computed using compliance methods required by the most recent permit. If actual emissions cannot be determined using the compliance methods in the permit, the actual emissions should be determined using federally recognized procedures. If a source commenced operation during the preceding calendar year, the source shall estimate its actual emissions for the current calendar year. In such a case, fees for the source shall be based on the total emissions estimated.
(3) The initial fee calculation worksheet shall be certified by a responsible official consistent with § 71.5(d).
(f)
Deadlines for submission.
(1) When EPA withdraws approval of a part 70 program and implements a part 71 program, part 71 sources shall submit initial fee calculation work sheets and fees in accordance with the following schedule:
(i) Sources having SIC codes between 0100 and 2499 inclusive shall complete and submit fee calculation work sheets and fees within 6 months of the effective date of the part 71 program;
(ii) Sources having SIC codes between 2500 and 2999 inclusive shall complete and submit fee calculation work sheets and fees within 7 months of the effective date of the part 71 program;
(iii) Sources having SIC codes between 3000 and 3999 inclusive shall complete and submit fee calculation work sheets and fees within 8 months of the effective date of the part 71 program;
(iv) Sources having SIC codes higher than 3999 shall complete and submit fee calculation work sheets and fees within 9 months of the effective date of the part 71 program.
(2) Sources that are required under either paragraph (f)(1) or (g) of this section to submit fee calculation work sheets and fees between January 1 and March 31 may estimate their emissions for the preceding calendar year in lieu of submitting actual emissions data. If the source's initial fee calculation work sheet was based on estimated emissions for the source's preceding calendar year, then the source shall reconcile the fees owed when it submits its annual emissions report, as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
(3) When EPA implements a part 71 program that does not replace an approved part 70 program, part 71 sources shall submit initial fee calculation work sheets and initial fees when submitting their permit applications in accordance with the requirements of § 71.5(a)(1).
(4) Notwithstanding the above, sources that become subject to the part 71 program after the program's effective date shall submit an initial fee calculation work sheet and initial fees when submitting their permit applications in accordance with the requirements of § 71.5(a)(1).
(g)
Fees for sources that are issued part 71 permits following an EPA objection pursuant to § 71.4(e).
Fees for such sources shall be determined as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, initial fee calculation work sheets for such sources and full payment of the initial fee shall be due three months after the date on which the source's part 71 permit is issued.
(h)
Annual emissions reports
—(1)
Deadlines for submission.
Each part 71 source shall submit an annual report of its actual emissions for the preceding calendar year, a fee calculation work sheet (based on the report), and full payment of the annual fee each year on the anniversary date of its initial fee calculation work sheet, except that sources that were required to submit initial fee calculation work sheets between January 1 and March 31 inclusive shall submit subsequent annual emissions reports and fee calculation work sheets by April 1.
(2) Annual emissions reports and fee calculation worksheets shall be certified by a responsible official consistent with § 71.5(d).
(3) For sources that have been issued part 70 or part 71 permits, actual emissions shall be computed using methods required by the most current permit for determining compliance.
(4) If the source's initial fee calculation work sheet was based on estimated emissions for the source's current or preceding calendar year, then the source shall reconcile the fees owed when it submits its annual emissions report. The source shall compare the estimated emissions from the initial work sheet and the actual emissions from the report and shall enter such information on the fee calculation work sheet that accompanies the annual report. The source shall recompute the initial fee accordingly and shall remit any underpayment with the report and work sheet. The EPA shall credit any overpayment to the source's account.
(i)
Recordkeeping requirements.
Part 71 sources shall retain, in accordance with the provisions of § 71.6(a)(3)(ii), all work sheets and other materials used to determine fee payments. Records shall be retained for 5 years following the year in which the emissions data is submitted.
(j)
Fee assessment errors.
(1) If EPA determines than a source has completed the fee calculation work sheet incorrectly, the permitting authority shall bill the applicant for the corrected fee or credit overpayments to the source's account.
(2) Each source notified by the permitting authority of additional amounts due shall remit full payment within 30 days of receipt of an invoice from the permitting authority.
(3) An owner or operator of a part 71 source who thinks that the assessed fee is in error shall provide a written explanation of the alleged error to the permitting authority along with the assessed fee. The permitting authority shall, within 90 days of receipt of the correspondence, review the data to determine whether the assessed fee was in error. If an error was made, the overpayment shall be credited to the account of the part 71 source.
(k)
Remittance procedure.
(1) Each remittance under this section shall be in United States currency and shall be paid by money order, bank draft, certified check, corporate check, or electronic funds transfer payable to the order of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
(2) Each remittance shall be sent to the Environmental Protection Agency to the address designated on the fee calculation work sheet or the invoice.
(l)
Penalty and interest assessment.
(1) The permitting authority shall assess interest on payments which are received later than the date due. The interest rate shall be the sum of the Federal short-term rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, plus 3 percentage points.
(2) The permitting authority shall assess a penalty charge of 50 percent of the fee amount if the fee is not paid within 30 days of the payment due date.
(3) If a source underpays the fee owed, except as provided in paragraph (l)(4) of this section, the permitting authority shall assess a penalty charge of 50 percent on the amount by which the fee was underpaid. Interest shall also be assessed, computed under paragraph (l)(1) of this section, on the amount by which the fee was underpaid.
(4) If a source bases its initial fee calculation on estimated emissions from the source's current or preceding calendar year, as provided under paragraph (h)(4) of this section, and underpays its fee based on an underestimation of these emissions, the permitting authority shall assess a penalty charge of 50 percent on certain of these underpayments, according to the following provisions:
(i) The penalty charge shall be assessed whenever a source's underpayment exceeds the underpayment penalty cutoff established in paragraph (l)(4)(iii) of this section. The penalty amount shall be 50 percent of the portion of the underpayment which is in excess of the underpayment penalty cutoff.
(ii) Where a source is subject to a penalty for underpayment pursuant to paragraph (l)(4)(i) of this section, interest as computed under paragraph (l)(1) of this section shall be assessed on that portion of the underpayment which is in excess of the underpayment penalty cutoff established in paragraph (l)(4)(iii) of this section.
(iii) The underpayment penalty cutoff for a source shall be the sum of the following:
(A) 50 percent of the portion of the initial fee amount which was calculated from estimated emissions of HAP listed pursuant to 112(b) of the Act, and
(B) 20 percent of the portion of initial fee amount which was calculated from estimated emissions of the remainder of the regulated air pollutants (for fee calculation).
(m)
Failure to remit fees.
The permitting authority shall not issue a final permit or permit revision until all fees, interest and penalties assessed against a source under this section are paid. The initial application of a source shall not be found complete unless the source has paid all fees owed.
(n)
Adjustments of fee schedules.
(1) The fee schedules provided in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section shall remain in effect until December 31, 1996. Thereafter, the fee schedules shall be changed annually by the percentage, if any, of any annual increase in the Consumer Price Index.
(2) Part 71 permit program costs and fees will be reviewed by the Administrator at least every 2 years, and changes will be made to the fee schedule as necessary to reflect permit program costs.
(3) When changes to a fee schedule are made based on periodic reviews by the Administrator, the changes will be published in the
Federal Register.
(o)
Use of revenue.
All fees, penalties, and interest collected under this part shall be deposited in a special fund in the U.S. Treasury, which thereafter shall be available for appropriation, to remain available until expended, subject to appropriation, to carry out the activities required by this part.

§ 71.10
Delegation of part 71 program.
(a)
Delegation of part 71 program.
The Administrator may delegate, in whole or in part, with or without signature authority, the authority to administer a part 71 operating permits program to a State, eligible Tribe, local, or other non-State agency in accordance with the provisions of this section. In order to be delegated authority to administer a part 71 program, the delegate agency must submit a legal opinion from the Attorney General from the State, or the attorney for the State, local, interstate, or eligible Tribal agency that has independent legal counsel, stating that the laws of the State, locality, interstate compact or Indian Tribe provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the delegated program. A Delegation of Authority Agreement (Agreement) shall set forth the terms and conditions of the delegation, shall specify the provisions that the delegate agency shall be authorized to implement, and shall be entered into by the Administrator and the delegate agency. The Agreement shall become effective upon the date that both the Administrator and the delegate agency have signed the Agreement. Once delegation becomes effective, the delegate agency will be responsible, to the extent specified in the Agreement, for administering the part 71 program for the area subject to the Agreement. Delegate agencies that choose to receive electronic documents as part of their delegated program must satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting).
(b)
Publication of Notice of Delegation of Authority Agreement.
The Administrator shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public of any delegation of a portion of the part 71 program to a State, eligible Tribe, or local agency.

(e)
Retention of records.
The records for each draft, proposed, and final permit, and application for permit renewal or modification shall be kept for a period of 5 years by the delegate agency. The delegate agency shall also submit to the Administrator such information as the Administrator may reasonably require to ascertain whether the delegate agency is implementing, administering, and enforcing the delegated part 71 program in compliance with the requirements of the Act and of this part.
(f)
Prohibition of default issuance.
(1) For the purposes of Federal law and title V of the Act, when a part 71 program has been delegated in accordance with the provisions of this section, no part 71 permit (including a permit renewal or modification) will be issued until affected States have had an opportunity to review the draft permit as required pursuant to § 71.8(a) and EPA has had an opportunity to review the proposed permit.
(2) To receive delegation of signature authority, the legal opinion submitted by the delegate agency pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall certify that no applicable provision of State, local or Tribal law requires that a part 71 permit or renewal be issued after a certain time if the delegate agency has failed to take action on the application (or includes any other similar provision providing for default issuance of a permit), unless EPA has waived such review for EPA and affected States.
(g)
EPA objection.
(1) The Administrator will object to the issuance of any proposed permit determined by the Administrator not to be in compliance with applicable requirements or requirements under this part. No permit for which an application must be transmitted to the Administrator under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be issued if the Administrator objects to its issuance in writing within 45 days of receipt of the proposed permit and all necessary supporting information. When a part 71 program has been delegated in accordance with the provisions of this section, failure of the delegate agency to do any of the following shall constitute grounds for an objection by the Administrator:
(i) Comply with paragraph (d) of this section;
(ii) Submit any information necessary to review adequately the proposed permit;
(iii) Process the permit under the procedures required by §§ 71.7 and 71.11; or

The Administrator will provide the permit applicant a copy of the objection.
(3) If the delegate agency fails, within 90 days after the date of an objection under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, to revise and submit to the Administrator the proposed permit in response to the objection, the Administrator shall issue or deny the permit in accordance with the requirements of this part.
(h)
Public petitions.
In the case of a delegated program, any interested person may petition the Administrator to reopen a permit for cause as provided in § 71.11(n).
(i)
Appeal of permits.
When a part 71 program has been delegated with signature authority in accordance with the provisions of this section, any person or affected State that submitted recommendations or comments on the draft permit, or that participated in the public hearing process may petition the Environmental Appeals Board in accordance with § 71.11(l)(1).
(j)
Nondelegable conditions.
(1) The Administrator's authority to object to the issuance of a part 71 permit cannot be delegated to an agency not within EPA.
(2) The Administrator's authority to act upon petitions submitted pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section cannot be delegated to an agency not within EPA.

(1) The permitting authority shall promptly provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete pursuant to § 71.7(a)(3).
(2) Once an application for an initial permit, permit revision, or permit renewal is complete, the permitting authority shall decide whether to prepare a draft permit or to deny the application.
(3) If the permitting authority initially decides to deny the permit application, it shall issue a notice of intent to deny. A notice of intent to deny the permit application is a type of draft permit and follows the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under this section. If the permitting authority's final decision is that the initial decision to deny the permit application was incorrect, it shall withdraw the notice of intent to deny and proceed to prepare a draft permit under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(4) If the permitting authority decides to prepare a draft permit, it shall prepare a draft permit that contains the permit conditions required under § 71.6.
(5) All draft permits prepared under this section shall be publicly noticed and made available for public comment.
(b)
Statement of basis.
The permitting authority shall prepare a statement of basis for every draft permit subject to this section. The statement of basis shall briefly describe the derivation of the conditions of the draft permit and the reasons for them or, in the case of notices of intent to deny or terminate, reasons supporting the initial decision. The statement of basis shall be sent to the applicant and, on request, to any other person.
(c)
Administrative record for draft permits.
(1) The provisions of a draft permit shall be based on the administrative record defined in this section.

All persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the permitting authority's initial decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit all reasonably ascertainable arguments supporting their position by the close of the public comment period (including any public hearing). Any supporting materials that are submitted shall be included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless they are already part of the administrative record in the same proceeding, or consist of State or Federal statutes and regulations, EPA documents of general applicability, or other generally available reference materials. In the case of
a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, if requested by the Administrator, the permitting authority shall make supporting materials not already included in the administrative record available to EPA. The permitting authority may direct commenters to provide such materials directly to EPA. A comment period longer than 30 days may be necessary to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this section. Additional time shall be granted to the extent that a commenter who requests additional time demonstrates the need for such time.
(h)
Reopening of the public comment period.
(1) The permitting authority may order the public comment period reopened if the procedures of paragraph (h) of this section could expedite the decision making process. When the public comment period is reopened under paragraph (h) of this section, all persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the permitting authority's initial decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must submit all reasonably available factual grounds supporting their position, including all supporting material, by a date not less than 30 days after public notice under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, set by the permitting authority. Thereafter, any person may file a written response to the material filed by any other person, by a date, not less than 20 days after the date set for filing of the material, set by the permitting authority.
(2) Public notice of any comment period under this paragraph (h) shall identify the issues to which the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section shall apply.
(3) On its own motion or on the request of any person, the permitting authority may direct that the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall apply during the initial comment period where it reasonably appears that issuance of the permit will be contested and that applying the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section will substantially expedite the decision making process. The notice of the draft permit shall state whenever this has been done.
(4) A comment period of longer than 30 days may be necessary in complicated proceedings to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this section. Commenters may request longer comment periods and they may be granted to the extent the permitting authority finds it necessary.
(5) If any data, information, or arguments submitted during the public comment period appear to raise substantial new questions concerning a permit, the permitting authority may take one or more of the following actions:
(i) Prepare a new draft permit, appropriately modified;
(ii) Prepare a revised statement of basis, and reopen the comment period; or
(iii) Reopen or extend the comment period to give interested persons an opportunity to comment on the information or arguments submitted.
(6) Comments filed during the reopened comment period shall be limited to the substantial new questions that caused the reopening. The public notice shall define the scope of the reopening.
(7) Public notice of any of the above actions shall be issued under paragraph (d) of this section.
(i)
Issuance and effective date of permit.
(1) After the close of the public comment period on a draft permit, the permitting authority shall issue a final permit decision. The permitting authority shall notify the applicant and each person who has submitted written comments or requested notice of the final permit decision. This notice shall include reference to the procedures for appealing a decision on a permit. For the purposes of this section, a final permit decision means a final decision to issue, deny, revise, revoke and reissue, renew, or terminate a permit.
(2) A final permit decision shall become effective 30 days after the service of notice of the decision, unless:
(i) A later effective date is specified in the decision;
(ii) Review is requested under paragraph (l) of this section (in which case the specific terms and conditions of the
permit which are the subject of the request for review shall be stayed); or
(iii) No comments requested a change in the draft permit, in which case the permit shall become effective immediately upon issuance.
(j)
Response to comments.
(1) At the time that any final permit decision is issued, the permitting authority shall issue a response to comments. This response shall:
(i) Specify which provisions, if any, of the draft permit have been changed in the final permit decision, and the reasons for the change; and
(ii) Briefly describe and respond to all significant comments on the draft permit raised during the public comment period, or during any hearing.
(2) Any documents cited in the response to comments shall be included in the administrative record for the final permit decision as defined in paragraph (k) of this section. If new points are raised or new material supplied during the public comment period, the permitting authority may document its response to those matters by adding new materials to the administrative record.
(3) The response to comments shall be available to the public.
(4) The permitting authority will notify in writing any affected State of any refusal to accept recommendations for the permit that the State submitted during the public or affected State review period.
(k)
Administrative record for final permits.
(1) The permitting authority shall base final permit decisions on the administrative record defined in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.
(2) The administrative record for any final permit shall consist of:
(i) All comments received during any public comment period, including any extension or reopening;
(ii) The tape or transcript of any hearing(s) held;
(iii) Any written material submitted at such a hearing;
(iv) The response to comments and any new materials placed in the record;
(v) Other documents contained in the supporting file for the permit;
(vi) The final permit;
(vii) The application and any supporting data furnished by the applicant;
(viii) The draft permit or notice of intent to deny the application or to terminate the permit;
(ix) The statement of basis for the draft permit;
(x) All documents cited in the statement of basis;
(xi) Other documents contained in the supporting file for the draft permit.
(3) The additional documents required under paragraph (k)(2) of this section should be added to the record as soon as possible after their receipt or publication by the permitting authority. The record shall be complete on the date the final permit is issued.
(4) Material readily available at the permitting authority, or published materials which are generally available and which are included in the administrative record under the standards of paragraph (j) of this section need not be physically included in the same file as the rest of the record as long as it is specifically referred to in the statement of basis or in the response to comments.
(l)
Appeal of permits.
(1) Permit decisions may be appealed under the permit appeal procedures of 40 CFR 124.19.
(2) An appeal under paragraph (l)(1) of this section is, under section 307(b) of the Act, a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of the final agency action.
(m)
Computation of time.
(1) Any time period scheduled to begin on the occurrence of an act or event shall begin on the day after the act or event.
(2) Any time period scheduled to begin before the occurrence of an act or event shall be computed so that the period ends on the day before the act or event, except as otherwise provided.
(3) If the final day of any time period falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the time period shall be extended to the next working day.
(4) Whenever a party or interested person has the right or is required to act within a prescribed period after the service of notice or other paper upon him or her by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed time.
(n)
Public petitions to the Permitting Authority.
(1) Any interested person (including the permittee) may petition the permitting authority to reopen a permit for cause, and the permitting authority may commence a permit reopening on its own initiative. However, the permitting authority shall not revise, revoke and reissue, or terminate a permit except for the reasons specified in § 71.7(f)(1) or § 71.6(a)(6)(i). All requests shall be in writing and shall contain facts or reasons supporting the request.
(2) If the permitting authority decides the request is not justified, it shall send the requester a brief written response giving a reason for the decision. Denials of requests for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination are not subject to public notice, comment, or hearings. Denials by the permitting authority may be informally appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board by a letter briefly setting forth the relevant facts. The Board may direct the permitting authority to begin revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination proceedings under paragraph (n)(3) of this section. The appeal shall be considered denied if the Board takes no action within 60 days after receiving it. This informal appeal is, under 42 U.S.C. 307, a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of EPA action in denying a request for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination.
(3) If the permitting authority decides the request is justified and that cause exists to revise, revoke and reissue or terminate a permit, it shall initiate proceedings to reopen the permit pursuant to § 71.7(f) or § 71.7(g).

§ 71.12
Prohibited acts.
Violations of any applicable requirement; any permit term or condition; any fee or filing requirement; any duty to allow or carry out inspection, entry, or monitoring activities; or any regulation or order issued by the permitting authority pursuant to this part are violations of the Act and are subject to full Federal enforcement authorities available under the Act.

# Subpart B—Permits for Early Reductions Sources
§ 71.21
Program overview.
(a) The regulations in this subpart provide for a limited, Federal, title V, permit program to establish alternative emission limitations for early reductions sources that have demonstrated qualifying reductions of hazardous air pollutants under section 112(i)(5) of the Act. A permit issued under this subpart which establishes such an enforceable alternative emission limitation shall grant all emissions units in the early reductions source a six-year extension from otherwise applicable dates of compliance for standards promulgated under section 112(d) of the Act.
(b) After approval of a State's comprehensive permit program pursuant to title V of the Act, the Administrator may continue to issue specialty permits under this subpart only under the following circumstances:
(1) The early reductions source filed a permit application under this subpart before the State obtained approval of a comprehensive title V permit program but the permit had not been finally issued at the time of State program approval; or
(2) The early reductions source will be required to file an early reductions permit application under § 71.24(b) before a comprehensive permit application is required by the State under the approved program.
(c) When a circumstance described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section occurs, the primary consideration in the Administrator's decision to issue a specialty permit is the degree of delay anticipated by deferring to the State for permit issuance.
(d) A Permit issued to an early reductions source under this subpart shall have a term not to exceed five years. Such a specialty permit shall be incorporated into a comprehensive title V permit subsequently issued to the facility containing the early reductions source, without reopening or revision of the specialty permit except as provided in § 71.26(e).
(e) Issuance of a specialty permit under this subpart does not relieve a source from an obligation to file a
timely and complete comprehensive permit application as required under an approved comprehensive title V permit program.
(f)
Delegation to other permitting authorities.
(1) The Administrator may delegate to another permitting authority the responsibility to implement this permit program. Under such a delegation, the Administrator reserves the right to issue a final permit to early reductions sources that filed permit applications with the Administrator prior to the permitting authority obtaining delegation.
(2) Under any delegation, the Administrator will require that the permitting authority have enforcement authority substantially equivalent to that specified in § 70.11 of this chapter.
(3) Upon any delegation, administrative appeals of permit decisions issuing pursuant to the delegated program shall continue to be subject to the requirements of § 71.27(l).

(ii) March 21, 1995.
(2) Permit applications for early reductions sources subject to enforceable commitments established pursuant to § 63.75 of this chapter shall be filed no later than April 30, 1994.
(3) If the post-reduction year does not end at least one month before the permit application deadline under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the source may file the post-reduction emissions information required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section later as
a supplement to the original permit application. In such cases, this supplemental information shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than one month after the end of the post-reduction year.
(4) If a source test will be the supporting basis for establishing post-reduction emissions for one or more emissions units in the early reductions source, the test results shall be submitted by the deadline for submittal of a permit application under this section.
(c)
Complete application.
To be found complete, an application must provide all information required pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, except for the information on post-reduction emissions required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Applications for permit revision need supply the information required under paragraph (e) of this section only if it is related to the proposed change. Information submitted under paragraph (e) of this section must be sufficient to allow the Administrator to determine if the early reductions source meets the applicable requirements of subpart D of part 63 of this chapter. Unless the Administrator determines that an application is not complete within 45 days of receipt of the application, such application shall be deemed to be complete, except as otherwise provided in § 71.26(a)(3).

(f) Any application form, report, or compliance certification submitted pursuant to these regulations shall contain certification by a responsible official of truth, accuracy, and completeness. This certification and any other certification required under this part shall state that, based on information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the statements and information in the document are true, accurate, and complete.
§ 71.25
Permit content.
(a)
Standard permit requirements.
Each permit issued under this subpart shall include the following elements:
(1)
Alternative emission limitation.
An annual alternative emission limitation for hazardous air pollutants from the early reductions source reflecting the 90 percent reduction (95 percent for hazardous air pollutants which are particulate matter) which qualified the early reductions source for a compliance extension under subpart D of part 63 of this chapter.
(2)
Additional limitations.
Additional emission limiting requirements, such as limitations on operation, work practice standards, and any other emission limiting requirements for the early reductions source necessary to assure compliance with the alternative emission limitation.
(3)
Monitoring requirements.
Each permit shall contain the following monitoring requirements:
(i) All emissions monitoring and analysis procedures or test methods necessary to assure compliance with the emission limitations established under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. Such monitoring or testing shall be consistent with the demonstration made pursuant to § 63.74 of this chapter and any procedures and methods promulgated pursuant to sections 114(a)(3) or 504(b) of the Act;
(ii) Periodic monitoring or testing sufficient to yield reliable data from the relevant time period that are representative of the early reductions source's compliance with the permit. Such monitoring requirements shall assure use of terms, test methods, units, averaging periods, and other statistical conventions consistent with the demonstration made pursuant to § 63.74 of this chapter. Recordkeeping provisions may be sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii); and
(iii) As necessary, requirements concerning the use, maintenance, and, where appropriate, installation of monitoring equipment or methods.
(4)
Recordkeeping requirements.
The permit shall contain recordkeeping requirements including the following, as applicable:
(i) Records of required monitoring information that include the following:
(A) The date, place as defined in the permit, and time of sampling or measurements;
(B) The date(s) analyses were performed;
(C) The company or entity that performed the analyses;
(D) The analytical techniques or methods used;
(E) The results of such analyses; and
(F) The operating conditions as existing at the time of sampling or measurement;
(ii) Retention of records of all required monitoring data and support information for a period of at least 5 years from the date of the monitoring sample, measurement, report, or application. Support information includes all calibration and maintenance records and all original strip-chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, and copies of all reports required by the permit.
(5)
Reporting requirements.
The permit shall require the following:
(i) Submittal of reports of all required monitoring at least every 6 months. All instances of deviations from permit requirements must be clearly identified in such reports; and
(ii) Prompt reporting of any deviations from permit requirements, including those attributable to upset conditions as defined in the permit. Such reports shall include the probable cause of such deviations and any corrective actions or preventive measures
taken. The Administrator will define “prompt” in the permit for each situation and will do so in relation to the degree and type of deviation likely to occur.
(6) A severability clause to ensure the continued validity of the various permit requirements in the event of a challenge to any portions of the permit.
(7) Provisions stating the following:
(i) The permittee must comply with all conditions of part 71 permit issued under this subpart. A violation of an alternative emission limitation, as well as any other requirement established in a permit issued under this subpart, is enforceable pursuant to the authority of section 113 of the Act, notwithstanding any demonstration of continuing 90 percent (95 percent in the case of hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) emission reduction over the entire early reductions source. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Act and is grounds for enforcement action or for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification;
(ii) Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit;
(iii) The permit may be revised, revoked, reopened, and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or of a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition;
(iv) The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege; and
(v) The permittee shall furnish to the Administrator, within a reasonable time, any information that the Administrator may request in writing to determine whether cause exists for revising the permit, revoking and reissuing, or terminating the permit or to determine compliance with the permit. Upon request, the permittee shall also furnish to the Administrator copies of records required to be kept by the permitee.
(8) Terms and conditions for reasonably anticipated operating scenarios identified by the early reductions source in its application as approved by the Administrator. Such terms and conditions:
(i) Shall require the early reductions source, contemporaneously with making a change from one operating scenario to another, to record in a log at the permitted facility a record of the scenario under which it is operating. Provided that an emitting unit is monitored in a way that provides contemporaneous identification that a change to a particular alternate scenario has occurred, no notice to the Administrator is required. Otherwise, when such a change is made, the permittee at the beginning of the following week shall place in regular mail to the Administrator notice that a change to a particular alternate operating scenario has occurred; and
(ii) Must ensure that the terms and conditions of each such alternative scenario meet the alternative emission limitation and the requirements of this subpart.
(9) Terms and conditions, if the permit applicant requests them, for the trading of hazardous air pollutant emissions increases and decreases among emissions units within the early reductions source without permit revision or case-by-case approval of each emissions trade, provided that:
(i) Such terms and conditions include all terms required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section to determine compliance;
(ii) The changes in hazardous air pollutant emissions do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit;
(iii) The changes in hazardous air pollutant emissions are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act;
(iv) The Administrator determines that the emissions are quantifiable and that replicable procedures or other practical means exist to enforce the emission trades; and
(v) The early reductions source owner or operator provides the Administrator written notification at least 7 days in advance of the proposed changes and
includes in the notification a description of the change in emissions that will occur, when the change will occur, and how the increases and decreases in emissions will comply with the alternative emission limitation and other terms and conditions of the permit.
(b)
Federally enforceable requirements.
All terms and conditions in a permit issued under this subpart are enforceable by the Administrator and citizens under the Act.
(c)
Compliance requirements.
All permits issued under this subpart shall contain the following elements with respect to compliance:
(1) Consistent with paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit. Any document (including reports) required to be submitted by a permit shall contain a certification by a responsible official that meets the requirements of § 71.24(f).
(2) Inspection and entry provisions that require that, upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the permittee shall allow the Administrator or an authorized representative to perform the following:
(i) Enter upon the permittee's premises where the early reductions source is located or emissions-related activity is conducted, or where required records are kept;
(ii) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit;
(iii) Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under the permit; and
(iv) Sample or monitor at reasonable times substances or parameters for the purpose of determining compliance with the permit.
(3) Requirements for compliance certification with terms and conditions contained in the permit, including the alternative emission limitation. Permits shall include each of the following:
(i) The frequency (not less than annually) of submissions of compliance certifications;
(ii) Consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a means for monitoring the compliance of the early reductions source with its alternative emission limitation;
(iii) A requirement that the compliance certification include the following:
(A) The identification of each term or condition of the permit that is the basis of the certification;
(B) The compliance status;
(C) Whether compliance was continuous or intermittent;
(D) The method(s) used for determining the compliance status of the early reductions source, currently and over the reporting period consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and

(2) A permit shield may be extended to all permit terms and conditions for alternate operating scenarios pursuant to paragraph (a)(9) of this section or that allow increases and decreases in hazardous air pollutant emissions pursuant to paragraph (a)(10) of this section.
(3) Nothing in this paragraph (d) or in any permit issued pursuant to this subpart shall alter or affect the following:
(i) The provisions of sections 112(r) and 303 of the Act (emergency orders);
(ii) The liability of an owner or operator of an early reductions source for any violation of applicable requirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance; or
(iii) The ability of the Administrator to obtain information from an early reductions source pursuant to section 114 of the Act.
(e)
Emergency provision
—(1)
Definition.
An “emergency” means any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the early reductions source, including acts of God, which situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the early reductions source to exceed an emission limitation under the permit, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.
(2)
Effect of an emergency.
An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such an emission limitation if the conditions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section are met.
(3) The affirmative defense of emergency shall be demonstrated through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(i) An emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the emergency;
(ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;
(iii) During the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission limitation, or other requirements in the permit; and
(iv) The permittee submitted notice of the emergency to the Administrator within 2 working days of the time when emission limitations were exceeded due to the emergency. This notice fulfills the requirement of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section. This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken.
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking to establish the occurrence of an emergency has the burden of proof.
§ 71.26
Permit issuance, reopenings, and revisions.
(a)
Action on application.
(1) A permit or permit revision may be issued only if all of the following conditions have been met:
(i) The Administrator has received a complete application for a permit or permit revision;
(ii) The requirements for public participation under § 71.27 have been followed; and
(iii) The conditions of the proposed permit or permit revision meet all the requirements of § 71.25 and provide for compliance with an alternative emission limitation reflecting the emissions reduction which qualified the early reductions source for a compliance extension under part 63, subpart D, of this chapter.
(2) The Administrator will take final action on each permit application (including a request for permit revision) within 12 months after receiving a complete application, except that final action may be delayed where an applicant fails to provide additional information in a timely manner as requested by the Administrator under § 71.24(c).
(3) The Administrator will promptly provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete. Unless the Administrator requests additional information or otherwise notifies the applicant of incompleteness within 45 days of receipt of an application, the application shall be deemed complete. For revisions that qualify as administrative amendments and are processed through the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section, a completeness determination need not be made.
(4) If a source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance, the source's failure to have a title V permit for purposes of any requirements under section 112 pertaining to the early reductions source is not a violation of this part until the Administrator takes final action on the permit application. This protection
shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination made pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and as required by § 71.24(d), the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified in writing by the Administrator any additional information identified as being needed to process the application.
(b)
Permit renewal and expiration.
(1) Permits issued under this subpart shall not be renewed. Permit renewal for expiring permits issued under this subpart shall be accomplished according to the requirements of title V of the Act for comprehensive permits for the facility containing the early reductions source.
(2) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, permit expiration terminates the early reductions source's right to operate.
(3) If, consistent with the requirements of title V of the Act, a timely and complete application for a comprehensive title V permit for the facility containing the early reductions source has been submitted but the permitting authority has failed to issue or deny the comprehensive permit prior to expiration of a permit issued under this subpart, then the existing permit for the early reductions source shall not expire until the comprehensive title V permit for the facility has been issued or denied.
(c)
Administrative permit amendments.
(1) An “administrative permit amendment” is a permit revision that:
(i) Corrects typographical errors;
(ii) Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor administrative change at the source;
(iii) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee;
(iv) Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of an early reductions source where the permitting authority determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the permitting authority; or
(v) Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator has determined to be ministerial in nature and, therefore, similar to those in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section.
(2)
Administrative permit amendment procedures.
Administrative permit amendments may be made to a permit issued under this subpart using the following procedures:
(i) The source shall submit to the Administrator an application containing a proposed addendum to the source's permit. The application shall demonstrate how the proposed change meets one of the criteria for administrative amendments set forth in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section, and include certification by the responsible official consistent with § 71.24(f) that the change is eligible for administrative amendment procedures. The addendum shall:
(A) Identify the terms of the part 71, subpart B permit the source proposes to change;
(B) Propose new permit terms consistent with the provisions of this subpart applicable to the change;
(C) Designate the addendum as having been processed under the procedures of this paragraph (c); and
(D) Specify that the addendum will be effective 60 days from the date of the Administrator's receipt, unless the Administrator disapproves the change within such period.
(ii) The Administrator will allow the source to implement the requested change immediately upon making all required submittals, including the proposed addendum.
(iii) The proposed addendum will become effective 60 days after the Administrator receives the submittal, provided the Administrator has not disapproved the request in writing before the end of the 60-day period. The Administrator shall record the change by attaching a copy of the addendum to the part 71, subpart B permit.
(iv) If the Administrator disapproves the change, he or she shall notify the source of the reasons for the disapproval in a timely manner. Upon receiving such notice, the source shall comply with the terms of the permit that it had proposed to change, and
thereafter the proposed addendum shall not take effect.
(v) The process in this paragraph (c) may also be used for changes initiated by the Administrator that meet the criteria under paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii), and (iv) of this section. For such changes, the Administrator will notify the source of the proposed change and its effective date, and shall attach a copy of the change to the existing permit. On the effective date of the proposed change, the source shall comply with the provisions of the proposed change.
(vi) The permit shield under § 71.25(d) may not extend to administrative amendments processed under this paragraph (c)(2).
(d)
Permit revision procedures
—(1)
Criteria.
Permit revision procedures shall be used for applications requesting permit revisions that do not qualify as administrative amendments. Nothing in this paragraph (d) shall be construed to preclude the permittee from making changes consistent with this subpart that would render existing permit compliance terms and conditions irrelevant.
(2) Permit revisions shall meet all requirements of this subpart, including those for applications, public participation, and review by affected States, as they apply to permit issuance. The Administrator will complete review on permit revisions within 9 months after receipt of a complete application.
(e)
Reopening for cause.
(1) Each issued permit shall include provisions specifying the conditions under which the permit will be reopened. A permit shall be reopened and revised under any of the following circumstances:
(i) The Administrator determines that the permit contains a material mistake or that inaccurate statements were made in establishing the emission limits or other terms or conditions of the permit.
(ii) The Administrator determines that the permit must be revised to assure compliance with the alternative emission limitation.
(2) Proceedings to reopen and issue a permit shall follow the same procedures as apply to initial permit issuance and shall affect only those parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists.
(3) Reopenings under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not be initiated before a notice of such intent is provided to the early reductions source by the Administrator. Such notice will be provided at least 30 days in advance of the date that the permit is to be reopened, except that the Administrator may provide a shorter time period in the case of an emergency.
(f)
EPA review under State programs for issuing specialty permits.
(1) If the Administrator approves a State program for the implementation of this subpart, the State program shall require that the Administrator receive a copy of each permit application (including any application for permit revision) each proposed permit, and each final permit issued pursuant to this subpart. The State program may require that the applicant provide a copy of any permit application directly to the Administrator.
(2) The Administrator will object to the issuance of any proposed permit determined by the Administrator not to be in compliance with requirements under this subpart or part 63 of this chapter. If the Administrator objects in writing within 45 days of receipt of a proposed permit and all necessary supporting documentation, the State shall not issue the permit.
(3) Any EPA objection to a proposed permit will include a statement of the Administrator's reasons for objection and a description of the terms and conditions that the permit must include to respond to the objections. The Administrator will provide the permit applicant a copy of the objection.
(4) Failure of the State to do any of the following also shall constitute grounds for an objection:
(i) Comply with paragraph (f)(1) of this section;
(ii) Submit any information necessary to review adequately the proposed permit; or
(iii) Process the permit under procedures approved to meet paragraph (f) of this section.
(5) If the State fails, within 90 days after the date of an objection under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, to revise and submit a proposed permit in
response to the objection, the Administrator will issue or deny the permit in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.
(6)
Public petitions to the Administrator.
Within 60 days after expiration of the Administrator's 45-day review period, any person may petition the Administrator in writing to make an objection. Any such petition shall be based only on objections to the permit that were raised with reasonable specificity during the public comment period provided for and consistent with § 71.27, unless the petitioner demonstrates that it was impracticable to raise such objections within such period, or unless the grounds for such objection arose after such period. If the Administrator objects to the permit as a result of a petition filed under this paragraph, the permitting authority shall not issue the permit until EPA's objection has been resolved, except that a petition for review does not stay the effectiveness of a permit or its requirements if the permit was issued after the end of the 45-day review period and prior to an objection. If the permitting authority has issued a permit prior to receipt of an EPA objection under this paragraph, the Administrator will revise, terminate, or revoke such permit, and shall do so consistent with the procedures in 40 CFR 70.7(g)(4) or (g)(5)(i) except in unusual circumstances, and the permitting authority may thereafter issue only a revised permit that satisfies EPA's objection. In any case, the source will not be in violation of the requirement to have submitted a timely and complete application.
§ 71.27
Public participation and appeal.
All permit proceedings, including preparation of draft permits, initial permit issuance, permit revisions, and granted appeals, shall provide adequate procedures for public participation, including notice, opportunity for comment, a hearing if requested, and administrative appeal. Specific procedures shall include the following:
(a)
Revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination of permits.
(1) Permits may be revised, revoked and reissued, or terminated either at the request of any interested person (including the permittee) or upon the Administrator's initiative. However, permits may only be revised, revoked and reissued, or terminated for the reasons specified in §§ 71.25(a)(7) and 71.26(e). All requests shall be in writing and shall contain facts or reasons supporting the request.
(2) If the Administrator decides the request is not justified, he or she shall send the requester a brief written response giving a reason for the decision. Denials of requests for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination are not subject to public notice, comment, or hearings. Denials by the Administrator may be informally appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board by a letter briefly setting forth the relevant facts. The Board may direct the Administrator to begin revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination proceedings under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The appeal shall be considered denied if the Board takes no action within 60 days after receiving it. This informal appeal is, under 42 U.S.C. 307, a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of EPA action in denying a request for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination.
(3)(i) Except in the case of administrative amendment of a permit, if the Administrator tentatively decides to revise or revoke and reissue a permit under §§ 71.25(a)(7) and 71.26(e), he or she shall prepare a draft permit under paragraph (b) of this section incorporating the proposed changes. The Administrator may request additional information and, in the case of a revised permit, shall require the submission of an updated application. In the case of revoked and reissued permits, the Administrator shall require the submission of a new application.
(ii) In a permit revision under this subsection, only those conditions to be revised shall be reopened when a new draft permit is prepared. All other aspects of the existing permit shall remain in effect for the duration of the unrevised permit. When a permit is revoked and reissued under this subsection, the entire permit is reopened just as if the permit had expired and was being reissued. During any revocation and reissuance proceeding the permittee shall comply with all conditions
of the existing permit until a new final permit is reissued.
(4) If the Administrator tentatively decides to terminate a permit under §§ 71.25(a)(7) and 71.26(e), he or she shall issue a notice of intent to terminate. A notice of intent to terminate is a type of draft permit which follows the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under paragraph (b) of this section. A notice of intent to terminate shall not be issued if the Administrator and the permittee agree to termination in the course of transferring permit responsibility to an approved State under § 71.21(e).
(5) Any request by the permittee for revision to an existing permit shall be treated as a permit application and shall be processed in accordance with all requirements of § 71.24.
(b)
Draft permits.
(1) Once an application is complete, the Administrator shall tentatively decide whether to prepare a draft permit or to deny the application.
(2) If the Administrator tentatively decides to deny the permit application, he or she shall issue a notice of intent to deny. A notice of intent to deny the permit application is a type of draft permit which follows the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under this subsection. If the Administrator's final decision is that the tentative decision to deny the permit application was incorrect, he or she shall withdraw the notice of intent to deny and proceed to prepare a draft permit under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(3) If the Administrator decides to prepare a draft permit, he or she shall prepare a draft permit that contains the permit conditions under § 71.25.
(4) All draft permits prepared under this subsection shall be publicly noticed and made available for public comment. The Administrator shall give notice of opportunity for a public hearing, issue a final decision and respond to comments. For all early reductions permits, an appeal may be taken under paragraph (l) of this section.
(c)
Statement of basis.
The Administrator shall prepare a statement of basis for every draft permit. The statement of basis shall briefly describe the derivation of the conditions of the draft permit and the reasons for them or, in the case of notices of intent to deny or terminate, reasons supporting the tentative decision. The statement of basis shall be sent to the applicant and, on request, to any other person.
(d)
Public notice of permit actions and public comment period
—(1)
Scope.
(i) The Administrator shall give public notice that the following actions have occurred:
(A) A permit application has been tentatively denied under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
(B) A draft permit has been prepared under paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
(C) A hearing has been scheduled under paragraph (f) of this section;
(D) An appeal has been granted under paragraph (l)(3) of this section.
(ii) No public notice is required in the case of administrative permit amendments, or when a request for permit revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination has been denied under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Written notice of that denial shall be given to the requester and to the permittee.
(iii) Public notices may describe more than one permit or permit action.
(2)
Timing.
(i) Public notice of the preparation of a draft permit or permit revision (including a notice of intent to deny a permit or permit revision application) shall allow at least 30 days for public comment.
(ii) Public notice of a public hearing shall be given at least 30 days before the hearing. (Public notice of the hearing may be given at the same time as public notice of the draft permit or permit revision and the two notices may be combined.)
(iii) The Administrator shall provide such notice and opportunity for participation to Affected States on or before the time that the Administrator provides this notice to the public.
(3)
Methods.
Public notice of activities described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section shall be given by the following methods:
(i) By mailing a copy of a notice to the following persons (any person otherwise entitled to receive notice under this paragraph (d) may waive his or her rights to receive notice for any permit):
(A) The applicant;
(B) Any other agency which the Administrator knows has issued or is required to issue any other permit under the Clean Air Act for the same facility or activity;
(C) Affected States and Indian Tribes;
(D) Affected State and local air pollution control agencies, the chief executives of the city and county where the early reductions source is located, any comprehensive regional land use planning agency and any State, Federal Land Manager, or Indian Governing Body whose lands may be affected by emissions from the regulated activity;
(E) Persons on a mailing list, including those who request in writing to be on the list. As part of this requirement, the Administrator shall notify the public of the opportunity to be put on the mailing list by way of generally accepted methods (
e.g.,
hyperlink sign-up function or radio button on an agency Web site, sign-up sheet at a public hearing, etc.) that enable interested parties to subscribe to the mailing list. The Administrator may update the mailing list from time to time by requesting written indication of continued interest from those listed. The Administrator may delete from the list the name of any person who fails to respond to such a request within a reasonable timeframe;
(F) Any unit of local government with authority for regulating air pollution and having jurisdiction over the area where the early reductions source is located and to each State agency having any authority for regulating air pollution under State law with respect to the operation of such source.
(ii) By posting a notice on a public Web site identified by the Administrator for the duration of the public comment period. The notice shall be consistent with paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section and be accompanied by a copy of the draft permit.
(iii) By any other method reasonably calculated to give actual notice of the action in question to the persons potentially affected by it, including press releases or any other forum or medium to elicit public participation.
(4)

(B) Date, time, and place of the hearing; and
(C) A brief description of the nature and purpose of the hearing, including the applicable rules and procedures.

the fact sheet or statement of basis, the permit application (if any), and the draft permit (if any).
(e)
Public comments and requests for public hearings.
During the public comment period provided under paragraph (a) of this section, any interested person may submit written comments on the draft permit or permit revision and may request a public hearing, if no hearing has already been scheduled. A request for a public hearing shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the issues proposed to be raised at the hearing. All comments shall be considered in making the final decision and shall be answered as provided in paragraph (j) of this section. The Administrator will keep a record of the commenters and of the issues raised during the public participation process, and such records shall be available to the public.
(f)
Public hearings.
(1)(i) The Administrator shall hold a hearing whenever he or she finds, on the basis of requests, a significant degree of public interest in a draft permit or permit revision.
(ii) The Administrator may also hold a public hearing at his or her discretion, whenever, for instance, such a hearing might clarify one or more issues involved in the permit decision.
(iii) Public notice of the hearing shall be given as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) Whenever a public hearing is held, the Administrator shall designate a Presiding Officer for the hearing who shall be responsible for its scheduling and orderly conduct.
(3) Any person may submit oral or written statements and data concerning the draft permit or permit revision. Reasonable limits may be set upon the time allowed for oral statements, and the submission of statements in writing may be required. The public comment period under paragraph (d) of this section shall be automatically extended to the close of any public hearing under this subsection. The hearing officer may also extend the comment period by so stating at the hearing.
(4) A tape recording or written transcript of the hearing shall be made available to the public.
(g)
Obligation to raise issues and provide information during the public comment period.
All persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the Administrator's tentative decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit all reasonably ascertainable arguments supporting their position by the close of the public comment period (including any public hearing). Any supporting materials which are submitted shall be included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless they are already part of the administrative record in the same proceeding, or consist of State or Federal statutes and regulations, EPA documents of general applicability, or other generally available reference materials. Commenters shall make supporting materials not already included in the administrative record available to EPA as directed by the Administrator. (A comment period longer than 30 days may be necessary to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (g). Additional time shall be granted to the extent that a commenter who requests additional time demonstrates the need for such time.)
(h)
Reopening of the public comment period.
(1)(i) The Administrator may order the public comment period reopened if the procedures of this paragraph (h) could expedite the decisionmaking process. When the public comment period is reopened under this paragraph (h), all persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the Administrator's tentative decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must submit all reasonably available factual grounds supporting their position, including all supporting material, by a date, not less than 60 days after public notice under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, set by the Administrator. Thereafter, any person may file a written response to the material filed by any other person, by a date, not less than 20 days after
the date set for filing of the material, set by the Administrator.
(ii) Public notice of any comment period under this paragraph shall identify the issues to which the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section shall apply.
(iii) On his or her own motion or on the request of any person, the Administrator may direct that the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section shall apply during the initial comment period where it reasonably appears that issuance of the permit will be contested and that applying the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section will substantially expedite the decisionmaking process. The notice of the draft permit shall state whenever this has been done.
(iv) A comment period of longer than 60 days will often be necessary in complicated proceedings to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this subsection. Commenters may request longer comment periods and they shall be granted to the extent they appear necessary.
(2) If any data, information, or arguments submitted during the public comment period appear to raise substantial new questions concerning a permit, the Administrator may take one or more of the following actions:
(i) Prepare a new draft permit, appropriately modified;
(ii) Prepare a revised statement of basis, a fact sheet or revised fact sheet, and reopen the comment period; or
(iii) Reopen or extend the comment period to give interested persons an opportunity to comment on the information or arguments submitted.
(3) Comments filed during the reopened comment period shall be limited to the substantial new questions that caused its reopening. The public notice shall define the scope of the reopening.
(4) Public notice of any of the above actions shall be issued under paragraph (d) of this section.
(i)
Issuance and effective date of permit.
(1) After the close of the public comment period on a draft permit, the Administrator shall issue a final permit decision. The Administrator shall notify the applicant and each person who has submitted written comments or requested notice of the final permit decision. This notice shall include reference to the procedures for appealing a decision on a permit. For the purposes of this paragraph (i), a final permit decision means a final decision to issue, deny, revise, revoke and reissue, or terminate a permit.
(2) A final permit decision shall become effective 30 days after the service of notice of the decision unless:
(i) A later effective date is specified in the decision; or
(ii) No comments requested a change in the draft permit, in which case the permit shall become effective immediately upon issuance.
(j)
Response to comments.
(1) At the time that any final permit decision is issued, the Administrator shall issue a response to comments. This response shall:
(i) Specify which provisions, if any, of the draft permit have been changed in the final permit decision, and the reasons for the change; and
(ii) Briefly describe and respond to all significant comments on the draft permit raised during the public comment period, or during any hearing.
(2) Any documents cited in the response to comments shall be included in the administrative record for the final permit decision as defined in paragraph (k) of this section. If new points are raised or new material supplied during the public comment period, EPA may document its response to those matters by adding new materials to the administrative record.
(3) The response to comments shall be available to the public.
(4) The Administrator will notify in writing any Affected State of any refusal to accept recommendations for the permit that the State submitted during the public or Affected State review period.
(k)
Administrative record for final permit.
(1) The Administrator shall base final permit decisions on the administrative record defined in this paragraph (k).
(2) The administrative record for any final permit shall consist of:
(i) All comments received during the public comment period, including any extension or reopening;
(ii) The tape or transcript of any hearing(s) held;
(iii) Any written material submitted at such a hearing;
(iv) The response to comments required by paragraph (j) of this section and any new materials placed in the record under paragraph (j) of this section;
(v) Other documents contained in the supporting file for the permit;
(vi) The final permit;
(vii) The application and any supporting data furnished by the applicant;
(viii) The draft permit or notice of intent to deny the application or to terminate the permit;
(ix) The statement of basis for the draft permit;
(x) All documents cited in the statement of basis; and
(xi) Other documents contained in the supporting file for the draft permit.
(3) The additional documents required under paragraph (k)(2) of this section should be added to the record as soon as possible after their receipt or publication by EPA. The record shall be complete on the date the final permit is issued.
(4) This section applies to all final permits.
(5) Material readily available at the issuing Regional Office, or published materials which are generally available and which are included in the administrative record under the standards of paragraph (j) of this section (“response to comments”), need not be physically included in the same file as the rest of the record as long as it is specifically referred to in the statement of basis or fact sheet or in the response to comments.
(l)
Appeal of permits.
(1) Permit decisions may be appealed under the permit appeal procedures of 40 CFR 124.19.
(2) An appeal under paragraph (l)(1) of this section is, under section 307(b) of the Act, a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of the final agency action.
(3) The filing of a petition for review of any condition of the permit or permit decision shall not stay the effect of any contested permit or permit condition.
(m)
Computation of time.
(1) Any time period scheduled to begin on the occurrence of an act or event shall begin on the day after the act or event.
(2) Any time period scheduled to begin before the occurrence of an act or event shall be computed so that the period ends on the day before the act or event, except as otherwise provided.
(3) If the final day of any time period falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the time period shall be extended to the next working day.
(4) Whenever a party or interested person has the right or is required to act within a prescribed period after the service of notice or other paper upon him or her by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed time.
