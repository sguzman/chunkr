via level gauge automation or daily manual gauging), the maximum average daily throughput is the average of all daily throughputs for days on which throughput was routed to the tank battery during the 30-day evaluation period; or
(3) If throughput to the tank battery is not measured on a daily basis (
e.g.,
via manual gauging at the start and end of loadouts), the maximum average daily throughput is the highest, of the average daily throughputs, determined for any production period to that tank battery during the 30-day evaluation period, as determined by averaging total throughput to that tank battery over each production period. A production period begins when production begins to be routed to a tank battery and ends either when throughput is routed away from that tank battery or when a loadout occurs from that tank battery, whichever happens first. Regardless of the determination methodology, operators must not include days during which throughput is not routed to the tank battery when calculating maximum average daily throughput for that tank battery.

# Model Rule—Applicability
§ 60.5385c
What is the purpose of this subpart?
(a)
Scope.
This subpart establishes emission standards and compliance schedules for the control of the pollutant greenhouse gases (GHG). The greenhouse gas standard in this subpart is in the form of a limitation on emissions of methane from designated facilities in the crude oil and natural gas source category that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction on or before December 6, 2022.
(b)
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and title V thresholds for Greenhouse Gases.
(1) For the purposes of 40 CFR 51.166(b)(49)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from designated facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(48) and in any State Implementation Plan (SIP) approved by the EPA that is interpreted to incorporate, or specifically incorporates, 40 CFR 51.166(b)(48).
(2) For the purposes of 40 CFR 52.21(b)(50)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from designated facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the
standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act as defined in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(49).
(3) For the purposes of 40 CFR 70.2, with respect to GHG emissions from designated facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.
(4) For the purposes of 40 CFR 71.2, with respect to GHG emissions from designated facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 71.2.
(c)
Exemption.
You are exempt from the obligation to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, provided you are not otherwise required by law to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 40 CFR 71.3(a). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, you must continue to comply with the provisions of this subpart.
§ 60.5386c
Am I subject to this subpart?
You are subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart if you are the owner or operator of one or more of the onshore designated facilities listed in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section, that is located within the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category, as defined in § 60.5430c, for which you commence construction, modification, or reconstruction on or before December 6, 2022. Facilities located inside and including the Local Distribution Company (LDC) custody transfer station are not subject to this subpart.
(a) Each well designated facility, which is a single well drilled for the purpose of producing oil or natural gas.
(b) Each centrifugal compressor designated facility, which is a single centrifugal compressor. A centrifugal compressor located at a well site is not a designated facility under this subpart. A centrifugal compressor located at a centralized production facility is a designated facility under this subpart.
(c) Each reciprocating compressor designated facility, which is a single reciprocating compressor. A reciprocating compressor located at a well site is not a designated facility under this subpart. A reciprocating compressor located at a centralized production facility is a designated facility under this subpart.
(d) Each process controller designated facility, which is the collection of natural gas-driven process controllers at a well site, centralized production facility, onshore natural gas processing plant, or a compressor station. Natural gas-driven process controllers that function as emergency shutdown devices and process controllers that are not driven by natural gas are exempt from the designated facility.
(e)(1) Each storage vessel designated facility, which is a tank battery that has the potential for methane emissions equal to or greater than 20 tpy as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. A tank battery with the potential for methane emissions below 20 tpy is not a storage vessel designated facility provided the owner or operator keeps records of the potential for emissions calculation for the life of the storage vessel or until such time the tank battery becomes a storage vessel designated facility because the potential for methane emissions meets or exceeds 20 tpy.
(2) The potential for methane emissions must be calculated as the cumulative emissions from all storage vessels within the tank battery as specified by the applicable requirements in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. The determination may take into account requirements under a legally and practicably enforceable limit in an operating permit or other requirement established under a Federal, state, local, or Tribal authority.
(i) For purposes of determining the applicability of a storage vessel tank battery as a designated facility, a legally and practicably enforceable limit must include the elements provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section.
(A) A quantitative production limit and quantitative operational limit(s) for the equipment, or quantitative operational limits for the equipment;
(B) An averaging time period for the production limit in (e)(2)(i)(A), if a production-based limit is used, that is equal to or less than 30 days;
(C) Established parametric limits for the production and/or operational limit(s) in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A), and where a control device is used to achieve an operational limit, an initial compliance demonstration (
i.e.,
performance test) for the control device that establishes the parametric limits;
(D) Ongoing monitoring of the parametric limits in (e)(2)(i)(C) that demonstrates continuous compliance with the production and/or operational limit(s) in (e)(2)(i)(A);
(E) Recordkeeping by the owner or operator that demonstrates continuous compliance with the limit(s) in (e)(2)(i)(A) through (D); and
(F) Periodic reporting that demonstrates continuous compliance.
(ii) For each tank battery located at a well site or centralized production facility, you must determine the potential for methane emissions within 60 days after the effective date of the approved state or Tribal plan, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section. The potential for methane emissions must be calculated using a generally accepted model or calculation methodology that accounts for flashing, working, and breathing losses, based on the maximum average daily throughput to the tank battery determined for a 30-day period of production.
(iii) For each tank battery not located at a well site or centralized production facility, including each tank battery located at a compressor station or onshore natural gas processing plant, you must determine the potential for methane emissions within 60 days after the effective date of the approved state or Tribal plan, using either method described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(A) Determine the potential for methane emissions using a generally accepted model or calculation methodology that accounts for flashing, working, and breathing losses, and based on the throughput to the tank battery established in a legally and practicably enforceable limit in an operating permit or other requirement established under a Federal, state, local, or Tribal authority; or
(B) Determine the potential for methane emissions using a generally accepted model or calculation methodology that accounts for flashing, working and breathing losses, based on projected maximum average daily throughput. Maximum average daily throughput is determined using a generally accepted engineering model (
e.g.,
volumetric condensate rates from the tank battery based on the maximum gas throughput capacity of each producing facility) to project the maximum average daily throughput for the tank battery.
(3) A storage vessel designated facility that subsequently has its potential for methane emissions decrease to less than 20 tpy shall remain a designated facility under this subpart.
(4) For storage vessels not subject to a legally and practicably enforceable limit in an operating permit or other requirement established under Federal, state, local, or Tribal authority, any vapor from the storage vessel that is recovered and routed to a process through a vapor recovery unit designed and operated as specified in this section is not required to be included in the determination of potential for methane emissions for purposes of determining designated facility status, provided you comply with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) You meet the cover requirements specified in § 60.5411c(b).
(ii) You meet the closed vent system requirements specified in § 60.5411c(a)(2) through (4) and (c).
(iii) You must maintain records that document compliance with paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(iv) In the event of removal of apparatus that recovers and routes vapor to a process, or operation that is inconsistent with the conditions specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, you must determine the storage vessel's potential for methane emissions according to this section within 30 days of such removal or operation.
(5) The requirements of this paragraph (e)(5) apply to each storage vessel designated facility immediately upon return to service. A storage vessel
designated facility or portion of a storage vessel designated facility that is reconnected to the original source of liquids remains a storage vessel designated facility subject to the same requirements that applied before being removed from service. Any storage vessel that is used to replace a storage vessel designated facility or portion of a storage vessel designated facility, or used to expand a storage vessel designated facility assumes the designated facility status of the storage vessel designated facility being replaced or expanded.
(6) A storage vessel with a capacity greater than 100,000 gallons used to recycle water that has been passed through two stage separation is not a storage vessel designated facility.
(f) Each process unit equipment designated facility, which is the group of all equipment within a process unit at an onshore natural gas processing plant is a designated facility. Equipment associated with a compressor station, dehydration unit, sweetening unit, underground storage vessel, field gas gathering system, or liquefied natural gas unit is covered by §§ 60.5400c, 60.5401c, 60.5402c, 60.5421c, and 60.5422c if it is located at an onshore natural gas processing plant. Equipment not located at the onshore natural gas processing plant site is exempt from the provisions of §§ 60.5400c, 60.5401c, 60.5402c, 60.5421c, and 60.5422c.

What GHG standards apply to reciprocating compressor designated facilities?
Each reciprocating compressor designated facility must comply with the GHG standards, using volumetric flow rate as a surrogate, in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, or the GHG standards in paragraph (d) of this section. You must also comply with the requirements in paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section.
(a) The volumetric flow rate of each cylinder, measured in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, must not exceed 2 scfm per individual cylinder. If the individual cylinders are manifolded to a single open-ended vent line, the volumetric flow rate must not exceed the sum of the individual cylinders multiplied by 2 scfm. You must conduct measurements of the volumetric flow rate in accordance with the schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section and determine the volumetric flow rate per cylinder in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. If the volumetric flow rate, measured in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, for a cylinder exceeds 2 scfm per cylinder (or a combined volumetric flow rate greater than the number of compression cylinders multiplied by 2 scfm), the rod packing or packings must be repaired or replaced as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(1) You must conduct your first volumetric flow rate measurements from your reciprocating compressor rod packing vent on or before 8,760 hours of operation after the effective date of an approved state or Tribal plan, on or before 8,760 hours of operation after last rod packing replacement, or on or before 8,760 hours of operation after startup, whichever date is later.
(2) You must conduct subsequent volumetric flow rate measurements from your reciprocating compressor rod packing vent on or before 8,760 hours of operation after the previous measurement which demonstrates compliance with the applicable volumetric flow rate of 2 scfm per cylinder (or a combined cylinder volumetric flow rate greater than the number of compression cylinders multiplied by 2 scfm), or on or before 8,760 hours of operation
after last rod packing replacement, whichever date is later.
(3) The rod packing must be repaired or replaced within 90 calendar days after the date of the volumetric emissions measurement that exceeded 2 scfm per cylinder. You must conduct follow-up volumetric flow rate measurements from compressor vents using the methods specified in paragraph (b) of this section within 15 days after the repair (or rod packing replacement) to document that the rate has been reduced to less than 2 scfm per cylinder. Delay of repair will be allowed if the conditions in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section are met.
(i) If the repair (or rod packing replacement) is technically infeasible, would require a vent blowdown, a compressor station shutdown, or would be unsafe to repair during operation of the unit, the repair (or rod packing replacement) must be completed during the next scheduled compressor station shutdown for maintenance, after a scheduled vent blowdown, or within 2 years of the date of the volumetric emissions measurement that exceeds the applicable required flow rate per cylinder, whichever is earliest. A vent blowdown is the opening of one or more blowdown valves to depressurize major production and processing equipment, other than a storage vessel.
(ii) If the repair requires replacement of the rod packing or a part, but the replacement cannot be acquired and installed within the repair timelines specified under this section due to the condition specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the repair must be completed in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section and documented in accordance with § 60.5420c(c)(4)(viii) through (x).
(A) Rod packing or part supplies had been sufficiently stocked but are depleted at the time of the required repair.
(B) The required rod packing or part replacement must be ordered no later than 10 calendar days after the reciprocating compressor is added to the delay of repair list due to parts unavailability. The repair must be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the replacement rod packing or part, unless the repair requires a compressor station shutdown. If the repair requires a compressor station shutdown, the repair must be completed in accordance with the timeframe specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
(b) You must determine the volumetric flow rate per cylinder from your reciprocating compressor as specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) For reciprocating compressor rod packing equipped with an open-ended vent line on compressors in operating or standby pressurized mode, determine the volumetric flow rate of the rod packing using one of the methods specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Determine the volumetric flow rate at standard conditions from the open-ended vent line using a high-volume sampler according to methods set forth in § 60.5405c(c).
(ii) Determine the volumetric flow rate at standard conditions from the open-ended vent line using a temporary or permanent meter, according to methods set forth in § 60.5405c(b).

For the purposes of this paragraph, emissions are detected whenever a leak is detected according to any of the methods in § 60.5405c(a). If emissions are detected using the methods set forth in § 60.5405c(a), then you must use one of the methods specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section to determine the volumetric flow rate per cylinder. If emissions are not detected using the methods in § 60.5405c(a), then you may assume that the volumetric flow rate is zero.
(2) For reciprocating compressor rod packing not equipped with an open-ended vent line on compressors in operating or standby pressurized mode, you must determine the volumetric flow rate of the rod packing using the methods specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) You must use the methods described in § 60.5405c(a) to conduct leak detection of emissions from the rod packing case into an open distance piece, or, for compressors with a closed distance piece, you must conduct annual leak detection of emissions from
the rod packing vent, distance piece vent, compressor crank case breather cap, or other vent emitting gas from the rod packing.
(ii) You must measure emissions found in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section using a meter or high-volume sampler according to methods set forth in § 60.5405c(b) or (c).

If you wish to use an analyzer other than a FID-based instrument, you must develop a site-specific fugitive emission definition that would be equivalent to 500 ppmv methane using a FID-based instrument (
e.g.,
10.6 eV PID with a specified isobutylene concentration as the fugitive emission definition would provide equivalent response to your compound of interest).
(ii)
Procedures for conducting surveys.
At a minimum, the procedures shall ensure that the surveys comply with the relevant sections of Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, including Section 8.3.1.
(iii)
Procedures for calibration.
The instrument must be calibrated before use each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part. At a minimum, you must also conduct precision tests at the interval specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, Section 8.1.2, and a calibration drift assessment at the end of each monitoring day. The calibration drift assessment must be conducted as specified in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(A) of this section. Corrective action for drift assessments is specified
in paragraphs (c)(8)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section.
(A) Check the instrument using the same calibration gas that was used to calibrate the instrument before use. Follow the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, Section 10.1, except do not adjust the meter readout to correspond to the calibration gas value. If multiple scales are used, record the instrument reading for each scale used. Divide the arithmetic difference of the initial and post-test calibration response by the corresponding calibration gas value for each scale and multiply by 100 to express the calibration drift as a percentage.
(B) If a calibration drift assessment shows a negative drift of more than 10 percent, then all equipment with instrument readings between the fugitive emission definition multiplied by (100 minus the percent of negative drift) divided by 100 and the fugitive emission definition that was monitored since the last calibration must be re-monitored.
(C) If any calibration drift assessment shows a positive drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then, at the owner/operator's discretion, all equipment with instrument readings above the fugitive emission definition and below the fugitive emission definition multiplied by (100 plus the percent of positive drift) divided by 100 monitored since the last calibration may be re-monitored.
(iv)
Procedures for monitoring yard piping (other than buried yard piping).

) You must conduct a visual inspection of the closed vent system(s) and cover(s) to identify if there are any defects, as defined in § 60.5416c(a)(1)(ii), § 60.5416c(a)(2)(iii), or § 60.5416c(a)(3)(i), as applicable.
(v) You must repair all sources of fugitive emissions in accordance with § 60.5397c(h) and all emissions or defects of covers and closed vent systems in accordance with § 60.5416c(b)(4), except as specified in this paragraph (b)(5)(v). Except as allowed by §§ 60.5397c(h)(3) and 60.5416c(b)(5), all repairs must be completed, including the resurvey verifying the repair, within 30 days of receiving the results of the periodic screening in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
(vi) If the results of the periodic screening event in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section indicate a confirmed detection at a designated facility, and the ground-based monitoring survey and inspections required by paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) through (iv) of this section demonstrate the confirmed detection was caused by a failure of a control device used to demonstrate continuous compliance under this subpart, you must initiate an investigative analysis to determine the underlying primary and other contributing cause(s) of such failure within 24 hours of receiving the results of the monitoring survey and/or inspection. As part of the investigation, you must determine if the control device is operating in compliance with the applicable requirements of §§ 60.5415c and 60.5417c, and if not, what actions are necessary to bring the control device into compliance with those requirements as soon as possible and prevent future failures of the control device from the same underlying cause(s).

(c)
Continuous Monitoring.
You may choose to demonstrate compliance for your fugitive emissions components designated facility and compliance with continuous inspection and monitoring requirements for your covers and closed vent systems through continuous monitoring using a technology approved in accordance with § 60.5398b(d). If you choose to demonstrate compliance using continuous monitoring, you must comply and develop a monitoring plan consistent with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section and comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in § 60.5424c.
(1) For the purpose of this section, continuous monitoring means the ability of a methane monitoring system to determine and record a valid methane mass emissions rate or equivalent of designated facilities at least once for every 12-hour block.
(i) The detection threshold of the system must be such that it can detect at least 0.40 kg/hr (0.88 lb/hr) of methane.
(ii) The health of the devices used within the continuous monitoring system must be confirmed for power and function at least twice every six-hour block.
(iii) The continuous monitoring system must transmit all applicable valid data at least once every 24-hours. The continuous monitoring system must transmit all valid data collected, including health checks required in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iv) The continuous monitoring system must continuously collect data as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section:
(A) The rolling 12-month average operational downtime of the continuous monitoring system must be less than or equal to 10 percent.
(B) Operational downtime of the continuous monitoring system is defined as a period of time for which any monitor fails to collect or transmit data as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or any monitor is out-of-control as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C) of this section.
(C) A monitor is out-of-control if it fails ongoing quality assurance checks, as specified in the alternative test method approved under § 60.5398b(d), or if the monitor output is outside of range. The beginning of the out-of-control period is defined as the time of the failure of the quality assurance check. The end of the out-of-control period is defined as the time when either the monitor passes a subsequent quality assurance check, or a new monitor is installed. The out-of-control period for a monitor outside of range starts at the time when the monitor first reads outside of range and ends when the monitor reads within range again.
(D) The downtime for the continuous monitoring system must be calculated each calendar month. Once 12 months of data are available, at the end of each calendar month, you must calculate the 12-month average by averaging that month with the previous 11 calendar months. You must determine the rolling 12-month average by recalculating the 12-month average at the end of each month.
(2) You must develop a monitoring plan that covers the collection of fugitive emissions components, covers, and closed vent systems for each site where continuous monitoring will be used to demonstrate compliance. At a minimum, the monitoring plan must contain the information specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (xii) of this section.
(i) Identification of each site to be monitored through continuous monitoring, including latitude and longitude coordinates of the site in decimal degrees to an accuracy and precision of at least four decimals of a degree using the North American Datum of 1983.
(ii) Identification of the approved alternative test method(s) approved under § 60.5398b(d) used for the continuous monitoring, including the detection principle; the manufacturer, make, and model; instrument manual, if applicable; and the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule.
(iii) If the continuous monitoring system is administered through a third-party provider, contact information where the provider can be reached 24 hours a day.
(iv) Number and location of monitors. If the continuous monitoring system uses open path technology, you must identify the location of any reflectors used. These locations should be identified by latitude and longitude coordinates in decimal degrees to an accuracy and precision of at least five decimals of a degree using the North American Datum of 1983.
(v) Discussion of system calibration requirements, including but not limited to, the calibration procedures and calibration schedule for the detection systems and meteorology systems.
(vi) Identification of critical components and infrastructure (
e.g.,
power, data systems) and procedures for their repairs.
(vii) Procedures for out-of-control periods.
(viii) Procedures for establishing baseline emissions, including the identification of any sources with methane emissions not subject to this subpart. The procedures for establishing the
baseline emissions must account for variability in the operation of the site. Operation of the site during the development of the baseline emissions must represent the site's expected annual production or throughput.
(ix) Procedures for determining when a fugitive emissions event is detected by the continuous monitoring technology.
(x) Procedures and timeframes for identifying and repairing fugitive emissions components, covers, and closed vent systems from which emissions are detected.
(xi) Procedures and timeframes for verifying repairs for fugitive emissions components, covers, and closed vent systems.
(xii) Records that will be kept and the length of time records will be kept.
(3) You must install and begin conducting monitoring with your continuous monitoring system according to the timeframes specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Within 120 days of the effective date of your state or Tribal plan for each fugitive emissions components designated facility and storage vessel designated facility located at a well site.
(ii) No later than the final date by which the next monitoring survey required by § 60.5397c(g)(1)(i) through (v) would have been required to be conducted if you were previously complying with the requirements in § 60.5397c and § 60.5416c.
(4) You are subject to the following action-levels as specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section for any designated facilities located at a well site, centralized production facility, or compressor station.
(i) For designated facilities located at a wellhead only well site, the action levels are as follows.
(A) The 90-day rolling average action-level is 1.2 kg/hr (2.6 lbs/hr) of methane over the site-specific baseline emissions.
(B) The 7-day rolling average action level is 15 kg/hr (34 lbs/hr) of methane over site-specific baseline emissions.
(ii) For designated facilities located at well sites with major production and processing equipment (including small well sites), centralized production facilities, and compressor stations, the action levels are as follows.
(A) The 90-day rolling average action-level is 1.6 kg/hr (3.6 lbs/hr) of methane over the site-specific baseline emissions.
(B) The rolling 7-day average action level is 21 kg/hr (46 lbs/hr) of methane over the site-specific baseline emissions.
(5) You must establish site-specific baseline emissions upon initial installation and activation of a continuous monitoring system. You must establish the baseline emissions under the conditions outlined in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section. You must determine the baseline emission rates according to paragraphs (c)(5)(iv) and (v) of this section. The baseline must be established initially and any time there is a major change to the processing equipment at a well site (including small well sites), centralized production facility, or compressor station.
(i) Inspect all fugitive emissions components according to the requirements in § 60.5397c and covers and closed vent systems according to the requirements in § 60.5416c. This includes all fugitive emissions components, covers, and closed vent systems, regardless of whether they are regulated by this subpart. Repairs of any fugitive emissions, leaks, or defects found during the inspection must be completed prior to beginning the period in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.

e.g.,
flares) on all affected sources are operating in compliance with the applicable requirements of §§ 60.5415c and 60.5417c. You must ensure that all control devices are operating in compliance with the applicable regulations prior to beginning the period in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section. Verify that all other methane emission sources (
e.g.,
reciprocating engines) located at the site are operating consistent with any applicable regulations. You must ensure that these sources are operating in compliance with the applicable regulations prior to beginning the period in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.
(iii) Using the alternative test method approved per § 60.5398b(d), record the
site-level emission rate from your continuous monitoring system for 30 operating days. You must minimize any activities that are not normal, day-to-day activities during this 30 operating day period. Document any maintenance activities and the period (including the start date and time and end date and time) such activities occurred during the 30 operating day period.
(iv) Determine the site-specific baseline by calculating the mean emission rate (kg/hr of methane) for the 30 operating day period, less any time periods when maintenance activities were conducted.
(v) The site-specific baseline emission rate must be no more than 10 times the applicable 90-day action-level defined in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
(6) Calculate the emission rate from your site according to paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section. Compare the emission rate calculated in this paragraph (c)(6) to the appropriate action levels in paragraph (c)(4) of this section to determine whether you have exceeded an action level.
(i) Each calendar day, calculate the daily average mass emission rate in kg/hr of methane from your continuous monitoring system.
(ii) Once the system has been operating for 7 calendar days, at the end of each calendar day calculate the 7-day average mass emission rate by averaging the mass emission rate from that day with the mass emission rate from the previous 6 calendar days. Subtract the site-specific baseline mass emission rate from the 7-day average mass emission rate when comparing the mass emission rate to the applicable action level. Determine the 7-day rolling average by recalculating the 7-day average each calendar day, less the site-specific baseline.
(iii) Once the system has been operating for 90 calendar days, at the end of each calendar day calculate the 90-day average mass emission rate by averaging the mass emission rate from that day with the mass emission rate from the previous 89 calendar days. Subtract the site-specific baseline emission rate from the 90-day average mass emission rate when comparing the mass emission rate to the applicable action level. Determine the 90-day rolling average by recalculating the 90-day average each calendar day, less the site-specific baseline.
(7) Within 5 days of determining that either of your action levels in paragraph (c)(4) of this section has been exceeded, you must initiate an investigative analysis to determine the underlying primary and contributing cause(s) of such exceedance and actions to be taken to reduce the mass emission rate below the applicable action level.
(i) You must complete the investigative analysis and take initial steps to bring the mass emission rate below the action level no later than 5 days after determining there is an exceedance of the action level in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) or (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.

(8) You must develop a mass emission rate reduction plan if you meet any of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section. The plan must describe the action(s) completed to date to reduce the mass emission rate below the action level, additional measures that you propose to employ to reduce methane emissions below the action level, and a schedule for completion of these measures. You must submit the plan to the Administrator within 60 days of initially determining there is an exceedance of an action level in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(i) If, upon completion of the initial actions required under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the average mass emission rate for the following 30-day period is not below the applicable action level in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) or (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section. The beginning of the 30-day period starts on the calendar day following completion of the initial actions in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
(ii) If, upon completion of the initial actions required under paragraph (c)(6)
of this section, the average mass emission rate for the following 24-hour period is not below the applicable action level in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) or (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. The average mass emission rate will be the mass emission rate calculated according to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section for the calendar day following completion of the initial corrective actions in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
(iii) All actions needed to reduce the average mass emission rate below the action level require more than 30 days to implement.
(9) You must maintain the records as specified in § 60.5420c(c)(3) through (c)(6), (c)(13) and (c)(14), and § 60.5424c(e). You must submit the reports as specified in § 60.5420c(b)(1), (b)(3) through (9) and § 60.5424c.

(2)
Method 21.
Use Method 21 in appendix A-7 to this part according to § 60.5406c(b)(1) and (2). For the purposes of this section, an instrument reading of 500 ppmv above background or greater is a leak.
(b) You must determine natural gas volumetric flow rate using a rate meter which meets the requirement in Method 2D in appendix A-1 to this part. Rate meters must be calibrated on an annual basis according to the requirements in Method 2D.
(c) You must use a high-volume sampler to measure emissions of the reciprocating compressor rod packing or centrifugal compressor dry or wet seal vent in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) You must use a high-volume sampler designed to capture the entirety of the emissions from the applicable vent and measure the entire range of methane concentrations being emitted as well as the total volumetric flow at standard conditions. You must develop a standard operating procedure for this device and document these procedures in the appropriate monitoring plan. In order to get reliable results, persons using this device should be knowledgeable in its operation and the requirements in this section.
(2) This procedure may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This procedure may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this procedure to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this procedure.
(3) The high-volume sampler must include a methane gas sensor(s) which meets the requirements in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) The methane sensor(s) must be selective to methane with minimal interference, less than 2.5 percent for the sum of responses to other compounds in the gas matrix. You must document the minimal interference though empirical testing or through data provided by the manufacturer of the sensor.

(A) Initially and on a semi-annual basis, determine the linearity at four points through the measurement range for each methane sensor using methane gaseous calibration cylinder standards. At each point, the difference between the cylinder value and the sensor reading must be less than 5 percent of the respective calibration gas value. If the sensor does not meet this requirement, perform corrective action on the sensor, and do not use the sampler until these criteria can be met.
(B) Prior to and at the end of each testing day, challenge each sensor at two points, a low point, and a mid-point, using methane gaseous calibration cylinder standards. At each point, the difference between the cylinder value and the sensor reading must be less than 5 percent of the respective calibration gas value. If the sensor does not meet this requirement, perform corrective action on the sensor and do not use the sampler again until these criteria can be met. If the post-test calibration check fails at either point, invalidate the data from all tests performed subsequent to the last passing calibration check.
(ii) Flow measurement sensors must meet the requirements in Method 2D in appendix A-1 to this part. Rate meters must be calibrated on an annual basis according to the requirements in Method 2D. If your flow sensor relies on ancillary temperature and pressure measurements to correct the flow rate to standard conditions, the temperature and pressure sensors must also be calibrated on an annual basis. Standard conditions are defined as 20 °C (68 °F) and 760 mm Hg (29.92 in. Hg).
(6) You must conduct sampling of the reciprocating compressor rod packing or centrifugal compressor dry or wet seal vent in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) The instrument must be operated consistent with manufacturer recommendations; users are encouraged to develop a standard operating procedure to document the exact procedures used for sampling.
(ii) Identify the rod packing or centrifugal compressor dry or wet seal vent to be measured and record the signal to noise ratio (S/N) of the engine. Collect a background methane sample in parts per million by volume (ppmv) for a minimum of one minute and record the result along with the date and time.
(iii) Approach the vent with the sample hose and adjust the sampler so that you are measuring at the full flow rate. Then, adjust the flow rate to ensure the measured methane concentration is within the calibrated range of the methane sensor and minimum methane concentration is at least 2 ppmv higher than the background concentration. Sample for a period of at least one minute and record the average flow rate in standard cubic feet per minute and the methane sample concentration in ppmv, along with the date and time. Standard conditions are defined as 20 °C (68 °F) and 760 mm Hg (29.92 in. Hg).
(iv) Calculate the leak rate according to the following equation:
ER08MR24.037
Where:
CH4
B
= background methane concentration, ppmv
CH4
S
= methane sample concentration, ppmv
V = Average flow rate of the sampler, scfm
Q = Methane emission rate, scfm
(v) You must collect at least three separate one-minute measurements and determine the average leak rate. The relative percent difference of these three separate samples should be less than 10 percent.
(7) If the measured natural gas flow determined as specified in paragraph (c)(6) of this section exceeds 70.0 percent of the manufacturer's reported maximum sampling flow rate you must either use a temporary or permanent flow meter according to paragraph (b) of this section or use another method meeting the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section to determine the leak or flow rate.
(d) As an alternative to a high-volume sampler, you may use any other method that has been validated in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 301 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 63, subject to Administrator approval, as specified in § 60.8(b).

(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration no more than 2,000 ppmv greater than the leak definition concentration of the equipment monitored. If the monitoring instrument's design allows for multiple calibration scales, then the lower scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is no higher than 2,000 ppmv above the concentration specified as a leak, and the highest scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is approximately or equal to 10,000 ppmv. If only one scale on an instrument will be used during monitoring, you need not calibrate the scales that will not be used during that day's monitoring.
(iii) Verification that your monitoring equipment meets the requirements specified in Section 6.0 of Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part. For purposes of instrument capability, the leak definition shall be 500 ppmv or greater methane using a FID-based instrument for valves and connectors and 2,000 ppmv methane or greater for pumps. If you wish to use an analyzer other than a FID-based instrument, you must develop a site-specific leak definition that would be equivalent to 500 ppmv methane using a FID-based instrument (
e.g.,
10.6 eV PID with a specified isobutylene concentration as the leak definition would provide equivalent response to your compound of interest).
(2) The instrument must be calibrated before use each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part. At minimum, you must also conduct precision
tests at the interval specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, Section 8.1.2, and a calibration drift assessment at the end of each monitoring day. The calibration drift assessment must be conducted as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Corrective action for drift assessments is specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
(i) Check the instrument using the same calibration gas that was used to calibrate the instrument before use. Follow the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, Section 10.1, except do not adjust the meter readout to correspond to the calibration gas value. If multiple scales are used, record the instrument reading for each scale used. Divide the arithmetic difference of the initial and post-test calibration response by the corresponding calibration gas value for each scale and multiply by 100 to express the calibration drift as a percentage.
(ii) If a calibration drift assessment shows a negative drift of more than 10 percent, then all equipment with instrument readings between the fugitive emission definition multiplied by (100 minus the percent of negative drift) divided by 100 and the fugitive emission definition that was monitored since the last calibration must be re-monitored.
(iii) If any calibration drift assessment shows a positive drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then, at the owner/operator's discretion, all equipment with instrument readings above the fugitive emission definition and below the fugitive emission definition multiplied by (100 plus the percent of positive drift) divided by 100 monitored since the last calibration may be re-monitored.
(c) You shall determine compliance with the no detectable emission standards in § 60.5401c(b) and (f) as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.
(2) Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part shall be used to determine the background level. All potential leak interfaces shall be traversed as close to the interface as possible. The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 500 ppmv for determining compliance.
(d) You shall demonstrate that a piece of equipment is in light liquid service by showing that all of the following conditions apply:
(1) The vapor pressure of one or more of the organic components is greater than 0.3 kPa at 20 °C (1.2 in. H
2
O at68 °F). Standard reference texts or ASTM D2879-83, -96, or -97 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) shall be used to determine the vapor pressures.
(2) The total concentration of the pure organic components having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kPa at 20 °C (1.2 in. H
2
O at 68 °F) is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight.
(3) The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.
(e) Samples used in conjunction with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment, or the gas being combusted in the flare.

(2)
OGI inspection.
Where OGI is used, the closed vent system, cover, or self-contained process controller is determined to operate with no identifiable emissions if no emissions are imaged during the inspection.

For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts that are not organic hazardous air pollutants or volatile organic compounds, you must calculate the average stream response factor on an inert-free basis.
(B) If no instrument is available that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section, you may adjust the instrument readings by multiplying by
the average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis, as described in paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section.

(B) If you choose to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, you must compare the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (b)(4)(vii) of this section.
(vii) A closed vent system, cover, or self-contained process controller is determined to operate with no identifiable emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section is less than 500 ppmv. An organic concentration value determined in paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section of greater than or equal to 500 ppmv constitutes a deviation of the no identifiable emissions standard until an inspection conducted in accordance with this paragraph (b)(4) of this section determines that the closed vent system, cover, or self-contained process controller, as applicable, operates with no identifiable emissions.

(
1
) You must follow the procedure in Performance Specification 9 of appendix B to this part, except that a single daily mid-level calibration check can be used (rather than triplicate analysis), the multi-point calibration can be conducted quarterly (rather than monthly), and the sampling line temperature must be maintained at a minimum temperature of 60 °C (rather than 120 °C). Calibration gas cylinders must be certified to an accuracy of 2 percent
and traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.
(
2
) You must meet the accuracy requirements in Performance Specification 9 of appendix B to this part.
(
3
) You must use a calibration gas or multiple gases that includes the compounds that are reasonably expected to be present in the flare gas stream. If multiple calibration gases are necessary to cover all compounds, you must calibrate the instrument on all of the gases. You may only use the compounds used to calibrate the gas chromatograph in the calculation of the vent gas NHV.
(

) In lieu of the calibration gas described in paragraph (d)(8)(ii)(
B
)(
3
) of this section, you may use a surrogate calibration gas consisting of hydrogen and C1 through C5 normal hydrocarbons. All of the calibration gases may be combined in one cylinder. If multiple calibration gases are necessary to cover all compounds, you must calibrate the instrument on all of the gases. Use the response factor for the nearest normal hydrocarbon (
i.e.,
n-alkane) in the calibration mixture to quantify unknown components detected in the analysis. Use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify unknown components detected in the analysis that elute after n-pentane.
(
5
) To determine the NHV of the vent gas, determine the product of the volume fraction of the individual component in the vent gas and the net heating value of that individual component. Sum the products for all components in the vent gas to determine the NHV for the vent gas. For the net heating value of each individual component, use the net heating value at 25 °C and 1 atmosphere.

) You must meet applicable requirements in Performance Specification 9 of appendix B of this part for continuous monitoring system acceptance including, but not limited to, performing an initial multi-point calibration check at three concentrations following the procedure in Section 10.1. A single daily mid-level calibration check can be used (rather than triplicate analysis), the multi-point calibration can be conducted quarterly (rather than monthly), and the sampling line temperature must be maintained at a minimum temperature of 60 °C (rather than 120 °C). Calibration gas cylinders must be certified to an accuracy of 2 percent and traceable to NIST standards.
(

= Certified cylinder gas value (ppm).
(
3
) You must use a calibration gas or multiple gases that includes the compounds that are reasonably expected to be present in the flare gas stream. If multiple calibration gases are necessary to cover all compounds, you must calibrate the instrument on all of the gases. You may only use the compounds used to calibrate the mass spectrometer in the calculation of the vent gas NHV.
(
4
) In lieu of the calibration gas described in paragraph (d)(8)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section, you may use a surrogate calibration gas consisting of hydrogen
and C1 through C5 normal hydrocarbons. All of the calibration gases may be combined in one cylinder. If multiple calibration gases are necessary to cover all compounds, you must calibrate the instrument on all of the gases. For unknown gas components that have similar analytical mass fragments to calibration compounds, you may report the unknowns as an increase in the overlapped calibration gas compound. For unknown compounds that produce mass fragments that do not overlap calibration compounds, you may use the response factor for the nearest molecular weight hydrocarbon in the calibration mix to quantify the unknown component. You may use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify any unknown components detected with a higher molecular weight than n-pentane.
(
5
) You must perform an initial calibration to identify mass fragment overlap and response factors for the target compounds.
(
6
) To determine the NHV of the vent gas, determine the product of the volume fraction of the individual component in the vent gas and the net heating value of that individual component. Sum the products for all components in the vent gas to determine the NHV for the vent gas. For the net heating value of each individual component, use the net heating value at 25 °C and 1 atmosphere.

Subsequent compositional analysis of the samples must be performed according to ASTM D1945-14 (R2019) (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). To determine the NHV of the vent gas, determine the product of the volume fraction of the individual component in the vent gas and the net heating value of that individual component. Sum the products for all components in the vent gas to determine the NHV for the vent gas. For the net heating value of each individual component, use the net heating value at 25 °C and 1 atmosphere.
(iii) For an unassisted or pressure-assisted flare or enclosed combustion device, if you demonstrate according to the methods described in paragraphs (d)(8)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section that the NHV of the inlet gas to the enclosed combustion device or flare consistently exceeds the applicable operating limit specified in § 60.5415c(e)(1)(vii)(B) or (C), continuous monitoring of the NHV is not required, but you must conduct the ongoing sampling in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(G) of this section. For flares and enclosed combustion devices that use only perimeter assist air and do not use steam assist or premix assist air, if you demonstrate according to the methods described in paragraphs (d)(8)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section that the NHV of the inlet gas to the enclosed combustion device or flare consistently exceeds 300 Btu/scf, continuous monitoring of the NHV is not required, but you must conduct the ongoing sampling in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(G) of this section. For an unassisted or pressure-assisted flare or enclosed combustion device, in lieu of conducting the demonstration outlined in paragraphs (d)(8)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section, you may conduct the demonstration outlined in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(H) of this section, but you must still comply with paragraphs (d)(8)(iii)(E) through (G) of this section.
(A) Continuously monitor or collect a sample of the inlet gas to the enclosed combustion device or flare twice daily to determine the average NHV of the gas stream for 14 consecutive operating days. If you do not continuously monitor the NHV, the minimum time of collection for each individual sample be at least one hour. Consecutive samples must be separated by at least 6 hours. If inlet gas flow is intermittent such that there are not at least 28 samples over the 14 operating day period, you must continue to collect samples of the inlet gas beyond the 14 operating day period until you collect a minimum of 28 samples.
(B) If you collect samples twice per day, count the number of samples where the NHV value is less than 1.2 times the applicable operating limit specified in § 60.5415c(e)(1)(vii)(B) or (C), or this paragraph (d)(8)(iii) (
i.e.,
values that are less than 240, 360, or 960 Btu/scf, as applicable) during the sample
collection period in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(A) of this section.
(C) If you continuously sample the inlet stream for 14 days, count the number of hourly average NHV values that are less than the applicable operating limit specified in § 60.5415c(e)(1)(vii)(B) or (C), or this paragraph (d)(8)(iii) (
i.e.,
values that are less than 200, 300, or 800 Btu/scf, as applicable), during the sample collection period in paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(A) of this section.
(D) If there are no samples counted under paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(B) of this section or there are no hourly values counted under paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(C) of this section, the gas stream is considered to consistently exceed the applicable NHV operating limit and on-going continuous monitoring is not required.
(E) If process operations are revised that could impact the NHV of the gas sent to the enclosed combustion device or flare, such as the removal or addition of process equipment, and at any time the Administrator requires, re-evaluation of the gas stream must be performed according to paragraphs (d)(8)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section to ensure the gas stream still consistently exceeds the applicable operating limit specified in § 60.5415c(e)(1)(vii)(B) or (C), or this paragraph (d)(8)(iii).
(F) When collecting samples under paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(A) of this section, the owner or operator must account for any sources of inert gases that can be sent to the enclosed combustion device or flare (
e.g.,
streams from compressors in acid gas service, streams from enhanced oil recovery facilities). The report in § 60.5420c(b)(10)(v)(I) and the records of the demonstration in § 60.5420c(c)(10)(vi) must note whether the enclosed combustion device or flare has the potential to receive inert gases, and if so, whether the sampling included periods where the highest percentage of inert gases were sent to the enclosed combustion device or flare. If the introduction of inerts is intermittent and does not occur during the initial demonstration, the introduction of inerts will be considered a revision to process operations that triggers a re-evaluation under paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(E) of this section. If conditions at the site did not allow sampling during periods where the introduction of inert gases was at the highest percentage possible, increasing the percentage of inerts will be considered a revision to process operations that triggers a re-evaluation under paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(E) of this section.
(G) You must collect three samples of the inlet gas to the enclosed combustion device or flare at least once every 5 years. The minimum time of collection for each individual sample must be at least one hour. The samples must be taken during the period with the lowest expected NHV (
i.e.,
the period with the highest percentage of inerts). The first set of periodic samples must be taken, or continuous monitoring commenced, no later than 60 calendar months following the last sample taken under paragraph (d)(8)(iii)(A) of this section. Subsequent periodic samples must be taken, or continuous monitoring commenced, no later than 60 calendar months following the previous sample. If any sample has an NHV value less than 1.2 times the applicable operating limit specified in § 60.5415c(e)(1)(vii)(B) or (C), or this paragraph (d)(8)(iii) (
i.e.,
values that are less than 240, 360, or 960 Btu/scf, as applicable), you must conduct the monitoring required by paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of this section.
(H) You may request an alternative test method under § 60.5412c(d) to demonstrate that the flare or enclosed combustion device reduces methane and VOC in the gases vented to the device by 95.0 percent by weight or greater. You must use an alternative test method that demonstrates compliance with the combustion efficiency limit; you may not use an alternative test method that demonstrates compliance with NHV
cz
and NHV
dil
in lieu of measuring combustion efficiency directly. You must measure data values at the frequency specified in the alternative test method and conduct the quality assurance and quality control requirements outlined in the alternative test method at the frequency outlined in the alternative test method. You must monitor the combustion efficiency of the flare continuously for 14 days. If there are no values of the combustion efficiency measured by the alternative
test method that are less than 95.0 percent, the gas stream is considered to consistently exceed the applicable NHV operating limit, and you are not required to continuously monitor the NHV of the inlet gas to the flare or enclosed combustion device.
(iv) Except as noted in paragraphs (d)(8)(iv)(A) through (E) of this section, a continuous parameter monitoring system for measuring the flow of gas to the enclosed combustion device or flare.

(A) Except as allowed by paragraph (d)(8)(iv)(E) of this section, you must monitor and calculate NHV
cz
as specified in § 63.670(m) of this chapter. Additionally, for flares and enclosed combustion devices that use only perimeter assist air and do not use steam assist or premix assist air, the NHV

cz
and NHV
dil
.

If you are required to submit notifications or reports following the procedure specified in this paragraph (d), you must submit notifications or reports to the EPA via CEDRI, which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as CBI. Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report or notification, you must submit a complete file in the format specified in this subpart, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (d).
(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov,
and as described above, should include clear CBI markings. ERT files should be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group; all other files should be flagged to the attention of the Oil and Natural Gas Sector Lead. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(2) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: U.S. EPA, Attn: OAQPS Document Control Officer, Mail Drop: C404-02, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, P.O. Box 12055, RTP, NC 27711. ERT files should be sent to the secondary attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, and all other files should be sent to the secondary attention of the Oil and Natural Gas Sector Lead. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.
(e)

The contract must also include a report for each audit under ISO-IEC Standard 17065 that fully documents the results of the audit. The contract must include authorization and requirement for the third-party certifier to submit all such reports to the Administrator and the manufacturer within 30 days of the audit. The audit report must identify deviations from the manufacturer's quality assurance plan and specify the corrective actions that need to be taken to address each identified deficiency.
(ii) The manufacturer must submit the materials specified in paragraph (b) of this section and a quality assurance plan that meets the requirements of paragraph (m) of this section to the third-party certifier. The quality assurance plan must ensure that units within a model line will be similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the wood heater submitted for certification testing, and it must include design drawings for the model line.
(iii) The manufacturer must apply to the third-party certifier for a certification of conformity with the applicable requirements of this subpart for the model line.
(A) After testing by an approved test laboratory is complete, certification of conformity with the emission standards in § 60.5474 must be performed by the manufacturer's contracted third-party certifier.
(B) The third-party certifier may certify conformity if the emission tests have been conducted per the appropriate guidelines: The test report is complete and accurate; the instrumentation used for the test was properly calibrated; the test report shows that the representative affected central heater meets the applicable emission limits specified in § 60.5474; and the quality assurance plan is adequate to ensure that units within the model line will be similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the central heater submitted for certification testing, and that the affected heaters would meet all applicable requirements of this subpart.
(iv) The manufacturer must then submit to the Administrator an application for a certificate of compliance that includes the certification of conformity, quality assurance plan, test report and all supporting documentation specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(v) The submission also must include a statement signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer or authorized representative that the manufacturer has complied with and will continue to comply with all requirements
of this subpart for certificate of compliance and that the manufacturer remains responsible for compliance regardless of any error by the test laboratory or third-party certifier.
(2) The Administrator will issue to the manufacturer a certificate of compliance for a model line if it is determined, based on all of the information submitted in the application for certification and any other relevant information, that:
(i) A valid certification of conformity has demonstrated that the representative affected central heater complies with the applicable emission standards in § 60.5474;
(ii) Any tolerances or materials for components listed in paragraph (k)(2) or (3) of this section that are different from those specified in those paragraphs may not be reasonably anticipated to cause central heaters in the model line to exceed the applicable emission limits;
(iii) The requirements of paragraphs (b) of this section have been met; and
(iv) A valid certificate of conformity for the model line has been prepared and submitted.
(3) The Administrator will deny certification if the Administrator determines that the criteria in paragraph (f)(2) of this section have not been satisfied. Upon denying certification under this paragraph, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for the determination.
(g)
Waiver from submitting test results.
An applicant for certification may apply for a potential waiver of the requirement to submit the results of a certification test pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, if the central heater meets either of the following conditions:
(1) The central heaters of the model line are similar in all material respects that would affect emissions, as defined in § 60.5473 and paragraph (k) of this section, to another model line that has already been issued a certificate of compliance. A manufacturer that seeks a waiver of certification testing must identify the model line that has been certified, and must submit a copy of an agreement with the owner of the design permitting the applicant to produce central heaters of that design.
(2) The manufacturer has previously conducted a valid certification test to demonstrate that the central heaters of the model line meet the applicable standard specified in § 60.5474.
(h)
Certification period.
Unless revoked sooner by the Administrator, a certificate of compliance will be valid for 5 years from the date of issuance or until a more stringent standard comes into effect, whichever is sooner.
(i)
Renewal of certification.
(1) The manufacturer must renew a model line's certificate of compliance or recertify the model line every 5 years, or the manufacturer may choose to no longer manufacture or sell that model line after the expiration date. If the manufacturer chooses to no longer manufacture that model line, then the manufacturer must submit a statement to the Administrator to that effect.
(2) A manufacturer of an affected residential hydronic heater or forced-air furnace or other central heater may apply to the Administrator for potential renewal of its certificate of compliance by submitting the material specified in paragraph (b) and following the procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section, or by affirming in writing that the central heaters in the model line continue to be similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the representative central heater submitted for testing on which the original certificate of compliance was based and requesting a potential waiver from certification testing. The application must include a copy of the review of the draft application and approval by the third-party certifier.
(3) If the Administrator grants a renewal of certification, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for the determination and issue a certification renewal.
(4) If the Administrator denies the request for a renewal of certification, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for the determination.
(5) If the Administrator denies the request for a renewal of certification, the manufacturer and retailer must not
manufacture or sell the previously-certified central heaters after the expiration date of the certificate of compliance.
(j) [Reserved]
(k)
Recertification.
(1) The manufacturer must recertify a model line whenever any change is made in the design submitted pursuant to paragraph (k)(2) of this section that affects or is presumed to affect the particulate matter emission rate for that model line. The manufacturer of an affected central heater must apply to the Administrator for potential recertification by submitting the material specified in paragraph (b) of this section and following the procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section or by affirming in writing that the change will not cause the central heaters in the model line to exceed applicable emission limits and requesting a waiver from certification testing. The application for recertification must be reviewed and approved by the contracted third-party certifier and a copy of the review and approval must be included. The Administrator may waive this requirement upon written request by the manufacturer, if the manufacturer presents adequate rationale and the Administrator determines that the change may not reasonably be anticipated to cause central heaters in the model line to exceed the applicable emission limits. The granting of such a waiver does not relieve the manufacturer of any compliance obligations under this subpart.
(2) Any change in the design tolerances of any of the following components (where such components are applicable) is presumed to affect particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency if that change exceeds ±0.64 cm (±1/4 inch) for any linear dimension and ±5 percent for any cross-sectional area relating to air introduction systems and catalyst bypass gaps unless other dimensions and cross-sectional areas are previously approved by the Administrator under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section:

Additionally, if a component change of either sampling train is needed during sampling, then perform the leak check specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Four-inch filters and Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used in ASTM E2515-11. For all tests conducted using ASTM 2515-11, with the exceptions described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, the manufacturer and approved test laboratory must also measure the first hour of particulate matter emissions for each test run by sampling with a third, identical and independent sampling train operated concurrently with the first hour of PM paired train compliance testing. The manufacturer and approved test laboratory must report the test results for this third train separately as the first hour emissions.
(1)
Post-test leak check.
A leak check of each sampling train is mandatory at the conclusion of each sampling run before sample recovery. The leak check must be performed in accordance with the procedures of ASTM E2515-11, section 9.6.4.1 (IBR, see § 60.17), except that it must be conducted at a vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum value reached during the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.0003 m
3
/min (0.01 cfm) or 4% of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the leak check results are acceptable. If a higher leakage rate is obtained, the sampling run is invalid.
(2)
Leak checks during sample run.
If, during a sampling run, a component (
e.g.,
filter assembly) change becomes necessary, a leak check must be conducted immediately before the change is made. Record the sample volume before and after the leak test. The sample volume collected during any leak checks must not be included in the total sample volume for the test run. The leak check must be done according to the procedure outlined in ASTM E2515-11, section 9.6.4.1 (IBR, see § 60.17), except that it must be done at a vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum value recorded up to that point in the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.0003 m
3
/min (0.01 cfm) or 4% of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the leak check results are acceptable. If a higher leakage rate is obtained, the sampling run is invalid.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
f

# ):
Immediately after component changes, leak checks are optional but highly recommended. If such leak checks are done, the procedure in paragraph (f)(1) of this section should be used.
(g) Douglas fir may be used in ASTM E2618-13 and CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17).
(h) The manufacturer of an affected central heater model line must notify the Administrator of the date that certification testing is to begin, by email,

# Emission Standards
§ 60.5515
Which pollutants are regulated by this subpart?
(a) The pollutants regulated by this subpart are greenhouse gases. The greenhouse gas standard in this subpart is in the form of a limitation on emission of carbon dioxide.
(b)
PSD and title V thresholds for greenhouse gases.
(1) For the purposes of 40 CFR 51.166(b)(49)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in § 51.166(b)(48) of this chapter and in any SIP approved by the EPA that is interpreted to incorporate, or specifically incorporates, § 51.166(b)(48).
(2) For the purposes of 40 CFR 52.21(b)(50)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in § 52.21(b)(49) of this chapter.

(4) For the purposes of 40 CFR 71.2, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 71.2.
§ 60.5520
What CO
2
emissions standard must I meet?
(a) For each affected EGU subject to this subpart, you must not discharge from the affected EGU any gases that contain CO
2
in excess of the applicable CO
2
emission standard specified in table 1 or 2 to this subpart, consistent with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, as applicable.
(b) Except as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, you must comply with the applicable gross or net energy output standard, and your operating permit must include monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting methodologies based on the applicable gross or net energy output standard. For the remainder of this subpart (for sources that do not qualify under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section), where the term “gross or net energy output” is used, the term that applies to you is “gross energy output.”
(c) As an alternate to meeting the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, an owner or operator of a stationary combustion turbine may petition the Administrator in writing to comply with the alternate applicable net energy output standard. If the Administrator grants the petition, beginning on the date the Administrator grants the petition, the affected EGU must comply with the applicable net energy output-based standard included in this subpart. Your operating permit must include monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting methodologies based on the applicable net energy output standard. For the remainder of this subpart, where the term “gross or net energy output” is used, the term that applies to you is “net energy output.” Owners or operators complying with the net output-based standard must petition the Administrator to switch back to complying with the gross energy output-based standard.
(d) Owners or operators of a stationary combustion turbine that maintain records of electric sales to demonstrate that the stationary combustion turbine is subject to a heat input-based standard in table 2 to this subpart that are only permitted to burn one or more uniform fuels, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, are only subject to the monitoring requirements in paragraph (d)(1). Owners or operators of all other stationary combustion turbines that maintain records of electric sales to demonstrate that the stationary combustion turbines are subject to a heat input-based standard
in table 2 are only subject to the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(1) Owners or operators of stationary combustion turbines that are only permitted to burn fuels with a consistent chemical composition (
i.e.,
uniform fuels) that result in a consistent emission rate of 69 kilograms per gigajoule (kg/GJ) (160 lb CO
2
/MMBtu) or less are not subject to any monitoring or reporting requirements under this subpart. These fuels include, but are not limited to hydrogen, natural gas, methane, butane, butylene, ethane, ethylene, propane, naphtha, propylene, jet fuel kerosene, No. 1 fuel oil, No. 2 fuel oil, and biodiesel. Stationary combustion turbines qualifying under this paragraph are only required to maintain purchase records for permitted fuels.
(2) Owners or operators of stationary combustion turbines permitted to burn fuels that do not have a consistent chemical composition or that do not have an emission rate of 69 kg/GJ (160 lb CO
2
/MMBtu) or less (e.g., non-uniform fuels such as residual oil and non-jet fuel kerosene) must follow the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements necessary to complete the heat input-based calculations under this subpart.
[89 FR 40029, May 9, 2024]

# General Compliance Requirements
§ 60.5525
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
Combustion turbines qualifying under § 60.5520(d)(1) are not subject to any requirements in this section other than the requirement to maintain fuel purchase records for permitted fuel(s). For all other affected sources, compliance with the applicable CO
2
emission standard of this subpart shall be determined on a 12-operating-month rolling average basis. See table 1 or 2 to this subpart for the applicable CO
2
emission standards.
(a) You must be in compliance with the emission standards in this subpart that apply to your affected EGU at all times. However, you must determine compliance with the emission standards only at the end of the applicable operating month, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(1) For each affected EGU subject to a CO
2
emissions standard based on a 12-operating-month rolling average, you must determine compliance monthly by calculating the average CO
2
emissions rate for the affected EGU at the end of the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month period.
(2) Consistent with § 60.5520(d)(2), if your affected stationary combustion turbine is subject to an input-based CO
2
emissions standard, you must determine the total heat input in GJ or MMBtu from natural gas (HTIP
ng
) and the total heat input from all other fuels combined (HTIP
o
) using one of the methods under § 60.5535(d)(2). You must then use the following equation to determine the applicable emissions standard during the compliance period:
Equation 1 to Paragraph (a)(2)
ER09my24.055
Where:
CO
2
emission standard = the emission standard during the compliance period in units of kg/GJ (or lb/MMBtu).
HTIP
ng
= the heat input in GJ (or MMBtu) from natural gas.
HTIP
o
= the heat input in GJ (or MMBtu) from all fuels other than natural gas.
50 = allowable emission rate in kg/GJ for heat input derived from natural gas (use 120 if electing to demonstrate compliance using lb CO
2
/MMBtu).
69 = allowable emission rate in kg/GJ for heat input derived from all fuels other than natural gas (use 160 if electing to demonstrate compliance using lb CO
2
/MMBtu).
(b) At all times you must operate and maintain each affected EGU, including associated equipment and monitors, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practice. The Administrator will determine if you are using consistent operation and maintenance procedures based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, fuel use records, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures and records, review of reports required by this subpart, and inspection of the EGU.
(c) Within 30 days after the end of the initial compliance period (
i.e.,
no more than 30 days after the first 12-operating-month compliance period), you must make an initial compliance determination for your affected EGU(s) with respect to the applicable emissions standard in table 1 or 2 to this subpart, in accordance with the requirements in this subpart. The first operating month included in the initial 12-operating-month compliance period shall be determined as follows:
(1) For an affected EGU that commences commercial operation (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2) on or after October 23, 2015, the first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580) after the calendar month in which emissions reporting is required to begin under:
(i) Section 60.5555(c)(3)(i), for units subject to the Acid Rain Program; or
(ii) Section 60.5555(c)(3)(ii)(A), for units that are not in the Acid Rain Program.
(2) For an affected EGU that has commenced commercial operation (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2) prior to October 23, 2015:
(i) If the date on which emissions reporting is required to begin under 40 CFR 75.64(a) has passed prior to October 23, 2015, emissions reporting shall begin according to § 60.5555(c)(3)(i) (for Acid Rain program units), or according to § 60.5555(c)(3)(ii)(B) (for units that are not subject to the Acid Rain Program). The first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580) after the calendar month in which the rule becomes effective; or
(ii) If the date on which emissions reporting is required to begin under 40 CFR 75.64(a) occurs on or after October 23, 2015, then the first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580) after the calendar month in which emissions reporting is required to begin under § 60.5555(c)(3)(ii)(A).
(3) For a modified or reconstructed EGU that becomes subject to this subpart, the first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580) after the calendar month in which emissions reporting is required to begin under § 60.5555(c)(3)(iii).
(4) Electric sales by your affected facility generated when it operated during a system emergency as defined in § 60.5580 are excluded for applicability with the base load standard if you can sufficiently provide the documentation listed in § 60.5560(i).
[89 FR 40029, May 9, 2024]

# Monitoring and Compliance Determination Procedures
§ 60.5535
How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate compliance?
(a) Combustion turbines qualifying under § 60.5520(d)(1) are not subject to any requirements in this section other than the requirement to maintain fuel purchase records for permitted fuel(s). If your combustion turbine uses non-uniform fuels as specified under § 60.5520(d)(2), you must monitor heat input in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and you must monitor CO
2
emissions in accordance with either paragraph (b), (c)(2), or (c)(5) of this section. For all other affected sources, you must prepare a monitoring plan to quantify the hourly CO
2
mass emission rate (tons/h), in accordance with the applicable provisions in 40 CFR 75.53(g) and (h). The electronic portion of the monitoring plan must be submitted using the ECMPS Client Tool and must be in place prior to reporting emissions data and/or the
results of monitoring system certification tests under this subpart. The monitoring plan must be updated as necessary. Monitoring plan submittals must be made by the Designated Representative (DR), the Alternate DR, or a delegated agent of the DR (see § 60.5555(d) and (e)).
(b) You must determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions in kg from your affected EGU(s) according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section, or, if applicable, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(1) For an affected EGU that combusts coal you must, and for all other affected EGUs you may, install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a CO
2
continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) to directly measure and record hourly average CO
2
concentrations in the affected EGU exhaust gases emitted to the atmosphere, and a flow monitoring system to measure hourly average stack gas flow rates, according to 40 CFR 75.10(a)(3)(i). As an alternative to direct measurement of CO
2
concentration, provided that your EGU does not use carbon separation (
e.g.,
carbon capture and storage), you may use data from a certified oxygen (O
2
) monitor to calculate hourly average CO
2
concentrations, in accordance with 40 CFR 75.10(a)(3)(iii). If you measure CO
2
concentration on a dry basis, you must also install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a continuous moisture monitoring system, according to 40 CFR 75.11(b). Alternatively, you may either use an appropriate fuel-specific default moisture value from 40 CFR 75.11(b) or submit a petition to the Administrator under 40 CFR 75.66 for a site-specific default moisture value.
(2) For each continuous monitoring system that you use to determine the CO
2
mass emissions, you must meet the applicable certification and quality assurance procedures in 40 CFR 75.20 and appendices A and B to 40 CFR part 75.
(3) You must use only unadjusted exhaust gas volumetric flow rates to determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions rate from the affected EGU; you must not apply the bias adjustment factors described in Section 7.6.5 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 75 to the exhaust gas flow rate data.
(4) You must select an appropriate reference method to setup (characterize) the flow monitor and to perform the on-going RATAs, in accordance with 40 CFR part 75. If you use a Type-S pitot tube or a pitot tube assembly for the flow RATAs, you must calibrate the pitot tube or pitot tube assembly; you may not use the 0.84 default Type-S pitot tube coefficient specified in Method 2.
(5) Calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emissions (kg) as described in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section. Perform this calculation only for “valid operating hours”, as defined in § 60.5540(a)(1).
(i) Begin with the hourly CO
2
mass emission rate (tons/h), obtained either from equation F-11 in appendix F to 40 CFR part 75 (if CO
2
concentration is measured on a wet basis), or by following the procedure in section 4.2 of appendix F to part 75 (if CO
2
concentration is measured on a dry basis).
(ii) Next, multiply each hourly CO
2
mass emission rate by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2), to convert it to tons of CO
2.
(iii) Finally, multiply the result from paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section by 907.2 to convert it from tons of CO
2
to kg. Round off to the nearest kg.
(iv) The hourly CO
2
tons/h values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO
2
mass emissions are required to be recorded under 40 CFR 75.57(e) and must be reported electronically under 40 CFR 75.64(a)(6). You must use these data to calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emissions.
(c) If your affected EGU exclusively combusts liquid fuel and/or gaseous fuel, as an alternative to complying with paragraph (b) of this section, you may determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions according to paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. If you use non-uniform fuels as specified in § 60.5520(d)(2), you may determine CO
2
mass emissions during the compliance period according to paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(1) If you are subject to an output-based standard and you do not install CEMS in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, you must implement the applicable procedures in appendix
D to part 75 of this chapter to determine hourly EGU heat input rates (MMBtu/h), based on hourly measurements of fuel flow rate and periodic determinations of the gross calorific value (GCV) of each fuel combusted.
(2) For each measured hourly heat input rate, use Equation G-4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emission rate (tons/h). You may determine site-specific carbon-based F-factors (F
c
) using Equation F-7b in section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, and you may use these F
c
values in the emissions calculations instead of using the default F
c
values in the Equation G-4 nomenclature.
(3) For each “valid operating hour” (as defined in § 60.5540(a)(1), multiply the hourly tons/h CO
2
mass emission rate from paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2), to convert it to tons of CO
2
. Then, multiply the result by 907.2 to convert from tons of CO
2
to kg. Round off to the nearest two significant figures.
(4) The hourly CO
2
tons/h values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO
2
mass emissions are required to be recorded under § 75.57(e) of this chapter and must be reported electronically under § 75.64(a)(6) of this chapter. You must use these data to calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emissions.
(5) If you operate a combustion turbine firing non-uniform fuels, as an alternative to following paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section, you may determine CO
2
emissions during the compliance period using one of the following methods:
(i) Units firing fuel gas may determine the heat input during the compliance period following the procedure under § 60.107a(d) and convert this heat input to CO
2
emissions using Equation G-4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter.
(ii) You may use the procedure for determining CO
2
emissions during the compliance period based on the use of the Tier 3 methodology under § 98.33(a)(3) of this chapter.
(d) Consistent with § 60.5520, you must determine the basis of the emissions standard that applies to your affected source in accordance with either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable:
(1) If you operate a source subject to an emissions standard established on an output basis (
e.g.,
lb of CO
2
per gross or net MWh of energy output), you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a sufficient number of watt meters to continuously measure and record the hourly gross electric output or net electric output, as applicable, from the affected EGU(s). These measurements must be performed using 0.2 class electricity metering instrumentation and calibration procedures as specified under ANSI No. C12.20-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). For a combined heat and power (CHP) EGU, as defined in § 60.5580, you must also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to continuously (
i.e.,
hour-by-hour) determine and record the total useful thermal output. For process steam applications, you will need to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to continuously determine and record the hourly steam flow rate, temperature, and pressure. Your plan shall ensure that you install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to record each component of the determination, hour-by-hour.
(2) If you operate a source subject to an emissions standard established on a heat-input basis (
e.g.,
lb CO
2
/MMBtu) and your affected source uses non-uniform heating value fuels as delineated under § 60.5520(d), you must determine the total heat input for each fuel fired during the compliance period in accordance with one of the following procedures:
(i) Appendix D to part 75 of this chapter;
(ii) The procedures for monitoring heat input under § 60.107a(d);
(iii) If you monitor CO
2
emissions in accordance with the Tier 3 methodology under § 98.33(a)(3) of this chapter, you may convert your CO
2
emissions to heat input using the appropriate emission factor in table C-1 of part 98 of this chapter. If your fuel is not listed in table C-1, you must determine a fuel-specific carbon-based F-factor (F
c
) in accordance with section 12.3.2 of EPA Method 19 of appendix A-7 to this part, and you must convert your CO
2
emissions to heat input using Equation G-4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter.
(e) Consistent with § 60.5520, if two or more affected EGUs serve a common electric generator, you must apportion the combined hourly gross or net energy output to the individual affected EGUs according to the fraction of the total steam load and/or direct mechanical energy contributed by each EGU to the electric generator. Alternatively, if the EGUs are identical, you may apportion the combined hourly gross or net electrical load to the individual EGUs according to the fraction of the total heat input contributed by each EGU. You may also elect to develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on alternate methods to apportion the gross energy output. The Administrator may approve such alternate methods for apportioning the gross energy output whenever the demonstration ensures accurate estimation of emissions regulated under this part.
(f) In accordance with §§ 60.13(g) and 60.5520, if two or more affected EGUs that implement the continuous emission monitoring provisions in paragraph (b) of this section share a common exhaust gas stack you must monitor hourly CO
2
mass emissions in accordance with one of the following procedures:
(1) If the EGUs are subject to the same emissions standard in table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you may monitor the hourly CO
2
mass emissions at the common stack in lieu of monitoring each EGU separately. If you choose this option, the hourly gross or net energy output (electric, thermal, and/or mechanical, as applicable) must be the sum of the hourly loads for the individual affected EGUs and you must express the operating time as “stack operating hours” (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2). If you attain compliance with the applicable emissions standard in § 60.5520 at the common stack, each affected EGU sharing the stack is in compliance.
(2) As an alternative, or if the EGUs are subject to different emission standards in table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must either:
(i) Monitor each EGU separately by measuring the hourly CO
2
mass emissions prior to mixing in the common stack or
(ii) Apportion the CO
2
mass emissions based on the unit's load contribution to the total load associated with the common stack and the appropriate F-factors. You may also elect to develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on alternate methods to apportion the CO
2
emissions. The Administrator may approve such alternate methods for apportioning the CO
2
emissions whenever the demonstration ensures accurate estimation of emissions regulated under this part.
(g) In accordance with §§ 60.13(g) and 60.5520 if the exhaust gases from an affected EGU that implements the continuous emission monitoring provisions in paragraph (b) of this section are emitted to the atmosphere through multiple stacks (or if the exhaust gases are routed to a common stack through multiple ducts and you elect to monitor in the ducts), you must monitor the hourly CO
2
mass emissions and the “stack operating time” (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) at each stack or duct separately. In this case, you must determine compliance with the applicable emissions standard in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart by summing the CO
2
mass emissions measured at the individual stacks or ducts and dividing by the total gross or net energy output for the affected EGU.

§ 60.5540
How do I demonstrate compliance with my CO
2
emissions standard and determine excess emissions?
(a) In accordance with § 60.5520, if you are subject to an output-based emission standard or you burn non-uniform fuels as specified in § 60.5520(d)(2), you must demonstrate compliance with the applicable CO
2
emission standard in table 1 or 2 to this subpart as required in this section. For the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month rolling average compliance period, you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section to calculate the CO
2
mass emissions rate for
your affected EGU(s) in units of the applicable emissions standard (
e.g.,
either kg/MWh or kg/GJ). You must use the hourly CO
2
mass emissions calculated under § 60.5535(b) or (c), as applicable, and either the generating load data from § 60.5535(d)(1) for output-based calculations or the heat input data from § 60.5535(d)(2) for heat-input-based calculations. Combustion turbines firing non-uniform fuels that contain CO
2
prior to combustion (e.g., blast furnace gas or landfill gas) may sample the fuel stream to determine the quantity of CO
2
present in the fuel prior to combustion and exclude this portion of the CO
2
mass emissions from compliance determinations.
(1) Each compliance period shall include only “valid operating hours” in the compliance period,
i.e.,
operating hours for which:
(i) “Valid data” (as defined in § 60.5580) are obtained for all of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions (kg) and, if a heat input-based standard applies, all the parameters used to determine total heat input for the hour are also obtained; and
(ii) The corresponding hourly gross or net energy output value is also valid data (
Note:
For hours with no useful output, zero is considered to be a valid value).
(2) You must exclude operating hours in which:
(i) The substitute data provisions of 40 CFR 75 are applied for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions or, if a heat input-based standard applies, for any parameters used to determine the hourly heat input;
(ii) An exceedance of the full-scale range of a continuous emission monitoring system occurs for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions or, if applicable, to determine the hourly heat input; or
(iii) The total gross or net energy output (P
gross/net
) or, if applicable, the total heat input is unavailable.
(3) For each compliance period, at least 95 percent of the operating hours in the compliance period must be valid operating hours, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(4) You must calculate the total CO
2
mass emissions by summing the valid hourly CO
2
mass emissions values from § 60.5535 for all of the valid operating hours in the compliance period.
(5) For each valid operating hour of the compliance period that was used in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to calculate the total CO
2
mass emissions, you must determine P
gross/net
(the corresponding hourly gross or net energy output in MWh) according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, as appropriate for the type of affected EGU(s). For an operating hour in which a valid CO
2
mass emissions value is determined according to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, if there is no gross or net electrical output, but there is mechanical or useful thermal output, you must still determine the gross or net energy output for that hour. In addition, for an operating hour in which a valid CO
2
mass emissions value is determined according to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, but there is no (
i.e.,
zero) gross electrical, mechanical, or useful thermal output, you must use that hour in the compliance determination. For hours or partial hours where the gross electric output is equal to or less than the auxiliary loads, net electric output shall be counted as zero for this calculation.
(i) Calculate P
gross/net
for your affected EGU using the following equation. All terms in the equation must be expressed in units of MWh. To convert each hourly gross or net energy output (consistent with § 60.5520) value reported under 40 CFR part 75 to MWh, multiply by the corresponding EGU or stack operating time.

This is calculated using the equation specified in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section in MWh.
(Pt)
HR
= Non steam useful thermal output (measured relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from heat recovery that is used for applications other than steam generation or performance enhancement of the affected EGU in MWh.
(Pt)
IE
= Useful thermal output (relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from any integrated equipment is used for applications that do not generate additional steam, electricity, produce mechanical energy output, or enhance the performance of the affected EGU in MWh.
TDF = Electric Transmission and Distribution Factor of 0.95 for a combined heat and power affected EGU where at least 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consists of electric or direct mechanical output and 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consists of useful thermal output on a 12-operating-month rolling average basis, or 1.0 for all other affected EGUs.
(ii) If applicable to your affected EGU (for example, for combined heat and power), you must calculate (Pt)
PS
using the following equation:
Equation 2 to Paragraph (a)(5)(ii)
ER09my24.056
Where:
Q
m
= Measured useful thermal output flow in kg (lb) for the operating hour.
H = Enthalpy of the useful thermal output at measured temperature and pressure (relative to SATP conditions or the energy in the condensate return line, as applicable) in Joules per kilogram (J/kg) (or Btu/lb).
CF = Conversion factor of 3.6 × 10
9
J/MWh or 3.413 × 10
6
Btu/MWh.
(6) Sources complying with energy output-based standards must calculate the basis (
i.e.,
denominator) of their actual 12-operating month emission rate in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. Sources complying with heat input based standards must calculate the basis of their actual 12-operating month emission rate in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.
(i) In accordance with § 60.5520 if you are subject to an output-based standard, you must calculate the total gross or net energy output for the affected EGU's compliance period by summing the hourly gross or net energy output values for the affected EGU that you determined under paragraph (a)(5) of this section for all of the valid operating hours in the applicable compliance period.
(ii) If you are subject to a heat input-based standard, you must calculate the total heat input for each fuel fired during the compliance period. The calculation of total heat input for each individual fuel must include all valid operating hours and must also be consistent with any fuel-specific procedures specified within your selected monitoring option under § 60.5535(d)(2).
(7) If you are subject to an output-based standard, you must calculate the CO
2
mass emissions rate for the affected EGU(s) (kg/MWh) by dividing the total CO
2
mass emissions value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the total gross or net energy output value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. Round off the result to two significant figures if the calculated value is less than 1,000; round the result to three significant figures if the calculated value is greater than 1,000. If you are subject to a heat input-based standard, you must calculate the CO
2
mass emissions rate for the affected EGU(s) (kg/GJ or lb/MMBtu) by dividing the total CO
2
mass emissions value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the total heat input calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section. Round off the result to two significant figures.
(b) In accordance with § 60.5520, to demonstrate compliance with the applicable CO
2
emission standard, for the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month compliance period, the CO
2
mass emissions rate for your affected EGU must be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) through (8) of this section and must be less than or equal to the applicable CO
2
emissions standard in table 1 or 2 to this subpart, or the emissions standard calculated in accordance with § 60.5525(a)(2).

§ 60.5580
What definitions apply to this subpart?
As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein will have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act and in subpart A (general provisions of this part).
Annual capacity factor
means the ratio between the actual heat input to an EGU during a calendar year and the potential heat input to the EGU had it been operated for 8,760 hours during a calendar year at the base load rating. Actual and potential heat input derived from non-combustion sources (e.g., solar thermal) are not included when calculating the annual capacity factor.
Base load rating
means the maximum amount of heat input (fuel) that an EGU can combust on a steady state basis plus the maximum amount of heat input derived from non-combustion source (e.g., solar thermal), as determined by the physical design and characteristics of the EGU at International Organization for Standardization (ISO) conditions. For a stationary combustion turbine,
base load rating
includes the heat input from duct burners.
Coal
means all solid fuels classified as anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, or lignite by ASTM International in ASTM D388-99R04 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), coal refuse, and petroleum coke.

# Emission Standards
§ 60.5515a
Which pollutants are regulated by this subpart?
(a) The pollutants regulated by this subpart are greenhouse gases. The greenhouse gas standard in this subpart is in the form of a limitation on emission of carbon dioxide.
(b) PSD and Title V thresholds for greenhouse gases.
(1) For the purposes of 40 CFR 51.166(b)(49)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(48) and in any SIP approved by the EPA that is interpreted to incorporate, or specifically incorporates, 40 CFR 51.166(b)(48).
(2) For the purposes of 40 CFR 52.21(b)(50)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(49).
(3) For the purposes of 40 CFR 70.2, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.

What CO
2
emissions standard must I meet?
(a) For each affected EGU subject to this subpart, you must not discharge from the affected EGU any gases that contain CO
2
in excess of the applicable CO
2
emission standard specified in table 1 to this subpart, consistent with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, as applicable.
(b) Except as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, you must comply with the applicable gross or net energy output standard, and your operating permit must include monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting methodologies based on the applicable gross or net energy output standard. For the remainder of this subpart (for sources that do not qualify under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section), where the term “gross or net energy output” is used, the term that applies to you is “gross energy output.”
(c) As an alternative to meeting the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, an owner or operator of a stationary combustion turbine may petition the Administrator in writing to comply with the alternate applicable net energy output standard. If the Administrator grants the petition, beginning on the date the Administrator grants the petition, the affected EGU must comply with the applicable net energy output-based standard included in this subpart. Your operating permit must include monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting methodologies based on the applicable net energy output standard. For the remainder of this subpart, where the term “gross or net energy output” is used, the term that applies to you is “net energy output.” Owners or operators complying with the net output-based standard must petition the Administrator to switch back to complying with the gross energy output-based standard.
(d) Owners or operators of a stationary combustion turbine that maintain records of electric sales to demonstrate that the stationary combustion turbine is subject to a heat input-based standard in table 1 to this subpart that are only permitted to burn one or more uniform fuels, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, are only subject to the monitoring requirements in paragraph (d)(1). Owners or operators of all other stationary combustion turbines that maintain records of electric sales to demonstrate that the stationary combustion turbines are subject to a heat input-based standard in table 1 are only subject to the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(1) Owners or operators of stationary combustion turbines that are only permitted to burn fuels with a consistent chemical composition (
i.e.,
uniform fuels) that result in a consistent emission rate of 69 kilograms per gigajoule (kg/GJ) (160 lb CO
2
/MMBtu) or less are not subject to any monitoring or reporting requirements under this subpart. These fuels include, but are not limited to hydrogen, natural gas, methane, butane, butylene, ethane, ethylene, propane, naphtha, propylene, jet fuel, kerosene, No. 1 fuel oil, No. 2 fuel oil, and biodiesel. Stationary combustion turbines qualifying under this paragraph are only required to maintain purchase records for permitted fuels.
(2) Owners or operators of stationary combustion turbines permitted to burn fuels that do not have a consistent chemical composition or that do not have an emission rate of 69 kg/GJ (160
lb CO
2
/MMBtu) or less (e.g., non-uniform fuels such as residual oil and non-jet fuel kerosene) must follow the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements necessary to complete the heat input-based calculations under this subpart.
§ 60.5525a
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
Combustion turbines qualifying under § 60.5520a(d)(1) are not subject to any requirements in this section other than the requirement to maintain fuel purchase records for permitted fuel(s). For all other affected sources, compliance with the applicable CO
2
emission standard of this subpart shall be determined on a 12-operating-month rolling average basis. See table 1 to this subpart for the applicable CO
2
emission standards.
(a) You must be in compliance with the emission standards in this subpart that apply to your affected EGU at all times. However, you must determine compliance with the emission standards only at the end of the applicable operating month, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(1) For each affected EGU subject to a CO
2
emissions standard based on a 12-operating-month rolling average, you must determine compliance monthly by calculating the average CO
2
emissions rate for the affected EGU at the end of the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month period.
(2) Consistent with § 60.5520a(d)(2), if your affected stationary combustion turbine is subject to an input-based CO
2
emissions standard, you must determine the total heat input in GJ or MMBtu from natural gas (HTIPng) and the total heat input from all other fuels combined (HTIPo) using one of the methods under § 60.5535a(d)(2). You must then use the following equation to determine the applicable emissions standard during the compliance period:

Where:
CO

2
/MMBtu).
69 = allowable emission rate in lb kg/GJ for heat input derived from all fuels other than natural gas (use 160 if electing to demonstrate compliance using lb CO
2
/MMBtu).
(3) Owners/operators of a base load combustion turbine with a base load rating of less than 2,110 GJ/h (2,000 MMBtu/h) and/or an intermediate or base load combustion turbine burning fuels other than natural gas may elect to determine a site-specific emissions rate using one of the following equations. Combustion turbines co-firing hydrogen are not required to use the fuel adjustment parameter.

(b) At all times you must operate and maintain each affected EGU, including associated equipment and monitors, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practice. The Administrator will determine if you are using consistent operation and maintenance procedures based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, fuel use records, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures and records, review of reports required by this subpart, and inspection of the EGU.
(c) Within 30 days after the end of the initial compliance period (
i.e.,
no more than 30 days after the first 12-operating-month compliance period), you must make an initial compliance determination for your affected EGU(s) with respect to the applicable emissions standard in table 1 to this subpart, in accordance with the requirements in this subpart. The first operating month included in the initial 12-operating-month compliance period shall be determined as follows:
(1) For an affected EGU that commences commercial operation (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2), the first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580a) after the calendar month in which emissions reporting is required to begin under:
(i) Section 60.5555a(c)(3)(i), for units subject to the Acid Rain Program; or
(ii) Section 60.5555a(c)(3)(ii), for units that are not in the Acid Rain Program.
(2) For a modified or reconstructed EGU that becomes subject to this subpart, the first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580a) after the calendar month in which emissions reporting is required to begin under § 60.5555a(c)(3)(iii).
(3) Emissions of CO
2
emitted by your affected facility and the output of the affected facility generated when it operated during a system emergency as defined in § 60.5580a are excluded for both applicability and compliance with the relevant standards of performance if you can sufficiently provide the documentation listed in § 60.5560a(i). The relevant standard of performance for affected EGUs that operate during a system emergency depends on the subcategory, as described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) For intermediate and base load combustion turbines that operate during a system emergency, you comply with the standard for low load combustion turbines specified in table 1 to this subpart.
(ii) For modified steam generating units, you must not discharge from the affected EGU any gases that contain CO
2
in excess of 230 lb CO
2
/MMBtu.

# Monitoring and Compliance Determination Procedures
§ 60.5535a
How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate compliance?
(a) Combustion turbines qualifying under § 60.5520a(d)(1) are not subject to any requirements in this section other than the requirement to maintain fuel purchase records for permitted fuel(s). If your combustion turbine uses non-uniform fuels as specified under § 60.5520a(d)(2), you must monitor heat input in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and you must monitor CO
2
emissions in accordance with either paragraph (b), (c)(2), or (c)(5) of this section. For all other affected sources, you must prepare a monitoring plan to quantify the hourly CO
2
mass emission rate (tons/h), in accordance with the applicable provisions in 40 CFR 75.53(g) and (h). The electronic portion of the monitoring plan must be submitted using the ECMPS Client Tool and must be in place prior to reporting emissions data and/or the results of monitoring system certification tests under this subpart. The monitoring plan must be updated as necessary. Monitoring plan submittals must be made by the Designated Representative (DR), the Alternate DR, or a delegated agent of the DR (see § 60.5555a(d) and (e)).
(b) You must determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions in kg from your affected EGU(s) according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section, or, if applicable, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(1) For an affected EGU that combusts coal you must, and for all other affected EGUs you may, install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a CO
2
continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) to directly measure and record hourly average CO
2
concentrations in the affected EGU exhaust gases emitted to the atmosphere, and a flow monitoring system to measure hourly average stack gas flow rates, according to 40 CFR 75.10(a)(3)(i). As an alternative to direct measurement of CO
2
concentration, provided that your EGU does not use carbon separation (
e.g.,
carbon capture and storage), you may use data from a certified oxygen (O2) monitor to calculate hourly average CO
2
concentrations, in accordance with 40 CFR 75.10(a)(3)(iii). If you measure CO
2
concentration on a dry basis, you must also install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a continuous moisture monitoring system, according to 40 CFR 75.11(b). Alternatively, you may either use an appropriate fuel-specific default moisture value from 40 CFR 75.11(b) or submit a petition to the Administrator under 40 CFR 75.66 for a site-specific default moisture value.
(2) For each continuous monitoring system that you use to determine the CO
2
mass emissions, you must meet the applicable certification and quality assurance procedures in 40 CFR 75.20 and appendices A and B to 40 CFR part 75.
(3) You must use only unadjusted exhaust gas volumetric flow rates to determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions rate from the affected EGU; you must not apply the bias adjustment factors described in Section 7.6.5 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 75 to the exhaust gas flow rate data.
(4) You must select an appropriate reference method to setup (characterize) the flow monitor and to perform the on-going RATAs, in accordance with 40 CFR part 75. If you use a Type-S pitot tube or a pitot tube assembly
for the flow RATAs, you must calibrate the pitot tube or pitot tube assembly; you may not use the 0.84 default Type-S pitot tube coefficient specified in Method 2.
(5) Calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emissions (kg) as described in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section. Perform this calculation only for “valid operating hours”, as defined in § 60.5540(a)(1).
(i) Begin with the hourly CO
2
mass emission rate (tons/h), obtained either from Equation F-11 in appendix F to 40 CFR part 75 (if CO
2
concentration is measured on a wet basis), or by following the procedure in section 4.2 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 75 (if CO
2
concentration is measured on a dry basis).
(ii) Next, multiply each hourly CO
2
mass emission rate by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2), to convert it to tons of CO
2
.
(iii) Finally, multiply the result from paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section by 907.2 to convert it from tons of CO
2
to kg. Round off to the nearest kg.
(iv) The hourly CO
2
tons/h values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO
2
mass emissions are required to be recorded under 40 CFR 75.57(e) and must be reported electronically under 40 CFR 75.64(a)(6). You must use these data to calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emissions.
(c) If your affected EGU exclusively combusts liquid fuel and/or gaseous fuel, as an alternative to complying with paragraph (b) of this section, you may determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions according to paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. If you use non-uniform fuels as specified in § 60.5520a(d)(2), you may determine CO
2
mass emissions during the compliance period according to paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(1) If you are subject to an output-based standard and you do not install CEMS in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, you must implement the applicable procedures in appendix D to 40 CFR part 75 to determine hourly EGU heat input rates (MMBtu/h), based on hourly measurements of fuel flow rate and periodic determinations of the gross calorific value (GCV) of each fuel combusted.
(2) For each measured hourly heat input rate, use Equation G-4 in appendix G to 40 CFR part 75 to calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emission rate (tons/h). You may determine site-specific carbon-based F-factors (Fc) using Equation F-7b in section 3.3.6 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 75, and you may use these Fc values in the emissions calculations instead of using the default Fc values in the Equation G-4 nomenclature.
(3) For each “valid operating hour” (as defined in § 60.5540(a)(1), multiply the hourly tons/h CO
2
mass emission rate from paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2), to convert it to tons of CO
2
. Then, multiply the result by 907.2 to convert from tons of CO
2
to kg. Round off to the nearest two significant figures.
(4) The hourly CO
2
tons/h values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO
2
mass emissions are required to be recorded under 40 CFR 75.57(e) and must be reported electronically under 40 CFR 75.64(a)(6). You must use these data to calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emissions.
(5) If you operate a combustion turbine firing non-uniform fuels, as an alternative to following paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section, you may determine CO
2
emissions during the compliance period using one of the following methods:
(i) Units firing fuel gas may determine the heat input during the compliance period following the procedure under § 60.107a(d) and convert this heat input to CO
2
emissions using Equation G-4 in appendix G to 40 CFR part 75.
(ii) You may use the procedure for determining CO
2
emissions during the compliance period based on the use of the Tier 3 methodology under 40 CFR 98.33(a)(3).
(d) Consistent with § 60.5520a, you must determine the basis of the emissions standard that applies to your affected source in accordance with either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable:
(1) If you operate a source subject to an emissions standard established on an output basis (
e.g.,
lb CO
2
per gross or
net MWh of energy output), you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a sufficient number of watt meters to continuously measure and record the hourly gross electric output or net electric output, as applicable, from the affected EGU(s). These measurements must be performed using 0.2 class electricity metering instrumentation and calibration procedures as specified under ANSI No. C12.20-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). For a combined heat and power (CHP) EGU, as defined in § 60.5580a, you must also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to continuously (
i.e.,
hour-by-hour) determine and record the total useful thermal output. For process steam applications, you will need to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to continuously determine and record the hourly steam flow rate, temperature, and pressure. Your plan shall ensure that you install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to record each component of the determination, hour-by-hour.
(2) If you operate a source subject to an emissions standard established on a heat-input basis (
e.g.,
lb CO
2
/MMBtu) and your affected source uses non-uniform heating value fuels as delineated under § 60.5520a(d), you must determine the total heat input for each fuel fired during the compliance period in accordance with one of the following procedures:
(i) Appendix D to 40 CFR part 75;
(ii) The procedures for monitoring heat input under § 60.107a(d);
(iii) If you monitor CO
2
emissions in accordance with the Tier 3 methodology under 40 CFR 98.33(a)(3), you may convert your CO
2
emissions to heat input using the appropriate emission factor in table C-1 of 40 CFR part 98. If your fuel is not listed in table C-1, you must determine a fuel-specific carbon-based F-factor (Fc) in accordance with section 12.3.2 of EPA Method 19 of appendix A-7 to this part, and you must convert your CO
2
emissions to heat input using Equation G-4 in appendix G to 40 CFR part 75.
(e) Consistent with § 60.5520a, if two or more affected EGUs serve a common electric generator, you must apportion the combined hourly gross or net energy output to the individual affected EGUs according to the fraction of the total steam load and/or direct mechanical energy contributed by each EGU to the electric generator. Alternatively, if the EGUs are identical, you may apportion the combined hourly gross or net electrical load to the individual EGUs according to the fraction of the total heat input contributed by each EGU. You may also elect to develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on alternate methods to apportion the gross or net energy output. The Administrator may approve such alternate methods for apportioning the gross or net energy output whenever the demonstration ensures accurate estimation of emissions regulated under this part.
(f) In accordance with §§ 60.13(g) and 60.5520a, if two or more affected EGUs that implement the continuous emission monitoring provisions in paragraph (b) of this section share a common exhaust gas stack you must monitor hourly CO
2
mass emissions in accordance with one of the following procedures:
(1) If the EGUs are subject to the same emissions standard in table 1 to this subpart, you may monitor the hourly CO
2
mass emissions at the common stack in lieu of monitoring each EGU separately. If you choose this option, the hourly gross or net energy output (electric, thermal, and/or mechanical, as applicable) must be the sum of the hourly loads for the individual affected EGUs and you must express the operating time as “stack operating hours” (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2). If you attain compliance with the applicable emissions standard in § 60.5520a at the common stack, each affected EGU sharing the stack is in compliance; or
(2) As an alternative to the requirements in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, or if the EGUs are subject to different emission standards in table 1 to this subpart, you must either:
(i) Monitor each EGU separately by measuring the hourly CO
2
mass emissions prior to mixing in the common stack or
(ii) Apportion the CO
2
mass emissions based on the unit's load contribution to the total load associated with the common stack and the appropriate F-
factors. You may also elect to develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on alternate methods to apportion the CO
2
emissions. The Administrator may approve such alternate methods for apportioning the CO
2
emissions whenever the demonstration ensures accurate estimation of emissions regulated under this part.
(g) In accordance with §§ 60.13(g) and 60.5520a if the exhaust gases from an affected EGU that implements the continuous emission monitoring provisions in paragraph (b) of this section are emitted to the atmosphere through multiple stacks (or if the exhaust gases are routed to a common stack through multiple ducts and you elect to monitor in the ducts), you must monitor the hourly CO
2
mass emissions and the “stack operating time” (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2) at each stack or duct separately. In this case, you must determine compliance with the applicable emissions standard in table 1 or 2 to this subpart by summing the CO
2
mass emissions measured at the individual stacks or ducts and dividing by the total gross or net energy output for the affected EGU.
§ 60.5540a
How do I demonstrate compliance with my CO
2
emissions standard and determine excess emissions?
(a) In accordance with § 60.5520a, if you are subject to an output-based emission standard or you burn non-uniform fuels as specified in § 60.5520a(d)(2), you must demonstrate compliance with the applicable CO
2
emission standard in table 1 to this subpart as required in this section. For the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month rolling average compliance period, you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section to calculate the CO
2
mass emissions rate for your affected EGU(s) in units of the applicable emissions standard (
e.g.,
either kg/MWh or kg/GJ). You must use the hourly CO
2
mass emissions calculated under § 60.5535a(b) or (c), as applicable, and either the generating load data from § 60.5535a(d)(1) for output-based calculations or the heat input data from § 60.5535a(d)(2) for heat-input-based calculations. Combustion turbines firing non-uniform fuels that contain CO
2
prior to combustion (
e.g.,
blast furnace gas or landfill gas) may sample the fuel stream to determine the quantity of CO
2
present in the fuel prior to combustion and exclude this portion of the CO
2
mass emissions from compliance determinations.
(1) Each compliance period shall include only “valid operating hours” in the compliance period,
i.e.,
operating hours for which:
(i) “Valid data” (as defined in § 60.5580a) are obtained for all of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions (kg) and, if a heat input-based standard applies, all the parameters used to determine total heat input for the hour are also obtained; and
(ii) The corresponding hourly gross or net energy output value is also valid data (Note: For hours with no useful output, zero is considered to be a valid value).
(2) You must exclude operating hours in which:
(i) The substitute data provisions of part 75 of this chapter are applied for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions or, if a heat input-based standard applies, for any parameters used to determine the hourly heat input;
(ii) An exceedance of the full-scale range of a continuous emission monitoring system occurs for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions or, if applicable, to determine the hourly heat input; or
(iii) The total gross or net energy output (P
gross/net
) or, if applicable, the total heat input is unavailable.
(3) For each compliance period, at least 95 percent of the operating hours in the compliance period must be valid operating hours, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(4) You must calculate the total CO
2
mass emissions by summing the valid hourly CO
2
mass emissions values from § 60.5535a for all of the valid operating hours in the compliance period.
(5) For each valid operating hour of the compliance period that was used in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to calculate the total CO
2
mass emissions, you must determine P
gross/net
(the corresponding hourly gross or net energy
output in MWh) according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, as appropriate for the type of affected EGU(s). For an operating hour in which a valid CO
2
mass emissions value is determined according to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, if there is no gross or net electrical output, but there is mechanical or useful thermal output, you must still determine the gross or net energy output for that hour. In addition, for an operating hour in which a valid CO
2
mass emissions value is determined according to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, but there is no (
i.e.,
zero) gross electrical, mechanical, or useful thermal output, you must use that hour in the compliance determination. For hours or partial hours where the gross electric output is equal to or less than the auxiliary loads, net electric output shall be counted as zero for this calculation.
(i) Calculate P
gross/net
for your affected EGU using the following equation. All terms in the equation must be expressed in units of MWh. To convert each hourly gross or net energy output (consistent with § 60.5520a) value reported under part 75 of this chapter to MWh, multiply by the corresponding EGU or stack operating time.
Equation 1 to Paragraph (a)(5)(i)

gross
.
(Pt)
PS
= Useful thermal output of steam (measured relative to standard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP) conditions, as applicable) that is used for applications that do not generate additional electricity, produce mechanical energy output, or enhance the performance of the affected EGU. This is calculated using the equation specified in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section in MWh.
(Pt)
HR
= Non steam useful thermal output (measured relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from heat recovery that is used for applications other than steam generation or performance enhancement of the affected EGU in MWh.
(Pt)
IE
= Useful thermal output (relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from any integrated equipment is used for applications that do not generate additional steam, electricity, produce mechanical energy output, or enhance the performance of the affected EGU in MWh.
TDF = Electric Transmission and Distribution Factor of 0.95 for a combined heat and power affected EGU where at least on an annual basis 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consists of useful thermal output on a 12-operating-month rolling average basis, or 1.0 for all other affected EGUs.
(ii) If applicable to your affected EGU (for example, for combined heat and power), you must calculate (Pt)PS using the following equation:
Equation 2 to Paragraph (a)(5)(ii)
ER09MY24.061
Where:
Q
m
= Measured useful thermal output flow in kg (lb) for the operating hour.
H = Enthalpy of the useful thermal output at measured temperature and pressure (relative to SATP conditions or the energy in the condensate return line, as applicable) in Joules per kilogram (J/kg) (or Btu/lb).
CF = Conversion factor of 3.6 × 10
9
J/MWh or 3.413 × 10
6
Btu/MWh.
(6) Sources complying with energy output-based standards must calculate the basis (
i.e.,
denominator) of their actual annual emission rate in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. Sources complying with heat input based standards must calculate the basis of their actual annual emission rate in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.
(i) In accordance with § 60.5520a if you are subject to an output-based standard, you must calculate the total gross or net energy output for the affected EGU's compliance period by summing the hourly gross or net energy output values for the affected EGU that you determined under paragraph (a)(5) of this section for all of the valid operating hours in the applicable compliance period.
(ii) If you are subject to a heat input-based standard, you must calculate the total heat input for each fuel fired during the compliance period. The calculation of total heat input for each individual fuel must include all valid operating hours and must also be consistent with any fuel-specific procedures specified within your selected monitoring option under § 60.5535(d)(2).
(7) If you are subject to an output-based standard, you must calculate the CO
2
mass emissions rate for the affected EGU(s) (kg/MWh) by dividing the total CO
2
mass emissions value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the total gross or net energy output value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. Round off the result to two significant figures if the calculated value is less than 1,000; round the result to three significant figures if the calculated value is greater than 1,000. If you are subject to a heat input-based standard, you must calculate the CO
2
mass emissions rate for the affected EGU(s) (kg/GJ or lb/MMBtu) by dividing the total CO
2
mass emissions value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the total heat input calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section. Round off the result to two significant figures.
(8) You may exclude CO
2
mass emissions and output generated from your affected EGU from your calculations for hours during which the affected EGU operated during a system emergency, as defined in § 60.5580a, if you can provide the information listed in § 60.5560a(i). While operating during a system emergency, your compliance determination depends on your subcategory or unit type, as listed in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) through (ii) of this section.
(i) For affected EGUs in the intermediate or base load subcategory, your CO
2
emission standard while operating during a system emergency is the applicable emission standard for low load combustion turbines.
(ii) For affected modified steam generating units, your CO
2
emission standard while operating during a system emergency is 230 lb CO
2
/MMBtu.
(b) In accordance with § 60.5520a, to demonstrate compliance with the applicable CO
2
emission standard, for the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month compliance period, the CO
2
mass emissions rate for your affected EGU must be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) through (8) of this section and must be less than or equal to the applicable CO
2
emissions standard in table 1 to this subpart, or the emissions standard calculated in accordance with § 60.5525a(a)(2).
(c) If you are the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine operating in the base load subcategory, are installing add-on controls, and are unable to comply with the applicable Phase 2 CO
2
emission standard specified in table 1 to this subpart due to circumstances beyond your control, you may request a compliance date extension of no longer than one year beyond the effective date of January 1, 2032, and may only receive an extension once. The extension request must contain a demonstration of necessity that includes the following:
(1) A demonstration that your affected EGU cannot meet its compliance date due to circumstances beyond your control and you have taken all steps reasonably possible to install the controls necessary for compliance by the effective date up to the point of the delay. The demonstration shall:
(i) Identify each affected unit for which you are seeking the compliance extension;
(ii) Identify and describe the controls to be installed at each affected unit to comply with the applicable CO
2
emission standard in table 1 to this subpart;
(iii) Describe and demonstrate all progress towards installing the controls and that you have acted consistently with achieving timely compliance, including;
(A) Any and all contract(s) entered into for the installation of the identified controls or an explanation as to why no contract is necessary or obtainable;
(B) Any permit(s) obtained for the installation of the identified controls or, where a required permit has not yet been issued, a copy of the permit application submitted to the permitting authority and a statement from the permit authority identifying its anticipated timeframe for issuance of such permit(s).
(iv) Identify the circumstances that are entirely beyond your control and that necessitate additional time to install the identified controls. This may include:
(A) Information gathered from control technology vendors or engineering firms demonstrating that the necessary controls cannot be installed or started up by the applicable compliance date listed in table 1 to this subpart;
(B) Documentation of any permit delays; or
(C) Documentation of delays in construction or permitting of infrastructure (
e.g.,
CO
2
pipelines) that is necessary for implementation of the control technology;
(v) Identify a proposed compliance date no later than one year after the applicable compliance date listed in table 1 to this subpart.
(2) The Administrator is charged with approving or disapproving a compliance date extension request based on his or her written determination that your affected EGU has or has not made each of the necessary demonstrations and provided all of the necessary documentation according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The following must be included:
(i) All documentation required as part of this extension must be submitted by you to the Administrator no later than 6 months prior to the applicable effective date for your affected EGU.
(ii) You must notify the Administrator of the compliance date extension request at the time of the submission of the request.

# Notification, Reports, and Records
§ 60.5550a
What notifications must I submit and when?

from an affected EGU be transferred to a facility reporting under 40 CFR part 98, subpart RR, or subpart VV. To receive a waiver, the applicant must demonstrate to the Administrator that its technology will store captured CO
2
as effectively as geologic sequestration, and that the proposed technology will not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety. In making this determination, the Administrator shall consider (among other factors) operating history of the technology, whether the technology will increase emissions or other releases of any pollutant other than CO

Btu/MMBtu, divided by 3,413 Btu/KWh, divided by 1,000 kWh/MWh, and multiplied by 8,760 h/yr (
e.g.,
a 35 percent efficient affected EGU with a 100 MW (341 MMBtu/h) fossil fuel heat input capacity would have a 306,000 MWh 12-month potential electric output capacity).
Solid fuel

means the thermal energy made available for use in any heating application (
e.g.,
steam delivered to an industrial process for a heating application, including thermal cooling applications) that is not used for electric generation, mechanical output at the affected EGU, to directly enhance the performance of the affected EGU (
e.g.,
economizer output is not useful thermal output, but thermal energy used to reduce fuel moisture is considered useful thermal output), or to supply energy to a pollution control device at the affected EGU. Useful thermal output for affected EGU(s) with no condensate return (or other thermal energy input to the affected EGU(s)) or where measuring the energy in the condensate (or other thermal energy input to the affected EGU(s)) would not meaningfully impact the emission rate calculation is measured against the energy in the thermal output at SATP conditions.

# Subpart UUUUb—Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Electric Utility Generating Units

# Source:
89 FR 40047, May 9, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

# Introduction
§ 60.5700b
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes emission guidelines and approval criteria for State plans that establish standards of performance limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an affected steam generating unit. An affected steam generating unit shall, for the purposes of this subpart, be referred to as an affected EGU. These emission guidelines are developed in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and subpart Ba of this part. State plans under the emission guidelines in this subpart are also subject to the requirements of subpart Ba. To the extent any requirement of this subpart is inconsistent with the requirements of subparts A or Ba of this part, the requirements of this subpart shall apply.
§ 60.5705b
Which pollutants are regulated by this subpart?
(a) The pollutants regulated by this subpart are greenhouse gases (GHG). The emission guidelines for greenhouse gases established in this subpart are expressed as carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emission performance rates.
(b) PSD and Title V Thresholds for Greenhouse Gases.
(1) For the purposes of 40 CFR 51.166(b)(49)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from facilities regulated in the State plan, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(48) and in any State Implementation Plan (SIP) approved by the EPA that is interpreted to incorporate, or specifically incorporates, 40 CFR 51.166(b)(48).
(2) For the purposes of 40 CFR 52.21(b)(50)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from facilities regulated in the State plan, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act”
shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(49).
(3) For the purposes of 40 CFR 70.2, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from facilities regulated in the State plan, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.
(4) For the purposes of 40 CFR 71.2, with respect to GHG emissions from facilities regulated in the State plan, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 71.2.
§ 60.5710b
Am I affected by this subpart?
(a) If you are the Governor of a State in the contiguous United States with one or more affected EGUs that must be addressed in your State plan as indicated in § 60.5845b, you must submit a State plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. If you are the Governor of a State in the contiguous United States with no affected EGUs, or if all EGUs in your State are excluded from being affected EGUs per § 60.5850b, you must submit a negative declaration letter in place of the State plan.
(b) If you are a coal-fired steam generating unit that has demonstrated that it plans to permanently cease operation prior to January 1, 2032, consistent with § 60.5740b(a)(9)(ii), and that would be an affected EGU under these emissions guidelines but for § 60.5850b(k), you must comply with § 60.5876b.
§ 60.5715b
What is the review and approval process for my State plan?
(a) The EPA will determine the completeness of your State plan submission according to § 60.27a(g). The timeline for completeness determinations is provided in § 60.27a(g)(1).
(b) The EPA will act on your State plan submission according to § 60.27a. The Administrator will have 12 months after the date the final State plan or State plan revision (as allowed under § 60.5790b) is found to be complete to fully approve, partially approve, conditionally approve, partially disapprove, and/or fully disapprove such State plan or revision or each portion thereof.
§ 60.5720b
What if I do not submit a State plan or my State plan is not approvable?
(a) If you do not submit an approvable State plan the EPA will develop a Federal plan for your State according to § 60.27a. The Federal plan will implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of affected EGUs not covered by an approved State plan must comply with a Federal plan implemented by the EPA for the State.
(b) After a Federal plan has been implemented in your State, it will be withdrawn when your State submits, and the EPA approves, a State plan replacing the relevant portion(s) of the Federal plan.
§ 60.5725b
In lieu of a State plan submittal, are there other acceptable option(s) for a State to meet its CAA section 111(d) obligations?
A State may meet its CAA section 111(d) obligations only by submitting a State plan or a negative declaration letter (if applicable).
§ 60.5730b
Is there an approval process for a negative declaration letter?
No. The EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, consistent with the electronic submission requirements in § 60.5875b, the EPA will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the
Federal Register.
If, at a later date, an affected EGU for which construction commenced on or before January 8, 2014, reconstruction on or before June 18, 2014, or modification on or before May 23, 2023, is found in your State, you will be found to have failed to submit a State plan as required, and a Federal plan implementing the emission guidelines contained in this subpart, when promulgated by the EPA, will apply to that
affected EGU until you submit, and the EPA approves, a State plan.

Short-Term Reliability Mechanism.
You may include in your State plan provisions for a short-term reliability mechanism for affected EGUs in your State that operate during a system emergency, as defined in § 60.5880b. Such a mechanism must include the components listed in paragraphs (a)(12)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(i) A requirement that the short-term reliability mechanism is available only during system emergencies as defined in § 60.5880b. The State plan must identify the entity or entities that are authorized to issue system emergencies for the State.
(ii) A provision that, for the duration of a documented system emergency, an impacted affected EGU may comply with an emission limitation corresponding to its baseline emission performance rate, as calculated under § 60.5775b(d), in lieu of its otherwise applicable standard of performance. The State plan must clearly identify the alternative emission limitation that corresponds to the affected EGU's baseline emission rate and include it as an enforceable emission limitation that may be applied only during periods of system emergency.
(iii) A requirement that an affected EGU impacted by the system emergency and complying with an alternative emission limitation must provide documentation, as part of its compliance demonstration, of the system emergency according to (a)(12)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section and that it was impacted by that system emergency.
(A) Documentation that the system emergency was in effect from the entity issuing the system emergency and documentation of the exact duration of the event;
(B) Documentation from the entity issuing the system emergency that the system emergency included the affected source/region where the unit was located;

(D) Data collected during the event including the sum of the CO
2
emissions, the sum of the gross energy output, and the resulting CO
2
emissions performance rate.
(iv) A requirement to document the hours an affected EGU operated under a system emergency and the enforceable emission limitation, whether the applicable standard of performance or the alternative emission limitation, under which that affected EGU operated during those hours.
(v) A provision that, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the applicable standard of performance, the affected EGU would comply with its baseline emissions rate as calculated under § 60.5775b(d) in lieu of its otherwise applicable standard of performance for the hours of operation that correspond to the duration of the event.
(vi) The inclusion of provisions defining the short-term reliability mechanism must be part of the public comment process as part of the State plan's development.
(13)
Reliability Assurance Mechanism.
You may include provisions for a reliability assurance mechanism in your State plan. If included, such provisions would allow for one extension, not to exceed 12-months of the date by which an affected EGU has committed to permanently cease operations based on a demonstration consistent with this paragraph (a)(13) that operation of the affected EGU is necessary for electric grid reliability.
(i) The State plan must require that the reliability assurance mechanism would only be appliable to the following EGUs which, for the purpose of this paragraph (a)(13), are collectively referred to as “eligible EGUs”:
(A) Coal-fired steam generating units that are exempt from these emission guidelines pursuant to § 60.5850b(k),
(B) Affected EGUs in the medium-term coal-fired steam-generating subcategory that have enforceable commitments to permanently cease operation before January 1, 2039, in the State plan, and
(C) Affected EGUs that have enforceable dates to permanently cease operation included in the State plan pursuant to § 60.24a(g).
(ii)The date from which an extension would run is the date included in the State plan by which an eligible EGU has committed to permanently cease operation.
(iii) The State plan must provide that an extension is only available to owners or operators of affected EGUs that have satisfied all applicable increments of progress and reporting obligations and milestones in paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section. This includes requiring that the owner or operator of an affected EGU has posted all information relevant to such increments of progress and reporting obligations and milestones on the Carbon Pollution Standards for EGUs website, described in § 60.5740b(a)(10).
(iv) The State plan must provide that any applicable standard of performance for an affected EGU must remain in place during the duration of an extension provided under this mechanism.
(v) The State plan may provide for requests for an extension of up to 12 months without a State plan revision.
(A) For an extension of 6 months or less, the owner or operator of the eligible EGU requesting the extension must submit the information in paragraph (a)(13)(vi) to the applicable EPA Regional Administrator to review and approve or disapprove the extension request.
(B) For an extension of more than 6 months and up to 12 months, the owner
or operator of the eligible EGU requesting the extension must submit the information in paragraph (a)(13)(vii) to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (through a process and at an office of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's designation) and to the applicable EPA Regional Administrator to review and approve or disapprove the extension request.
(vi) The State plan must require that to apply for an extension for 6 months or less, described in paragraph (a)(13)(v)(A) of this section, the owner or operator of an eligible EGU must submit a complete written application that includes the information listed in paragraphs (a)(13)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section no less than 30 days prior to the cease operation date, but no earlier than 12 months prior to the cease operation date.
(A) An analysis of the reliability risk that clearly demonstrates that the eligible EGU is critical to maintaining electric reliability. The analysis must include a projection of the length of time that the EGU is expected to be reliability-critical and the length of the requested extension must be no longer than this period or 6 months, whichever is shorter. In order to show an approvable reliability need, the analysis must clearly demonstrate that an eligible EGU ceasing operation by the date listed in the State plan would cause one or more of the conditions listed in paragraphs (a)(13)(vi)(A)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section. An eligible EGU that has received a Reliability Must Run designation, or equivalent from a Reliability Coordinator or Balancing Authority, would fulfill those conditions.
(1)
Result in noncompliance with at least one of the mandatory reliability standards approved by FERC; or
(2)
Would cause the loss of load expectation to increase beyond the level targeted by regional system planners as part of their established procedures for that particular region; specifically, this requires a clear demonstration that the eligible EGU would be needed to maintain the targeted level of resource adequacy.
(B) Certification from the relevant reliability planning authority that the claims of reliability risk are accurate and that the identified reliability problem both exists and requires the specific relief requested. This certification must be accompanied by a written analysis by the relevant planning authority consistent with paragraph (a)(13)(vi)(A) of this section, confirming the asserted reliability risk if the eligible EGU was not in operation. The information from the relevant reliability planning authority must also include any related system-wide or regional analysis and a substantiation of the length of time that the eligible EGU is expected to be reliability critical.
(C) Copies of any written comments from third parties regarding the extension.
(D) Demonstration from the owner or operator of the eligible EGU, grid operator, and other relevant entities of a plan, including appropriate actions to bring on new capacity or transmission, to resolve the underlying reliability issue is leading to the need to employ this reliability assurance mechanism, including the steps and timeframes for implementing measures to rectify the underlying reliability issue.
(E) Any other information requested by the applicable EPA Regional Administrator or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
(vii) The State plan must require that to apply for an extension longer than 6 months but up to 12 months, described in paragraph (a)(13)(v)(B) of this section, the owner or operator of an eligible EGU must submit a complete written application that includes the information listed in (a)(13)(vi)(A) through (E) of this section, except that the period of time under (a)(13)(vi)(A) would be 12 months. For requests for extensions longer than 6 months, this application must be submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator no less than 45 days prior to the date for ceasing operation listed in the State plan, but no earlier than 12 months prior to that date.
(viii) The State plan must provide that extensions will only be granted for the period of time that is substantiated by the reliability need and the submitted analysis and documentation, and shall not exceed 12 months in total.
(ix) The State plan must provide that the reliability assurance mechanism
shall not be used more than once to extend an eligible EGU's planned cease operation date.
(x) The EPA Regional Administrator may reject the application if the submission is incomplete with respect to the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(13)(vi)(A) through (E) of this section or if the submission does not adequately support the asserted reliability risk or the period of time for which the eligible EGU is anticipated to be reliability critical.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 60.5775b
What standards of performance must I include in my State plan?
(a) For each affected EGU, your State plan must include the standard of performance that applies for the affected EGU. A standard of performance for an affected EGU may take the following forms:
(1) A rate-based standard of performance for an individual affected EGU that does not exceed the level calculated through the use of the methods described in § 60.5775b(c) and (d).
(2) A standard of performance in an alternate form, which may apply for affected EGUs in the long-term coal-fired steam generating unit subcategory or the medium-term coal-fired steam generating unit subcategory, as provided for in § 60.5775b(e).
(b) Standard(s) of performance for affected EGUs included under your State plan must be demonstrated to be quantifiable, verifiable, non-duplicative, permanent, and enforceable with respect to each affected EGU. The State plan submittal must include the methods by which each standard of performance meets each of the following requirements:
(1) An affected EGU's standard of performance is quantifiable if it can be reliably measured in a manner that can be replicated.
(2) An affected EGU's standard of performance is verifiable if adequate monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements are in place to enable the State and the Administrator to independently evaluate, measure, and verify compliance with the standard of performance.
(3) An affected EGU's standard of performance is non-duplicative with respect to a State plan if it is not already incorporated as an standard of performance in the State plan.
(4) An affected EGU's standard of performance is permanent if the standard of performance must be met continuously unless it is replaced by another standard of performance in an approved State plan revision.
(5) An affected EGU's standard of performance is enforceable if:
(i) A technically accurate limitation or requirement, and the time period for the limitation or requirement, are specified;
(ii) Compliance requirements are clearly defined;
(iii) The affected EGUs are responsible for compliance and liable for violations identified;
(iv) Each compliance activity or measure is enforceable as a practical matter, as defined by 40 CFR 49.167; and
(v) The Administrator, the State, and third parties maintain the ability to enforce against violations (including if an affected EGU does not meet its standard of performance based on its emissions) and secure appropriate corrective actions: in the case of the Administrator, pursuant to CAA sections 113(a)-(h); in the case of a State, pursuant to its State plan, State law or CAA section 304, as applicable; and in the case of third parties, pursuant to CAA section 304.

2
.
(ii) Degree of emission limitation is 88.4 percent reduction in emission rate (lb CO
2
/MWh-gross).
(iii) Presumptively approvable standard of performance is an emission rate limit defined by an 88.4 percent reduction in annual emission rate (lb CO
2
/MWh-gross) from the unit-specific baseline.
(2) Medium-term coal-fired steam generating units
(i) BSER is natural gas co-firing at 40 percent of the heat input to the unit.
(ii) Degree of emission limitation is a 16 percent reduction in emission rate (lb CO

/MWh-gross).
(iii) Presumptively approvable standard of performance is an emission rate limit defined by a 16 percent reduction in annual emission rate (lb CO
2
/MWh-gross) from the unit-specific baseline.
(iv) For units in this subcategory that have an amount of co-firing that is reflected in the baseline operation, States must account for such preexisting co-firing in adjusting the degree of emission limitation (
e.g.,
for an EGU co-fires natural gas at a level of 10 percent of the total annual heat input during the applicable 8-quarter baseline period, the corresponding degree of emission limitation would be adjusted to 12 percent to reflect the preexisting level of natural gas co-firing).
(3) Base load oil-fired steam generating units.

(ii) Degree of emission limitation is a 0 percent increase in emission rate (lb CO
2

2
emission performance in lb CO
2
per MWh or lb CO
2
per MMBtu.
(e) Your State plan may include a standard of performance in an alternate form that differs from the presumptively approvable standard of performance specified in § 60.5775b(a)(1), as follows:

(j) EGUs that derive greater than 50 percent of the heat input from an industrial process that does not produce any electrical or mechanical output or useful thermal output that is used outside the affected EGU.
(k) Existing coal-fired steam generating units that have demonstrated that they plan to permanently cease operations before January 1, 2032, pursuant to § 60.5740b(a)(9)(ii).

# Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements
§ 60.5860b
What applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements do I need to include in my State plan for affected EGUs?
(a) Your State plan must include monitoring for affected EGUs that is no less stringent than what is described in (a)(1) through (9) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator of an affected EGU (or group of affected EGUs that share a monitored common stack) that is required to meet standards of performance must prepare a monitoring plan in accordance with the applicable provisions in 40 CFR 75.53(g) and (h), unless such a plan is already in place under another program that requires CO
2
mass emissions to be monitored and reported according to 40 CFR part 75.
(2) For rate-based standards of performance, only “valid operating hours,”,
i.e.,
full or partial unit (or stack) operating hours for which:
(i) “Valid data” (as defined in § 60.5880b) are obtained for all of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions (lbs). For the purposes of this subpart, substitute data recorded under part 75 of this chapter are not considered to be valid data; data obtained from flow monitoring bias adjustments are not considered to be valid data; and data provided or not provided from monitoring instruments that have not met the required frequency for relative accuracy audit testing are not considered to be valid data and
(ii) The corresponding hourly gross energy output value is also valid data (Note: For operating hours with no useful output, zero is considered to be a valid value).
(3) For rate-based standards of performance, the owner or operator of an affected EGU must measure and report the hourly CO
2
mass emissions (lbs) from each affected unit using the procedures in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(i) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a CO
2
continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) to directly measure and record CO
2
concentrations in the affected EGU exhaust gases emitted to the atmosphere and an exhaust gas flow rate monitoring system according to 40 CFR 75.10(a)(3)(i). As an alternative to direct measurement of CO
2
concentration, provided that the affected EGU does not use carbon separation (
e.g.,
carbon capture and storage (CCS)), the owner or operator of an affected EGU may use data from a certified oxygen (O
2
) monitor to calculate hourly average CO
2
concentrations, in accordance with 40 CFR 75.10(a)(3)(iii). However, when an O
2
monitor is used this way, it only quantifies the combustion CO
2
; therefore, if the EGU is equipped with emission controls that produce non-combustion CO
2
(
e.g.,
from sorbent injection), this additional CO
2
must be accounted for, in accordance with section 3 of appendix G to part 75 of this chapter. If CO
2
concentration is measured on a dry basis, the owner or operator of the affected EGU must also install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a continuous moisture monitoring system, according to 40 CFR 75.11(b). Alternatively, the owner or operator of an affected EGU may either use an appropriate fuel-specific default moisture value from 40 CFR 75.11(b) or submit a petition to the Administrator under 40 CFR 75.66 for a site-specific default moisture value.
(ii) For each “valid operating hour” (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emission rate (tons/hr), either from Equation F-11 in appendix F to 40 CFR
part 75 (if CO
2
concentration is measured on a wet basis), or by following the procedure in section 4.2 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 75 (if CO
2
concentration is measured on a dry basis).
(iii) Next, multiply each hourly CO
2
mass emission rate by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2), to convert it to tons of CO
2.
Multiply the result by 2,000 lbs/ton to convert it to lbs.
(iv) The hourly CO
2
tons/hr values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO
2
mass emissions are required to be recorded under 40 CFR 75.57(e) and must be reported electronically under 40 CFR 75.64(a)(6), if required by a State plan. The owner or operator must use these data, or equivalent data, to calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emissions.
(v) Sum all of the hourly CO
2
mass emissions values from paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
(vi) For each continuous monitoring system used to determine the CO
2
mass emissions from an affected EGU, the monitoring system must meet the applicable certification and quality assurance procedures in 40 CFR 75.20 and appendices A and B to 40 CFR part.
(4) The owner or operator of an affected EGU that exclusively combusts liquid fuel and/or gaseous fuel may, as an alternative to complying with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, determine the hourly CO
2
mass emissions according to paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(vi) of this section.
(i) Implement the applicable procedures in appendix D to part 75 of this chapter to determine hourly EGU heat input rates (MMBtu/hr), based on hourly measurements of fuel flow rate and periodic determinations of the gross calorific value (GCV) of each fuel combusted. The fuel flow meter(s) used to measure the hourly fuel flow rates must meet the applicable certification and quality-assurance requirements in sections 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 of appendix D to 40 CFR part 75 (except for qualifying commercial billing meters). The fuel GCV must be determined in accordance with section 2.2 or 2.3 of appendix D to 40 CFR part 75, as applicable.
(ii) For each measured hourly heat input rate, use Equation G-4 in appendix G to 40 CFR part 75 to calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emission rate (tons/hr).
(iii) For each “valid operating hour” (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), multiply the hourly tons/hr CO
2
mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2), to convert it to tons of CO
2
. Then, multiply the result by 2,000 lbs/ton to convert it to lbs.
(iv) The hourly CO
2
tons/hr values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO
2
mass emissions are required to be recorded under 40 CFR 75.57(e) and must be reported electronically under 40 CFR 75.64(a)(6), if required by a State plan. You must use these data, or equivalent data, to calculate the hourly CO
2
mass emissions.
(v) Sum all of the hourly CO
2
mass emissions values (lb) from paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.
(vi) The owner or operator of an affected EGU may determine site-specific carbon-based F-factors (F
c
) using Equation F-7b in section 3.3.6 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 75 and may use these F
c
values in the emissions calculations instead of using the default F
c
values in the Equation G-4 nomenclature.
(5) For rate-based standards, the owner or operator of an affected EGU (or group of affected units that share a monitored common stack) must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a sufficient number of watt meters to continuously measure and record on an hourly basis gross electric output. Measurements must be performed using 0.2 accuracy class electricity metering instrumentation and calibration procedures as specified under ANSI No. C12.20-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). Further, the owner or operator of an affected EGU that is a combined heat and power facility must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate equipment to continuously measure and record on an hourly basis useful thermal output and, if applicable, mechanical output, which are used with gross electric output to determine gross energy output. The owner or operator must use the following procedures to calculate gross energy output, as appropriate for the type of affected EGU(s).
(i) Determine P
gross/net
the hourly gross or net energy output in MWh. For rate-based standards, perform this calculation only for valid operating hours (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section). For mass-based standards, perform this calculation for all unit (or stack) operating hours,
i.e.,
full or partial hours in which any fuel is combusted.
(ii) If there is no net electrical output, but there is mechanical or useful thermal output, either for a particular valid operating hour (for rate-based applications), or for a particular operating hour (for mass-based applications), the owner or operator of the affected EGU must still determine the net energy output for that hour.
(iii) For rate-based applications, if there is no (
i.e.,
zero) gross electrical, mechanical, or useful thermal output for a particular valid operating hour, that hour must be used in the compliance determination. For hours or partial hours where the gross electric output is equal to or less than the auxiliary loads, net electric output shall be counted as zero for this calculation.
(iv) Calculate P
gross/net
for your affected EGU (or group of affected EGUs that share a monitored common stack) using the following equation. All terms in the equation must be expressed in units of MWh. To convert each hourly gross or net energy output value reported under 40 CFR part 75 to MWh, multiply by the corresponding EGU or stack operating time.
Equation 1 to Paragraph (a)(5)(iv)
ER09MY24.062
Where:
P
GROSS/NET
= Gross or net energy output of your affected EGU for each valid operating hour (as defined in 60.5860b(a)(2)) in MWh.
(PE)
ST
= Electric energy output plus mechanical energy output (if any) of steam turbines in MWh.
(PE)
CT
= Electric energy output plus mechanical energy output (if any) of stationary combustion turbine(s) in MWh.
(PE)
IE
= Electric energy output plus mechanical energy output (if any) of your affected egu's integrated equipment that provides electricity or mechanical energy to the affected EGU or auxiliary equipment in MWh.
(PE)
A
= Electric energy used for any auxiliary loads in MWh.
(PT)
PS
= Useful thermal output of steam (measured relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) that is used for applications that do not generate additional electricity, produce mechanical energy output, or enhance the performance of the affected EGU. This is calculated using the equation specified in paragraph (a)(5)(V) of this section in MWh.
(PT)
HR
= Non-steam useful thermal output (measured relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from heat recovery that is used for applications other than steam generation or performance enhancement of the affected EGU in MWh.
(PT)
IE
= Useful thermal output (relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from any integrated equipment is used for applications that do not generate additional steam, electricity, produce mechanical energy output, or enhance the performance of the affected EGU in MWh.
TDF = Electric transmission and distribution factor of 0.95 for a combined heat and power affected egu where at least on an annual basis 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consists of electric or direct mechanical output and 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consist of useful thermal output on a 12-operating month rolling average basis, or 1.0 for all other affected EGUs.
(v) If applicable to your affected EGU (for example, for combined heat and power), you must calculate (Pt)
PS
using the following equation:
Equation 2 to Paragraph (a)(5)(v)
ER09MY24.063
Where:
Q
M
= Measured steam flow in kilograms (KG) (or pounds (LBS)) for the operating hour.
H = Enthalpy of the steam at measured temperature and pressure (relative to SATP conditions or the energy in the condensate return line, as applicable) in joules per kilogram (J/KG) (or BTU/LB).
CF = Conversion factor of 3.6 × 10
9
J/MWH or 3.413 × 10
6
BTU/MWh.
(vi) For rate-based standards, sum all of the values of P
gross/net
for the valid operating hours (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section). Then, divide the total CO
2
mass emissions for the valid operating hours from paragraph (a)(3)(v) or (a)(4)(v) of this section, as applicable, by the sum of the P
gross/net
values for the valid operating hours to determine the CO
2
emissions rate (lb/gross or net MWh).
(6) In accordance with § 60.13(g), if two or more affected EGUs implementing the continuous emissions monitoring provisions in paragraph (a)(3) of this section share a common exhaust gas stack and are subject to the same emissions standard, the owner or operator may monitor the hourly CO
2
mass emissions at the common stack in lieu of monitoring each EGU separately. If an owner or operator of an affected EGU chooses this option, the hourly gross or net electric output for the common stack must be the sum of the hourly gross or net electric output of the individual affected EGUs and the operating time must be expressed as “stack operating hours” (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2).
(7) In accordance with § 60.13(g), if the exhaust gases from an affected EGU implementing the continuous emissions monitoring provisions in paragraph (a)(3) of this section are emitted to the atmosphere through multiple stacks (or if the exhaust gases are routed to a common stack through multiple ducts and you elect to monitor in the ducts), the hourly CO
2
mass emissions and the “stack operating time” (as defined in 40 CFR 72.2) at each stack or duct must be monitored separately. In this case, the owner or operator of an affected EGU must determine compliance with an applicable emissions standard by summing the CO
2
mass emissions measured at the individual stacks or ducts and dividing by the gross or net energy output for the affected EGU.
(8) Consistent with § 60.5775b, if two or more affected EGUs serve a common electric generator, you must apportion the combined hourly gross or net energy output to the individual affected EGUs according to the fraction of the total steam load contributed by each EGU. Alternatively, if the EGUs are identical, you may apportion the combined hourly gross or net electrical load to the individual EGUs according to the fraction of the total heat input contributed by each EGU.
(9) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must measure and report monthly fuel usage for each affected source subject to standards of performance with the information in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) The calendar month during which the fuel was used;
(ii) Each type of fuel used during the calendar month of the compliance period; and
(iii) Quantity of each type of fuel combusted in each calendar month in the compliance period with units of measure.
(b) Your State plan must require the owner or operator of each affected EGU covered by your State plan to maintain the records, for at least 5 years following the date of each occurrence,
measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record.
(1) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must maintain each record on site for at least 2 years after the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record, whichever is latest, according to § 60.7. The owner or operator of an affected EGU may maintain the records off site and electronically for the remaining year(s).
(2) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must keep all of the following records, in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review:
(i) All documents, data files, and calculations and methods used to demonstrate compliance with an affected EGU's standard of performance under § 60.5775b.
(ii) Copies of all reports submitted to the State under paragraph (b) of this section.
(iii) Data that are required to be recorded by 40 CFR part 75 subpart F.
(c) Your State plan must require the owner or operator of an affected EGU covered by your State plan to include in a report submitted to you the information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) Owners or operators of an affected EGU must include in the report all hourly CO
2
emissions, for each affected EGU (or group of affected EGUs that share a monitored common stack).
(2) For rate-based standards, each report must include:
(i) The hourly CO
2
mass emission rate values (tons/hr) and unit (or stack) operating times, (as monitored and reported according to part 75 of this chapter), for each valid operating hour;
(ii) The gross or net electric output and the gross or net energy output (P
gross/net
) values for each valid operating hour;
(iii) The calculated CO
2
mass emissions (lb) for each valid operating hour;
(iv) The sum of the hourly gross or net energy output values and the sum of the hourly CO
2
mass emissions values, for all of the valid operating hours; and
(v) The calculated CO
2
mass emission rate (lbs/gross or net MWh).
(3) For each affected EGU the report must also include the applicable standard of performance and demonstration that it met the standard of performance. An owner or operator must also include in the report the affected EGU's calculated emission performance as a CO
2
emission rate in units of the standard of performance.
(d) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must follow any additional requirements for monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting in a State plan that are required under § 60.5740b if applicable.
(e) If an affected EGU captures CO
2
to meet the applicable standard of performance, the owner or operator must report in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98 subpart PP and either:
(1) Report in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98, subpart RR, or subpart VV, if injection occurs on-site;
(2) Transfer the captured CO
2
to a facility that reports in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98, subpart RR, or subpart VV, if injection occurs off-site; or
(3) Transfer the captured CO
2
to a facility that has received an innovative technology waiver from the EPA pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.
(f) Any person may request the Administrator to issue a waiver of the requirement that captured CO
2
from an affected EGU be transferred to a facility reporting under 40 CFR part 98, subpart RR, or subpart VV. To receive a waiver, the applicant must demonstrate to the Administrator that its technology will store captured CO
2
as effectively as geologic sequestration, and that the proposed technology will not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety. In making this determination, the Administrator shall consider (among other factors) operating history of the technology, whether the technology will increase emissions or other releases of any pollutant other than CO
2
, and permanence of the CO
2
storage. The Administrator may test the system or require the applicant to perform any tests considered by the Administrator to be necessary to show the technology's effectiveness, safety,
and ability to store captured CO
2
without release. The Administrator may grant conditional approval of a technology, with the approval conditioned on monitoring and reporting of operations. The Administrator may also withdraw approval of the waiver on evidence of releases of CO
2
or other pollutants. The Administrator will provide notice to the public of any application under this provision and provide public notice of any proposed action on a petition before the Administrator takes final action.

§ 60.5875b
How do I submit information required by these emission guidelines to the EPA?
(a) You must submit to the EPA the information required by these emission guidelines following the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
(b) All State plan submittals, supporting materials that are part of a State plan submittal, any State plan revisions, and all State reports required to be submitted to the EPA by the State plan must be reported through the EPA's State Plan Electronic Collection System (SPeCS). SPeCS is a web accessible electronic system accessed at the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
http://www.epa.gov/cdx/
). States that claim that a State plan submittal or supporting documentation includes confidential business information (CBI) must submit that information on a compact disc, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAQPS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: State and Local Programs Group, MD C539-01, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703.
(c) Only a submittal by the Governor or the Governor's designee by an electronic submission through SPeCS shall be considered an official submittal to the EPA under this subpart. If the Governor wishes to designate another responsible official the authority to submit a State plan, the EPA must be notified via letter from the Governor prior to the May 11, 2026, deadline for State plan submittal so that the official will have the ability to submit the initial or final State plan submittal in the SPeCS. If the Governor has previously delegated authority to make CAA submittals on the Governor's behalf, a State may submit documentation of the delegation in lieu of a letter from the Governor. The letter or documentation must identify the designee to whom authority is being designated and must include the name and contact information for the designee and also identify the State plan preparers who will need access to SPeCS. A State may also submit the names of the State plan preparers via a separate letter prior to the designation letter from the Governor in order to expedite the State plan administrative process. Required contact information for the designee and preparers includes the person's title, organization, and email address.
(d) The submission of the information by the authorized official must be in a non-editable format. In addition to the non-editable version all State plan components designated as federally enforceable must also be submitted in an editable version. Following initial State plan approval, States must provide the EPA with an editable copy of any submitted revision to existing approved federally enforceable State plan components, including State plan
backstop measures. The editable copy of any such submitted State plan revision must indicate the changes made at the State level, if any, to the existing approved federally enforceable State plan components, using a mechanism such as redline/strikethrough. These changes are not part of the State plan until formal approval by the EPA.
(e) You must provide the EPA with non-editable and editable copies of any submitted revision to existing approved federally enforceable State plan components. The editable copy of any such submitted State plan revision must indicate the changes made at the State level, if any, to the existing approved federally enforceable State plan components, using a mechanism such as redline/strikethrough. These changes are not part of the State plan until formal approval by the EPA.

(3) The owner or operator must submit a final report to the EPA no later than 6 months following its committed
closure date. This report must document any actions that the EGU has taken subsequent to ceasing operation to ensure that such cessation is permanent, including any regulatory filings with applicable authorities or decommissioning plans.
(b) Beginning November 12, 2024, if you are the owner or operator of an EGU that has committed to permanently cease operations by January 1, 2032, you must submit all the information required in paragraph (a) of this section in a Permanent Cessation of Operation report in PDF format following the procedures specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) If you are required to submit notifications or reports following the procedure specified in this paragraph (c), you must submit notifications or reports to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI), which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as CBI. Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report or notification, you must submit a complete file in the format specified in this subpart, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (c).
(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
, and as described above, should include clear CBI markings and be flagged to the attention of the Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Electric Utility Generating Units Sector Lead. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(2) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: U.S. EPA Attn: OAQPS Document Control Officer, Mail Drop: C404-02, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive P.O. Box 12055, RTP, NC 27711. All other files should also be sent to the attention of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Electric Utility Generating Units Sector Lead. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.
(d) Any records required to be maintained by this subpart that are submitted electronically via the EPA's CEDRI may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to a delegated air agency or the EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.
(e) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with that reporting requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (e)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.
(2) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.
(3) The outage may be planned or unplanned.
(4) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(5) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:
(i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(7) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.
(f) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of
force majeure
for failure to timely comply with that reporting requirement. To assert a claim of
force majeure,
you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs(f)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You may submit a claim if a
force majeure
event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a
force majeure
event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage).
(2) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(3) You must provide to the Administrator:
(i) A written description of the
force majeure
event;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(4) The decision to accept the claim of
force majeure
and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(5) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the
force majeure
event occurs.
(g) Alternatives to any electronic reporting required by this subpart must be approved by the Administrator.

e.g.,
the point of sale).
Net energy output
means:
(1) The net electric or mechanical output from the affected facility, plus 100 percent of the useful thermal output measured relative to standard ambient temperature and pressure conditions that is not used to generate additional electric or mechanical output or to enhance the performance of the unit (
e.g.,
steam delivered to an industrial process for a heating application).
(2) For combined heat and power facilities where at least 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consists of electric or direct mechanical output and at least 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consists of useful thermal output on a 12-operating month rolling average basis, the net electric or mechanical output from the affected EGU divided by 0.95, plus 100 percent of the useful thermal output; (
e.g.,
steam delivered to an industrial process for a heating application).

steam delivered to an industrial process for a heating application, including thermal cooling applications) that is not used for electric generation, mechanical output at the affected EGU, to directly enhance the performance of the affected EGU (
e.g.,
economizer output is not useful thermal output, but thermal energy used to reduce fuel moisture is considered useful thermal output), or to supply energy to a pollution control device at the affected EGU. Useful thermal output for affected EGU(s) with no condensate return (or other thermal energy input to the affected EGU(s)) or where measuring the energy in the condensate (or other thermal energy input to the affected EGU(s)) would not meaningfully impact the emission rate calculation is measured against the energy in the thermal output at SATP conditions. Affected EGU(s) with meaningful energy in the condensate return (or other thermal energy input to the affected EGU) must measure the energy in the condensate and subtract that energy relative to SATP conditions from the measured thermal output.
Valid data
means quality-assured data generated by continuous monitoring systems that are installed, operated, and maintained according to 40 CFR part 75. For CEMS, the initial certification requirements in 40 CFR 75.20 and appendix A to 40 CFR part 75 must be met before quality-assured data are reported under this subpart; for on-going quality assurance, the daily, quarterly, and semiannual/annual test requirements in sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 of appendix B to 40 CFR part 75 must be met and the data validation criteria in sections 2.1.4, 2.2.3, and 2.3.2 of appendix B to 40 CFR part 75 apply. For fuel flow meters, the initial certification requirements in section 2.1.5 of appendix D to 40 CFR part 75 must be met before quality-assured data are reported under this subpart (except for qualifying commercial billing meters under section 2.1.4.2 of appendix D), and for on-going quality assurance, the provisions in section 2.1.6 of appendix D to 40 CFR part 75 apply (except for qualifying commercial billing meters).
Waste-to-Energy
means a process or unit (
e.g.,
solid waste incineration unit) that recovers energy from the conversion or combustion of waste stream materials, such as municipal solid waste, to generate electricity and/or heat.
