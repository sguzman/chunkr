This part establishes classifications of air carriers known as “air taxi operators” and “commuter air carriers,” provides certain exemptions to them from some of the economic regulatory provisions of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation), specifies procedures by which such air carriers may obtain authority to conduct operations, and establishes rules applicable to their operations in interstate and/or foreign air transportation in all States, Territories and possessions of the United States. This part also establishes reporting requirements for commuter air carriers and small certificated air carriers.
§ 298.2
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Air taxi operator
means an air carrier as established by § 298.3(a).

Note:
Operations wholly within the geographic limits of a single State are not considered interstate air transportation if in those operations the carrier transports no more than a
de minimis
volume of passengers or property moving as part of a continuous journey to or from a point outside the State.
Foreign air transportation is defined in section 40102(a)(23) of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII as the transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft, between a place in the United States and a place outside the United States when any part of the transportation is by aircraft.
Air transportation also is defined to include the transportation of mail by aircraft. Section 5402 of the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. 5402, authorizes the carriage of mail by air taxi operators and commuter air carriers in some circumstances under contract with the U.S. Postal Service.

Docket No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.0
Applicability.
The rules of conduct set forth in this part except as otherwise provided in this or any other DOT regulation shall govern the conduct of the parties and their representatives, and the relationships between the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and the Office of the General Counsel, including regular personnel, and officials, special Government employees, consultants, or experts under contract to the Department of Transportation (DOT) and administrative law judges (hereinafter referred to as “DOT employee(s)”) and all other persons in all DOT matters involving aviation economic and enforcement proceedings.
[Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended by Amdt. 1-261, 59 FR 10061, Mar. 3, 1994; 60 FR 43528, Aug. 22, 1995]
§ 300.1
Judicial standards of practice.
Certain of DOT's functions involving aviation economic and enforcement proceedings are similar to those of a court, and parties to cases before DOT and those who represent such parties are expected—in fact and in appearance—to conduct themselves with honor and dignity as they would before a court. By the same token, any DOT employee or administrative law judge carrying out DOT's quasi-judicial functions and any DOT employee making recommendations or advising them are expected to conduct themselves with the same fidelity to appropriate standards of propriety that characterize a court and its staff. The standing and effectiveness of DOT in carrying out its quasi-judicial functions are in direct relation to the observance by DOT, DOT employees, and the parties and attorneys appearing before DOT of the highest standards of judicial and professional ethics. The rules of conduct set forth in this part are to be interpreted in light of those standards.
[Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, Aug. 22, 1995]

§ 300.4
Separation of functions in hearing cases.
(a) This section applies after the initiation of a hearing or enforcement case by the Department.
(b) A DOT employee who is participating in a hearing case on behalf of an office that is a party, another DOT employee who is in fact reviewing the position taken, or who has participated in developing the position taken in that case, or, in cases involving accusatory or disciplinary issues (including all enforcement cases) such employees' supervisors within that office, shall have no substantive communication with any DOT decisionmaker, administrative law judge in the case, or other DOT employee advising them, with respect to that or any factually related hearing case, except in accordance with a published DOT rule or order. In addition, each bureau or office supervisor of a DOT employee who is participating in a hearing case on behalf of that office when it is a party shall have no substantive communication with any administrative law judge in the case, or DOT employee advising the judge, in that or any factually related hearing case, except in accordance with a published DOT rule or order. For each hearing case, bureau or office heads shall maintain a publicly available record of those employees who are participating or are in fact reviewing the position taken, or who have participated in developing the position taken in that case.
(c) In hearing cases involving fares or rates, or applications for a certificate or permit under 49 U.S.C. 41102 and 41302, or applications by a holder for a change in a certificate or permit, a supervisor who would not be permitted to advise the DOT decisionmaker under paragraph (b) of this section may advise the DOT decisionmaker in the following manner: The supervisor's advice must either be made orally in an open DOT meeting or by a memorandum placed in the docket or other public file of such matter. Oral advice must be summarized in writing by the supervisor and placed in the docket or file of the matter. A copy of such written memorandum or summary of oral advice must be served on each party to the proceeding within 3 business days after such advice is given to the concerned DOT decisionmaker. Each of the parties may comment in writing on such advice within 5 business days after service or the summary. In no event, however, may a supervisor advise the DOT decisionmaker if he or she acted as the office's counsel or witness in the matter.
(d) In enforcement cases, the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, under the supervision of the career Deputy General Counsel and the General Counsel, will conduct all enforcement proceedings and related investigative functions, while the non-career Deputy General Counsel will advise the DOT decisionmaker in the course of the decisional process. The Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings will report to the career Deputy General Counsel and the General Counsel. To ensure the independence of these functions, this Office and the General Counsel, for the purpose of this section, shall be considered an “office” as that term is used in paragraph (b) of this section, separate from the non-career Deputy General Counsel and the rest of the Office of the General Counsel.

§ 300.8
Opinions or rulings by the General Counsel.
The General Counsel is authorized to render opinions or rulings to the public on the application of the provisions of this part. When written request is made for such opinions and rulings, they shall be transmitted to DOT and shall be available to the public in the Documentary Services Division after any appeal to or review by the Secretary has been completed or after the time for review has expired. Identifying details shall normally be stricken from copies available to the public unless the public interest requires disclosure of such details.

§ 300.9
Disqualification of partners of DOT employees.
No partner of a DOT employee shall act as agent or attorney for anyone other than the United States in any DOT proceeding or matter in which such employee participates or has participated personally and substantially through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, rendering advice, investigation, or otherwise, or which is the subject of his or her official responsibility.

§ 300.10
Motions to disqualify DOT employee in review of hearing matters.
In cases to be determined on an evidentiary record, a party desiring that a concerned DOT employee disqualify himself or herself from participating in a DOT decision shall file a motion supported by an affidavit setting forth the grounds for such disqualification in the form and within the periods prescribed in § 302.11 of this chapter. Where review of the administrative law judge's decision can be obtained only upon the filing of a petition for discretionary review, such motions must be filed on or before the date answers are due pursuant to § 302.32. In cases where exceptions are filed to recommended, initial, or tentative decisions or where the DOT decisionmaker orders review of an initial or recommended decision on his or her own initiative, such motions must be filed on or before the date briefs are due pursuant to § 302.35 or § 302.218, as applicable. Failure to file a timely motion will be deemed a waiver of disqualification. Applications for leave to file an untimely motion seeking disqualification of a concerned DOT employee must be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth in detail why the facts relied upon as grounds for disqualification were not known and could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence within the prescribed time.

§ 300.11
Use of confidential information.
No former CAB member or employee or DOT employee, or any person associated with him or her, shall ever use or undertake to use in any DOT proceeding or matter any confidential facts or information which came into the possession of such Member or employee or to his or her attention by reason of his or her employment with the CAB or DOT without first applying for and obtaining the consent of the appropriate ethics counselor for the use of such facts or information.

§ 300.12
Violations.
(a) DOT may disqualify, and deny temporarily or permanently the privilege of appearing or practicing before it in any way to, any person who is found by DOT after written notice of charges and hearing to have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct. Any violation of this part shall be deemed to be such conduct.
(b) When appropriate in the public interest, DOT may deny any application or other request of a party in a proceeding subject to this part where DOT finds after hearing that such party has, in connection with any DOT proceeding, violated any of the provisions of this part or any of the provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code. DOT may also condition its further consideration of such party's application or other request or the effectiveness of any order granting such application or other request upon such party's first taking such action as DOT may deem necessary or appropriate to remedy the violation of this part or Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code to prevent or deter any repetition of such violation. DOT may in addition issue a cease and desist order against any repetition of such or similar misconduct.
(c) The actions authorized by this section may take place within the framework of the matter during or concerning which the violations occur or in a separate matter, as the DOT decisionmaker or the presiding administrative law judge may direct. A complaint
alleging that a violation has occurred in the course of a matter shall be filed in the docket or appropriate public file of such matter unless such complaint is made after DOT's decision of the matter has become final, in which event such complaint may be filed pursuant to part 302, subpart D of the rules of practice. A violation in the course of a matter which may be attributable to or affect the fitness of a party will ordinarily either be disposed of within the framework of such matter or be considered within the context of any subsequent matter involving the interests of such party. Other violations will ordinarily be disposed of in a separate proceeding.
(d) In the case of any violation of the provisions of this part, the violator may be subject to civil penalties under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 46301. The violator may also be subject to a proceeding brought under 49 U.S.C. 46101 before the Department, or sections 46106 through 46108 of the Statute before a U.S. District Court, as the case may be, to compel compliance with civil penalties which have been imposed.

or legal successor of any of the foregoing, or upon any attorney of record for the party, or upon the agent designated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier under section 46103 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, but it shall be served upon a person designated by a party to receive service of documents in a particular proceeding in accordance with § 302.4(a)(2)(i)(D) once a proceeding has been commenced.
(d)
Where service may be made.
Service shall be made at the principal place of business of the party to be served, or at his or her usual residence if he or she is an individual, or at the office of the party's attorney of record, or at the office or usual residence of the agent designated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier under section 46103 of 49 U.S.C.

In the event of an electronic transmission failure, any other authorized means of service may be substituted and the appropriate proof of service provided.
(f)
Date of service.
The date of service by post office or electronic mail is the date of mailing. Whenever proof of service by personal delivery or facsimile transmission is made, the date of such delivery or facsimile transmission shall be the date of service.

In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, by notice, order or regulation or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday for the Department, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor holiday. When the period of time prescribed is seven (7) days or fewer, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be excluded in the computation, unless otherwise specified by the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding, as the case may be.
§ 302.9
Continuances and extensions of time.
(a) Whenever a party has the right or obligation to take action within a period prescribed by this part, by a notice given thereunder, or by an order or regulation, the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding, as appropriate, may:
(1) Before the expiration of the prescribed period, with or without notice, extend such period, or
(2) Upon motion, permit the act to be done after the expiration of the specified period, where good cause for the failure to act on time is clearly shown.
(b) Except where an administrative law judge has been assigned to a proceeding, requests for continuance or extensions of time, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be directed to the DOT decisionmaker. Requests for continuances and extensions of time may be directed to the Chief Administrative Law Judge in the absence of the administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding.
§ 302.10
Parties.
(a) In addition to the persons set forth in § 302.2, in hearing cases, parties shall include Department staff designated to participate in the proceeding and any persons authorized to intervene or granted permission to participate in accordance with §§ 302.19 and 302.20. In any proceeding directly involving air transportation to the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau, these governments or their designated authorities shall be a party.
(b) Upon motion and for good cause shown, the Department may order a substitution of parties, except that in case of the death of a party, substitution may be ordered without the filing of a motion.
(c) An association composed entirely or in part of air carriers may participate in any proceedings of the Department to which the Department's procedural regulations apply if the association represents members that are identified in any documents filed with the Department, and that have specifically authorized the positions taken by the association in that proceeding. The specific authorizations may be informal and evidence of them shall be provided only upon request of the Department. Upon motion of any interested person or upon its own initiative, the Department may issue an order requiring an association to withdraw from a case on the grounds of significant divergence of interest or position within the association.
§ 302.11
Motions.
(a)
Generally.
An application to the DOT decisionmaker or an administrative law judge for an order or ruling not otherwise specifically provided for in this part shall be by motion. If an administrative law judge is assigned to a proceeding and before the issuance of a recommended or initial decision or the certification of the record to the DOT decisionmaker, all motions shall be addressed to the administrative law judge. At all other times, motions shall be addressed to the DOT decisionmaker. All motions shall be made at an appropriate time depending upon the nature thereof and the relief requested therein. This paragraph should not be construed as authorizing motions in the nature of petitions for reconsideration.
(b)
Form and contents.
Unless made during a hearing, motions shall be made in writing in conformity with §§ 302.3 and 302.4, shall state their grounds and the relief or order sought, and shall be accompanied by any affidavits or other evidence desired to be relied upon. Motions made during hearings, answers to them, and rulings on them, may be made orally on the record unless the administrative law judge directs otherwise. Written motions shall be filed as separate documents, and shall not be incorporated in any other documents, except where incorporation of a motion in another document is specifically authorized by the Department, or where a document is filed that requests alternative forms of relief and one of these alternative requests is properly to be made by motion. In these instances the document filed shall be appropriately titled and identified to indicate that it incorporates a motion; otherwise, the motion will be disregarded.
(c)
Answers to motions.
Within seven (7) days after a motion is served, or such other period as the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge may fix, any party to the proceeding may file an answer in support of or in opposition to the motion, accompanied by such affidavits or other evidence as it desires to rely upon. Except as otherwise provided, no reply to an answer, reply to a reply, or any further responsive document shall be filed.
(d)
Oral arguments; briefs.
No oral argument will be heard on motions unless the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge otherwise directs. Written memoranda or briefs may be filed with motions or answers to motions, stating the points and authorities relied upon in support of the position taken.
(e)
Requests for expedition.
Any interested person may by motion request expedition of any proceeding or file an answer in support of or in opposition to such motions.
(f)
Effect of pendency of motions.
The filing or pendency of a motion shall not automatically alter or extend the time to take action fixed by this part or by
any order of the Department or of an administrative law judge (or any extension granted thereunder).
(g)
Disposition of motions.
The DOT decisionmaker shall pass upon all motions properly submitted to him or her for decision. The administrative law judge shall pass upon all motions properly addressed to him or her, except that, if the administrative law judge finds that a prompt decision by the DOT decisionmaker on a motion is essential to the proper conduct of the proceeding, the administrative law judge may refer such motion to the DOT decisionmaker for decision.
(h)
Appeals to the DOT decisionmaker from rulings of administrative law judges.
Rulings of administrative law judges on motions may not be appealed to the DOT decisionmaker prior to his or her consideration of the entire proceeding except in extraordinary circumstances and with the consent of the administrative law judge. An appeal shall be disallowed unless the administrative law judge finds, either on the record or in writing, that the allowance of such an appeal is necessary to prevent substantial detriment to the public interest or undue prejudice to any party. If an appeal is allowed, any party may file a brief with the DOT decisionmaker within such period as the administrative law judge directs. No oral argument will be heard unless the DOT decisionmaker directs otherwise. The rulings of the administrative law judge on a motion may be reviewed by the DOT decisionmaker in connection with his or her final action in the proceeding or at any other appropriate time irrespective of the filing of an appeal or any action taken on it.
§ 302.12
Objections to public disclosure of information.
(a)
Generally.
Part 7 of the Office of the Secretary regulations, Public Availability of Information, governs the availability of records and documents of the Department to the public. (49 CFR 7.1
et seq.
)
(b)
Information contained in written documents.
Any person who objects to the public disclosure of any information filed in any proceeding, or pursuant to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, or any Department rule, regulation, or order, shall segregate, or request the segregation of, such information into a separate submission and shall file it separately in a sealed envelope, bearing the caption of the enclosed submission, and the notation “Confidential Treatment Requested Under § 302.12.” At the time of filing such submission (or, when the objection is made by a person who is not the filer, within five (5) days after the filing of such submission), the objecting party shall file a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure, in accordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph (d) or (f) of this section, as appropriate. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, copies of the filed submission and of the motion need not be served upon any other party unless so ordered by the Department.
(c)
Information contained in oral testimony.
Any person who objects to the public disclosure of any information sought to be elicited from a witness or deponent on oral examination shall, before such information is disclosed, make his or her objection known. Upon such objection duly made, the witness or deponent shall be compelled to disclose such information only in the presence of the administrative law judge or the person before whom the deposition is being taken, as the case may be, the official stenographer and such attorneys for and representative of each party as the administrative law judge or the person before whom the deposition is being taken shall designate, and after all present have been sworn to secrecy. The transcript of testimony containing such information shall be segregated and filed in a sealed envelope, bearing the title and docket number of the proceeding, and the notation “Confidential Treatment Requested Under § 302.12 Testimony Given by (name of witness or deponent).” Within five (5) days after such testimony is given, the objecting person shall file a motion in accordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph (d) of this section, to withhold the information from public disclosure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, copies of the segregated portion of the transcript and of the motion need not be served upon any other
party unless so ordered by the Department.
(d)
Form of motion.
Motions to withhold from public disclosure information covered by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be filed with the Department in accordance with the following procedure:
(1) The motion shall include:
(i) An index listing the information or document sought to be withheld by an identifying number, and including its title, description and number of pages, and, if relevant, the specific location within a document;
(ii) A statement explaining how and why the information falls within one or more of the exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9)); and
(iii) A statement explaining how and why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the interests of the objecting persons and is not required in the interest of the public.
(2) Such motion shall be filed with the person conducting the proceeding, or with the person with whom said application, report, or submission is required to be filed. Such motion will be denied when the complete justification required by this paragraph is not provided.
(3) During the pendency of such motion, the ruling official may, by notice or order, allow limited disclosure to parties' representatives, for purposes of participating in the proceeding, upon submission by them of affidavits swearing to protect the confidentiality of the documents at issue.
(e)
Conditions of disclosure.
The order, notice or other action of the Department containing its ruling upon each such motion will specify the extent to which, and the conditions upon which, the information may be disclosed to the parties and to the public, which ruling shall become effective upon the date stated therein, unless, within five (5) days after the date of the entry of the Department's order with respect thereto, a petition is filed by the objecting person requesting reconsideration by the Department, or a written statement is filed indicating that the objecting person in good faith intends to seek judicial review of the Department's order.
(f)
Objection by Government departments or representative thereof.
In the case of objection to the public disclosure of any information filed by or elicited from any United States Government department or agency, or representative thereof, under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the department or agency making such objection shall be exempted from the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section insofar as said paragraphs require the filing of a written objection to such disclosure. However, any department, agency, or representative thereof may, if it so desires, file a memorandum setting forth the reasons why it is claimed that a public disclosure of the information should not be made. If such a memorandum is submitted, it shall be filed and handled as is provided by this section in the case of a motion to withhold information from public disclosure.
§ 302.13
Consolidation of proceedings.
(a)
Initiation of consolidations.
The Department, upon its own initiative or upon motion, may consolidate for hearing or for other purposes or may contemporaneously consider two or more proceedings that involve substantially the same parties, or issues that are the same or closely related, if it finds that such consolidation or contemporaneous consideration will be conducive to the proper dispatch of its business and to the ends of justice and will not unduly delay the proceedings. Although the Department may, in any particular case, consolidate or contemporaneously consider two or more proceedings on its own motion, the burden of seeking consolidation or contemporaneous consideration of a particular application shall rest upon the applicant and the Department will not undertake to search its docket for all applications that might be consolidated or contemporaneously considered.
(b)
Time for filing.
Unless the Department has provided otherwise in a particular proceeding, a motion to consolidate or contemporaneously consider an application with any other application shall be filed within 21 days of the original application in the case of international route awards under section 41102 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII
(
see
§ 302.212), or, where a proceeding has been set for hearing before an administrative law judge, not later than the prehearing conference in the proceeding with which consolidation or contemporaneous consideration is requested. If made at such conference, the motion may be oral. All motions for consolidation or consideration of issues that enlarge, expand, or otherwise change the nature of the proceeding shall be addressed to the DOT decisionmaker, unless made orally at the prehearing conference, in which event the presiding administrative law judge shall present such motion to the DOT decisionmaker for his or her decision. A motion that is not timely filed, or that does not relate to an application pending at such time, shall be dismissed unless the movant shall clearly show good cause for failure to file such motion or application on time.
(c)
Answer.
If a motion to consolidate two or more proceedings is filed with the Department, any party to any of such proceedings, or any person who has a petition for intervention pending, may file an answer to such motion within such period as the DOT decisionmaker may permit. The administrative law judge may require that answers to such motions be stated orally at the prehearing conference in the proceeding with which the consolidation is proposed.
§ 302.14
Petitions for reconsideration.
(a)
Department orders subject to reconsideration; time for filing.
(1) Unless an order or a rule of the Department specifically provides otherwise:
(i) Any interested person may file a petition for reconsideration of any interlocutory order issued by the Department that institutes a proceeding; and
(ii) Any party to a proceeding may file a petition for reconsideration, rehearing, or reargument of final orders issued by the Department (
See
§ 302.38), or an interlocutory order that defines the scope and issues of a proceeding or suspends a provision of a tariff on file with the Department.
(2) Unless otherwise provided, petitions for reconsideration shall be filed, in the case of a final order, within twenty (20) days after service thereof, and, in the case of an interlocutory order, within ten (10) days after service. However, neither the filing nor the granting of such a petition shall operate as a stay of such final or interlocutory order unless specifically so ordered by the DOT decisionmaker. Within ten (10) days after a petition for reconsideration, rehearing, or reargument is filed, any party to the proceeding may file an answer in support of or in opposition. Motions for extension of time to file a petition or answer, and for leave to file a petition or answer after the time for the filing has expired, will not be granted except on a showing of unusual and exceptional circumstances, constituting good cause for the movant's inability to meet the established procedural dates.
(b)
Contents of petition.
A petition for reconsideration, rehearing, or reargument shall state, briefly and specifically, the matters of record alleged to have been erroneously decided, the ground relied upon, and the relief sought. If a decision by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary is requested, the petition should describe in detail the reasons for such request and specify any important national transportation policy issues that are presented. If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on allegations as to the consequences that would result from the final order, the basis of such allegations shall be set forth. If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on new matter, such new matter shall be set forth, accompanied by a statement to the effect that petitioner, with due diligence, could not have known or discovered such new matter prior to the date the case was submitted for decision. Unless otherwise directed by the DOT decisionmaker upon a showing of unusual or exceptional circumstances, petitions for reconsideration, rehearing or reargument or answers thereto that exceed twenty-five (25) pages (including appendices) in length shall not be accepted for filing by Department of Transportation Dockets.
(c)
Successive petitions.
A successive petition for rehearing, reargument, reconsideration filed by the same party or person, and upon substantially the same ground as a former petition that has been considered or denied will not be entertained.

# Non-Hearing Proceedings
§ 302.15
Non-hearing procedures.
In cases where oral evidentiary hearing procedures will not be used, § 302.17 through § 302.37, relating to hearing procedures, shall not be applicable except to the extent that the DOT decisionmaker shall determine that the application of some or all of such rules in the particular case will be conducive to the proper dispatch of its business and to the public interest. References in these and other sections of this part to powers or actions by administrative law judges shall not apply.

# Rulemaking Proceedings
§ 302.16
Petitions for rulemaking.
Any interested person may petition the Department for the issuance, amendment, modification, or repeal of any regulation or guidance document, subject to the provisions of 49 CFR 5.3.
[86 FR 17294, Apr. 2, 2021]

# Oral Evidentiary Hearing Proceedings
§ 302.17
Administrative law judges.
(a)
Powers and delegation of authority.
(1) An administrative law judge shall have the following powers, in addition to any others specified in this part:
(i) To give notice concerning and to hold hearings;
(ii) To administer oaths and affirmations;
(iii) To examine witnesses;
(iv) To issue subpoenas and to take or cause depositions to be taken;
(v) To rule upon offers of proof and to receive relevant evidence;
(vi) To regulate the course and conduct of the hearing;
(vii) To hold conferences before or during the hearing for the settlement or simplification of issues;
(viii) To rule on motions and to dispose of procedural requests or similar matters;
(ix) To make initial or recommended decisions as provided in § 302.31;
(x) To take any other action authorized by this part or by the Statute.
(2) The administrative law judge shall have the power to take any other action authorized by part 385 of this chapter or by the Administrative Procedure Act.
(3) The administrative law judge assigned to a particular case is delegated the DOT decisionmaker's function of making the agency decision on the substantive and procedural issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing in such case, except that this delegation does not apply in cases where the record is certified to the DOT decisionmaker, with or without an initial or recommended decision by the administrative law judge, or in cases requiring Presidential approval under section 41307 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII. This delegation does not apply to the review of rulings by the administrative law judge on interlocutory matters that have been appealed to the DOT decisionmaker in accordance with the requirements of § 302.11.
(4) The administrative law judge's authority in each case will terminate either upon the certification of the record in the proceeding to the DOT decisionmaker, or upon the issuance of an initial or recommended decision, or when he or she shall have withdrawn from the case upon considering himself or herself disqualified.
(b)
Disqualification.
An administrative law judge shall withdraw from the case if at any time he or she deems himself or herself disqualified. If, prior to the initial or recommended decision in the case, there is filed with the administrative law judge, in good faith, an affidavit of personal bias or disqualification with substantiating facts and the administrative law judge does not withdraw, the DOT decisionmaker shall determine the matter, if properly presented by exception or brief, as a part of the record and decision in the case. The DOT decisionmaker shall not otherwise consider any claim of bias or disqualification. The DOT decisionmaker, in his or her discretion, may order a hearing on a charge of bias or disqualification.
§ 302.18
DOT decisionmaker.
(a)
Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs is the DOT decisionmaker. The Assistant
Secretary shall have all of the powers set forth in § 302.17(a)(1) and those additional powers delegated by the Secretary. The Assistant Secretary may delegate this authority in appropriate non-hearing cases to subordinate officials.
(b)
Oral hearing cases assigned to the senior career official.
Carrier selection proceedings for international route authority that are set for oral hearing and such other oral hearing cases as the Secretary deems appropriate will be assigned to the senior career official in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, who will serve as the DOT decisionmaker. In all such cases, the administrative law judge shall render a recommended decision to the senior career official, who shall have all of the powers set forth in § 302.17(a)(1) and those additional powers delegated by the Secretary.
(1) Decisions of the senior career official are subject to review by, and at the discretion of, the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs. Petitions for discretionary review of decisions of the senior career official will not be entertained. A notice of review by the Assistant Secretary will establish the procedures for review. Unless a notice of review is issued, the decision of the senior career official will be issued as a final decision of the Department and will be served fourteen (14) days after it is adopted by the senior career official.
(2) Final decisions of the senior career official may be reviewed upon a petition for reconsideration filed pursuant to § 302.14. Such a petition shall state clearly the basis for requesting reconsideration and shall specify any questions of national transportation policy that may be involved. The Assistant Secretary will either grant or deny the petition.
(3) Upon review or reconsideration, the Assistant Secretary may either affirm the decision or remand the decision to the senior career official for further action consistent with such order of remand.
(4) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, final decisions of the senior career official will be transmitted to the President of the United States when required under 49 U.S.C. 41307.
(c)
Secretary and Deputy Secretary.
The Secretary or Deputy Secretary may exercise any authority of the Assistant Secretary whenever he or she believes a decision involves important questions of national transportation policy.
§ 302.19
Participation by persons not parties.
Any person, including any State, subdivision thereof, State aviation commission, or other public body, may appear at any hearing, other than in an enforcement proceeding, and present any evidence that is relevant to the issues. With the consent of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, such person may also cross-examine witnesses directly. Such persons may also present to the administrative law judge a written statement on the issues involved in the proceeding. Such written statements shall be filed and served on all parties prior to the close of the hearing.
§ 302.20
Formal intervention.
(a)
Who may intervene.
Any person who has a statutory right to be made a party to an oral evidentiary hearing proceeding shall be permitted to intervene. Any person whose intervention will be conducive to the public interest and will not unduly delay the conduct of such proceeding may be permitted to intervene.
(b)
Considerations relevant to determination of petition to intervene.
In passing upon a petition to intervene, the following factors, among other things, will be considered and will be liberally interpreted to facilitate the effective participation by members of the public in Department proceedings:
(1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the statute to be made a party to the proceeding;
(2) The nature and extent of the property, financial or other interest of the petitioner;
(3) The effect of the order that may be entered in the proceeding on petitioner's interest;
(4) The availability of other means whereby the petitioner's interest may be protected;
(5) The extent to which petitioner's interest will be represented by existing parties;
(6) The extent to which petitioner's participation may reasonably be expected to assist in the development of a sound record; and
(7) The extent to which participation of the petitioner will broaden the issues or delay the proceeding.
(c)
Petition to intervene
—(1)
Contents.
Any person desiring to intervene in a proceeding shall file a petition in conformity with this part setting forth the facts and reasons why he or she thinks he or she should be permitted to intervene. The petition should make specific reference to the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Time for filing.
Unless otherwise ordered by the Department:
(i) A petition to intervene shall be filed with the Department prior to the first prehearing conference, or, in the event that no such conference is to be held, not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing.
(ii) A petition to intervene filed by a city, other public body, or a chamber of commerce shall be filed with the Department not later than the last day prior to the beginning of the hearing.
(iii) A petition to intervene that is not timely filed shall be dismissed unless the petitioner shall clearly show good cause for his or her failure to file such petition on time.
(3)
Answer.
Any party to a proceeding may file an answer to a petition to intervene, making specific reference to the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, within seven (7) days after the petition is filed.
(4)
Disposition.
The decision granting, denying or otherwise ruling on any petition to intervene may be issued without receiving testimony or oral argument either from the petitioner or other parties to the proceeding.
(d)
Effect of granting intervention.
A person permitted to intervene in a proceeding thereby becomes a party to the proceeding. However, interventions provided for in this section are for administrative purposes only, and no decision granting leave to intervene shall be deemed to constitute an expression by the Department that the intervening party has such a substantial interest in the order that is to be entered in the proceeding as will entitle it to judicial review of such order.
§ 302.21
Appearances.
(a) Any party to a proceeding may appear and be heard in person or by a designated representative.
(b) No register of persons who may practice before the Department is maintained and no application for admission to practice is required.
(c) Any person practicing or desiring to practice before the Department may, upon hearing and good cause shown, be suspended or barred from practicing.
§ 302.22
Prehearing conference.
(a)
Purpose and scope of conference.
At the discretion of the administrative law judge, a prehearing conference may be called prior to any hearing. Written notice of the prehearing conference shall be sent by the administrative law judge to all parties to a proceeding and to other persons who appear to have an interest in such proceeding. The purpose of such a conference is to define the issues and the scope of the proceeding, to secure statements of the positions of the parties and amendments to the pleadings, to schedule the exchange of exhibits before the date set for hearing, and to arrive at such agreements as will aid in the conduct and disposition of the proceeding. For example, consideration will be given to:
(1) Matters that the DOT decisionmaker can consider without the necessity of proof;
(2) Admissions of fact and of the genuineness of documents;
(3) Requests for documents;
(4) Admissibility of evidence;
(5) Limitation of the number of witnesses;
(6) Reducing of oral testimony to exhibit form;
(7) Procedure at the hearing; and
(8) Use of electronic media as a basis for exchange of briefs, hearing transcripts and exhibits, etc., in addition to the official record copy.
(b)
Actions during prehearing conference.
The administrative law judge may require a further conference, or responsive pleadings, or both. If a
party refuses to produce documents requested by another party at the conference, the administrative law judge may compel the production of such documents prior to a hearing by subpoena issued in accordance with the provisions of § 302.25 as though at a hearing. Applications for the production prior to hearing of documents in the Department's possession shall be addressed to the administrative law judge, in accordance with the provisions of § 302.25(g), in the same manner as provided therein for production of documents at a hearing. The administrative law judge may also, on his or her own initiative or on motion of any party, direct any party to the proceeding (air carrier or non-air carrier) to prepare and submit exhibits setting forth studies, forecasts, or estimates on matters relevant to the issues in the proceeding.
(c)
Report of prehearing conference.
The administrative law judge shall issue a report of prehearing conference, defining the issues, giving an account of the results of the conference, specifying a schedule for the exchange of exhibits and rebuttal exhibits, the date of hearing, and specifying a time for the filing of objections to such report. The report shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding and any person who appeared at the conference. Objections to the report may be filed by any interested person within the time specified therein. The administrative law judge may revise his or her report in the light of the objections presented. The revised report, if any, shall be served upon the same persons as was the original report. Exceptions may be taken on the basis of any timely written objection that has not been met by a revision of the report if the exceptions are filed within the time specified in the revised report. Such report shall constitute the official account of the conference and shall control the subsequent course of the proceeding, but it may be reconsidered and modified at any time to protect the public interest or to prevent injustice.
§ 302.23
Hearing.
The administrative law judge to whom the case is assigned or the DOT decisionmaker shall give the parties reasonable notice of a hearing or of the change in the date and place of a hearing and the nature of such hearing.
§ 302.24
Evidence.
(a)
Presenting evidence.
Presenting evidence at the hearing shall be limited to material evidence relevant to the issues as drawn by the pleadings or as defined in the report of prehearing conference, subject to such later modifications of the issues as may be necessary to protect the public interest or to prevent injustice, and shall not be unduly repetitious. Evidence shall be presented in such form by all parties as the administrative law judge may direct.
(b)
Objections to evidence.
Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections relied upon, and the transcript shall not include argument or debate except as ordered by the administrative law judge. Rulings on such objections shall be a part of the transcript.
(c)
Exhibits.
When exhibits are offered in evidence, one copy must be furnished to each of the parties at the hearing, and two copies to the administrative law judge, unless the parties previously have been furnished with copies or the administrative law judge directs otherwise. If the administrative law judge has not fixed a time for the exchange of exhibits, the parties shall exchange copies of exhibits at the earliest practicable time, preferably before the hearing or, at the latest, at the commencement of the hearing. Copies of exhibits may, at the discretion of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, be furnished by use of electronic media in lieu of or in addition to a paper record copy.
(d)
Substitution of copies for original exhibits.
In his or her discretion, the administrative law judge may permit a party to withdraw original documents offered in evidence and substitute true copies in lieu thereof.
(e)
Designation of parts of documents.
When relevant and material matter offered in evidence by any party is embraced in a book, paper, or document containing other matter not material or relevant, the party offering the
same shall plainly designate the matter so offered. The immaterial and irrelevant parts shall be excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable. If the volume of immaterial or irrelevant matter would unduly encumber the record, such submission will not be received in evidence, but may be marked for identification, and, if properly authenticated, the relevant or material matter may be read into the record, or, if the administrative law judge so directs, a true copy of such matter, in proper form, shall be received as an exhibit, and like copies delivered by the party offering the same to opposing parties or their attorneys appearing at the hearing, who shall be afforded an opportunity to examine the submission, and to offer in evidence in like manner other portions of the exhibit.
(f)
Records in other proceedings.
In case any portion of the record in any other proceeding or civil or criminal action is offered in evidence, a true copy of such portion shall be presented for the record in the form of an exhibit unless:
(1) The portion is specified with particularity in such manner as to be readily identified;
(2) The party offering the same agrees unconditionally to supply such copies later, or when required by the DOT decisionmaker;
(3) The parties represented at the hearing stipulate upon the record that such portion may be incorporated by reference, and that any portion offered by any other party may be incorporated by like reference upon compliance with paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section; and
(4) The administrative law judge directs such incorporation or waives the requirement in paragraph (f)(3) of this section with the consent of the parties.
(g)
Official notice of facts contained in certain documents.
(1) Without limiting, in any manner or to any extent, the discretionary powers of the DOT decisionmaker and the administrative law judge to notice other matters or documents properly the subject of official notice, facts contained in any document within the categories enumerated in this subdivision are officially noticed in all formal economic proceedings except those subject to subpart D of this part. Each such category shall include any document antedating the final Department decision in the proceeding where such notice is taken. The matters officially noticed under the provisions of this paragraph are:
(i) Air carrier certificates or applications therefor, together with any requests for amendment, and pleadings responding to applications when properly filed.
(ii) All Form 41 reports required to be filed by air carriers with the Department.
(iii) Reports of Traffic and Financial Data of all U.S. Air Carriers issued by the Department or by its predecessor.

§ 302.25
Subpoenas.
(a) An application for a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a hearing or the production of documentary evidence may be made without notice by any party to the administrative law judge or, in the event that an administrative law judge has not been assigned to a proceeding or is not available, to the DOT decisionmaker or the Chief Administrative Law Judge, for action.
(b) An application for a subpoena shall be in duplicate except that if it is made during the course of a hearing, it may be made orally on the record with the consent of the administrative law judge.
(c) All such applications, whether written or oral, shall contain a statement or showing of general relevance
and reasonable scope of the evidence sought, and shall be accompanied by two copies of a draft of the subpoena sought that, in the case of evidence, shall describe the documentary or tangible evidence to be subpoenaed with as much particularity as is feasible, or, in the case of a witness, the name of the witness and a general description of the matters concerning which the witness will be asked to testify.
(d) The administrative law judge or DOT decisionmaker considering any application for a subpoena shall issue the subpoena requested if the application complies with this section. No attempt shall be made to determine the admissibility of evidence in passing upon an application for a subpoena, and no detailed or burdensome showing shall be required as a condition to the issuance of a subpoena.
(e) Where it appears during the course of a proceeding that the testimony of a witness or documentary evidence is relevant to the issues in a proceeding, the administrative law judge, Chief Administrative Law Judge or DOT decisionmaker may issue on his or her own initiative a subpoena requiring such witness to attend and testify or requiring the production of such documentary evidence.
(f) Subpoenas issued under this section shall be served upon the person to whom directed in accordance with § 302.7(b). Any person upon whom a subpoena is served may within seven (7) days after service or at any time prior to the return date thereof, whichever is earlier, file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena with the administrative law judge or, in the event an administrative law judge has not been assigned to a proceeding or is not available, to the DOT decisionmaker or the Chief Administrative Law Judge for action. If the person to whom the motion to modify or quash the subpoena has been addressed or directed, has not acted upon such a motion by the return date, such date shall be stayed pending his or her final action thereon. The DOT decisionmaker may at any time review, upon his or her own initiative, the ruling of an administrative law judge or the Chief Administrative Law Judge denying a motion to quash a subpoena. In such cases, the DOT decisionmaker may order that the return date of a subpoena be stayed pending action thereon.
(g) The provisions of this section are not applicable to the attendance of DOT employees or the production of documentary evidence in the custody thereof at a hearing. The attendance of DOT employees and the production of documentary evidence in their custody are governed by 49 CFR Parts 9 and 7, respectively.
§ 302.26
Depositions.
(a) For good cause shown, the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge assigned to a proceeding may order that the testimony of a witness be taken by deposition and that the witness produce documentary evidence in connection with such testimony. Ordinarily an order to take the deposition of a witness will be entered only if:
(1) The person whose deposition is to be taken would be unavailable at the hearing,
(2) The deposition is deemed necessary to perpetuate the testimony of the witness, or
(3) The taking of the deposition is necessary to prevent undue and excessive expense to a party and will not result in an undue burden to other parties or in undue delay.
(b) Any party desiring to take the deposition of a witness shall make application therefor in duplicate to the administrative law judge or, in the event that an administrative law judge has not been assigned to a proceeding or is not available, to the DOT decisionmaker or Chief Administrative Law Judge, setting forth the reasons why such deposition should be taken, the name and residence of the witness, the time and place proposed for the taking of the deposition, and a general description of the matters concerning which the witness will be asked to testify. If good cause be shown, the administrative law judge, the DOT decisionmaker, or the Chief Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, may, in his or her discretion, issue an order authorizing such deposition and specifying the witness whose deposition is to be taken, the general scope of the testimony to be taken, the time when,
the place where, the designated officer (authorized to take oaths) before whom the witness is to testify, and the number of copies of the deposition to be supplied. Such order shall be served upon all parties by the person proposing to take the deposition a reasonable period in advance of the time fixed for taking testimony.
(c) Witnesses whose testimony is taken by deposition shall be sworn or shall affirm before any questions are put to them. Each question shall be recorded and the answers shall be taken down in the words of the witness.
(d) Objections to questions or evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied upon, but no transcript filed by the designated officer shall include argument or debate. Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the designated officer upon the deposition, but he or she shall not have power to decide on the competency or materiality or relevance of evidence, and he or she shall record the evidence subject to objection. Objections to questions or evidence not made before the designated officer shall not be deemed waived unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.
(e) The testimony shall be reduced to writing by the designated officer, or under his or her direction, after which the deposition shall be signed by the witness unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign, and certified in usual form by the designated officer. If the deposition is not signed by the witness, the designated officer shall state on the record this fact and the reason therefor. The original deposition and exhibits shall be forwarded to Department of Transportation Dockets and shall be filed in the proceedings.
(f) Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by oral examination. Ordinarily such procedure will be authorized only if necessary to achieve the purposes of an oral deposition and to serve the balance of convenience of the parties. The interrogatories shall be filed in quadruplicate with two copies of the application and a copy of each shall be served on each party. Within seven (7) days after service any party may file with the person to whom application was made two copies of his or her objections, if any, to such interrogatories and may file such cross-interrogatories as he or she desires to submit. Cross-interrogatories shall be filed in quadruplicate, and a copy thereof together with a copy of any objections to interrogatories, shall be served on each party, who shall have five (5) days thereafter to file and serve his or her objections, if any, to such cross-interrogatories. Objections to interrogatories or cross-interrogatories, shall be served on the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge considering the application. Objections to interrogatories shall be made before the order for taking the deposition issues and if not so made shall be deemed waived. When a deposition is taken upon written interrogatories, and cross-interrogatories, no party shall be present or represented, and no person other than the witness, a reporter, and the designated officer shall be present at the examination of the witness, which fact shall be certified by the designated officer, who shall ask the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to the witness in their order and reduce the testimony to writing in the witness's own words. The provisions of paragraph (e) of this section shall be applicable to depositions taken in accordance with this paragraph.
(g) All depositions shall conform to the specifications of § 302.3 except that the filing of three copies thereof shall be sufficient. Any fees of a witness, the reporter, or the officer designated to take the deposition shall be paid by the person at whose instance the deposition is taken.
(h) The fact that a deposition is taken and filed in a proceeding as provided in this section does not constitute a determination that it is admissible in evidence or that it may be used in the proceeding. Only such part or the whole of a deposition as is received in evidence shall constitute a part of the record in such proceeding upon which a decision may be based.
§ 302.27
Rights of witnesses; attendance fees and mileage.
(a) Any person appearing as a witness in any proceeding governed by this part, whether in response to a subpoena or by request or permission of the Department, may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel and may be examined by that counsel after other questioning.
(b) Any person who submits data or evidence in a proceeding governed by this part, whether in response to a subpoena or by request or permission of the Department, may retain, or, on payment of lawfully prescribed costs, procure, a copy of any document so submitted or a copy of any transcript made of such testimony.
(c) No person whose attendance at a hearing or whose deposition is to be taken shall be obliged to respond to a subpoena unless upon a service of the subpoena he or she is tendered attendance fees and mileage by the party at whose instance he or she is called in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section;
Provided,
That a witness summoned at the instance of the Department or one of its employees, or a salaried employee of the United States summoned to testify as to matters related to his or her public employment, need not be tendered such fees or mileage at that time.
(1) Witnesses who are not salaried employees of the United States, or such employees summoned to testify on matters not related to their public employment, shall be paid the same per diem, subsistence, and mileage fees paid to witnesses for like service in the courts of the United States that are in effect at the time of travel;
Provided,
That no employee, officer, or attorney of an air carrier who travels under the free or reduced rate provisions of section 41511 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII shall be entitled to any fees or mileage;
And provided further,
That such fees and mileage shall not be applicable for witnesses summoned to testify in Alaska, and that, in Alaska, where permitted by section 41511 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, the witness may, at his or her option, accept a pass for travel by air. Such witnesses shall be furnished appropriate forms and instructions for the submission of claims for attendance fees, subsistence, and mileage from the Government before the close of the proceedings that they are required to attend. Only persons summoned by subpoena shall be entitled to claim attendance fees, subsistence, or mileage from the Government.
(2) Witnesses who are salaried employees of the United States and who are summoned to testify on matters relating to their public employment, irrespective of at whose instance they are summoned, shall be paid in accordance with applicable Government regulations.
§ 302.28
Transcripts of hearings.
(a) Hearings shall be recorded and transcribed under supervision of the administrative law judge, by a reporting firm under contract with the Department. Copies of the transcript that may, at the discretion of the administrative law judge, be furnished by use of electronic media in addition to the official copy, shall be supplied to the parties to the proceeding by said reporting firm, at the contract price for copies.
(b) The administrative law judge shall determine whether “ordinary transcript” or “daily transcript” (as those terms are defined in the contract) will be necessary and required for the proper conduct of the proceeding and the Department will pay the reporting firm the cost of reporting its proceedings at the contract price for such type of transcript. If the administrative law judge has determined that ordinary transcript is adequate, and has notified the parties of such determination (in the notice of hearings, or otherwise), then any party may request reconsideration of such determination and that daily transcript be required. In determining what is necessary and required for the proper conduct of the proceeding, the administrative law judge shall consider, among other things:
(1) The nature of the proceeding itself;
(2) The DOT decisionmaker's needs as well as the reasonable needs of the parties;
(3) The cost to the Department; and
(4) The requirements of a fair hearing.
(c) If the administrative law judge has determined that ordinary transcript is adequate, or, upon reconsideration, has adhered to such determination, then any party may request the reporting firm to provide daily transcript. In that case, pursuant to its contract with the Department, the reporting firm will be obligated to furnish to the Department daily transcript upon the agreement by the requesting party to pay to the reporting firm an amount equal to the difference between the contract prices for ordinary transcript and daily transcript, provided that the requesting party makes such agreement with the reporting firm at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the date for which such transcript is requested.
(d) Any party may obtain from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration, the name and address of the private reporting company with which the Department currently has a contract for transcripts and copies, as well as the contract prices then in effect for such services.
(e) Copies of transcripts ordered by parties other than the Department shall be prepared for delivery to the requesting person at the reporting firm's place of business, within the stated time for the type of transcript ordered. The requesting party and the reporting firm may agree upon some other form or means of delivery (mail, messenger, electronic media, etc.) and the reporting firm may charge for such special service, provided that such charge shall not exceed the reasonable cost of such service.
(f) Changes in the official transcript may be made only when they involve errors affecting substance. A motion to correct a transcript shall be filed with Department of Transportation Dockets, within ten (10) days after receipt of the completed transcript by the Department. If no objections to the motion are filed within ten (10) days thereafter, the transcript may, upon the approval of the administrative law judge, be changed to reflect such corrections. If objections are received, the motion and objections shall be submitted to the official reporter by the administrative law judge together with a request for a comparison of the transcript with the reporter's record of the hearing. After receipt of the report of the official reporter an order shall be entered by the administrative law judge settling the record and ruling on the motion.
§ 302.29
Argument before the administrative law judge.
(a) The administrative law judge shall give the parties to the proceeding adequate opportunity during the course of the hearing for the presentation of arguments in support of or in opposition to motions, and objections and exceptions to rulings of the administrative law judge.
(b) When, in the opinion of the administrative law judge, the volume of the evidence or the importance or complexity of the issues involved warrants, he or she may, either on his or her own motion or at the request of a party, permit the presentation of oral argument, and may impose such time limits on the argument as he or she may determine appropriate. Such argument shall be transcribed and bound with the transcript of testimony and will be available to the Department decisionmaker for consideration in deciding the case.
§ 302.30
Briefs to the administrative law judge.
Within such limited time after the close of the reception of evidence fixed by the administrative law judge, any party may, upon request and under such conditions as the administrative law judge may prescribe, file for his or her consideration briefs which may include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law that shall contain exact references to the record and authorities relied upon.
§ 302.31
Initial and recommended decisions; certification of the record.
(a)
Action by administrative law judge after hearing.
Except where the DOT decisionmaker directs otherwise, after the taking of evidence and the receipt of briefs which may include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, if any, the administrative law judge shall take the following action:
(1)
Initial decision.
If the proceeding does not involve foreign air transportation, the administrative law judge shall render an “initial decision.” Such decision shall encompass the administrative law judge's decision on the merits of the proceeding and on all ancillary procedural issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing.
(2)
Recommended decision.
In cases where the action of the Department involves foreign air transportation and is subject to review by the President of the United States pursuant to section 41307 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, the administrative law judge shall render a “recommended decision.” Such decision shall encompass the administrative law judge's decision on the merits of the proceeding and on all ancillary procedural issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing.
(b)
Certification to the DOT decisionmaker for decision.
At any time prior to the close of the hearing, the DOT decisionmaker may direct the administrative law judge to certify any question or the entire record in the proceeding to the DOT decisionmaker for decision. In cases where the record is thus certified, the administrative law judge shall not render a decision but shall make a recommendation to the DOT decisionmaker as required by section 8(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 558(a)) unless advised by the DOT decisionmaker that he or she intends to issue a tentative decision.
(c) Every initial or recommended decision issued shall state the names of the persons who are to be served with copies of it, the time within which exceptions to, or petitions for review of, such decision may be filed, and the time within which briefs in support of the exceptions may be filed. In addition, every such decision shall recite that it is made under delegated authority, and contain notice of the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. In the event the administrative law judge certifies the record to the DOT decisionmaker without an initial or recommended decision, he or she shall notify the parties of the time within which to file with the DOT decisionmaker briefs which may include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
(d) Unless a petition for discretionary review is filed pursuant to § 302.32, exceptions are filed pursuant to § 302.217, or the DOT decisionmaker issues an order to review upon his or her own initiative, the initial decision shall become effective as the final order of the Department thirty (30) days after service thereof; in the case of a recommended decision, that decision shall be transmitted to the President of the United States under 49 U.S.C. 41307. If a petition for discretionary review or exceptions are timely filed or action to review is taken by the DOT decisionmaker upon his or her own initiative, the effectiveness of the initial decision or the transmission of the recommended decision is stayed until the further order of the DOT decisionmaker.
§ 302.32
Petitions for discretionary review of initial or recommended decisions; review proceedings.
(a)
Petitions for discretionary review.
(1) Review by the DOT decisionmaker pursuant to this section is not a matter of right but is at the sole discretion of the DOT decisionmaker. Any party may file and serve a petition for discretionary review by the DOT decisionmaker of an initial decision or recommended decision within twenty-one (21) days after service thereof, unless the DOT decisionmaker sets a different period for filing.
(2) Petitions for discretionary review shall be filed only upon one or more of the following grounds:
(i) A finding of a material fact is erroneous;
(ii) A necessary legal conclusion is without governing precedent or is a departure from or contrary to law, the Department's rules, or precedent;
(iii) A substantial and important question of law, policy or discretion is involved; or
(iv) A prejudicial procedural error has occurred.
(3) Each issue shall be separately numbered and plainly and concisely stated. Petitioners shall not restate the same point in repetitive discussions of an issue. Each issue shall be supported by detailed citations of the record when objections are based on the record, and by statutes, regulations
or principal authorities relied upon. Any matters of fact or law not argued before the administrative law judge, but that the petitioner proposes to argue on brief to the DOT decisionmaker, shall be stated.
(4) Petitions for discretionary review shall be self-contained and shall not incorporate by reference any part of another document. Except by permission of the DOT decisionmaker, petitions shall not exceed twenty (20) pages including appendices and other papers physically attached to the petition.
(5) Requests for oral argument on petitions for discretionary review will not be entertained by the DOT decisionmaker.
(b)
Answers.
Within fifteen (15) days after service of a petition for discretionary review, any party may file and serve an answer of not more than fifteen (15) pages in support of or in opposition to the petition. If any party desires to answer more than one petition for discretionary review in the same proceeding, he or she shall do so in a single document of not more than twenty (20) pages.
(c)
Orders declining review.
The DOT decisionmaker's order declining to exercise the discretionary right of review will specify the date upon which the administrative law judge's decision shall become effective as the final decision of the Department. A petition for reconsideration of a Department order declining review will be entertained only when the order exercises, in part, the DOT decisionmaker's discretionary right of review, and such petition shall be limited to the single question of whether any issue designated for review and any issue not so designated are so inseparably interrelated that the former cannot be reviewed independently or that the latter cannot be made effective before the final decision of the Department in the review proceeding.
(d)
Review proceedings.
(1) The DOT decisionmaker may take review of an initial or recommended decision upon petition or on his or her own initiative or both. The DOT decisionmaker will issue a final order upon such review without further proceedings on any or all the issues where he or she finds that matters raised do not warrant further proceedings.
(2) Where the DOT decisionmaker desires further proceedings, he or she will issue an order for review that will:
(i) Specify the issues to which review will be limited. Only those issues specified in the order shall be argued on brief to the DOT decisionmaker, pursuant to § 302.35, and considered by the DOT decisionmaker;
(ii) Specify the portions of the administrative law judge's decision, if any, that are to be stayed as well as the effective date of the remaining portions thereof; and
(iii) Designate the parties to the review proceeding.
§ 302.33
Tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whenever the administrative law judge certifies the record in a proceeding directly to the DOT decisionmaker without issuing an initial or recommended decision in the matter, the DOT decisionmaker shall, after consideration of any briefs submitted by the parties, prepare a tentative decision and serve it upon the parties. Every tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker shall state the names of the persons who are to receive copies of it, the time within which exceptions to such decision and briefs, if any, in support of or in opposition to the exceptions may be filed, and the date when such decision will become final in the absence of exceptions thereto. If no exceptions are filed to the tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker within the period fixed, it shall become final at the expiration of such period unless the DOT decisionmaker orders otherwise.
(b) The DOT decisionmaker may, in his or her discretion, omit a tentative decision in proceedings under subpart B. Final decisions of the DOT decisionmaker are subject to review as provided in § 302.18.
§ 302.34
Exceptions to tentative decisions of the DOT decisionmaker.
(a)
Time for filing.
Within ten (10) days after service of any tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker, any
party to a proceeding may file exceptions to such decision with the DOT decisionmaker.
(b)
Form and contents of exceptions.
Each exception shall be separately numbered and shall be stated as a separate point, and appellants shall not restate the same point in several exceptions. Each exception shall state, sufficiently identify, and be limited to, an ultimate conclusion in the decision to which exception is taken (such as, selection of one carrier rather than another to serve any point or points; points included in or excluded from a new route; imposition or failure to impose a given restriction; determination of a rate at a given amount rather than another). No specific exception shall be taken with respect to underlying findings or statements, but exceptions to an ultimate conclusion shall be deemed to include exceptions to all underlying findings and statements pertaining thereto;
Provided, however,
That exceptions shall specify any matters of law, fact, or policy that were not argued before the administrative law judge but will be set forth for the first time on brief to the DOT decisionmaker.
(c)
Effect of failure to file timely and adequate exceptions.
No objection may be made on brief or at a later time to an ultimate conclusion that is not expressly made the subject of an exception in compliance with the provisions of this section;
Provided, however,
That any party may file a brief in support of the decision and in opposition to the exceptions filed by any other party.
§ 302.35
Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker.
(a)
Time for filing.
Within such period after the date of service of any tentative decision by the DOT decisionmaker as may be fixed therein, any party may file a brief addressed to the DOT decisionmaker in support of his or her exceptions to such decision or in opposition to the exceptions filed by any other party. Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker on initial or recommended decisions of administrative law judges shall be filed only in those cases where the DOT decisionmaker grants discretionary review and orders further proceedings, pursuant to § 302.32(d)(2), and only upon those issues specified in the order. Such briefs shall be filed within thirty (30) days after date of service of the order granting discretionary review unless otherwise specified in the order. In cases where, because of the limited number of parties and the nature of the issues, the filing of opening, answering, and reply briefs will not unduly delay the proceeding and will assist in its proper disposition, the DOT decisionmaker may direct that the parties file briefs at different times rather than at the same time.
(b)
Effect of failure to restate objections in briefs.
In determining the merits of an appeal, the DOT decisionmaker will not consider the exceptions or the petition for discretionary review but will consider only the brief. Each objection contained in the exceptions or each issue specified in the DOT decisionmaker's order exercising discretionary review must be restated and supported by a statement and adequate discussion of all matters relied upon, in a brief filed pursuant to and in compliance with the requirements of this section.
(c)
Formal specifications of briefs
—(1)
Contents.
Each brief shall discuss every point of law, fact, or precedent that the party submitting it is entitled to raise and that it wishes the DOT decisionmaker to consider. Each brief shall include a summary of the argument not to exceed five (5) pages. Support and justification for every point raised shall include itemized references to the pages of the transcript of hearing, exhibit or other matter of record, and citations of the statutes, regulations, or principal authorities relied upon. If a brief or any point discussed in the brief is not in substantial conformity with the requirement for such support and justification, no motion to strike or dismiss such document shall be made but the DOT decisionmaker may disregard the points involved. Copies of briefs may be furnished by use of electronic media in a format acceptable to the Department and the parties.
(2)
Incorporation by reference.
Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker shall be completely self-contained and shall not incorporate by reference any portion of any other brief or pleading;
Provided, however,
That instead of submitting a brief to the DOT decisionmaker a party
may adopt by reference specifically identified pages or the whole of his or her prior brief to the administrative law judge if the latter complies with all requirements of this section. In such cases, the party shall file with Department of Transportation Dockets a letter exercising this privilege and serve all parties in the same manner as a brief to the DOT decisionmaker.
(3)
Length.
Except by permission or direction of the DOT decisionmaker, briefs shall not exceed fifty (50) pages including pages contained in any appendix, table, chart, or other document physically attached to the brief, but excluding maps and the summary of the argument. In this case “map” means only those pictorial representations of routes, flight paths, mileage, and similar ancillary data that are superimposed on geographic drawings and contain only such text as is needed to explain the pictorial representation.
§ 302.36
Oral argument before the DOT decisionmaker.
(a) If any party desires to argue a case orally before the DOT decisionmaker, he or she shall request leave to make such argument in his or her exceptions or brief. Such request shall be filed no later than the date when briefs before the DOT decisionmaker are due in the proceeding. The DOT decisionmaker will rule on such request, and, if oral argument is to be allowed, all parties to the proceeding will be advised of the date and hour set for such argument and the amount of time allowed to each party. Requests for oral argument on petitions for discretionary review will not be entertained.
(b) Pamphlets, charts, and other written data may be offered to the DOT decisionmaker at oral argument only in accordance with the following rules: All such material shall be limited to facts in the record of the case being argued and shall be served on all parties to the proceeding with four (4) copies transmitted to Department of Transportation Dockets at least five (5) calendar days in advance of the argument.
§ 302.37
Waiver of procedural steps after hearing.
The parties to any proceeding may agree to waive any one or more of the procedural steps provided in § 302.29 through § 302.36.
§ 302.38
Final decision of the DOT Decisionmaker.
When a case stands submitted to the DOT decisionmaker for final decision on the merits, he or she will dispose of the issues presented by entering an appropriate order that will include a statement of the reasons for his or her findings and conclusions. Such orders shall be deemed “final orders” within the purview of § 302.14(a), in the manner provided by § 302.18.

(a) Applications under this subpart will be decided on the basis of written submissions unless the DOT decisionmaker, on petition as provided in § 302.208 or on his or her own initiative, determines that an oral presentation or an administrative law judge's decision is required because:
(1) Use of written procedures will prejudice a party;
(2) Material issues of decisional fact cannot adequately be resolved without oral evidentiary hearing procedures; or
(3) Assignment of an application for oral evidentiary hearing procedures or an initial or recommended decision by an administrative law judge is otherwise required by the public interest.
(b) The standards employed in deciding cases under § 302.210(a)(1) or (5) shall be the same as the standards applied in cases decided under § 302.210(a)(4). These are the standards set forth in the Statute as interpreted and expanded upon under that Statute.
§ 302.208

(a) Any person may file a petition for oral evidentiary hearing, oral argument, an initial or recommended decision, or any combination of these.

Such petitions shall be supported by a detailed explanation of the following:
(1) Why the evidence or argument to be presented cannot be submitted in the form of written evidence or briefs;
(2) Which issues should be examined by an administrative law judge and why such issues should not be presented directly to the DOT decisionmaker for decision;

Filing of the information required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section may be deferred until the DOT decisionmaker has decided to hold a formal proceeding.

§ 302.209
Procedures for deferral of applications.
Within twenty-eight (28) days after the filing of an application under this subpart, the DOT decisionmaker may defer further processing of the application until all of the information necessary to process that application is submitted. The time periods contained in this subpart with respect to the disposition of the application shall not begin to run until the application is complete.

(2) Issue a Final Order granting the application if the DOT decisionmaker determines that there are no material issues of fact that warrant further procedures for their resolution.
(3) Issue a Final Order dismissing or rejecting the application for lack of prosecution or if the application does not comply with this subpart or is otherwise materially deficient.
(4) Issue an order setting the application for oral evidentiary hearing. The order will establish the scope of the issues to be considered and the procedures to be employed, and will indicate whether one or more attorneys from the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings will participate as a party. All of the procedures set forth in §§ 302.214 through 302.218 will apply unless the DOT decisionmaker decides otherwise.
(5) Begin to make a determination with respect to the application under simplified procedures without oral evidentiary hearing. In this event, the DOT decisionmaker may indicate which, if any, of the procedural steps set forth in §§ 302.215 through 302.219 will be employed. The DOT decisionmaker may also indicate that other non-oral evidentiary hearing procedures will be employed.
(b)
Additional evidence.
An order establishing further procedures under paragraph (a)(1), (4) or (5) of this section may provide for the filing of additional evidence.
(c)
Petitions for reconsideration.

Informal complaints.
Any person may submit in writing to the Assistant General Counsel an informal complaint with respect to anything done or omitted to be done by any person in contravention of any provision of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII or any requirement established thereunder. Such informal complaints need not otherwise comply with the provisions of this part. Matters so presented may, if their nature warrants, be handled by correspondence or conference with the appropriate persons. Any matter not disposed of informally may be made the subject of an enforcement proceeding pursuant to this subpart. The filing of an informal complaint shall not bar the subsequent filing of a formal complaint.
§ 302.404
Formal complaints.
(a)
Filing.
Any person may make a formal complaint to the Assistant General Counsel about any violation of the economic regulatory provisions of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII or of the Department's rules, regulations, orders, or other requirements. Every formal complaint shall conform to the requirements of §§ 302.3 and 302.4, concerning the form and filing of documents. The filing of a complaint shall result in the institution of an enforcement proceeding only if the Assistant General Counsel issues a notice instituting such a proceeding as to all or part of the complaint under § 302.406(a) or the General Counsel does so under § 302.406(c).
(b)
Amendment.
A formal complaint may be amended at any time before service of an answer to the complaint. After service of an answer but before institution of an enforcement proceeding, the complaint may be amended with the permission of the Assistant General Counsel. After institution of an enforcement proceeding, the complaint may be amended only on grant of a motion filed under § 302.11.
(c)
Insufficiency of formal complaint.
In any case where the Assistant General Counsel is of the opinion that a complaint does not sufficiently set forth matters required by any applicable rule, regulation or order of the Department, or is otherwise insufficient, he or she may advise the complainant of the deficiency and require that any additional information be supplied by amendment.
(d)
Joinder of complaints or complainants.
Two or more grounds of complaints involving substantially the same purposes, subject or state of facts may be included in one complaint even though they involve more than one respondent. Two or more complainants may join in one complaint if their respective causes of complaint are against the same party or parties and involve substantially the same purposes, subject or state of facts. The Assistant General Counsel may separate or split complaints if he or she finds that the joinder of complaints, complainants, or respondents will not be conducive to the proper dispatch of the Department's business or the ends of justice.
(e)
Service.
A formal complaint, and any amendments thereto, shall be served by the person filing such documents upon each party complained of, upon the General Counsel, and upon the Assistant General Counsel.

Responsive documents.
(a)
Answers.
Within fifteen (15) days after the date of service of a formal complaint, each respondent shall file an answer in conformance with and subject to the requirements of § 302.408(b). Extensions of time for filing an answer may be granted by the Assistant General Counsel for good cause shown.
(b)
Offers to satisfy.
A respondent in a formal complaint may offer to satisfy the complaint through submission of facts, offer of settlement or proposal of adjustment. Such offer shall be in writing and shall be served, within fifteen (15) days after service of the complaint, upon the same persons and in the same manner as an answer. The submittal of
an offer to satisfy the complaint shall not excuse the filing of an answer.
(c)
Motions to dismiss.
Motions to dismiss a formal complaint shall not be filed prior to the filing of a notice instituting an enforcement proceeding with respect to such complaint or a portion thereof.
§ 302.406
Procedure for responding to formal complaints.

(b) An order dismissing a complaint issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall become effective as a final order of the Department thirty (30) days after service thereof.
(c) Whenever the Assistant General Counsel has failed to act on a formal complaint within a reasonable time after an answer is due, the following motions may be addressed to the General Counsel:
(1) By the complainant to institute an enforcement proceeding by docketing the complaint upon a showing that it is in the public interest to do so; and
(2) By the respondent to dismiss the complaint upon a showing that it is in the public interest to do so.

§ 302.407
Commencement of enforcement proceeding.
(a) Whenever in the opinion of the Assistant General Counsel there are reasonable grounds to believe that any economic regulatory provision of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, or any rule, regulation, order, limitation, condition, or other requirement established pursuant thereto, has been or is being violated, that efforts to satisfy a complaint as provided by § 302.405 have failed, and that the investigation of any or all of the alleged violations is in the public interest, the Assistant General Counsel may issue a notice instituting an enforcement proceeding before an administrative law judge.
(b) The notice shall incorporate by reference the formal complaint submitted pursuant to § 302.404 or shall be accompanied by a complaint by an attorney from the Office of the Assistant General Counsel. The notice and accompanying complaint, if any, shall be formally served upon each respondent and each complainant.
(c) The proceedings thus instituted shall be processed in regular course in accordance with this part. However, nothing in this part shall be construed to limit the authority of the Department to institute or conduct any investigation or inquiry within its jurisdiction in any other manner or according to any other procedures that it may deem necessary or proper.
(d) Whenever the Assistant General Counsel seeks an assessment of civil penalties in an enforcement proceeding, he or she shall serve on all parties to the proceeding a notice of the violations alleged and the amount of penalties for which the respondent may be liable. The notice may be included in the notice instituting a formal enforcement proceeding or in a separate document.
(e) In any proceeding in which civil penalties are sought, any decisions issued by the Department shall state the amount of any civil penalties assessed upon a finding of violation, and the time and manner in which payment shall be made to the United States.

§ 302.408
Answers and replies.
(a) Within fifteen (15) days after the date of service of a notice issued pursuant to § 302.407, the respondent shall file an answer to the complaint attached thereto or incorporated therein unless an answer has already been filed in accordance with § 302.405. Any requests for extension of time for filing of an answer to such complaint shall be filed in accordance with § 302.11.
(b) All answers shall be served in accordance with § 302.7 and shall fully and
completely advise the parties and the Department as to the nature of the defense and shall admit or deny specifically and in detail each allegation of the complaint unless the respondent is without knowledge, in which case, his or her answer shall so state and the statement shall operate as a denial. Allegations of fact not denied or controverted shall be deemed admitted. Matters alleged as affirmative defenses shall be separately stated and numbered and shall, in the absence of a reply, be deemed to be controverted. Any answer to a complaint, or response to a notice, proposing the assessment of civil penalties shall specifically present any matters that the respondent intends to rely upon in opposition to, or in mitigation of, such civil penalties.
(c) The DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge may, in his or her discretion, require or permit the filing of a reply in appropriate cases; otherwise, no reply may be filed.
§ 302.409
Default.
Failure of a respondent to file and serve an answer within the time and in the manner prescribed by § 302.408 shall be deemed to authorize the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge, as a matter of discretion, to find the facts alleged in the complaint incorporated in or accompanying the notice instituting a formal enforcement proceeding to be true and to enter such orders as may be appropriate without notice or hearing, or, as a matter of discretion, to proceed to take proof, without notice, of the allegations or charges set forth in the complaint or order;
Provided,
that the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge may permit late filing of an answer for good cause shown.
§ 302.410
Consolidation of proceedings.
The DOT decisionmaker or Chief Administrative Law Judge may, upon his or her own initiative, or upon motion of any party, consolidate for hearing or for other purposes, or may contemporaneously consider, two or more enforcement proceedings that involve substantially the same parties or issues that are the same or closely related, if he or she finds that such consolidation or contemporaneous hearing will be conducive to the dispatch of business and to the ends of justice and will not unduly delay the proceedings.
§ 302.411
Motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.
(a) At any time after an answer has been filed, any party may file with the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment, including supporting affidavits.

(a) At any time after an answer has been filed, any party may file with the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge and serve upon the opposing side a written request for the admission of the genuineness and authenticity of any relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request or for the admission of the truth of any relevant matters of fact stated in the request with respect to such documents.
(b) Each of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless within a period designated in the request, not less than ten (10) days after service thereof, or within such further time as the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge may allow upon motion and notice, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters of which an admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why he or she cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters.
(c) Service of such request and answering statement shall be made as provided in § 302.7. Any admission made by a party pursuant to such request is only for the purposes of the pending proceeding, or any proceeding or action instituted for the enforcement of any order entered therein, and shall not constitute an admission by him or her for any other purpose or be used against him or her in any other proceeding or action.
§ 302.413
Evidence of previous violations.
Evidence of previous violations by any person or of any provision of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII or any requirement thereunder found by the Department or a court in any other proceeding or criminal or civil action may, if relevant and material, be admitted in any enforcement proceeding involving such person.

Hearing.
After the issues have been formulated, whether by the pleadings or otherwise, the administrative law judge shall give the parties reasonable written notice of the time and place of the hearings.

Appearances by persons not parties.
With consent of the administrative law judge, appearances may be entered without request for or grant of permission to intervene by interested persons who are not parties to the proceeding. Such persons may, with the consent of the administrative law judge, cross-examine a particular witness or suggest to any party or counsel therefor questions or interrogations to be asked witnesses called by any party, but may not otherwise examine witnesses and may not introduce evidence or otherwise participate in the proceeding.

# Subpart G—Rules Applicable to Mail Rate Proceedings and Mail Contracts
§ 302.701
Applicability.
(a) This subpart sets forth the special rules applicable to proceedings for the establishment of mail rates by the Department for foreign air transportation and air transportation between points in Alaska, and certain contractual arrangements between the U.S. Postal Service and certificated air carriers for the carriage of mail in foreign air transportation entered into pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 5402(a), 84 Stat. 772.
(b) Such contracts must be for the transportation of at least 750 pounds of mail per flight, and no more than five (5) percent, based on weight, of the international mail transported under any such contract may consist of letter mail.

# Final Mail Rate Proceedings
§ 302.702
Institution of proceedings.
(a) Proceedings for the determination of rates of compensation for the transportation of mail may be commenced by the filing of a petition by an air carrier whose rate is to be fixed, or the U.S. Postal Service, or upon the issuance of an order by the DOT decisionmaker.
(b) The petition shall set forth the rate or rates sought to be established, a statement that they are believed to be fair and reasonable, the reasons supporting the request for a change in rates, and a detailed economic justification sufficient to establish the reasonableness of the rate or rates proposed.
(c) In any case where an air carrier is operating under a final mail rate uniformly applicable to an entire rate-making unit as established by the DOT decisionmaker, a petition must clearly and unequivocally challenge the rate for such entire rate-making unit and not only a part of such unit.
(d) All petitions, amended petitions, and documents relating thereto shall be served upon the U.S. Postal Service by sending a copy to the Assistant General Counsel, Transportation Division, Washington, DC 20260-1124, by registered or certified mail, postpaid, prior to the filing thereof with the Department. Proof of service on the U.S. Postal Service shall consist of a statement in the document that the person filing it has served a copy as required by this section.
(e) Answers to petitions shall be filed within twenty (20) days after service of the petition.
§ 302.703
Order to show cause or instituting a hearing.
Whether the proceeding is commenced by the filing of a petition or upon the Department's own initiative, the DOT decisionmaker may issue an order directing the respondent to show cause why it should not adopt such findings and conclusions and such final rates as may be specified in the order to show cause, or may issue an order setting the matter for hearing before an administrative law judge.
§ 302.704
Objections and answers to order to show cause.
(a) Where an order to show cause is issued, any person having objections to the rates specified in such order shall file with the DOT decisionmaker an answer within forty-five (45) days after
the date of service of such order or within such other period as the order may specify.
(b) An answer to an order to show cause shall contain specific objections, and shall set forth the findings and conclusions, the rates, and the supporting exhibits that would be substituted for the corresponding items in the findings and conclusions of the show cause order, if such objections were found valid.
(c) An answer filed by a person who is neither a party nor a person ultimately permitted to intervene in an oral evidentiary hearing if such proceeding is established shall be treated as a memorandum filed under § 302.706.
§ 302.705
Further procedures.
(a) If no answer is filed within the designated time, or if a timely filed answer raises no material issue of fact, the DOT decisionmaker may, upon the basis of the record in the proceeding, enter a final order fixing the rate or rates.
(b) If an answer raising a material issue of fact is filed within the time designated in the Department's order, the DOT decisionmaker may then issue an order authorizing additional pleadings and/or establishing further procedural steps, including setting the matter for oral evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge.
§ 302.706
Hearing.
(a) If a hearing is ordered under § 302.705, the issues at such hearing shall be formulated in accordance with the instituting order, except that at a prehearing conference, the administrative law judge may permit the parties to raise such additional issues as he or she deems necessary to make a full determination of a fair and reasonable rate.
(b)(1) The parties to the proceeding shall be the air carrier or carriers for whom rates are to be fixed, the U.S. Postal Service, the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings and any other person whom the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge permits to intervene in accordance with § 302.20.
(2) In addition to participation in hearings in accordance with § 302.19, persons other than parties may, within the time fixed for filing an answer to an order to show cause as provided in § 302.704, submit a memorandum of opposition to, or in support of, the position taken in the petition or order. Such memorandum shall not be received as evidence in the proceeding.
(c) All direct evidence shall be in writing and shall be filed in exhibit form within the times specified by the DOT decisionmaker or by the administrative law judge.
(d) Except as modified by this subpart, the provisions of §§ 302.17 through 302.38 of this part shall apply.

# Provision for Temporary Rate
§ 302.707
Procedure for fixing temporary mail rates.
At any time during the pendency of a proceeding for the determination of final mail rates, the DOT decisionmaker, upon his or her own initiative, or on petition by the air carrier whose rates are in issue or by the U.S. Postal Service, may fix temporary rates of compensation for the transportation of mail subject to downward or upward adjustment upon the determination of final mail rates.

# Informal Mail Rate Conference Procedure
§ 302.708
Invocation of procedure.
(a) Conferences between DOT employees, representatives of air carriers, the U.S. Postal Service and other interested persons may be called by DOT employees for the purpose of considering and clarifying issues and factual material in pending proceedings for the establishment of rates for the transportation of mail.
(b) At the commencement of an informal mail rate conference pursuant to this section, the authorized DOT employees conducting such conference shall issue to each person present at such conference a written statement to the effect that such conference is being conducted pursuant to this section and stating the time of commencement of such conference; and at the termination of such conference the DOT employees conducting such conference
shall note in writing on such statement the time of termination of such conference.
§ 302.709
Scope of conferences.
The mail rate conferences shall be limited to the discussion of, and possible agreement on, particular issues and related factual material in accordance with sound rate-making principles. The duties and powers of DOT employees in rate conferences essentially will not be different, therefore, from the duties and powers they have in the processing of rate cases not involving a rate conference. The employees' function in both instances is to present clearly to the DOT decisionmaker the issues and the related material facts, together with recommendations. The DOT decisionmaker will make an independent determination of the soundness of the employees's analyses and recommendations.
§ 302.710
Participants in conferences.
The persons entitled to be present in mail rate conferences will be the representatives of the carrier whose rates are in issue, the staff of the U.S. Postal Service, and the authorized DOT employees. No other person will attend unless the DOT employees deem his or her presence necessary in the interest of one or more purposes to be accomplished, and in such case his or her participation will be limited to such specific purposes. No person, however, shall have the duty to attend merely by reason of invitation by the authorized DOT employees.
§ 302.711
Conditions upon participation.
(a)
Nondisclosure of information.
As a condition to participation, every participant, during the period of the conference and for ninety (90) days after its termination, or until the Department takes public action with respect to the facts and issues covered in the conference, whichever is earlier:
(1) Shall, except for necessary disclosures in the course of employment in connection with conference business, hold the information obtained in conference in absolute confidence and trust;
(2) Shall not deal, directly or indirectly, for the account of himself or herself, his or her immediate family, members of his or her firm or company, or as a trustee, in securities of the air carrier involved in the rate conference except that under exceptional circumstances special permission may be obtained in advance from the DOT decisionmaker; and
(3) Shall adopt effective controls for the confidential handling of such information and shall instruct personnel under his or her supervision, who by reason of their employment come into possession of information obtained at the conference, that such information is confidential and must not be disclosed to anyone except to the extent absolutely necessary in the course of employment, and must not be misused. (The term “information”, as used in this section, shall refer only to information obtained at the conference regarding the future course of action or position of the Department or its employees with respect to the facts or issues discussed at the conference.)
(b)
Signed statement required.
Every representative of an air carrier actually present at any conference shall sign a statement that he or she has read this entire instruction and promises to abide by it and advise any other participant to whom he or she discloses any confidential information of the restrictions imposed above. Every representative of the U.S. Postal Service actually present at any conference shall, on his or her own behalf, sign a statement to the same effect.
(c)
Presumption of having conference information.
A director of any air carrier that has had a representative at the conference, who deals either directly or indirectly for himself or herself, his or her immediate family, members of his or her firm or company, or as a trustee, in securities of the air carrier involved in the conference, during the restricted period set forth above, shall be presumed to have come into possession of information obtained at the conference knowing that such information was subject to the restrictions imposed above; but such presumption can be rebutted.
(d)
Compliance report required.
Within ten (10) days after the expiration of the
time specified for keeping conference matters confidential, every participant, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, shall file a verified compliance report with Department of Transportation Dockets stating that he or she has complied in every respect with the conditions of this section, or if he or she has not so complied, stating in detail in what respects he or she has failed to comply.
(e)
Persons subject to the provisions of this section.
For the purposes of this section, participants shall include:
(1) Any representative of any air carrier and any representative of the U.S. Postal Service actually present at the conference;
(2) The directors and the officers of any air carrier that had a representative at the conference;
(3) The members of any firm of attorneys or consultants that had a representative at the conference; and
(4) The members of the U.S. Postal Service staff who come into possession of information obtained at the conference, knowing that such information is subject to the restrictions imposed in this section.
§ 302.712
Information to be requested from an air carrier.
When an air carrier is requested to submit detailed estimates as to traffic, revenues and expenses by appropriate periods and the investment that will be required to perform the operations for a future period, full and adequate support shall be presented for all estimates, particularly where such estimates deviate materially from the air carrier's experience. With respect to the rate for a past period, essentially the same procedure shall be followed. Other information or data likewise may be requested by the DOT employees. All data submitted by the air carrier shall be certified by a responsible officer.
§ 302.713
DOT analysis of data for submission of answers thereto.
After a careful analysis of these data, the DOT employees will, in most cases, send the air carrier a statement of exceptions showing areas of differences. Where practicable, the air carrier may submit an answer to these exceptions. Conferences will then be scheduled to resolve the issues and facts in accordance with sound ratemaking principles.
§ 302.714
Availability of data to the U.S. Postal Service.
The representatives of the U.S. Postal Service shall have access to all conference data and, insofar as practicable, shall be furnished copies of all pertinent data prepared by the DOT employees and the air carrier, and a reasonable time shall be allowed to review the facts and issues and to make any presentation deemed necessary;
Provided,
That in cases other than those involving an issue as to the service mail rates payable by the U.S. Postal Service pursuant to section 41901 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, representatives of the U.S. Postal Service shall be furnished with copies of data under this provision only upon their written request.
§ 302.715
Post-conference procedure.
No briefs, argument, or any formal steps will be entertained by the DOT decisionmaker after the rate conferences. The form, content and time of the staff's presentation to the DOT decisionmaker are entirely matters of internal procedure. Any party to the mail rate proceeding may, through an authorized DOT employee, request the opportunity to submit a written or oral statement to the DOT decisionmaker on any unresolved issue. The DOT decisionmaker will grant such requests whenever he or she deems such action desirable in the interest of further clarification and understanding of the issues. The granting of an opportunity for such further presentation shall not, however, impair the rights that any party might otherwise have under the Statute and this part.
§ 302.716
Effect of conference agreements.
No agreements or understandings reached in rate conferences as to facts or issues shall in any respect be binding on the Department or any participant. Any party to mail rate proceedings will have the same rights to
file an answer and take other procedural steps as though no rate conference had been held. The fact, however, that a rate conference was held and certain agreements or understandings may have been reached on certain facts and issues renders it proper to provide that, upon the filing of an answer by any party to the rate proceeding, all issues going to the establishment of a rate shall be open, except insofar as limited in prehearing conference in accordance with § 302.22.
§ 302.717
Waiver of participant conditions.
After the termination of a mail rate conference hereunder, the air carrier whose rates were in issue may petition the DOT decisionmaker for a release from the obligations imposed upon it and all other persons by § 302.711. The DOT decisionmaker will grant such petition only after a detailed and convincing showing is made in the petition and supporting exhibits and documents that there is no reasonable possibility that any of the abuses sought to be prevented will occur or that the Department's processes will in any way be prejudiced. There will be no hearing or oral argument on the petition and the DOT decisionmaker will grant or deny the request without being required to assign reasons therefor.

# Processing Contracts for the Carriage of Mail in Foreign Air Transportation
§ 302.718
Filing.
Any air carrier that is a party to a contract to which this subpart is applicable shall file three (3) copies of the contract in the Office of Aviation Analysis, X-50, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, not later than ninety (90) days before the effective date of the contract. A copy of such contract shall be served upon the persons specified in § 302.720 and the certificate of service shall specify the persons upon whom service has been made. One copy of each contract filed shall bear the certification of the secretary or other duly authorized officer of the filing air carrier to the effect that such copy is a true and complete copy of the original written instrument executed by the parties.
§ 302.719
Explanation and data supporting the contract.
Each contract filed pursuant to this subpart shall be accompanied by economic data and such other information in support of the contract upon which the filing air carrier intends that the Department rely, including, in cases where pertinent, estimates of the annual volume of contract mail (weight and ton-miles) under the proposed contract, the nature of such mail (letter mail, parcel post, third class, etc.), together with a statement as to the extent to which this traffic is new or diverted from existing classes of air and surface mail services and the priority assigned to this class of mail.
§ 302.720
Service.
A copy of each contract filed pursuant to § 302.718, and a copy of all material and data filed pursuant to § 302.719, shall be served upon each of the following persons:

(b) The Assistant General Counsel, Transportation Division, U.S. Postal Service, Washington, DC 20260-1124.
§ 302.721
Complaints.
Within fifteen (15) days of the filing of a contract, any interested person may file with the Office of Aviation Analysis, X-50, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, a complaint with respect to the contract setting forth the basis for such complaint and all pertinent information in support of same. A copy of the complaint shall be served upon the air carrier filing the contract and upon each of the persons served with such contract pursuant to § 302.720.
§ 302.722
Answers to complaints.
Answers to the complaint may be filed within ten (10) days of the filing of
the complaint, with service being made as provided in § 302.720.
§ 302.723
Further procedures.
(a) In any case where a complaint is filed, the DOT decisionmaker shall issue an order dismissing the complaint, disapproving the contract, or taking such other action as may be appropriate. Any such order shall be issued not later than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of the contract.
(b) In cases where no complaint is filed, the DOT decisionmaker may issue a letter of notification to all persons upon whom the contract was served indicating that the Department does not intend to disapprove the contract.
(c) Unless the DOT decisionmaker disapproves the contract not later than ten (10) days prior to its effective date, the contract automatically becomes effective.
§ 302.724
Petitions for reconsideration.
Except in the case of a Department determination to disapprove a contract, no petitions for reconsideration of any Department determination pursuant to this subpart shall be entertained.

§ 305.1
Applicability.
The provisions of this part shall govern informal nonpublic investigations, as distinguished from formal investigations and adjudicatory proceedings, undertaken by the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings with a view to obtaining information from any person. While the Department seeks and encourages voluntary cooperation and believes that it is in the best interest of all parties concerned, it will utilize the procedures provided by this part to compel the disclosure of information by any person where DOT wishes to determine whether such person, or any other person, has been or is violating any provisions of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, Chapter 411 or 49 U.S.C. 40102(2), 41502, 41507, 41508, 41509, 41702, 41703, or 46101, or any rule, regulation, order, certificate, permit, or letter or registration issued pursuant thereto by DOT and when the information appears to be relevant to the matter under investigation. This part shall not apply to employees or records of other agencies of the U.S. Government, the District of Columbia, or the several States and their political subdivisions.

§ 305.2
Definition.
For the purpose of, and as used in this part, the term
investigation
means a non-adjudicatory, informal nonpublic investigation for the purpose of determining whether formal enforcement action should be instituted with respect to alleged violations of law.
§§ 305.3-305.4
[Reserved]
§ 305.5
Initiation of investigation.
An investigation may be initiated by order of the Department. Attorneys of the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings shall conduct such investigations pursuant to the provisions of this part and they shall be designated Investigation Attorneys. Investigation Attorneys, administrative law judges and the DOT decisionmaker are hereby authorized to exercise and perform their duties and functions under this part in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Department.
§ 305.6
Appearance of witnesses.
Witnesses may be required to appear before any administrative law judge for the purpose of receiving their testimony or receiving from them documents or other data relating to any subject under investigation. Such testimony shall be mechanically or stenographically recorded, and a transcript thereof shall be made and incorporated in the record of the investigation.
§ 305.7
Issuance of investigation subpenas.
(a) The General Counsel, the DOT decisionmaker, the chief administrative law judge or the administrative law judge designated to preside at the reception of evidence, may issue a subpena directing the person named therein to appear before a designated administrative law judge at a designated time and place to testify or to produce documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation, or both. Each such subpena shall briefly advise the person required to testify or submit documentary evidence of the purpose and scope of the investigation, and a copy of the order initiating the investigation shall be attached to the subpena.
(b) Witnesses subpoenaed to appear shall be paid the fees and mileage prescribed in § 302.27(c) of the Rules of Practice (14 CFR 302.27(c)). Service of such subpoenas shall be made in accordance with the provisions of § 302.7 of the Rules of Practice (14 CFR 302.7).
[Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2421, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 65 FR 6456, Feb. 9, 2000; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15937, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 305.8
[Reserved]
§ 305.9
Rights of witnesses.
Any person required to testify or to submit documentary evidence shall be entitled to procure, on payment of lawfully prescribed costs, a copy of any document produced by such person and of his or her own testimony as stenographically reported. Any person compelled to testify or to produce documentary evidence may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel.
§ 305.10
Nonpublic character of proceedings.
Investigations shall be attended only by the witnesses and their counsel, the administrative law judge, the Investigation Attorney, other DOT personnel concerned with the conduct of the proceeding and the official stenographer. All orders initiating investigations, motions to quash or modify investigation subpenas, orders disposing of such motions, documents, and transcripts of testimony shall be part of the record in the investigation. Unless DOT determines otherwise, all orders initiating investigations which do not disclose the identity of the particular persons of firms under investigation shall be published in the
Federal Register.
Except as otherwise required by law, the remainder of the record of such proceedings shall constitute internal DOT documents which shall not be available to the general public. The use of such records in DOT proceedings subject to part 302 of the Rules of Practice shall be governed by §§ 302.25(g) and 302.12 of this chapter and by the law of
evidence applicable to DOT proceedings.

§ 305.11
Procedures after investigation.
Upon completion of the investigation, where the General Counsel, determines that no corrective action is warranted, the investigation will be closed. Where remedial action is indicated by the investigation, the General Counsel will proceed pursuant to subpart D of part 302 of this chapter (the Rules of Practice) or will take such other action as may be appropriate.
[Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2421, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 65 FR 6456, Feb. 9, 2000; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15937, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 305.12
Motions to quash or modify an investigation subpena.
Any person upon whom an investigation subpena is served may, within seven (7) days after such service or at any time prior to the return date thereof, whichever is earlier, file a motion to quash or modify such subpena with the administrative law judge who issued such subpena, or in the event the administrative law judge is not available, with the chief administrative law judge for action by himself or herself or by the DOT decisionmaker. Such motions shall be made in writing in conformity with Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules of Practice (part 302 of this subchapter); shall state with particularity the grounds therefor and the relief sought; shall be accompanied by the evidence relied upon and all such factual matter shall be verified in accordance with the provisions of Rule 4(b) of the aforesaid Rules of Practice. Written memoranda or briefs may be filed with the motions, stating the points and authorities relied upon. No oral argument will be heard on such motions unless the chief administrative law judge, the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker directs otherwise. A subpena will be quashed or modified if the evidence whose production is required is not reasonably relevant to the matter under investigation, or the demand made does not describe with sufficient particularity the information sought, or the subpena is unlawful or unduly burdensome. The filing of a motion to quash or modify an investigation subpena shall stay the return date of such subpena until such motion is granted or denied. The DOT decisionmaker may at any time review, upon his or her own initiative, the ruling of an administrative law judge or the chief administrative law judge denying a motion to quash a subpena. In such cases, the DOT decisionmaker may order that the return date of a subpena which he or she has elected to review be stayed pending DOT action thereon.

§ 313.1
Purpose, scope, and authority.
(a) Chapter 77 (Energy Conservation) of Title 42 (The Public Health and Welfare), authorizes and directs certain actions to conserve energy supplies through energy conservation programs and where necessary, the regulation of certain energy uses, and to provide for improved energy efficiency of motor vehicles, major appliances, and certain other consumer products. In furtherance of these purposes, 42 U.S.C. 6362 requires several transportation regulatory agencies, including DOT, to submit a number of reports to the Congress with respect to energy conservation and efficiency, and where practicable and consistent with the exercise of DOT's authority under other law, to include in any major regulatory action a statement of its probable impact on energy efficiency and energy
conservation. 42 U.S.C. 6362(b) directs DOT to define the term “major regulatory action” by rule.
(b) Section 40113 of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation)(“the Statute”), authorizes DOT to establish such rules, regulations, and procedures as are necessary to the exercise of its functions and are consistent with the purposes of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII.
(c) The purpose of these regulations is to establish procedures and guidelines for the implementation of DOT's responsibility under 42 U.S.C. 6362 to include in any major regulatory action taken by DOT a statement of the probable impact on energy efficiency and energy conservation.
(d) These regulations apply to all proceedings before DOT, as provided herein.
[Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, 43529, Aug. 22, 1995, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15938, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 313.2
Policy.
(a)
General.
It is the policy of DOT to view the conservation of energy and the energy efficiency improvement goals of Chapter 77 of Title 42 as part of DOT's overall mandate, to be considered along with the several public interest and public convenience and necessity factors enumerated in section 40101 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII. To the extent practicable and consistent with DOT's authority under the Statute and other law, energy conservation and efficiency are to be weighed in the decisionmaking process just as are DOT's traditional policies and missions.
(b)
Implementation.
Implementation of this policy is through the integration of energy findings and conclusions into decisions, opinions, or orders in proceedings involving a major regulatory action, as defined in this part.
(c)
Proceedings in progress.
The provisions of this part are intended primarily for prospective application. Proceedings in progress on the effective date of this part, in which an application has been docketed but no final decision made public, shall adhere to § 313.6(a) of this part, provided that the fair, efficient, and timely administration of DOT's regulatory activities is not compromised thereby. Nothing herein shall imply a requirement for new or additional hearings, a reopening of the record, or any other procedures which would tend to delay a timely decision in proceedings in progress.
(d)
Hearings.
Public hearings will not normally be held for the purpose of implementing 42 U.S.C. 6362, particularly in connection with proposed actions which do not require notice and hearing as a prerequisite to decision under the Statute. Hearings may be ordered in exceptional circumstances where the proposed action is of great magnitude or widespread public interest and, in addition, presents complex issues peculiarly subject to resolution through evidentiary hearings and the process of cross-examination.

§ 313.3
Definitions.
As used in this part:
(a)
Energy efficiency
means the ratio of the useful output of services in air transportation to the energy consumption of such services.
(b)
Energy statement
is a statement of the probable impact of a major regulatory action on energy efficiency and energy conservation, contained in a decision, opinion, order, or rule.
(c)
Major regulatory action
is any decision by the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge requiring an energy statement pursuant to § 313.4 of this part.
(d)
NEPA
means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
[Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43529, Aug. 22, 1995, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15938, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 313.4
Major regulatory actions.
(a) Any initial, recommended, tentative or final decision, opinion, order, or final rule is a major regulatory action requiring an energy statement, if it:
(1) May cause a near-term net annual change in aircraft fuel consumption of 10 million (10,000,000) gallons or more, compared to the probable consumption
of fuel were the action not to be taken; or
(2) Is specifically so designated by DOT because of its precedential value, substantial controversy with respect to energy conservation and efficiency, or other unusual circumstances.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the following types of actions shall not be deemed as major regulatory actions requiring an energy statement:
(1) Tariff suspension orders under section 41509 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, emergency exemptions or temporary exemptions not exceeding 24 months under section 40109 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII and other proceedings in which timely action is of the essence;
(2) Orders instituting or declining to institute investigations or rulemaking, setting or declining to set applications for hearing, on reconsideration, or on requests for stay;
(3) Other procedural or interlocutory orders;
(4) Actions taken under delegated authority; and
(5) Issuance of a certificate where no determination of public convenience and necessity is required.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, DOT may provide that an energy statement shall not be prepared in a proceeding which may result in a major regulatory action, if it finds that:
(1) The inclusion of an energy statement is not consistent with the exercise of DOT's authority under the Statute or other law;
(2) The inclusion of an energy statement is not practicable because of time constraints, lack of information, or other unusual circumstances; or
(3) The action is taken under laws designed to protect the public health or safety.
[Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43529, Aug. 22, 1995; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15938, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 313.5
Energy information.
(a) It shall be the responsibility of applicants and other parties or participants to a proceeding which may involve a major regulatory action to submit sufficient information about the energy consumption and energy efficiency consequences of their proposals or positions in the proceeding to enable the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, as the case may be, to determine whether the proceeding will in fact involve a major regulatory action for purposes of this part, and if so, to consider the relevant energy factors in the decision and prepare the energy statement.
(b) In proceedings involving evidentiary hearings, the energy information shall be submitted at such hearings pursuant to DOT's usual procedural regulations and practices, under control of the administrative law judge or other hearing officer.
(c) In proceedings not involving evidentiary hearings, the energy information shall be submitted at such time as other materials in justification of an application are submitted. Where an application itself is intended as justification for DOT action, the energy information shall be submitted with the application. In rulemakings not involving hearings, the energy information shall normally be submitted along with comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking, or as directed in any such notice or any advance notice.
§ 313.6
Energy statements.
(a) Each major regulatory action shall include, to the extent practicable, consideration of the probable impact of the action taken or to be taken upon energy efficiency and conservation. The administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, as the case may be, shall normally make findings and conclusions about:
(1) The net change in energy consumption;
(2) The net change in energy efficiency; and
(3) The balance struck between energy factors and other public interest and public convenience and necessity factors in the decision.
(b) Energy findings and conclusions contained in any initial or recommended decision are a part of that decision and thus subject to discretionary review by DOT.
(c) In the case of orders to show cause initiated by DOT, energy findings and conclusions may be omitted if
adequate information is not available. In such instances, the energy statement shall be integrated into the final decision.
§ 313.7
Integration with environmental procedures.
(a) In proceedings in which an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact is prepared by a responsible official pursuant to DOT's procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the energy information called for by this part may be included in that statement or declaration in order to yield a single, comprehensive document. In such instances, the DOT's NEPA procedures shall govern the submission of the energy information. However, it shall remain the responsibility of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, as the case may be, to make the findings and conclusions required by § 313.6(a) of this part.
(b) A determination that a major regulatory action within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 6362 and this part may be involved in a proceeding is independent from any determination that the proceeding is a “major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” within the meaning of NEPA, and vice versa.

Whereas Principal is an overseas military personnel charter operator pursuant to the provisions of part 372 of the Department's regulations and other rules and regulations of the Department relating to security for the protection of charter participants, and has elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a bond as will insure financial responsibility with respect to all monies received from charter participants for services in connection with overseas military personnel charters to be operated subject to part 372 of the Department's Special Regulations in accordance with contracts, agreements, or arrangements therefor, and

Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to charter participants any sum or sums for which Principal may be held legally liable by reason of Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill and carry out all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by Principal while this bond is in effect with respect to the receipt of moneys from charter participants, and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of part 372 of the Department's regulations, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.
The liability of Surety with respect to any charter participant shall not exceed the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant.
The liability of Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penalty (face amount) of the bond, but in no event shall Surety's obligation hereunder exceed the amount of said penalty.
Surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation, forthwith of all suits or claims made and judgments rendered, and payments made by Surety under this bond.

Surety shall not be liable hereunder for the payment of any damages hereinbefore described which arise as a result of any contracts, agreements, undertakings, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Principal after the termination of this bond as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the bond hereunder for the payment of any damages arising as a result of contracts, agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Principal prior to the date that such termination becomes effective. Liability of Surety under this bond shall in all events be limited only to a charter participant or charter participants who shall within sixty (60) days after the termination of the particular charter described herein give written notice of claim to the charter operator or, if it is unavailable, to Surety, and all liability on this bond shall automatically terminate sixty (60) days after the termination date of each particular charter covered by this bond except for claims made in the time provided herein.

Reporting requirements.
(a) Air carriers shall make monthly reports to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics with respect to the credit for transportation furnished to candidates, or persons acting on behalf of candidates, during the period from 6 months before nomination, if any, or from 6 months before election, until the date of election. After that 6-month period, air carriers shall file such a report with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics not later than the 20th day following the end of the calendar month in which the election or nomination takes place, and thereafter when any change occurs in that report, until a negative report is filed showing that no debt for such extension of credit is owed to the carrier.
(b)(1) A separate report shall be filed for each candidate with an aggregate indebtedness balance of over $5,000 on the last day of the month to which the report pertains. The report shall cover all debts incurred by the candidate, whether or not incurred in connection with his campaign, and all debts incurred by persons acting on his behalf in connection with such campaign. The indebtedness accounts reported shall be those which the air carrier knows, or has reason to know, have been incurred by or on behalf of a candidate; and it shall be presumed that the transportation for which the indebtedness has been incurred is intended to be used in connection with the campaign of such candidate for nomination for election, or election, to Federal office.
(2) The reports required by this paragraph (b) shall be filed with the Office of Airline Information not later than the 20th day following the end of the calendar month to which the report pertains. They shall include the following data: (i) Name of account; (ii) the credit limit established for such account; (iii) the balance, if any, of the amount payable for transportation not paid for in advance; (iv) any unpaid balance of the charges for such transportation as of the last day of the month covered by the report, and the length of time that such balance has remained unpaid; and (v) a description of the type and value of any bond, collateral, or other security securing such unpaid balance.
(3) The report required by this paragraph (b) shall be in the form attached hereto as appendix A.

§ 374a.7
Record retention requirements.
(a) Every air carrier subject to the part shall retain for 2 years after a Federal election true copies of the following documents at its principal or general office in the United States:
(1) All documents which evidence or reflect the furnishing of transportation to a candidate for political office or a person acting on his behalf;
(2) All statements, invoices, bills, and receipts with respect to the furnishing of such transportation referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b) Every air carrier shall make the documents listed in this section available in the United States upon request by an authorized representative of the DOT and shall permit such representative to make such notes and copies thereof as he deems appropriate.
[SPR-53, 37 FR 9388, May 10, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66726, Dec. 26, 1995]
§ 374a.8
Prospective application of part.
The provisions of this part shall apply only to the extension of credit by an air carrier to a candidate, or to a person acting on his behalf, which is made subsequent to the effective date of this part, and shall not be applicable to debts incurred prior to such date but which are unpaid as of the effective date of this part. The provisions of this part will be applicable, however, to all credit transactions which occur subsequent to the effective date of the part even though the credit account in which the transaction takes place was opened prior to the effective date of the part.

[OST Doc. No. 42547, 51 FR 7254, Mar. 3, 1986, as amended at 71 FR 15328, Mar. 28, 2006; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 375.2
Applicability.
The provisions of this part regulate the admission to, and navigation in, the United States of foreign civil aircraft other than aircraft operated under authority contained in a foreign air carrier permit or exemption. This part also contains provisions that specify the extent to which certain classes of flight operations by foreign civil aircraft may be conducted, and the terms and conditions applicable to such operations. Nothing in this part shall authorize any foreign civil aircraft to engage in air transportation nor be deemed to provide for such authorization by the Department.
§ 375.3
[Reserved]

# Subpart B—Authorization
§ 375.10
Certain foreign civil aircraft registered in ICAO member states.
Subject to the observance of the applicable rules, conditions, and limitations set forth in this part:
(a) Foreign civil aircraft manufactured in a State that at the time of manufacture was a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and registered in a State that at the time of flight is a member of ICAO, may be navigated in the United States;
(b) Foreign civil aircraft manufactured in a State that at the time of manufacture was not a member of ICAO, and registered in a State that at the time of flight is a member of ICAO, may be navigated in the United States,
(1) If the State of registry has notified ICAO that the requirements under which it issues or renders valid certificates of airworthiness are equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the Chicago Convention, or
(2) If such notification has not been made to ICAO at the time of flight, there is on file with the Department a statement by the State of registry that, with regard to aircraft of the type that is proposed to be operated hereunder, the requirements under which certificates of airworthiness are issued or rendered valid are equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the Chicago Convention.
§ 375.11
Other foreign civil aircraft.
A foreign civil aircraft, including unmanned aircraft as defined in § 1.1 of this title, other than those referred to in § 375.10 may be navigated in the United States only when:
(a) The operation is authorized by the Department under the provisions of this part, and
(b) The aircraft complies with any applicable airworthiness standards of the Federal Aviation Administration for its operation.
[80 FR 78648, Dec. 16, 2015]

# Subpart C—Rules Generally Applicable
§ 375.19
Nature of privilege conferred.
The provisions of this part, and of any permit issued hereunder, together with 49 U.S.C. 41703, are designed, among other purposes, to carry out the international undertakings of the United States in the Chicago Convention, in particular Article 5. That article gives foreign aircraft the privilege of “taking on or discharging passengers, cargo or mail” subject to the right of the State where such embarkation or discharge takes place to impose such regulations, conditions or limitations as it may consider desirable. The U.S. Congress by the 1953 amendment to section 6 of the Air Commerce Act of 1926, now designated as 49 U.S.C. 41703, authorizes the Department to permit such operations only where conditions of reciprocity and the interest of the public in the United States are met. Thus, the operator of any foreign registered aircraft is not entitled as a matter of right to the issuance, renewal or freedom from modification or change in a permit issuable pursuant to this authority. Accordingly, any authority conferred by this part may be withheld, revoked, amended, modified, restricted, suspended, withdrawn, or canceled by the Department in the interest of the public of the United States, without notice or hearing.
[OST Doc. No. 42547, 51 FR 7254, Mar. 3, 1986, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 375.20
Airworthiness and registration certificates.
Foreign civil aircraft shall carry currently effective certificates of registration and airworthiness issued or rendered valid by the country of registry and shall display the nationality and registration markings of that country. However, a foreign civil aircraft may carry, in lieu of such certificate of airworthiness, an effective special flight authorization issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for the operations being performed.
§ 375.21
Airmen.
Members of the flight crew of a foreign civil aircraft shall have in their personal possession valid airman certificates or licenses authorizing them to perform their assigned functions in the aircraft and for the operation involved issued or rendered valid by the country of registry of the aircraft or by the United States. No such flight crew members shall perform any flight duty within the United States that they are not currently authorized to perform in the country issuing or validating the certificate.
§ 375.22
Flight operations.
Flights of foreign civil aircraft in the United States shall be conducted in accordance with the currently applicable rules of the Federal Aviation Administration in 14 CFR chapter I.
[OST Doc. No. 42547, 51 FR 7254, Mar. 3, 1986, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 375.23
Maximum allowable weights.
Foreign civil aircraft that are permitted to navigate in the United States on the basis of foreign airworthiness certificates must conform to the limitations on maximum certificated weights prescribed or authorized for the particular variation of the aircraft type, and for the particular category of use, by the country of manufacture of the aircraft type involved.
§ 375.24
Entry and clearance.
All U.S. entry and clearance requirements for aircraft, passengers, crews, baggage and cargo shall be followed.
§ 375.25
Unauthorized operations.
No foreign civil aircraft shall be navigated in the United States unless authorized by this part. Commercial
air operations (other than those authorized by § 375.36) shall not be undertaken without a permit issued by the Department.
§ 375.26
Waiver of sovereign immunity.
Owners and operators of aircraft operated under this part that are engaged in proprietary of commercial activities waive any defense of sovereign immunity from suit in any action or proceeding instituted against any of them in any court or other tribunal in the United States for any claim relating to that operation.

# Subpart D—Authorized Operations
§ 375.30
Operations other than commercial air operations.
Foreign civil aircraft that are not engaged in commercial air operations into, out of, or within the United States may be operated in the United States and may carry non-revenue traffic to, from or between points in the United States.
§ 375.31
Demonstration flights of foreign aircraft.
Flights of foreign civil aircraft within the United States may be made for the purpose of demonstration of the aircraft or any component thereof (including demonstrations at airshows), provided no persons, cargo or mail are carried for remuneration or hire.
§ 375.32
Flights incidental to agricultural and industrial operations outside the United States.
Foreign civil aircraft that are engaged in agricultural or industrial operations to be performed wholly outside the United States may be navigated into, out of, and within the United States in connection with those operations provided that the aircraft is not at the time engaged in the carriage of passengers, cargo, or mail for remuneration or hire.
§ 375.33
Transit flights, irregular operations.
Foreign civil aircraft carrying passengers, property or mail for remuneration or hire, but not engaged in scheduled international air services, are authorized to navigate nonstop across the territory of the United States and to make stops for non-traffic purposes. The navigation of foreign civil aircraft in the United States is not authorized under this section when the elapsed time between landing and takeoff at a stop in the United States exceeds 24 hours and passengers are permitted to leave the airport or when passengers, property or mail are transferred to another aircraft. Flights involving stops under such circumstances may, however, be performed in the case of emergency relating to the safety of the aircraft, passengers, cargo or crew.
[OST Doc. No. 42547, 51 FR 7254, Mar. 3, 1986, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 375.34
Indoctrination training.
Foreign civil aircraft may be operated in the United States for the purpose of giving indoctrination training in the operation of the aircraft concerned to a buyer or a buyer's employees or designees. This section does not, however, authorize foreign civil aircraft to be used within the United States for the purpose of flight instruction for remuneration or hire.
§ 375.35
Free transportation.
(a) Foreign civil aircraft may be navigated in the United States by a foreign air carrier for the transportation of persons and property specified in paragraph (b) of this section over the following non-traffic segments provided such transportation is not for compensation or hire:
(1) Between two or more points in the United States;
(2) Between a point in the United States named in the carrier's section 41301 permit or exemption, and a point outside the United States not so named, when authorized in accordance with the provisions of part 216 of this chapter to carry blind sector traffic to or from such unnamed foreign point; and
(3) Between a point in the United States and a point outside thereof when the carrier lands at the United States point for non-traffic purposes in exercise of the privilege granted under the International Air Services Transit Agreement.
(b) Free transportation may be provided under this section for the following categories of persons and property:
(1) Directors, officers and employees, and their parents and immediate families, of the foreign air carrier operating the aircraft;
(2) Directors, officers and employees, and their parents and immediate families, of an air carrier or another foreign air carrier traveling pursuant to a pass interchange arrangement;
(3) Travel agents being transported for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with the carrier's services, if the agents are under no obligation to sell the transporting carrier's services;
(4) Witnesses and attorneys attending any legal investigation in which any such foreign air carrier is involved;
(5) Persons injured in aircraft accidents and physicians and nurses attending such persons;
(6) Any persons or property with the object of providing relief in cases of general epidemic, natural disaster or other catastrophe;

(c) A charge reasonably related to the value of meals and beverages furnished enroute shall not be deemed to constitute compensation or hire for purposes of this section.
[OST Doc. No. 42547, 51 FR 7254, Mar. 3, 1986, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 375.36
Lease of foreign civil aircraft without crew.
Foreign civil aircraft that are leased without crew to an air carrier or citizen or permanent resident of the United States, and used by the lessee in otherwise authorized air transportation or commercial air operations, may be operated into, out of, and within the United States in accordance with any applicable regulations prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration.
§ 375.37
Certain business aviation activities using U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft.
For purposes of this section, “company” is defined as a person that operates civil aircraft in furtherance of a business other than air transportation. U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft that are not otherwise engaged in commercial air operations, or foreign air transportation, and which are operated by a company in the furtherance of a business other than transportation by air, when the carriage is within the scope of, and incidental to, the business of the company (other than transportation by air), may be operated to, from, and within the United States as follows:
(a)
Intra-company operations.
A company operating a U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft may conduct operations for a subsidiary or parent or a subsidiary of its parent on a fully-allocated cost reimbursable basis; provided, that the operator of the U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft must hold majority ownership in, be majority owned by, or have a common parent with, the company for which it provides operations;
(b)
Interchange operations.
A company may lease a U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft to another company in exchange for equal time when needed on the other company's U.S. registered aircraft, where no charge, assessment, or fee is made, except that a charge may be made not to exceed the difference between the cost of owning, operating, and maintaining the two aircraft;
(c)
Joint ownership operations.
A company that jointly owns a U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft and furnishes the flight crew for that aircraft may collect from the other joint owners of that aircraft a share of the actual costs involved in the operation of the aircraft; and
(d)
Time-sharing operations.
A company may lease a U.S.-registered foreign civil aircraft, with crew, to another company; provided, that the operator may collect no charge for the operation of the aircraft except reimbursement for:
(1) Fuel, oil, lubricants, and other additives.
(2) Travel expenses of the crew, including food, lodging, and ground transportation.
(3) Hanger and tie-down costs away from the aircraft's base of operations.
(4) Insurance obtained for the specific flight.
(5) Landing fees, airport taxes, and similar assessments.

[80 FR 78648, Dec. 16, 2015]

# Subpart E—Operations Requiring Specific Preflight Authorization of Filing
§ 375.40
Permits for commercial air operations.
(a)
Permit required.
Except for aircraft being operated under a foreign air carrier permit, an exemption, or as otherwise provided in subpart D or H of this part, foreign civil aircraft may engage in commercial air operations only if there is carried on board the aircraft a permit issued by the Department in accordance with this subpart authorizing the operations involved.
(b) Aircraft are not authorized to engage in air transportation under this section. Where an operation involves the carriage of persons, property or mail for compensation or hire, the Department will determine whether particular flights for which a permit is sought will be in common carriage, and therefore in air transportation, based on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the applicant's entire operations. The burden rests upon the applicant in each instance to demonstrate by an appropriate factual showing that the contemplated operation will not constitute common carriage from, to or within the United States. In general, an applicant that holds itself out to the public, or to a particular class or segment, as willing to furnish transportation for hire is a common carrier.
§ 375.41
Agricultural and industrial operations within the United States.
Foreign civil aircraft shall not be used for such commercial air operations as crop dusting, pest control, pipeline patrol, mapping, surveying, banner towing, skywriting or similar agricultural or industrial operations within the United States, including its territorial waters and overlying airspace, unless a permit has been issued by the Department and the operation is conducted in accordance with all applicable State and local laws and regulations as well as the applicable provisions of this part.
§ 375.42
Transport operations—occasional planeload charters.
Occasional planeload charters may be authorized where, because of their limited nature and extent, special equipment or facilities utilized, or other circumstances pertaining to them, it appears that they are not within the scope of the applicant's normal holding out of transportation services to the general public. Such charters are normally limited to those in which the entire capacity of the aircraft is engaged by a single charterer, and since they are occasional in nature, should not exceed for any one applicant more than six flights during a calendar year. This part does not authorize operations that
involve solicitation of the general public such as is usually involved in the transportation of individually-ticketed passengers or individually-waybilled cargo, or in which the charterer is a travel agent, a charter operator, a broker, an air freight forwarder or any other organization that holds itself out to the general public to provide transportation services. Carriage of cargo for the operator's own account is governed by the provisions of this section if the cargo is to be resold or otherwise used in the furtherance of a business other than the business of providing carriage by aircraft.
§ 375.43
Application for foreign aircraft permit.
(a) Applications for foreign aircraft permits shall be submitted on OST Form 4509 (see appendix A to this part), in duplicate, addressed to the Chief, Foreign Air Carrier Licensing Division, X-45, Office of International Aviation. Applications should be submitted by email; see “Application Procedures under Part 375” at
www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/licensing/foreign-carriers.
(b) Applications shall contain a proper identification (including citizenship) of the applicant (the operator of the aircraft concerned) and of the owner thereof (if different from the applicant), a description of the aircraft by make, model, and registration marks; and a full description of the operations for which authority is desired, indicating type and dates of operations and number of flights, and routing. In the case of cargo flights, the names of all contractors, agents, if any, and the beneficial owner of the cargo, and a description of the cargo and of the proposed operations shall be provided. In the case of passenger flights, a full identification and description of the group chartering the aircraft, and identification of the travel agent, if any, shall be provided. Applications shall also contain a statement as to whether the applicant's homeland allows operators of U.S.-registered aircraft to conduct similar operations.
(c) Applications shall be filed at least 15 days in advance of the proposed commencement date of the operations. The Department may direct the applicant to serve copies of its application on additional persons. Late applications may be considered by the Department upon a showing of good cause.
(d)(1) Any party in interest may file a memorandum supporting or opposing an application. Two copies of each memorandum shall be filed within 7 business days after the application is filed but no later than the proposed commencement date of the operations. Memoranda will be considered to the extent practicable; the Department may act on an application without waiting for supporting or opposing memoranda to be filed.
(2) Each memorandum shall set forth the reasons why the applications should be granted or denied, accompanied by whatever data, including affidavits, the Department is asked to consider.
(3) A copy of each memorandum shall be served on the applicant.
(e)(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Department, each application and memorandum filed in response shall be available for public inspection at the Licensing Division of the Office of International Aviation immediately upon filing. Notice of the filing of all applications shall be published in the Department's Weekly List of Applications Filed.
(2) Any person objecting to public disclosure of any information in an application or memorandum must state the grounds for the objection in writing. If the Department finds that disclosure of all or part of the information should be withheld under applicable provisions of law, and the public interest does not require disclosure, it will order that the injurious information be withheld.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2106-0002)
[OST Doc. No. 42547, 51 FR 7254, Mar. 3, 1986, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 375.44
Issuance of permit.
(a) The Department will issue a foreign aircraft permit if it finds that the proposed operations meet the requirements of this part and are in the public interest. Foreign aircraft permits may be conditioned or limited by the Department. Permits must be carried
aboard the applicant's aircraft during flight over U.S. territory, and are not transferable.
(b) In determining whether to grant a particular application, the Department will consider, among other factors, the extent to which the country of the applicant's nationality deals with U.S. civil aircraft operators on the basis of substantial reciprocity, and whether the operation is otherwise in the public interest.
§ 375.45
Records and reports of occasional planeload charters.
(a)
Cargo documents.
The holder of a permit for cargo operations shall issue a manifest or shipping document to its shipper with respect to each shipment.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Contents of documents for passenger flights.
The holder of a permit for passenger charters originating or terminating in the United States shall require each charterer to file with it prior to flight a list of names and addresses of all passengers to be transported on each flight.
(d)
Reports of unused authority.
All foreign operators of occasional planeload charters for which authority is granted must notify the Department, in writing, not later than 15 days after the expiration of their permits, or their failure to use this authority. The unused authority shall otherwise be deemed to have been exercised.

# Subpart F—Transit Flights
§ 375.50
Transit flights; scheduled international air service operations.
(a)
Requirement of notice.
Scheduled international air services proposed to be operated pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement in transit across the United States may not be undertaken by foreign civil aircraft unless the operator of such aircraft, and (if other than the operator) the carrier offering such service to the public, has, not less than 30 days prior to the date of commencement of such service, filed a Notice of Proposed Transit Flights Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b)
Filing of the notice.
An original and two copies of the Notice shall be filed with the Chief, Foreign Air Carrier Licensing Division, X-45, Office of International Aviation. Copies of the Notice shall be served upon the Department of State and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. The filing date shall be the date of actual receipt by the Department.
(c)
Content of notice.
A “Notice of Proposed Transit Flights Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement” shall be clearly labeled as such, and as a minimum shall set forth, with whatever detail may be necessary, the following information:
(1) The name, country or organization, and citizenship of the operator, and, if other than the operator, of the carrier offering the services to the public. If any interest (direct or indirect) in the operator or offeror of services is held by nationals of a country other than the country of organization or citizenship, the nature and extent of such interest must be fully disclosed. If any officer or director of the operator or carrier offering the services is a national of a country other than the country of organization or citizenship, the position of duties of such officer or director, and the officer and director's relevant position in relation to other officers and directors must similarly be fully disclosed. If the information required in this subsection has been previously supplied to the Department, the applicant may incorporate it by reference.
(2) The State of registration of the aircraft proposed to be operated.
(3) A full description of the proposed operations including the type of operations (passenger, property, mail, or combination), date of commencement, duration and frequency of flights, and routing (including each terminal and intermediate point to be served).
(4) A statement as to whether or not any advertisement or publication of the proposed operations has been made in the United States. If there has been any advertisement or publication of the operations in the United States, copies of all such advertisements or publications shall be included.
(5) Any change with respect to these matters (minor changes in schedules or
routing excepted) shall also be filed with the Department.
(d)
Authorized operations.
If the operator and the carrier offering services to the public (if different from the operator) have filed a “Notice of Proposed Transit Flights Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement,” at least 30 days before the date of commencement of the proposed operations in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the described operations may be commenced and performed without further authorization from the Department, unless and until the Department issues an order notifying the operator and/or the carrier offering the services to the public that, considering the matters submitted in the Notice, the Department is of the view that a question may exist as to whether:
(1) The proposed services are authorized pursuant to the terms of the International Air Services Transit Agreement;
(2) Substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of a State party to the International Air Services Transit Agreement;
(3) The proposed operations will be in compliance with the laws of the United States, the Department's rules, or the provisions of this section; or
(4) The operator or its government have performed their obligations under the International Air Services Transit Agreement.
(e)
Prohibited operations.
If the Department issues an order of notification as described in paragraph (d) of this section, neither the operator, nor the carrier offering the services to the public, shall commence the proposed operations, or, except as may be otherwise specified in the order, operate any flights subsequent to receipt of the order, unless and until the Department issues a foreign aircraft permit pursuant to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 41703 and this part specifically authorizing such operations.
(f)
Foreign aircraft permit—application and procedures.
If the Department issues an Order of Notification as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier's Notice of Proposed Transit Flights Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement shall be treated as an application for the required foreign aircraft permit, and further procedures on such application shall be as directed by the Department.
(g)
Short notice filing.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as precluding the filing of an application for a foreign aircraft permit to perform transit operations pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement less than 30 days in advance of the proposed operation. No such flights shall be operated, however, unless or until a specific foreign aircraft permit has been issued by the Department.
(h)
Nature of privilege conferred.
Air transportation is not authorized under this section, and the burden rests upon each operator and carrier to show that the proposed operations will not constitute air transportation within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII. In addition, each operator and carrier has the burden of demonstrating that the proposed operations are authorized by the International Air Services Transit Agreement, and that the appropriate authorization should not be withheld pursuant to section 5 of Article I thereof. Stopovers for the convenience or pleasure of the passengers are not authorized under this section and stops other than for strictly operational reasons shall not be made. The consolidation on the same aircraft of an operation under this section with a service authorized under 49 U.S.C. 41301 or 41709 is not authorized by this section. Any authorization or permit granted under this section is nontransferable, and may be withheld, revoked, suspended, withdrawn, or cancelled by the Department, without notice or hearing, if required by the public interest. Operators of aircraft registered in countries not parties to the International Air Services Transit Agreement shall make special application to the Department under § 375.70.

# Subpart G—Penalties
§ 375.60
Penalties.
The operation of a foreign aircraft within the United States or over adjacent territorial waters in violation of the provisions of this part constitutes a violation of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII and of this chapter, and may, in addition, constitute a violation of the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration. Such operation makes the person or persons responsible for the violation or violations subject to a civil penalty as provided in 49 U.S.C. 46301, and to the alteration, amendment, modification, suspension or revocation of any permit issued under this part and of any U.S. certificate involved as provided in 49 U.S.C. 44709. Engaging in air transportation as defined in 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII by a foreign aircraft without a foreign air carrier permit issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 41301 or an exemption, or in violation of the terms of such authority constitutes not only a violation of this part but of Title 49, subtitle VII, as well, which entails a criminal penalty as set forth in 49 U.S.C. 46316.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]

# Subpart H—Special Authorization
§ 375.70
Special authorization.
Any person desiring to navigate a foreign civil aircraft within the United States other than as specifically provided in this part may petition the Department for a special authorization to conduct the particular flight or series of flights. Such authorization may be issued only if the Department finds that the proposed operation is fully consistent with the applicable law, that the applicant's homeland grants a similar privilege with respect to operators of U.S.-registered aircraft, and that the proposed operation is in the interest of the public of the United States.

§ 377.2
Applicability of part.
(a) This part implements the last sentence of 5 U.S.C. 558(c) with regard to temporary authorizations granted by the Department.

# Note:
The last sentence of 5 U.S.C. 558(c) provides: “When the licensee has made timely and sufficient application for a renewal or a new license in accordance with agency rules, a license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency.”
(b) Nothing in this part prevents the Department from terminating at any time, in accordance with law, any authorization or any extension of an authorization.
(c) Nothing in this part constitutes a determination that any given authorization is a “license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c).
[SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, Feb. 18, 1982, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 377.3
Authorizations not covered by 5 U.S.C. 558(c).
The Department hereby determines that the following authorizations are not licenses “with reference to an activity of a continuing nature” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c):
(a) Authorizations granted for a specified period of 180 days or less; and
(b) Authorizations, other than those granted under 49 U.S.C. 41102, that by their terms are subject to termination at an uncertain date upon the happening of an event, including fulfillment of a condition subsequent or occurrence of a contingency.
[SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, Feb. 18, 1982, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 377.4
Certain authorizations with alternative termination dates.
Unless granted under 49 U.S.C. 41102, an authorization that by its terms is subject to termination alternatively, either at an uncertain date upon the happening of an event or upon the arrival of a specified date:
(a) Will not be considered a “license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature” within the meaning of
5 U.S.C. 558(c), if the event occurs before the specified date; and
(b) Ordinarily (subject to interpretation under § 377.5) will be considered such a license, if the event does not occur before the specified date and that date is more than 180 days after the effective date of the authorization.
[SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, Feb. 18, 1982, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 377.5
Procedure to obtain Department interpretation.
(a) The Department will determine upon written request by the holder of a temporary authorization or by any competitively affected air carrier or foreign air carrier, or upon its own initiative, whether the temporary authorization is a “license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c).
(b) A written request for such a Department determination shall be filed at least 60 days before the deadline set forth in § 377.10 for a timely renewal application.
(c) The filing of such a written request shall not affect the timeliness requirements for renewal applications that are set forth in § 377.10 or any other applicable Department rule or order.
[SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, Feb. 18, 1982, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]

# Subpart B—Renewal Applications and Procedure Thereon
§ 377.10
Requirements for, and effect of, renewal applications.
(a)
Identification of authorization covered by renewal application.
Each renewal application shall identify the authorization or authorizations to which it is intended to relate. The application shall indicate the applicant's intention to rely upon 5 U.S.C. 558(c) as implemented by this part. In case of applications for renewal of an authorization for route service, the renewal application shall specifically identify the separate routes which the applicant proposes to continue serving pursuant to the expiring authorization, pending final determination of the renewal application.
(b)
Contents of renewal application.
The application must contain all the information required by law and the Department's regulations, and meet the requirements thereof as to form. The new authorization sought need not be of the same duration as the expiring authorization. If the application relates to renewal of route authority, it must contain, as a minimum, a request for renewed authority to render route service between the terminals named in each separate route for which renewal is requested.
(c)
Timeliness.
The application must be filed and served in compliance with applicable law and the Department's regulations at least 60 days before the expiration date of the outstanding temporary authorization, except that:
(1) For certificates issued under 49 U.S.C. 41102 with a specified expiration date, the deadline is 180 days before the expiration date;
(2) For certificates issued under 49 U.S.C. 41102 that terminate by their terms upon the happening of an event that could not be foreseen, the deadline is 30 days after the time that the carrier has notice that the event will occur or has occurred;
(3) For foreign air carrier permits issued under 49 U.S.C. 41301 and exemptions issued under 49 U.S.C. 41708 to non-U.S. citizens, the deadline is the expiration date itself;
(4) For renewal by substantially equivalent certificate authority of fixed term route authorizations granted by exemption and for interim extension of the exemption, pursuant to § 399.18 of this chapter, the deadline is 90 days before the expiration date; and
(5) Nothing in this part supersedes a requirement for earlier filing contained in any law, Department rule or order, or temporary authorization.
(d)
Effect.
In the case of authorizations which constitute licenses with reference to activities of a continuing nature within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c), the filing of an application complying in all respects with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section shall extend the authorization to which it relates as then outstanding in its entirety, together with
all applicable terms, conditions and limitations, until the application has been finally determined by the Department. In the case of routes granted under 49 U.S.C. 41102, the duty to render adequate service continues to attach to every point as provided in the expired authorization which is extended pursuant to this provision. The date of final determination of the application shall be the date when the final order determining the application takes effect, or when the applicable period for filing of petitions for rehearing, reargument or reconsideration expires, or when a timely filed petition therefor is denied, whichever occurs latest.
[SPR-84, 40 FR 24998, June 12, 1975, as amended by SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, Feb. 18, 1982; 65 FR 6457, Feb. 9, 2000; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 377.11
Processing of defective renewal applications.
When the Department determines that a renewal application does not comply with the requirements of this part, or that it does not relate to a license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature, it will so notify the applicant. The applicant may amend his application to cure the deficiency as a matter of right at any time prior to the date when the application was due pursuant to § 377.10(c).
[SPR-84, 40 FR 24998, June 12, 1975, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15940, Apr. 16, 2019]

Applicability.
This part applies to Public Charter air transportation of passengers in interstate or foreign air transportation, whether furnished by direct air carriers or Public Charter operators. This part also relieves such charter operators from various provisions of subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (statute), for the purpose of enabling them to provide Public Charters utilizing aircraft chartered from such direct air carriers. It also declines jurisdiction over foreign Public Charter operators operating foreign-originating Public Charters.

§ 380.31
General requirements for operator-participant contracts.

If a member of a group that will travel together pays for the group, that member may sign the contract on behalf of the group.
(b) For telephone sales only, the charter operator may accept payment by credit card without the participant having first signed an operator-participant contract provided that the charter operator first advises the customer:
(1) That he or she has the right to receive the operator-participant contract before making a booking;

(d) If there is no space available on the flight or specific alternative flights requested by the participant the operator shall return all the participant's money within 7 days after receiving it unless the participant, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, has authorized the operator to retain the payments while the operator attempts to make other arrangements for the participant. If the operator retains the payments while attempting to make other arrangements for the participant, it shall notify the participant of the fact within 7 days after receiving the payments, but in no event later than the departure. For the purpose of the time periods in this paragraph, receipt of money by a travel agent on behalf of a charter operator will not be considered as receipt by the operator.
(e) Except as set forth in § 380.33a for operator's option plan contracts, the operator-participant contract shall not specify alternative dates for the outbound or return flights, or alternative origin or destination cities for any flight leg.

1
or, when the charter is sold to the participant by a retail
travel agent, checks and money orders may be made payable to the agent, who must in turn make his check payable to the escrow account at the depository bank;
1
If the credit card merchant account is separate from the depository account, it must be used solely as a conduit, i.e., all credit card payments toward Public Charter trips must be immediately remitted to the depository account in full, without holdback, or retention of any portion of the participant's payment. If the depository bank is not the credit card merchant bank, the Department must be satisfied that there are adequate procedural safeguards for the protection of participants' payments.

(j) That if a charter is canceled less than 10 days before departure (
i.e.,
for circumstances that make it physically impossible to perform the charter trip), the operator will get the message to the participant as soon as possible;
(k) That if the charter is canceled, a refund will be made to the participant within 14 days after the cancellation;
(l) The right to refunds if the participant changes plans is limited;
(m) The right to refunds if the participant changes plans, including
(1) The right to a full refund, for sales made by credit card, until an operator-participant contract is signed; and

(n) The procedure for obtaining the refunds described in paragraph (m) of this section, including that they will be made within 14 days after the cancellation or substitution;
(o) The meaning of “major change”, as set forth in § 380.33(a);
(p) That if the charter operator knows of a major change 10 or more days before scheduled departure, the operator will notify the participant of the change within 7 days after first knowing of it, but in any event at least 10 days before scheduled departure;
(q) That if the operator first knows of a major change less than 10 days before scheduled departure, the operator will get the message to the participant as soon as possible;
(r) That within 7 days after receiving a pre-departure notification of a major change but in no event later than departure, the participant may cancel, and that a full refund will be made to the participant within 14 days after canceling;
(s) That upon a post-departure notification of a major change, the participant may reject the substituted hotel or the changed date, origin, or destination of a flight leg and be sent, within 14 days after the return date named in the contract, a refund of the portion of his payment allocable to the hotel accommodations or air transportation not provided;
(t) That the participant's rights and remedies set forth in the contract, including the procedures for major changes, shall be in addition to any other rights or remedies available under applicable law, although the operator may condition a refund on the participant's waiver of additional remedies;
(u) That trip cancellation, health, and accident insurance is available and that the operator will furnish details of the insurance to participants who check the space provided for this purpose on the contract form;
(v) The name and address of the surety company or bank issuing the security agreement; and that unless the charter participant files a claim with the charter operator or, if he is unavailable, with the securer, within 60 days after termination of the charter, the securer shall be released from all liability under the security agreement to that participant. Termination means the date of arrival (or in the case of a canceled charter, the intended date of arrival) of the return flight. If there is no return flight in a participant's itinerary, termination means the date or intended date of departure of the last flight in the participant's itinerary;
(w) For international flights only: That additional restrictions may be imposed on the flight by the foreign government involved, and that if landing rights are denied by a foreign government the flight will be canceled with a full refund to the participant. This statement need not be included in the contract if—
(1) The prospectus includes a certification by the charter operator and the direct air carrier that landing rights have been obtained from all the foreign governments involved, and
(2) All the foreign governments involved have adopted country-of-origin rules for charterworthiness;
(x) That the charter operator is the principal and is responsible to the participants for all services and accommodations offered in connection with the charter. However, the contract may expressly provide that the charter operator, unless negligent, is not responsible for personal injury or property damage caused by any direct air carrier, hotel or other supplier of services in connection with the charter.

§ 380.33
Major changes in itinerary or price; refunds.
(a) For the purposes of this section, “major change” means any of the following:
(1) A change in the departure or return date shown in the operator-participant contract, (or, if the contract states alternative dates, the date designated to the participant by the charter operator in accordance with § 380.33a(b)), unless the change results from a flight delay. In any event, however, a date change that the operator knows of more than 2 days before the scheduled flight date, and any delay of more than 48 hours, will be considered a major change.
(2) A change in the origin or destination city shown in the operator-participant contract for any flight leg (or, if the contract states alternative cities, the city designated to the participant by the operator in accordance with § 380.33a(b)), unless the change affects only the order in which cities named in a tour package are visited.
(3) A substitution of any hotel that is not named in the operator-participant contract; and
(4) A price increase to the participant that occurs 10 or more days before departure and results in an aggregate price increase of more than 10 percent.
(b) The charter operator shall not increase the price to any participant less than 10 days before departure.
(c) The charter operator shall notify all participants of major changes, as required by the operator-participant contracts. This notification shall include the participants' rights to refunds required to be described in the operator-participant contract. The operator shall, if applicable, also notify the participants that the acceptance of a refund constitutes a waiver of their legal rights.
(d) Except as otherwise specified, notifications and refunds required by this part are considered made at the time they are mailed or sent by an equivalent method.
(e) The charter operator shall make all refunds required to be described in the operator-participant contract within the time limits set forth in paragraphs (k), (n), (r), and (s) of § 380.32, as applicable.
§ 380.33a
Operator's option plan.
(a) For the purposes of this part, an operator's option plan contract that states alternative dates for the outbound or return flights, or alternative origin or destination cities for any flight leg.
(b) Operator's option plan contracts shall state, in addition to the information required by § 380.32, that the selection of the actual dates or cities, as applicable, is at the charter operator's option and will not entitle the participant to a refund, and that the operator will notify the participant of the actual dates or cities at least 10 days before the earliest of any alternative dates for the outbound flight.
(c) Contract forms for all operator's option plan contracts shall be labeled “OPERATOR'S OPTION PLAN” in bold-faced capital letters at least
1/4
inch high. The statement required by paragraph (b) of this section and the statement of alternative dates (§ 380.32(c)) or alternative cities
(§ 380.32(d)), as applicable, shall be printed so as to contrast with the rest of the contract, as set forth in § 380.31(f).
(d) Any solicitation material that states a price per passenger for an operator's option plan contract shall clearly and conspicuously—
(1) Identify that price as being for the operator's option plan,
(2) Name all the possible dates or cities, as applicable, and
(3) State that the selection of the actual dates or cities is at the charter operator's option.
(e) Charter operators and their agents shall not misrepresent to prospective participants, orally, in solicitation materials, or otherwise, the probability that any particular city or date will be selected from among the alternatives named in an operator's option plan contract.
(f) The charter operator shall notify all participants with operator's option plan contracts of the actual dates or cities, as applicable, as required by contracts.
§ 380.34
Security and depository agreements.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the charter operator or foreign charter operator shall furnish a security agreement in an amount for not less than the charter price for the air transportation, if only air transportation is involved, or, if the charter involves land accommodations in addition to air transportation, a security agreement in one of the following amounts dependent upon the length of the charter or series of charters:
(1) For a charter or series of charters of 14 days or less, security in an amount of not less than the charter price for the air transportation to be furnished in connection with such charter or series of charters;
(2) For a charter or series of charters of more than 14 days but less than 28 days security in an amount of not less than twice the charter price; and
(3) For a charter or series of charters of 28 days or more, security in an amount of not less than three times the charter price: Provided, however, That the liability of the securer to any charter participant shall not exceed amounts paid by that participant to the charter operator with respect to the charter.
(b) The direct air carrier and the charter operator or foreign charter operator may elect, in lieu of furnishing a security agreement as provided under paragraph (a) of this section, to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, as follows:
(1) The charter operator shall furnish a security agreement in an amount of at least $10,000 times the number of flights, except that the amount need not be more than $200,000. The liability of the securer to any charter participant shall not exceed the amount paid by the participant to the charter operator for that charter.
(2) The direct air carrier and charter operator or foreign charter operator shall enter into an agreement with a designated bank, the terms of which shall provide that all payments by charter participants paid to charter operators or foreign charter operators and their retail travel agents shall be deposited with and maintained by the bank subject to the following conditions:
(i) On sales made to charter participants by charter operators or foreign charter operators the participant shall pay by check, money order, or credit card draft payable to the bank;
2
on sales made to charter participants by retail travel agents, the retail travel agent may deduct his commission and remit the balance to the designated bank by check, money order, or electronic transfer: Provided, That the travel agent agrees in writing with the charter operator or foreign charter operator that if the charter is canceled the travel agent shall remit to the bank the full amount of the commission previously deducted or received within 10 days after receipt of notification of cancellation of the charter; except for the credit card company's usual commission (not to exceed 3 percent), the charter operator shall not permit any portion of a charter participant's payments by credit card to be
“held back” by the credit card merchant bank;

See also n.1,
supra.

“Holdback” is an amount in excess of usual commissions that a credit card merchant bank sometimes retains to cover potential charge-backs or other charges.
(ii) The bank shall pay the direct air carrier the charter price for the transportation not earlier than 60 days (including day of departure) prior to the scheduled day of departure of the originating or returning flight, upon certification of the departure date by the air carrier: Provided, That, in the case of a round trip charter contract to be performed by one carrier, the total round trip charter price shall be paid to the carrier not earlier than 60 days prior to the scheduled day of departure of the originating flight;
(iii) The bank shall reimburse the charter operator or foreign charter operator for refunds made by the latter to the charter participant upon written notification from the charter operator or foreign charter operator;
(iv) If the charter operator, foreign charter operator or the direct air carrier notifies the bank that a charter has been canceled, the bank shall make applicable refunds directly to the charter participants;
(v) After the charter price has been paid in full to the direct air carrier, the bank shall pay funds from the account directly to the hotels, sightseeing enterprises, or other persons or companies furnishing ground accommodations and services, if any, in connection with the charter or series of charters upon presentation to the bank of vendors' bills and upon certification by the charter operator or foreign charter operator of the amounts payable for such ground accommodations and services and the person or companies to whom payment is to be made: Provided, however, That the total amounts paid by the bank pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (v) of this section shall not exceed either the total cost of the air transportation, or 80 percent of the total deposits received by the bank less any refunds made to charter participants pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (iv) of this section, whichever is greater;
(vi) As used in this section, the term “bank” means a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
(vii) The bank shall maintain a separate accounting for each charter group;
(viii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the amount of total cash deposits required to be maintained in the depository account of the bank may be reduced by one or both of the following: The amount of the security agreement in the form prescribed in this section in excess of the minimum coverage required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section; an escrow with the designated bank of Federal, State, or municipal bonds or other securities, consisting of certificates of deposit issued by banks having a stated policy of redeeming such certificates before maturity at the request of the holder (subject only to such interest penalties or other conditions as may be required by law), or negotiable securities which are publicly traded on a securities exchange, all such securities to be made payable to the escrow account: Provided, That such other securities shall be substituted in an amount no greater than 80 percent of the total market value of the escrow account at the time of such substitution: And provided, further, That should the market value of such other securities subsequently decrease, from time to time, then additional cash or securities qualified for investment hereunder shall promptly be added to the escrow account, in an amount equal to the amount of such decreased value; and
(ix) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i), (iii), (iv), (v), and (viii) of this section, the bank shall not pay out any funds from the account prior to 2 banking days after completion of each charter, when the balance in the account shall be paid the charter operator or foreign charter operator, upon certification of the completion date by the direct air carrier: Provided, however, That if the Charter involves air transportation only and the bank has paid the direct air carrier(s) the charter price for the originating flight, and the returning flight if any, and has paid all refunds due to participants, as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) and (iii), respectively, of this section, then the bank
may pay the balance in the account to the charter operator upon certification by the direct air carrier performing the originating flight that such flight has in fact departed.
(c)(1) The security agreement required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall insure the financial responsibility of the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the supplying of the transportation and all other accommodations, services, and facilities in accordance with the contract between the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the charter participants.
(2) The security agreement may be either:
(i) A surety bond in the form set forth as appendix A to this part;
(ii) A surety trust agreement in the form set forth as appendix B to this part; or
(iii) An arrangement with a bank (for instance, a standby letter of credit) that provides protection of charter participants' funds equivalent to or greater than that provided by the Bond in appendix A. An arrangement that furnishes a lesser degree of protection than would be provided under the bond shall be invalid to that extent, and instead the bank, the charter operator or foreign charter operator, and the charter participants shall have the same rights and liabilities as provided under a bond in the form of appendix A. If the arrangement does not give as much protection as a bond against the risk of the charter operator's bankruptcy, the bank shall be liable in the event of bankruptcy to the same extent as if it had entered into a bond.
(3) Any agreement under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section shall include a statement that, in the event that the other provisions of the agreement do not provide protection to charter participants comparable to that provided under a bond in the form of appendix A, the bank shall assume, for the benefit of the charter participants, all the liabilities it would have if it entered into the bond.
(4) The security agreement shall be effective on or before the date the charter prospectus is filed with the Department.
(5) The security agreement shall be specifically identified by the issuing securer with a numbering system so that the Department can identify the security agreement with the specific charter or charters to which it relates. These data may be set forth in an addendum attached to the security agreement, which addendum must be signed by the charter operator or foreign charter operator and the securer.
(6) When security is provided by a surety bond, such bond shall be issued by a bonding or surety company that is listed in Best's Insurance Reports (Fire and Casualty) with a general policyholders' rating of “A” or better. The bonding or surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State in which the charter originates. For purposes of this section the term “State” includes any territory or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia.
(7) When security is provided by a security agreement other than a bond, the agreement shall be issued by a national bank complying with the provisions of 12 CFR 7.7010(a), or by a State bank complying with applicable State laws that give authority to issue such agreements, and all such banks must be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
(d) The security agreement required by this section shall provide that unless the charter participant files a claim with the charter operator or foreign charter operator, or, if it is unavailable, with the securer, within 60 days after termination of the charter, the securer shall be released from all liability under the security agreement to such charter participant. Terminations means the date of arrival (or in the case of a canceled charter, the intended date of arrival) of the return flight. If there is no return flight in a participant's itinerary, termination means the date or intended date of departure of the last flight in the participant's itinerary.

§ 380.34a
Substitution of direct air carrier's security or depository agreement.
(a) A direct air carrier may substitute its own security agreement and/or depository arrangements, as specified in this section, for those required of the charter operator under § 380.34, but only for charter trips in which all the air transportation is provided by one direct air carrier. Charter operators are relieved from § 380.34 to the extent that the direct carrier substitutes its own arrangements.
(b) The direct air carrier may substitute its security agreement for all of the arrangements required of the charter operator under § 380.34 (a) or (b). Alternatively, it may substitute its depository agreement for the depository agreement required of the charter operator under § 380.34(b)(2). If the direct carrier substitutes its depository agreement, it may also obtain and substitute a security agreement for the one otherwise required of the charter operator under § 380.34(b)(1). If the direct carrier substitutes its depository agreement only, the charter operator must supply the security agreement required under § 380.34(b)(1).
(c) If the direct carrier substitutes a security agreement for all the charter operator's requirements under § 380.34, the charter operator shall include in the charter prospectus, in place of the information in § 380.28(a)(2) regarding the charter operator's security agreement:
(1) A statement by the direct air carrier on OST Form 4535 that it will take responsibility for all charter participant payments (including those for ground accommodations and services) and for the fulfillment of all the charter operator's contractual and regulatory obligations to the charter participants.
(2) A statement from the direct air carrier and its securer (under § 212.12 of this chapter), OST Form 4533, that they have entered into a security agreement assuring the direct air carrier's responsibilities to charter participants under this section in an unlimited amount (except that the liability of the securer with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant), and that the securer has received a copy of the proposed flight schedule identified by the schedule number assigned by the charter operator under this part.
(d) A substitute depository agreement under this section shall be signed by the direct air carrier, the charter operator, and the depository bank, and shall provide, in addition to existing requirements under § 212.8 of this chapter, that:
(1) Payments by or on behalf of charter participants shall be allocated to the flight accounts matching the participant's itinerary in the following way: Each account shall have allocated to it the charter cost of the participant's air transportation on that flight.

§ 381.3
Applicability.
This part applies to Special Event Tours that are in interstate air transportation, or in foreign air transportation originating at a point in the United States. This part applies to U.S. and foreign operators of Special Event Tours, whether they be air carriers or ticket agents. This part applies to scheduled, charter, and other air transportation.
§ 381.5
Definition.
Special Event Tour
means a tour that is organized for the purpose of attending a sporting, social, religious, educational, cultural, political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exists for reasons apart from the tour itself, and which is represented by the operator of the tour as including admission to that event. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, college and professional sporting events, the Olympics, concerts, the Passion Play in Oberammergau, etc.
§ 381.7
Advertising.
No operator of a Special Event Tour or agent of such an operator shall conduct, or cause or allow to be conducted, any advertising, solicitation or other promotion for a Special Event Tour unless:
(a) The operator is in physical possession of enough tickets for admission to the event to provide such tickets for a substantial number of seats on the tour; or
(b) The operator has entered into a written contract with an organization that is the distributor of such tickets or an organization that receives such tickets directly from the distributor (e.g., a bowl committee; football conference, league or team; concert promoter or arena; etc.), the terms of which provide for that organization to furnish the operator enough admission tickets to provide such tickets for a substantial number of seats on the tour; or
(c) The operator has entered into a written contract with another person or organization that has a written contract or series of written contracts with the distributor of such tickets or with an organization that receives such tickets directly from the distributor, the terms of which provide for that organization (the organization with which the operator has contracted) to furnish the operator enough admission tickets to provide such tickets for a substantial number of seats on the tour.

(2) Upon acceptance of the money for a sale, the operator must reserve one event ticket for that individual. An operator may not sell more seats on the tour than it has event tickets in hand or under contract. (An operator need not continue to reserve an event ticket for an individual who withdraws from the tour by providing notice to the operator or by being notified by the operator that the individual's participation has been canceled due to failure to remit a required installment payment.)
(b) An operator of a Special Event Tour may accept a booking and payment from an individual for whom the operator does not have an event ticket in hand or under contract if that individual agrees in writing that he or she understands that no event ticket has been reserved for him or her. This agreement shall specify whether the person has agreed to participate in the tour without an event ticket and/or the operator has agreed to attempt to acquire an event ticket for this person. If the two parties agree that the operator will attempt to acquire an event ticket, the agreement shall specify any penalties that will apply if the individual later cancels because an event ticket did not become available. If the operator notifies this person that an event ticket has become available, that person shall enjoy all the other protections of this part from that time.
§ 381.11
Refunds.

§ 382.3, Nt.

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102441, Dec. 17, 2024, § 382.3 was amended by adding in alphabetical order definitions for “Custody”, “Dignified”, “Hands-on training”, “Mishandled”, and “Safe”, effective Jan. 16, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the added text is set forth as follows:
§ 382.3
What do the terms in this rule mean?
Custody
means the time period when a passenger has checked a wheelchair, scooter, or other assistive device with a carrier and the carrier has control of a passenger's wheelchair, scooter, or other assistive device.
(1) An airline's custody begins when the passenger hands the device to an airline's representative or agent or leaves the wheelchair, scooter, or other assistive device at a location as instructed by the airline.
(2) An airline's custody ends when the passenger, or someone acting on behalf of the passenger, or another airline takes physical possession of the wheelchair, scooter, or other assistive device.
Dignified
means assistance provided in a manner that respects a passenger's independence, autonomy, and privacy, which includes but is not limited to: airline personnel providing transfer assistance in a manner that ensures the passenger's clothing is not removed; airline personnel not unduly delaying requests for access to a restroom such that the individual soils himself or herself; and, to the maximum extent possible, airline personnel communicating directly with the individual with disability (
e.g.,
rather than his or her companion or another individual) when the individual with disability is interacting with them.
Hands-on training
means in-person training that is received by an employee or contractor where the employee or contractor can learn and practice real-life scenarios in a safe and controlled environment without the possibility of real-life consequences to passengers with disabilities and with the use of a suitable life-sized model or equipment, as appropriate.
Mishandled
means lost, delayed, damaged, or pilfered.
Safe
means assistance provided to individuals with disabilities that does not put them at heightened risk of bodily injury, which may include loss or damage to wheelchairs and other assistive devices that result in bodily injury.
§ 382.5
When are U.S. and foreign carriers required to begin complying with the provisions of this part?
As a U.S. or foreign carrier, you are required to comply with the requirements of this part on May 13, 2009, except as otherwise provided in individual sections of this part.
§ 382.7
To whom do the provisions of this part apply?
(a) If you are a U.S. carrier, this Part applies to you with respect to all your operations and aircraft, regardless of where your operations take place, except as otherwise provided in this part.
(b) If you are a foreign carrier, this part applies to you only with respect to flights you operate that begin or end at a U.S. airport and to aircraft used for these flights. For purposes of this part, a “flight” means a continuous journey in the same aircraft or with one flight number that begins or ends at a U.S. airport. The following are some examples of the application of this term:

# Example 1 to paragraph (b):
A passenger books a nonstop flight on a foreign carrier from New York to Frankfurt, or Frankfurt to New York. Each of these is a “flight” for purposes of this Part.

# Example 2 to paragraph (b):
A passenger books a journey on a foreign carrier from New York to Prague. The foreign carrier flies nonstop to Frankfurt. The passenger gets off the plane in Frankfurt and boards a connecting flight (with a different flight number), on the same foreign carrier or a different carrier, which goes to Prague. The New York-Frankfurt leg of the journey is a “flight” for purposes of this Part; the Frankfurt-Prague leg is not. On the reverse routing, the Prague-Frankfurt leg is not a covered flight for purposes of this Part, while the Frankfurt-New York leg is.

# Example 3 to paragraph (b):
A passenger books a journey on a foreign carrier from New York to Prague. The plane stops for refueling and a crew change in Frankfurt. If, after deplaning in Frankfurt, the passengers originating in New York reboard the aircraft (or a different aircraft, assuming the flight number remains the same) and continue to Prague, they remain on a covered flight for purposes of this Part. This is because their transportation takes place on a direct flight between New York and Prague, even though it had an interim stop in Frankfurt. This example would also apply in the opposite direction (Prague to New York via Frankfurt).

# Example 4 to paragraph (b):
In Example 3, the foreign carrier is not subject to coverage under this Part with respect to a Frankfurt-originating passenger who boards the aircraft and goes to Prague, or a Prague-originating passenger who gets off the plane in Frankfurt and does not continue to New York.
(c) As a foreign carrier, you are not subject to the requirements of this part with respect to flights between two foreign points, even with respect to flights involving code-sharing arrangements with U.S. carriers. As a U.S. carrier that participates in a code-sharing arrangement with a foreign carrier with respect to flights between two foreign points, you (as distinct from the foreign carrier) are responsible for ensuring compliance with the service provisions of subparts A through C, E through H, and K of this part, with respect to passengers traveling under your code on such a flight.

# Example 1 to paragraph (c):
A passenger buys a ticket from a U.S. carrier for a journey from New York to Prague. The ticket carries the U.S. carrier's code and flight number throughout the entire journey. There is a change of carrier and aircraft in Frankfurt, and a foreign carrier operates the Frankfurt-Prague segment. The foreign carrier is not subject to the provisions of Part 382 for the Frankfurt-Prague segment. However, the U.S. carrier must ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of Part 382 on the Frankfurt-Prague segment with respect to passengers flying under its code, and the Department could take enforcement action against the U.S. carrier for acts or omissions by the foreign carrier.
(d) As a foreign carrier, if you operate a charter flight from a foreign airport to a U.S. airport, and return to a foreign airport, and you do not pick up any passengers in the U.S., the charter flight is not a flight subject to the requirements of this part.
(e) Unless a provision of this Part specifies application to a U.S. carrier or a foreign carrier, the provision applies to both U.S. and foreign carriers.
(f) If you are an indirect carrier, §§ 382.1 through 382.15 of this part apply to you. §§ 382.17 through 382.157 of this part do not apply to you except insofar as provided by § 382.11(b).
(g) Notwithstanding any provisions of this part, you must comply with all FAA safety regulations, TSA security
regulations, and foreign safety and security regulations having legally mandatory effect that apply to you.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009; 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020; 86 FR 41382, Aug. 2, 2021]
§ 382.9
What may foreign carriers do if they believe a provision of a foreign nation's law conflicts with compliance with a provision of this part?
(a) If you are a foreign carrier, and you believe that an applicable provision of the law of a foreign nation precludes you from complying with a provision of this part, you may request a waiver of the provision of this Part.
(b) You must send such a waiver request to the following address: Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, C-70 U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Room W96-322, Washington, DC 20590.
(c) Your waiver request must be in English and include the following elements:
(1) A copy, in the English language, of the foreign law involved;
(2) A description of how the foreign law applies and how it precludes compliance with a provision of this part;
(3) A description of the alternative means the carrier will use, if the waiver is granted, to effectively achieve the objective of the provision of this part subject to the waiver or, if applicable, a justification of why it would be impossible to achieve this objective in any way.
(d) The Department may grant the waiver request, or grant the waiver request subject to conditions, if it determines that the foreign law applies, that it does preclude compliance with a provision of this part, and that the carrier has provided an effective alternative means of achieving the objective of the provisions of this part subject to the waiver or have demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would be impossible to achieve this objective in any way.
(e)(1) If you submit a waiver request on or before September 10, 2008, the Department will, to the maximum extent feasible, respond to the request before May 13, 2009. If the Department does not respond to the waiver request by May 13, 2009, you may continue to implement the policy or practice that is the subject of your request until the Department does respond. The Department will not take enforcement action with respect to your implementation of the policy or practice during the time prior to the Department's response.
(2) If you submit a waiver request after September 10, 2008, the Department will, to the maximum extent feasible, respond to the request by May 13, 2009 or within 180 days of receiving it, whichever is later. If the Department does not respond to the waiver request by this date, you may continue to implement the policy or practice that is the subject of your request until the Department does respond. However, the Department may take enforcement action with respect to your implementation of the policy or practice during the time between May 13, 2009 and the date of the Department's response.
(3) If you submit a waiver request after September 10, 2008, and the request pertains to an applicable provision of the law of a foreign nation that did not exist on September 10, 2008, you may continue to implement the policy or practice that is the subject of your request until the Department responds to the request. The Department will, to the maximum extent feasible, respond to such requests within 180 days of receiving them. The Department will not take enforcement action with respect to your implementation of the policy or practice during the time prior to the Department's response.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Department may commence enforcement action at any time after May 13, 2009 with respect to the policy or practice that is the subject of the request if it finds the request to be frivolous or dilatory.
(g) If you have not submitted a request for a waiver under this section with respect to a provision of this part, or such a request has been denied, you cannot raise the alleged existence of such a conflict as a defense to an enforcement action.
§ 382.10
How does a U.S. or foreign carrier obtain a determination that it is providing an equivalent alternative to passengers with disabilities?
(a) As a U.S. or foreign carrier, you may apply to the Department for a determination that you are providing an equivalent alternative to passengers with disabilities.
(b) You must send your application for an equivalent alternative determination to the following address: Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings (C-70), U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Room W96-322, Washington, DC 20590.
(c) Your application must be in English and include the following elements:
(1) A citation to the specific provision of this part concerning which you are proposing an equivalent alternative.
(2) A detailed description of the alternative policy, practice, or other accommodation you are proposing to use in place of compliance with the provision of this part that you cite, and an explanation of how it provides substantially equivalent accessibility to passengers with disabilities.
(d) The Department may grant the application, or grant the application subject to conditions, if it determines that the proposed facilitation does provide substantially equivalent accessibility to passengers with disabilities, compared to compliance with the provision of this part in question.
(e) If your application is granted, you will be deemed to be in compliance with this Part through implementing the equivalent alternative. If your application is denied, you must implement this part as written.
(f)(1) If you submit your application on or before September 10, 2008, the Department will respond to the request before May 13, 2009 to the maximum extent feasible. If the Department does not respond to the application by May 13, 2009, you may implement your policy or practice that is the subject of your application until the Department does respond.
(2) With respect to an application you make after September 10, 2008, you must comply with the provisions of this part without change from May 13, 2009 until the Department responds to your application.

# Subpart B—Nondiscrimination and Access to Services and Information
§ 382.11
What is the general nondiscrimination requirement of this part?
(a) As a carrier, you must not do any of the following things, either directly or through a contractual, licensing, or other arrangement:
(1) You must not discriminate against any qualified individual with a disability, by reason of such disability, in the provision of air transportation;
(2) You must not require a qualified individual with a disability to accept special services (including, but not limited to, preboarding) that the individual does not request. However, you may require preboarding as a condition of receiving certain seating or in-cabin stowage accommodations, as specified in §§ 382.83(c), 382.85(b), and 382.123(a) of this part.
(3) You must not exclude a qualified individual with a disability from or deny the person the benefit of any air transportation or related services that are available to other persons, except where specifically permitted by this Part. This is true even if there are separate or different services available for individuals with a disability, except when specifically permitted by another section of this Part; and
(4) You must not take any adverse action against an individual (e.g., refusing to provide transportation) because the individual asserts, on his or her own behalf or through or on behalf of others, rights protected by this part or the Air Carrier Access Act.
(b) As an indirect carrier, you must comply with §§ 382.17 through 382.157 of this part when providing facilities or services to passengers that would have otherwise been provided by a direct air carrier.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010]
§ 382.11, Nt.

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102441, Dec. 17, 2024, § 382.11 was amended by redesignating paragraph (b) as paragraph (c) and adding new paragraph (b), effective Jan. 16, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the added text is set forth as follows:
§ 382.11
What is the general nondiscrimination requirement of this part?
(b) As a carrier or an indirect carrier, the assistance you provide with respect to this part must be performed in a safe and dignified manner.
§ 382.13
Do carriers have to modify policies, practices, and facilities to ensure nondiscrimination?
(a) As a carrier, you must modify your policies, practices, and facilities when needed to provide nondiscriminatory service to a particular individual with a disability, consistent with the standards of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended.
(b) This requirement is part of your general nondiscrimination obligation, and is in addition to your duty to make the specific accommodations required by this part.
(c) However, you are not required to make modifications that would constitute an undue burden or would fundamentally alter your program.
§ 382.15
Do carriers have to make sure that contractors comply with the requirements of this Part?
(a) As a carrier, you must make sure that your contractors that provide services to the public (including airports where applicable) meet the requirements of this part that would apply to you if you provided the services yourself.
(b) As a carrier, you must include an assurance of compliance with this part in your contracts with any contractors that provide services to the public that are subject to the requirements of this part. Noncompliance with this assurance is a material breach of the contract on the contractor's part.
(1) This assurance must commit the contractor to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Part in activities performed on behalf of the carrier.
(2) The assurance must also commit the contractor to implementing directives issued by your CROs under §§ 382.151 through 382.153.

(d) You remain responsible for your contractors' compliance with this part and for enforcing the assurances in your contracts with them.
(e) It is not a defense against an enforcement action by the Department under this part that your noncompliance resulted from action or inaction by a contractor.
§ 382.17
May carriers limit the number of passengers with a disability on a flight?
As a carrier, you must not limit the number of passengers with a disability who travel on a flight. (See also § 382.27(c)(6) of this part.)
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009]
§ 382.19
May carriers refuse to provide transportation on the basis of disability?
(a) As a carrier, you must not refuse to provide transportation to a passenger with a disability on the basis of his or her disability, except as specifically permitted by this part.
(b) You must not refuse to provide transportation to a passenger with a disability because the person's disability results in appearance or involuntary behavior that may offend, annoy, or inconvenience crewmembers or other passengers.
(c) You may refuse to provide transportation to any passenger on the basis of safety, as provided in 49 U.S.C. 44902 or 14 CFR 121.533, or to any passenger whose carriage would violate FAA or TSA requirements or applicable requirements of a foreign government.
(1) You can determine that there is a disability-related safety basis for refusing to provide transportation to a passenger with a disability if you are able to demonstrate that the passenger poses a direct threat (see definition in § 382.3). In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat, you must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain:
(i) The nature, duration, and severity of the risk;
(ii) The probability that the potential harm to the health and safety of others will actually occur; and
(iii) Whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.
(2) If you determine that the passenger does pose a direct threat, you must select the least restrictive response from the point of view of the passenger, consistent with protecting the health and safety of others. For example, you must not refuse transportation to the passenger if you can protect the health and safety of others by means short of a refusal.
(3) In exercising this authority, you must not act inconsistently with the provisions of this part.
(4) If your actions are inconsistent with any of the provisions of this part, you are subject to enforcement action under Subpart K of this part.
(d) If you refuse to provide transportation to a passenger on his or her originally-scheduled flight on a basis relating to the individual's disability, you must provide to the person a written statement of the reason for the refusal. This statement must include the specific basis for the carrier's opinion that the refusal meets the standards of paragraph (c) of this section or is otherwise specifically permitted by this part. You must provide this written statement to the person within 10 calendar days of the refusal of transportation.
§ 382.21
May carriers limit access to transportation on the basis that a passenger has a communicable disease or other medical condition?
(a) You must not do any of the following things on the basis that a passenger has a communicable disease or infection, unless you determine that the passenger's condition poses a direct threat:
(1) Refuse to provide transportation to the passenger;
(2) Delay the passenger's transportation (e.g., require the passenger to take a later flight);
(3) Impose on the passenger any condition, restriction, or requirement not imposed on other passengers; or
(4) Require the passenger to provide a medical certificate.
(b) In assessing whether the passenger's condition poses a direct threat, you must apply the provisions of § 382.19(c)(1)-(2) of this subpart.
(1) In making this assessment, you may rely on directives issued by public health authorities (e.g., the U.S. Centers for Disease Control or Public Health Service; comparable agencies in other countries; the World Health Organization).
(2) In making this assessment, you must consider the significance of the consequences of a communicable disease and the degree to which it can be readily transmitted by casual contact in an aircraft cabin environment.

# Example 1 to paragraph (b)(2):
The common cold is readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment but does not have severe health consequences. Someone with a cold would not pose a direct threat.

# Example 2 to paragraph (b)(2):
AIDS has very severe health consequences but is not readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment. Someone would not pose a direct threat because he or she is HIV-positive or has AIDS.

# Example 3 to paragraph (b)(2):
SARS may be readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment and has severe health consequences. Someone with SARS probably poses a direct threat.
(c) If a passenger with a communicable disease meeting the direct threat criteria of this section gives you a medical certificate of the kind outlined in § 382.23(c)(2) describing measures for preventing transmission of the disease during the normal course of the
flight, you must provide transportation to the passenger, unless you are unable to carry out the measures.
(d) If your action under this section results in the postponement of a passenger's travel, you must permit the passenger to travel at a later time (up to 90 days from the date of the postponed travel) at the fare that would have applied to the passenger's originally scheduled trip without penalty or, at the passenger's discretion, provide a refund for any unused flights, including return flights.
(e) If you take any action under this section that restricts a passenger's travel, you must, on the passenger's request, provide a written explanation within 10 days of the request.
§ 382.23
May carriers require a passenger with a disability to provide a medical certificate?
(a) Except as provided in this section, you must not require a passenger with a disability to have a medical certificate as a condition for being provided transportation.
(b)(1) You may require a medical certificate for a passenger with a disability—
(i) Who is traveling in a stretcher or incubator;
(ii) Who needs medical oxygen during a flight; or
(iii) Whose medical condition is such that there is reasonable doubt that the individual can complete the flight safely, without requiring extraordinary medical assistance during the flight.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical certificate is a written statement from the passenger's physician saying that the passenger is capable of completing the flight safely, without requiring extraordinary medical assistance during the flight.
(3) To be valid, a medical certificate under this paragraph must be dated within 10 days of the scheduled date of the passenger's initial departing flight.

# Example to paragraph (b)(3):
A passenger who schedules a flight from New York to London on January 15 with a return on April 15 would have to show a medical certificate dated January 5 or later. The passenger would not have to show a second medical certificate dated April 5 or later.
(c)(1) You may also require a medical certificate for a passenger if he or she has a communicable disease or condition that could pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others on the flight.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical certificate is a written statement from the passenger's physician saying that the disease or infection would not, under the present conditions in the particular passenger's case, be communicable to other persons during the normal course of a flight. The medical certificate must state any conditions or precautions that would have to be observed to prevent the transmission of the disease or infection to other persons in the normal course of a flight. A medical certificate under this paragraph must be dated within 10 days of the date of the flight for which it is presented.
(d) As a carrier, you may require that a passenger with a medical certificate undergo additional medical review by you if there is a legitimate medical reason for believing that there has been a significant adverse change in the passenger's condition since the issuance of the medical certificate or that the certificate significantly understates the passenger's risk to the health of other persons on the flight. If the results of this medical review demonstrate that the passenger, notwithstanding the medical certificate, is likely to be unable to complete the flight without requiring extraordinary medical assistance (e.g., the passenger has apparent significant difficulty in breathing, appears to be in substantial pain,
etc.
) or would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other persons on the flight, you may take an action otherwise prohibited under § 382.21(a) of this part.

§ 382.25
May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice that he or she is traveling on a flight?
As a carrier, you must not require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice of the fact that he or she is traveling on a flight.
§ 382.27
May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice in order to obtain certain specific services in connection with a flight?
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and §§ 382.75 and 382.133(e)(4), (5), (f)(5) and (6), as a carrier you must not require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice in order to obtain services or accommodations required by this part.
(b)(1) You may require a passenger with a disability to provide up to 72 hours' advance notice and check in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to receive carrier-supplied in-flight medical oxygen on international flights, and 48 hours' advance notice and check-in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to receive carrier-supplied in-flight medical oxygen on domestic flights. This service is optional; you are not required to provide carrier-supplied in-flight medical oxygen, but you may choose to do so.
(2) You may require a passenger with a disability to provide 48 hours' advance notice and check-in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to use his/her ventilator, respirator, CPAP machine or POC.
(3) You may require a passenger with a disability seeking to travel with a service animal in the cabin of the aircraft to provide up to 48 hours' advance notice through submission of the forms identified in § 382.75 (a) and (b) as a condition of permitting the service animal to travel in the cabin if the reservation is made more than 48 hours prior to a flight's departure. In the alternative, you may require a passenger with a disability seeking to travel with a service animal in the cabin of the aircraft to provide the forms identified in § 382.75 (a) and (b) at the passenger's departure gate on the date of travel as a condition of permitting the service animal to travel in the cabin.
(c) You may require a passenger with a disability to provide up to 48 hours' advance notice and check in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to receive the following services and accommodations. The services listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section are optional; you are not required to provide them, but you may choose to do so.
(1) Carriage of an incubator;
(2) Hook-up for a respirator, ventilator, CPAP machine or POC to the aircraft electrical power supply;
(3) Accommodation for a passenger who must travel in a stretcher;
(4) Transportation for an electric wheelchair on an aircraft with fewer than 60 seats;
(5) Provision of hazardous materials packaging for batteries or other assistive devices that are required to have such packaging;
(6) Accommodation for a group of ten or more qualified individuals with a disability, who make reservations and travel as a group; and
(7) Provision of an on-board wheelchair on an aircraft with more than 60 seats that does not have an accessible lavatory.
(8) Accommodation of a passenger who has both severe vision and hearing impairments (see § 382.29(b)(4)).
(d) If the passenger with a disability provides the advance notice you require, consistent with this section, for a service that you must provide (see paragraphs (b)(2) through (3) and (c)(4) through (8) of this section) or choose to provide (see paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section), you must provide the requested service or accommodation except to comply with any applicable safety regulations.
(e) Your reservation and other administrative systems must ensure that when passengers provide the advance notice that you require, consistent with this section, for services and accommodations, the notice is communicated, clearly and on time, to the people responsible for providing the requested service or accommodation.
(f) If a passenger with a disability provides the advance notice you require, consistent with this section, and the passenger is forced to change to another flight (
e.g.,
because of a flight cancellation), you must, to the maximum extent feasible, provide the accommodation on the new flight. If the new flight is another carrier's flight, you must provide the maximum feasible assistance to the other carrier in
providing the accommodation the passenger requested from you.
(g) If a passenger does not meet advance notice or check-in requirements you establish consistent with this section, you must still provide the service or accommodation if you can do so by making reasonable efforts, without delaying the flight.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020]
§ 382.29
May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to travel with a safety assistant?
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must not require that a passenger with a disability travel with another person as a condition of being provided air transportation.
(b) You may require a passenger with a disability in one of the following categories to travel with a safety assistant as a condition of being provided air transportation, if you determine that a safety assistant is essential for safety:
(1) A passenger traveling in a stretcher or incubator. The safety assistant for such a person must be capable of attending to the passenger's in-flight medical needs;
(2) A passenger who, because of a mental disability, is unable to comprehend or respond appropriately to safety instructions from carrier personnel, including the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 121.571(a)(3) and (a)(4) or 14 CFR 135.117(b) or the safety regulations of a foreign carrier's government, as applicable;
(3) A passenger with a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to physically assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft;
(4) A passenger who has both severe hearing and severe vision impairments, if the passenger cannot establish some means of communication with carrier personnel that is adequate both to permit transmission of the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 121.57(a)(3) and (a)(4), 14 CFR 135,117(b) or the safety regulations of a foreign carrier's government, as applicable, and to enable the passenger to assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft in the event of an emergency. You may require a passenger with severe hearing and vision impairment who wishes to travel without a safety assistant to notify you at least 48 hours in advance to provide this explanation. If the passenger fails to meet this notice requirement, however, you must still accommodate him or her to the extent practicable.
(c)(1) If you determine that a person meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section must travel with a safety assistant, contrary to the individual's self-assessment that he or she is capable of traveling independently, you must not charge for the transportation of the safety assistant. You are not required to find or provide the safety assistant, however.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, you may require, contrary to the individual's self-assessment, that an individual with both severe hearing and vision impairments must travel with a safety assistant if you determine that—
(i) The means of communication that the individual has explained to you does not adequately satisfy the objectives identified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; or
(ii) The individual proposes to establish communication by means of finger spelling and you cannot, within the time following the individual's notification, arrange for a flight crew member who can communicate using this method to serve the passenger's flight.
(3) If a passenger voluntarily chooses to travel with a personal care attendant or safety assistant that you do not require, you may charge for the transportation of that person.
(d) If, because there is not a seat available on a flight for a safety assistant whom the carrier has determined to be necessary, a passenger with a disability holding a confirmed reservation is unable to travel on the flight, you must compensate the passenger with a disability in an amount to be calculated as provided for instances of involuntary denied boarding under 14 CFR part 250, where part 250 applies.
(e) For purposes of determining whether a seat is available for a safety assistant, you must deem the safety assistant to have checked in at the same time as the passenger with a disability.
(f) Concern that a passenger with a disability may need personal care services (e.g., assistance in using lavatory facilities or with eating) is not a basis for requiring the passenger to travel with a safety assistant. You must explain this clearly in training or information you provide to your employees. You may advise passengers that your personnel are not required to provide such services.
§ 382.31
May carriers impose special charges on passengers with a disability for providing services and accommodations required by this rule?
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this part you must not, as a carrier, impose charges for providing facilities, equipment, or services that this rule requires to be provided to passengers with a disability. You may charge for services that this part does not require.
(b) You may charge a passenger for the use of more than one seat if the passenger's size or condition (e.g., use of a stretcher) causes him or her to occupy the space of more than one seat. This is not considered a special charge under this section.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 67914, Nov. 12, 2013]
§ 382.33
May carriers impose other restrictions on passengers with a disability that they do not impose on other passengers?
(a) As a carrier, you must not subject passengers with a disability to restrictions that do not apply to other passengers, except as otherwise permitted in this part (
e.g.,
advance notice requirements for certain services permitted by § 382.27).
(b) Restrictions you must not impose on passengers with a disability include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Restricting passengers” movement within the terminal;
(2) Requiring passengers to remain in a holding area or other location in order to receive transportation, services, or accommodations;
(3) Making passengers sit on blankets on the aircraft;
(4) Making passengers wear badges or other special identification (
e.g.,
similar to badges worn by unaccompanied minors); or
(5) Otherwise mandating separate treatment for passengers with a disability, unless permitted or required by this part or other applicable Federal requirements.
§ 382.35
May carriers require passengers with a disability to sign waivers or releases?
(a) As a carrier, you must not require passengers with a disability to sign a release or waiver of liability in order to receive transportation or to receive services or accommodations for a disability.
(b) You must not require passengers with a disability to sign waivers of liability for damage to or loss of wheelchairs or other assistive devices, or for the loss of, death of, or injury to service animals. Carriers may note pre-existing damage to an assistive device to the same extent that carriers do this with respect to other checked baggage.

# Subpart C—Information for Passengers
§ 382.41
What flight-related information must carriers provide to qualified individuals with a disability?
As a carrier, you must provide the following information, on request, to qualified individuals with a disability or persons making inquiries on their behalf concerning the accessibility of the aircraft expected to make a particular flight. The information you provide must be specific to the aircraft you expect to use for the flight unless it is unfeasible for you to do so (
e.g.,
because unpredictable circumstances such as weather or a mechanical problem require substitution of another aircraft that could affect the location or availability of an accommodation). The required information is:
(a) The specific location of seats, if any, with movable armrests (
i.e.,
by row and seat number);
(b) The specific location of seats (
i.e.,
by row and seat number) that the carrier, consistent with this part, does not make available to passengers with a disability (
e.g.,
exit row seats);
(c) Any aircraft-related, service-related or other limitations on the ability to accommodate passengers with a disability, including limitations on the availability of level-entry boarding to the aircraft at any airport involved with the flight. You must provide this information to any passenger who states that he or she uses a wheelchair for boarding, even if the passenger does not explicitly request the information.
(d) Any limitations on the availability of storage facilities, in the cabin or in the cargo bay, for mobility aids or other assistive devices commonly used by passengers with a disability, including storage in the cabin of a passenger's wheelchair as provided in §§ 382.67 and 382.123 of this part;
(e) Information regarding accessibility of lavatories (
see
§ 382.63(h)); and
(f) The types of services to passengers with a disability that are or are not available on the flight.

(5) Information regarding accessibility of lavatories (
see
§ 382.63(h)); and
(6) The types of services to passengers with a disability that are or are not available on the flight.
(b) As a carrier, you must publish information in a prominent and easily accessible place on your public-facing website(s) describing the relevant dimensions and other characteristics of the cargo holds of all aircraft types you operate, including the dimensions of the cargo hold entry, that would limit the size, weight, and allowable type of cargo.
§ 382.43
Must information and reservation services of carriers be accessible to individuals with visual, hearing, and other disabilities?
(a) If, as a carrier, you provide telephone reservation and information service to the public, you must make this service available to individuals who use a text telephone (TTY), whether via your own TTY, voice relay, or other available technology, as follows:
(1) You must provide access to TTY users during the same hours as the telephone service is available to the general public.
(2) You must ensure that the response time for answering calls and the level of service provided to TTY users is substantially equivalent to the response time and level of service provided to the general public (
i.e.,
non-TTY users).
(3) You must not subject TTY users to charges exceeding those that apply to non-TTY users of telephone information and reservation service.
(4) In any medium in which you list the telephone number of your information and reservation service for the general public, you must also list your TTY number if you have one. If you do not have a TTY number, you must state how TTY users can reach your information and reservation service (
e.g.,
via a voice relay service).
(5) If you are a foreign carrier, you must meet this requirement by May 13, 2010.
(b) The requirements of paragraph (a) do not apply to you in any country in which the telecommunications infrastructure does not readily permit compliance.
(c) If you are a U.S. or foreign air carrier that operates at least one aircraft having a designed seating capacity of more than 60 passengers and owns or controls a primary Web site that markets passenger air transportation, or a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation, you must ensure the public-facing Web pages on your primary Web site are accessible to individuals with disabilities as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. Only Web sites that market air transportation to the general public in the United States must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. The following are among the characteristics of a primary Web site that markets to the general public in the U.S.: the content can be viewed in English, the site advertises or sells flights operating to, from, or within the United States, and the site displays fares in U.S. dollars.

Collectively, such individuals must be able to provide feedback on the usability of the Web site by individuals with visual, auditory, tactile, and cognitive disabilities. Consultation is required to ensure that your Web site is usable by individuals with disabilities by the date specified in paragraph (c)(1).
(3) You are permitted to use a Level AA conforming alternate version only when conforming a public-facing Web page to all WCAG 2.0 Level AA success criteria would constitute an undue burden or fundamentally alter the information or functionality provided by that page.
(4) You must assist prospective passengers who indicate that they are unable to use your Web site due to a disability and contact you through other channels (e.g., by telephone or at the ticket counter) as follows:
(i) Disclose Web-based discount fares to the passenger if his or her itinerary qualifies for the discounted fare.
(ii) Provide Web-based amenities to the passenger, such as waiving any fee applicable to making a reservation or purchasing a ticket using a method other than your Web site (e.g., by telephone), unless the fee applies to other customers purchasing the same fare online.
(d) As a carrier covered under paragraph (c) of this section, you must provide a mechanism on your primary Web site for persons with disabilities to request disability accommodation services for future flights, including but not limited to wheelchair assistance, seating accommodation, escort assistance for a visually impaired passenger, and stowage of an assistive device no later than December 12, 2015.

# Subpart D—Accessibility of Airport Facilities
§ 382.51
What requirements must carriers meet concerning the accessibility of airport facilities?
(a) As a carrier, you must comply with the following requirements with respect to all terminal facilities you own, lease, or control at a U.S. airport:
(1) You must ensure that terminal facilities providing access to air transportation are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. You are deemed to comply with this obligation if the facilities meet requirements applying to places of public accommodation under Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations implementing Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
(2) With respect to any situation in which boarding and deplaning by level-entry loading bridges or accessible passenger lounges to and from an aircraft is not available, you must ensure that there is an accessible route between the gate and the area from which aircraft are boarded (
e.g.
, the tarmac in a situation in which level-entry boarding is not available). An accessible route is one meeting the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), sections 4.3.3 through 4.3.10.
(3) You must ensure that systems of intra- and inter-terminal transportation, including, but not limited to, moving sidewalks, shuttle vehicles and people movers, comply with applicable requirements of the Department of Transportation's ADA rules (49 CFR parts 37 and 38).
(4) Your contracts or leases with airport operators concerning the use of airport facilities must set forth your airport accessibility responsibility under this part and that of the airport operator under applicable section 504 and ADA rules of the Department of Transportation and Department of Justice.
(5) In cooperation with the airport operator and in consultation with local service animal training organization(s), you must provide animal relief areas for service animals that accompany passengers departing, connecting,
or arriving at an airport on your flights.
(6) You must enable captioning at all times on all televisions and other audio-visual displays that are capable of displaying captions and that are located in any portion of the terminal to which any passengers have access on May 13, 2009. The captioning must be high-contrast insofar as is feasible.
(7) You must replace any televisions and other audio-visual displays providing passengers with safety briefings, information, or entertainment that do not have high-contrast captioning capability with equipment that does have such capability whenever such equipment is replaced in the normal course of operations and/or whenever areas of the terminal in which such equipment is located are undergoing substantial renovation or expansion.
(8) If you newly acquire televisions and other audio-visual displays for passenger safety briefings, information, or entertainment on or after May 13, 2009, such equipment must have high-contrast captioning capability.
(b) As a carrier, you must ensure that passengers with a disability can readily use all terminal facilities you own, lease, or control at a foreign airport. In the case of foreign carriers, this requirement applies only to terminal facilities that serve flights covered by § 382.7 of this part.
(1) This means that passengers with a disability must be able to move readily through such terminal facilities to get to or from the gate and any other area from which passengers board the aircraft you use for such flights (
e.g.
, the tarmac in the case of flights that do not use level-entry boarding). This obligation is in addition to your obligation to provide enplaning, deplaning, and connecting assistance to passengers.
(2) You may meet this obligation through any combination of facility accessibility, auxiliary aids, equipment, the assistance of personnel, or other appropriate means consistent with the safety and dignity of passengers with a disability.
(c) As a foreign carrier, you must meet the requirements of this section by May 13, 2010, except as otherwise indicated in paragraph (a). As a U.S. carrier, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section by May 13, 2010.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009; 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010]
§ 382.53
What information must carriers give individuals with a vision or hearing impairment at airports?
(a)(1) As a U.S. carrier, you must ensure that passengers with a disability who identify themselves as persons needing visual or hearing assistance have prompt access to the same information provided to other passengers at each gate, ticketing area, and customer service desk that you own, lease, or control at any U.S. or foreign airport, to the extent that this does not interfere with employees' safety and security duties as set forth in FAA, TSA, and applicable foreign regulations.
(2) As a foreign carrier, you must make this information available at each gate, ticketing area, and customer service desk that you own, lease, or control at any U.S. airport. At foreign airports, you must make this information available only at gates, ticketing areas, or customer service desks that you own, lease, or control and only for flights that begin or end in the U.S.
(3) As a U.S. or foreign carrier, at any U.S. airport covered by this paragraph where the airport has effective control over the covered gates, ticketing areas, and customer service desks, you and the airport are jointly responsible for compliance.

§ 382.55
May carriers impose security screening procedures for passengers with disabilities that go beyond TSA requirements or those of foreign governments?
(a) All passengers, including those with disabilities, are subject to TSA security screening requirements at U.S. airports. In addition, passengers at foreign airports, including those with disabilities, may be subject to security screening measures required by law of the country in which the airport is located.
(b) If, as a carrier, you impose security screening procedures for passengers with disabilities that go beyond those mandated by TSA (or, at a foreign airport, beyond the law of the country in which the airport is located), you must ensure that they meet the following requirements:
(1) You must use the same criteria for applying security screening procedures to passengers with disabilities as to other passengers.
(2) You must not subject a passenger with a disability to special screening procedures because the person is traveling with a mobility aid or other assistive device if the person using the aid or device clears the security system without activating it.
(i) However, your security personnel may examine a mobility aid or assistive device which, in their judgment, may conceal a weapon or other prohibited item.
(ii) You may conduct security searches of qualified individuals with a disability whose aids activate the security system in the same manner as for other passengers.
(3) You must not require private security screenings of passengers with a disability to a greater extent, or for any different reason, than for other passengers.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if a passenger with a disability requests a private screening in a timely manner, you must provide it in time for the passenger to enplane.
(d) If you use technology that can conduct an appropriate screening of a passenger with a disability without necessitating a physical search of the person, you are not required to provide a private screening.

# Subpart E—Accessibility of Aircraft and Service Animals on Aircraft
§ 382.61
What are the requirements for movable aisle armrests?
(a) As a carrier, you must ensure that aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats on which passenger aisle seats have armrests are equipped with movable aisle armrests on at least one-half of the aisle seats in rows in which passengers with mobility impairments are permitted to sit under FAA or applicable foreign government safety rules.
(b) You are not required to provide movable armrests on aisle seats of rows which a passenger with a mobility impairment is precluded from using by an FAA safety rule.
(c) You must ensure that these movable aisle armrests are provided proportionately in all classes of service in the cabin. For example, if 80 percent of the aisle seats in which passengers with mobility impairments may sit are in coach, and 20 percent are in first class, then 80 percent of the movable aisle armrests must be in coach, with 20 percent in first class.
(d) For aircraft equipped with movable aisle armrests, you must configure cabins, or establish administrative systems, to ensure that passengers with mobility impairments or other passengers with a disability can readily identify and obtain seating in rows with movable aisle armrests. You must provide this information by specific seat and row number.
(e) You are not required to retrofit cabin interiors of existing aircraft to comply with the requirements of this section. However, if you replace any of an aircraft's aisle seats with newly manufactured seats, the new seats must include movable aisle armrests as required by this section. However, an aircraft is never required to have movable aisle armrests on more than one half of the aisle seats.
(f) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section
with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after May 13, 2009 or which are delivered after May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) of this section applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after April 5, 1990, or which are delivered after April 5, 1992. As a U.S. carrier, paragraph (c) of this section applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after May 13, 2009 or which were delivered after May 13, 2010.
(g) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section with respect to seats ordered after May 13, 2009.
§ 382.63
What are the requirements for accessible lavatories?
(a) As a carrier, you must ensure that aircraft with more than one aisle in which lavatories are provided shall include at least one accessible lavatory.
(1) The accessible lavatory must permit a qualified individual with a disability to enter, maneuver within as necessary to use all lavatory facilities, and leave, by means of the aircraft's on-board wheelchair.
(2) The accessible lavatory must afford privacy to persons using the on-board wheelchair equivalent to that afforded ambulatory users.
(3) The lavatory shall provide door locks, accessible call buttons, grab bars, faucets and other controls, and dispensers usable by qualified individuals with a disability, including wheelchair users and persons with manual impairments.
(b) With respect to aircraft not covered in paragraph (f) of this section with only one aisle in which lavatories are provided, you may, but are not required to, provide an accessible lavatory.
(c) You are not required to retrofit cabin interiors of existing aircraft to comply with the requirements of this section. However, if you replace a lavatory on an aircraft with more than one aisle, you must replace it with an accessible lavatory.
(d) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after May 13, 2009 or which are delivered after May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, this requirement applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after April 5, 1990, or which were delivered after April 5, 1992.
(e) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning May 13, 2009. As a U.S. carrier, these requirements apply to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after April 5, 1990, or which were delivered after April 5, 1992.

(7) The aircraft must include a visual barrier that must be provided upon request of a passenger with a disability. The barrier must provide passengers with disabilities using the lavatory (with the lavatory door open) a level of privacy substantially equivalent to that provided to ambulatory users. Visual barriers are not an acceptable method of providing privacy with respect to lavatories covered in § 382.64.
(g) You are not required to retrofit cabin interiors of existing single-aisle aircraft to comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. However, if you replace a lavatory on a single-aisle aircraft after October 2, 2026, you must replace it with a lavatory complying with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. Under this paragraph (g), a lavatory is not considered replaced if it is removed for specified maintenance, safety checks, or any other action that results in returning the same lavatory into service. For retrofit lavatories, there shall be no requirement to install a visual barrier if doing so will obstruct the visibility of exit signs.
(h) As a carrier operating at least one aircraft with an FAA-certificated maximum seating capacity of 60 or more, you must comply with the following requirements:
(1) You must train flight attendants to proficiency on an annual basis to provide assistance in transporting qualified individuals with disabilities to and from the lavatory from the aircraft seat. Such training shall include hands-on training on the retrieval, assembly, stowage, transfer features, and use of the aircraft's on-board wheelchair, and regarding the accessibility features of the lavatory, including any assembly or modifications to accessibility features.
(2) You must provide information, on request, to qualified individuals with a disability or persons making inquiries on their behalf concerning, at a minimum, the accessibility features of aircraft lavatories set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. This information must also be available on the carrier's website (if the carrier markets tickets to the public), and in printed or electronic form on the aircraft, including picture diagrams of accessibility features in the lavatory and the location and usage of all controls and dispensers.
(3) You must remove or conceal the International Symbol of Accessibility from new and in-service aircraft equipped with lavatories that are not capable of facilitating a seated independent transfer (
i.e.,
a transfer from an on-board wheelchair to the toilet seat without requiring the use of an assistant). You must include the International Symbol of Accessibility if the lavatory is capable of providing a seated independent transfer.
(4) You must develop and, upon request, inform passengers of trash disposal procedures and processes for sharps and bio-waste.
(5) You must comply with the provisions of this paragraph (h) by October 2, 2026.

§ 382.65
What are the requirements concerning on-board wheelchairs?
(a) As a carrier, you must equip aircraft that have more than 60 passenger seats, and that have an accessible lavatory (whether or not having such a lavatory is required by § 382.63 of this Part) with an on-board wheelchair. The Aerospatiale/Aeritalia ATR-72 and the British Aerospace Advanced Turboprop (ATP), in configurations having between 60 and 70 passenger seats, are exempt from this requirement.
(b) If a passenger asks you to provide an on-board wheelchair on a particular flight, you must provide it if the aircraft being used for the flight has more than 60 passenger seats, even if the aircraft does not have an accessible lavatory.
(1) The basis of the passenger's request must be that he or she can use an inaccessible lavatory but cannot reach it from a seat without using an on-board wheelchair.
(2) You may require the passenger to provide the advance notice specified in § 382.27 to receive this service.
(c) You must ensure that on-board wheelchairs meet the following standards:
(1) On-board wheelchairs must include footrests, armrests which are movable or removable, adequate occupant restraint systems, a backrest height that permits assistance to passengers in transferring, structurally sound handles for maneuvering the occupied chair, and wheel locks or another adequate means to prevent chair movement during transfer or turbulence.
(2) The chair must be designed to be compatible with the maneuvering space, aisle width, and seat height of the aircraft on which it is to be used, and to be easily pushed, pulled, and turned in the cabin environment by carrier personnel.
(d) As a foreign carrier, you must meet this requirement as of May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, you must meet this requirement by May 13, 2009.
(e) As a carrier, you must ensure that all new single-aisle aircraft that you operate with an FAA-certificated maximum seating capacity of 125 or more that are delivered on or after October 2, 2026, and on which lavatories are provided include an on-board wheelchair meeting the requirements of this section. The Access Board's published nonbinding technical assistance on aircraft on-board wheelchairs may be relied upon for compliance with these requirements.
(1) The on-board wheelchair must be maneuverable both forward and backward through the aircraft aisle by an attendant.
(2) The height of the on-board wheelchair seat must align with the height of the aircraft seat so as to facilitate a safe transfer between the on-board wheelchair seat and the aircraft seat.
(3) The on-board wheelchair must have wheels that lock in the direction of travel, and that lock in place so as to permit safe transfers. Any other moving parts of the on-board wheelchair must be capable of being secured such that they do not move while the occupied on-board wheelchair is being maneuvered.
(4) The on-board wheelchair shall be designed not to tip or fall in any direction under normal operating conditions when occupied for use.
(5) The on-board wheelchair must have a padded seat and backrest and must be free of sharp or abrasive components.
(6) The on-board wheelchair must have arm supports that are sufficiently structurally sound to permit transfers and repositionable so as to allow for unobstructed transfers; adequate back support; torso and leg restraints that are adequate to prevent injury during
transport; and a unitary foot support that provides sufficient clearance to traverse the threshold of the lavatory and is repositionable so as to allow for unobstructed transfer. All restraints must be operable by the passenger.
(7) The on-board wheelchair must be maneuverable in a forward orientation partially into at least one aircraft lavatory to permit transfer from the on-board wheelchair to the toilet.
(8) The on-board wheelchair must be maneuverable into the aircraft lavatory without protruding into the clear space needed to completely close the lavatory door.

(f) You are not required to expand the existing FAA-certificated on-board wheelchair stowage space of the aircraft, or modify the interior arrangement of the lavatory or the aircraft, in order to comply with this section. However, if the on-board wheelchair that you obtain does not fit within the original stowage space, and another space exists (
e.g.,
an overhead compartment) where the on-board wheelchair could fit consistent with FAA safety standards, then you must stow the on-board wheelchair in that space and must request any necessary FAA approval to do so. You are not required to make the on-board wheelchair available if the pilot-in-command determines that safety or security considerations preclude its use.
(g) You must acquire an OBW that complies with as many requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of this section as are available. You are not responsible for the failure of third parties to develop and deliver an on-board wheelchair that complies with a requirement set forth in paragraph (e) of this section so long as you make reasonable efforts to purchase such an OBW and inform the Department at the address cited in § 382.159 that an on-board wheelchair meeting that requirement is unavailable despite your reasonable efforts. If you cannot provide a wheelchair meeting requirement (e)(8) of this section despite your reasonable efforts, then you must provide, on request, the use of the visual barrier (
e.g.,
a curtain) described in § 382.63(f)(7) to enable the passenger to perform lavatory functions in privacy.
(h) If you replace an on-board wheelchair on aircraft with an FAA-certificated maximum seating capacity of 125 or more after October 2, 2026, then you must replace it with an on-board wheelchair that meets the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.

be strapped using a strap kit that complies with applicable Federal Aviation Administration or applicable foreign government regulations on the stowage of cargo in the cabin compartment) in the cabin of sufficient size to stow at least one typical adult-sized folding, collapsible, or break-down manual passenger wheelchair, the dimensions of which are 13 inches by 36 inches by 42 inches or less without having to remove the wheels or otherwise disassemble it. This section applies to any aircraft with 100 or more passenger seats and this space must be other than the overhead compartments and under-seat spaces routinely used for passengers' carry-on items.
(b) If you are a carrier that uses the seat-strapping method to stow a manual passenger wheelchair, you must ensure that there is priority space for at least two such wheelchairs, if stowing the second passenger wheelchair would not displace passengers.
(c) If you are a carrier that uses a closet as the priority space to stow a manual passenger wheelchair, you must install a sign or placard prominently on the closet indicating that such wheelchairs and other assistive devices are to be stowed in this area with priority over other items brought onto the aircraft by other passengers or crew, including crew luggage, as set forth in § 382.123.
(d) If passengers holding confirmed reservations are not able to travel on a flight because their seats are being used to stow a passenger's wheelchair as required by paragraph (a) of this section, carriers must compensate those passengers in an amount to be calculated as provided for in instances of involuntary denied boarding under 14 CFR part 250, where part 250 applies.
(e) As a carrier, you must never request or suggest that a passenger not stow his or her wheelchair in the cabin to accommodate other passengers (e.g., informing a passenger that stowing his or her wheelchair in the cabin will require other passengers to be removed from the flight), or for any other non-safety related reason (e.g., that it is easier for the carrier if the wheelchair is stowed in the cargo compartment).
(f) As a carrier, you must offer pre-boarding to a passenger stowing his or her wheelchair in the cabin.
(g) As a foreign carrier, you must meet the requirement of this section for new aircraft ordered after May 13, 2009, or delivered after May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, this section applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were ordered after April 5, 1990, or which were delivered after April 5, 1992.

§ 382.69
What requirements must carriers meet concerning the accessibility of videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual presentations shown on-aircraft to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing?
(a) As a carrier, you must ensure that all new videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual displays played on aircraft for safety purposes, and all such new audio-visual displays played on aircraft for informational purposes that were created under your control, are high-contrast captioned. The captioning must be in the predominant language or languages in which you communicate with passengers on the flight.
(b) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section go into effect with respect to audio-visual displays used for safety purposes on November 10, 2009.
(c) Between May 13, 2009 and November 9, 2009, U.S. carriers must ensure that all videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual displays played on aircraft for safety purposes have open captioning or an inset for a sign language interpreter, unless such captioning or inset either would interfere with the video presentation so as to render it ineffective or would not be large enough to be readable, in which case these carriers must use an equivalent non-video alternative for transmitting the briefing to passengers with hearing impairments.
(d) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section go into effect with respect to informational displays on January 8, 2010.
§ 382.71
What other aircraft accessibility requirements apply to carriers?
(a) As a carrier, you must maintain all aircraft accessibility features in proper working order.
(b) You must ensure that any replacement or refurbishing of the aircraft cabin or its elements does not reduce the accessibility of that element to a level below that specified for new aircraft in this part.

§ 382.72
Must carriers allow a service animal to accompany a passenger with a disability?
You must allow a service animal to accompany a passenger with a disability. You must not deny transportation to a service animal based on the animal's breed or type or on the basis that its carriage may offend or annoy carrier personnel or persons traveling on the aircraft.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020]
§ 382.73
How do carriers determine if an animal is a service animal that must be accepted for transport? May a carrier require that a service animal be under the control of the service animal user or handler?
(a) You may rely on one or more of the factors set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through)(3) of this section to determine if an animal is a service animal that must be accepted for transport.
(1) You may make two inquiries to determine whether an animal qualifies as a service animal. You may ask if the animal is required to accompany the passenger because of a disability and what work or task the animal has been trained to perform. You must not ask about the nature or extent of a person's disability or ask that the service animal demonstrate its work or task.
(2) You may observe the behavior of an animal. A trained service animal will remain under the control of its handler. It does not run freely around an aircraft or an airport gate area, bark or growl repeatedly at other persons or other animals on the aircraft or in the airport gate area, bite, jump on, or cause injury to people, or urinate or defecate in the cabin or gate area. An animal that engages in such disruptive behavior demonstrates that it has not been successfully trained to behave properly in a public setting and carriers are not required to treat it as a service animal without a carrier in the cabin, even if the animal performs an assistive function for a passenger with a disability.
(3) You may look for physical indicators, such as a harness or vest on the animal, to determine if the animal is a service animal.
(b) You may require that a service animal be harnessed, leashed, or otherwise tethered at all times by the service animal user or service animal handler while in areas of the airport that you own, lease or control, or on an aircraft.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020]
§ 382.74
How many service animals must a carrier transport in the cabin of aircraft?
You are not required to accept more than two service animals for a single passenger with a disability.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020]
§ 382.75
May a carrier require documentation from passengers with disabilities seeking to travel with a service animal?
(a) If a passenger with a disability seeks to travel with a service animal, you may require the passenger to provide you, as a condition of permitting the service animal to travel in the cabin, a current completed U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Form. Current means the form was completed on or after the date the passenger purchased his or her airline ticket.
(b) On a flight segment scheduled to take 8 hours or more, you may, as a condition of permitting a service animal to travel in the cabin, require the passenger with a disability traveling with the service animal to confirm that the animal will not need to relieve itself on the flight, or that the animal can relieve itself in a way that does not
create a health or sanitation issue on the flight by providing a current DOT Service Animal Relief Attestation Form. Current means the form was completed on or after the date the passenger purchased his or her airline ticket.
(c) You are not permitted to require documentation from passengers with disabilities traveling with service animals beyond the completion of the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section except to comply with requirements on transport of animals by a Federal agency, a U.S. territory or a foreign jurisdiction.
(d) As a U.S. air carrier, if you require service animal users to submit the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you must have copies of these forms available for passengers at each airport you serve. As a foreign air carrier, if you require service animal users to submit the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you must have copies of the forms available for passengers at each airport serving a flight you operate that begins or ends at a U.S. airport.
(e) If you have a website, you must have the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) available to passengers in an accessible format. You must mail copies of the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) to passengers upon request.
(f) If you require a passenger with a disability traveling with a service animal to submit the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in advance of the passenger's date of travel, you must provide the passenger the option of submitting the completed form(s) to you electronically or by hardcopy.
(g)(1) If a passenger's reservation was made more than 48 hours in advance of the first originally scheduled departure time on the passenger's itinerary, you may require that passenger provide up to 48 hours advance notice by submitting the form identified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) If a passenger's reservation was made more than 48 hours in advance of the first originally scheduled departure time on the passenger's itinerary and a flight segment on the passenger's itinerary is scheduled to take 8 hours or more, you may require that the passenger provide up to 48 hours advance notice by submitting the form identified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) If a passenger's reservation was made less than 48 hours in advance of the first originally scheduled departure time on the passenger's itinerary, you may not require that passenger provide advance notice of his or her intent to travel with a service animal. You may require that the passenger complete the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and submit a copy of the form to you at the passenger's departure gate on the date of travel.
(h) If the passenger does not meet the advance notice requirements you establish consistent with this section, you must still provide the accommodation if you can do so by making reasonable efforts, without delaying the flight.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020]
§ 382.76
May a carrier require a service animal user to check-in physically at the airport?
You may not require a passenger with a disability to check-in physically at the airport, rather than using the online check-in available to the general public, on the basis that the passenger is traveling with a service animal.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020]
§ 382.77
May carriers restrict the location and placement of service animals on aircraft?
(a) You must permit a service animal to accompany a passenger with a disability on the passenger's lap or in the passenger's foot space, unless this location and placement would:
(1) Be inconsistent with safety requirements set by the FAA or the foreign carrier's government; or
(2) Encroach into another passenger's space.
(b) Before refusing to transport a large service animal that cannot be accommodated on the passenger's lap or in the passenger's foot space without encroaching into another passenger's
space, you must offer the passenger the opportunity to move with the animal to another seat location within the same class of service, if available on the aircraft, where the animal can be accommodated. You are not required to reseat other passengers to accommodate a service animal except as required for designated priority seats in Subpart F.
(c) If there are no alternatives available to enable the passenger to travel with the service animal in the cabin of the scheduled flight, you must offer the passenger the opportunity to transport the service animal in the cargo hold free of charge or travel on a later flight to the extent there is space available on a later flight and the transport is consistent with the safety requirements set by the FAA or a foreign carrier's government.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020]
§ 382.78
May carriers charge individuals with disabilities for the damage their service animal causes?
While you generally cannot charge an individual with a disability for transporting service animals, or for providing other services that this part requires, you may charge a passenger with a disability for damage caused by his or her service animal so long as you normally charge individuals without disabilities for similar kinds of damage.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020]
§ 382.79
Under what other circumstances may carriers refuse to provide transportation to a service animal traveling with a passenger with a disability?
(a) You may deny transport to a service animal under the following circumstances:
(1) The animal poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others (see definition in § 382.3);
(2) The animal causes a significant disruption in the cabin or at an airport gate area, or its behavior on the aircraft or at an airport gate area indicates that it has not been trained to behave properly in public (e.g., running freely, barking or growling repeatedly at other persons on the aircraft, biting or jumping on people, or urinating or defecating in the cabin or gate area);
(3) The animal's carriage would violate applicable safety or health requirements of any U.S. federal agency, U.S. territory or foreign government; or
(4) The passenger with a disability seeking to travel with a service animal in the cabin of the aircraft does not provide completed current forms as set forth in § 382.75 (a) and (b) to the carrier when requested to do so.
(b) In determining whether to deny transport to a service animal on the basis that the animal poses a direct threat under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must make an individualized assessment, independent of the dog's breed or type, based on reasonable judgment that relies on the best available objective evidence to ascertain the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedure will mitigate the risk. A current completed U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Form may be used in making this determination.
(c) In determining whether to deny transport to a service animal on the basis that the animal has misbehaved and/or has caused a significant disruption in the cabin under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you must make an individualized assessment, independent of the dog's breed or type, based on reasonable judgment that relies on the best available objective evidence to ascertain the probability that the misbehavior and/or disruption will continue to occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedure will mitigate the misbehavior and/or the disruption. A current completed U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Form and a current completed U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Relief Attestation Form may be used in making this determination.
(d) In conducting the analysis required under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, you must not deny
transportation to the service animal if there are means available short of refusal that would mitigate the problem (e.g., muzzling a barking service dog or taking other steps to comply with animal health regulations needed to permit entry of the service animal into a domestic territory or a foreign country).
(e) If you refuse to provide transportation to a service animal based on any provision in this part, you must provide the individual with a disability accompanied by the service animal a written statement of the reason for the refusal. This statement must include the specific basis for the carrier's opinion that the refusal meets the standards of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section or is otherwise specifically permitted by this part. You must provide this written statement to the individual with a disability accompanied by the service animal either at the airport, or within 10 calendar days of the refusal of transportation.

# Subpart F—Seating Accommodations
§ 382.81
For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?
As a carrier, you must provide the following seating accommodations to the following passengers on request, if the passenger self-identifies to you as having a disability specified in this section and the type of seating accommodation in question exists on the particular aircraft. Once the passenger self-identifies to you, you must ensure that the information is recorded and properly transmitted to personnel responsible for providing the accommodation.
(a) For a passenger who uses an aisle chair to access the aircraft and who cannot readily transfer over a fixed aisle armrest, you must provide a seat in a row with a movable aisle armrest. You must ensure that your personnel are trained in the location and proper use of movable aisle armrests, including appropriate transfer techniques. You must ensure that aisle seats with movable armrests are clearly identifiable.
(b) You must provide an adjoining seat for a person assisting a passenger with a disability in the following circumstances:
(1) When a passenger with a disability is traveling with a personal care attendant who will be performing a function for the individual during the flight that airline personnel are not required to perform (
e.g.,
assistance with eating);
(2) When a passenger with a vision impairment is traveling with a reader/assistant who will be performing functions for the individual during the flight;
(3) When a passenger with a hearing impairment is traveling with an interpreter who will be performing functions for the individual during the flight; or
(4) When you require a passenger to travel with a safety assistant (see § 382.29).
(c) For a passenger with a disability traveling with a service animal, you must provide, as the passenger requests, either a bulkhead seat or a seat other than a bulkhead seat.
(d) For a passenger with a fused or immobilized leg, you must provide a bulkhead seat or other seat that provides greater legroom than other seats, on the side of an aisle that better accommodates the individual's disability.
§ 382.83
Through what mechanisms do carriers make seating accommodations?
(a) If you are a carrier that provides advance seat assignments to passengers (
i.e.,
offer seat assignments to passengers before the day of the flight),
you must comply with the requirements of § 382.81 of this part by any of the following methods:
(1) You may “block” an adequate number of the seats used to provide the seating accommodations required by § 382.81.
(i) You must not assign these seats to passengers who do not meet the criteria of § 382.81 until 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight.
(ii) At any time up until 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight, you must assign a seat meeting the requirements of this section to a passenger with a disability meeting one or more of the requirements of § 382.81 who requests it, at the time the passenger initially makes the request.
(iii) If a passenger with a disability specified in § 382.81 does not make a request at least 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight, you must meet the passenger's request to the extent practicable, but you are not required to reassign a seat assigned to another passenger in order to do so.
(2) You may designate an adequate number of the seats used to provide seating accommodations required by § 382.81 as “priority seats” for passengers with a disability.
(i) You must provide notice that all passengers assigned these seats (other than passengers with a disability listed in § 382.81 of this part) are subject to being reassigned to another seat if necessary to provide a seating accommodation required by this section.
(ii) You may provide this notice through your computer reservation system, verbal information provided by reservation personnel, ticket notices, gate announcements, counter signs, seat cards or notices, frequent-flier literature, or other appropriate means.
(iii) You must assign a seat meeting the requirements of this section to a passenger with a disability listed in § 382.81 of this part who requests the accommodation at the time the passenger makes the request. You may require such a passenger to check in and request the seating accommodation at least one hour before the standard check-in time for the flight. If all designated priority seats that would accommodate the passenger have been assigned to other passengers, you must reassign the seats of the other passengers as needed to provide the requested accommodation.
(iv) If a passenger with a disability listed in § 382.81 does not check in at least an hour before the standard check-in time for the general public, you must meet the individual's request to the extent practicable, but you are not required to reassign a seat assigned to another passenger in order to do so.
(b) If you assign seats to passengers, but not until the date of the flight, you must use the “priority seating” approach of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(c) If you do not provide advance seat assignments to passengers, you must allow passengers specified in § 382.81 to board the aircraft before other passengers, including other “preboarded” passengers, so that the passengers needing seating accommodations can select seats that best meet their needs.
(d) As a carrier, if you wish to use a different method of providing seating assignment accommodations to passengers with disabilities from those specified in this subpart, you must obtain the written concurrence of the Department of Transportation. Contact the Department at the address cited in § 382.159 of this part.
§ 382.85
What seating accommodations must carriers make to passengers in circumstances not covered by § 382.81 (a) through (d)?
As a carrier, you must provide the following seating accommodations to a passenger who self-identifies as having a disability other than one in the four categories listed in § 382.81 (a) through (d) of this part and as needing a seat assignment accommodation in order to readily access and use the carrier's air transportation services:
(a) As a carrier that assigns seats in advance, you must provide accommodations in the following ways:
(1) If you use the “seat-blocking” mechanism of § 382.83(a)(1) of this part, you must implement the requirements of this section as follows:
(i) When a passenger with a disability not described in § 382.81(a) through (d) of this part makes a reservation more than 24 hours before the scheduled departure time of the flight, you are not
required to offer the passenger one of the seats blocked for the use of passengers with a disability listed under § 382.81.
(ii) However, you must assign to the passenger any seat, not already assigned to another passenger that accommodates the passenger's needs, even if that seat is not available for assignment to the general passenger population at the time of the request.
(2) If you use the “designated priority seats” mechanism of § 382.83(a)(2) of this part, you must implement the requirements of this section as follows:
(i) When a passenger with a disability not described in § 382.81 makes a reservation, you must assign to the passenger any seat, not already assigned to another passenger, that accommodates the passenger's needs, even if that seat is not available for assignment to the general passenger population at the time of the request. You may require a passenger making such a request to check in one hour before the standard check-in time for the flight.
(ii) If such a passenger is assigned to a designated priority seat, he or she is subject to being reassigned to another seat as provided in § 382.83(a)(2)(i) of this subpart.
(b) On flights where advance seat assignments are not offered, you must provide seating accommodations under this section by allowing passengers to board the aircraft before other passengers, including other “preboarded” passengers, so that the individuals needing seating accommodations can select seats that best meet their needs.
(c) If you assign seats to passengers, but not until the date of the flight, you must use the “priority seating” approach of section 382.83(a)(2).
§ 382.87
What other requirements pertain to seating for passengers with a disability?
(a) As a carrier, you must not exclude any passenger with a disability from any seat or require that a passenger with a disability sit in any particular seat, on the basis of disability, except to comply with FAA or applicable foreign government safety requirements.
(b) In responding to requests from individuals for accommodations under this subpart, you must comply with FAA and applicable foreign government safety requirements, including those pertaining to exit seating (see 14 CFR 121.585 and 135.129).
(c) If a passenger's disability results in involuntary active behavior that would result in the person properly being refused transportation under § 382.19, and the passenger could be transported safely if seated in another location, you must offer to let the passenger sit in that location as an alternative to being refused transportation.
(d) If you have already provided a seat to a passenger with a disability to furnish an accommodation required by this subpart, you must not (except in the circumstance described in § 382.85(a)(2)(ii)) reassign that passenger to another seat in response to a subsequent request from another passenger with a disability, without the first passenger's consent.
(e) You must never deny transportation to any passenger in order to provide accommodations required by this subpart.
(f) You are not required to furnish more than one seat per ticket or to provide a seat in a class of service other than the one the passenger has purchased in order to provide an accommodation required by this part.

# Subpart G—Boarding, Deplaning, and Connecting Assistance
§ 382.89
How timely must the service required under this Subpart be provided by carriers to passengers with disabilities?
(a) As a carrier, the assistance you provide with respect to this subpart must be performed in a prompt manner.
(b) Whether the assistance is prompt is dependent on the totality of the circumstances, except, for as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) Prompt assistance for a person who uses a boarding chair (
i.e.,
aisle chair) in deplaning means:
(1) Personnel and boarding chair must be available to deplane the passenger when the last passenger who did not request deplaning assistance departs the aircraft;
(2) The passenger's personal wheelchair must be available as close as possible to the door of the aircraft to the maximum extent possible, except:
(i) Where this practice would be inconsistent with Federal regulations governing transportation security or the transportation of hazardous materials; or
(ii) When the passenger requests the wheelchair be returned at a location other than the door of the aircraft; and
(3) When a passenger's personal wheelchair is not available at the door of the aircraft for the reasons set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an airport wheelchair must be available as close as possible to the door of the aircraft for the passenger's use.

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102442, Dec. 17, 2024, § 382.89 was added, effective Jan. 16, 2025.
§ 382.91
What assistance must carriers provide to passengers with a disability in moving within the terminal?
(a) As a carrier, you must provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by a passenger with a disability, in transportation between gates to make a connection to another flight. If the arriving flight and the departing connecting flight are operated by different carriers, the carrier that operated the arriving flight (
i.e.,
the one that operates the first of the two flights that are connecting) is responsible for providing or ensuring the provision of this assistance, even if the passenger holds a separate ticket for the departing flight. It is permissible for the two carriers to mutually agree that the carrier operating the departing connecting flight (
i.e.,
the second flight of the two) will provide this assistance, but the carrier operating the arriving flight remains responsible under this section for ensuring that the assistance is provided.
(b) You must also provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by a passenger with a disability, in moving from the terminal entrance (or a vehicle drop-off point adjacent to the entrance) through the airport to the gate for a departing flight, or from the gate to the terminal entrance (or a vehicle pick-up point adjacent to the entrance after an arriving flight).
(1) This requirement includes assistance in accessing key functional areas of the terminal, such as ticket counters and baggage claim.
(2) This requirement also includes a brief stop upon the passenger's request at the entrance to a rest room (including an accessible rest room when requested). As a carrier, you are required to make such a stop only if the rest room is available on the route to the destination of the enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance and you can make the stop without unreasonable delay. To receive such assistance, the passenger must self-identify as being an individual with a disability needing the assistance.
(c) As a carrier at a U.S. airport, you must, on request, in cooperation with the airport operator, provide for escorting a passenger with a service animal to an animal relief area provided under § 382.51(a)(5) of this part.
(d) As part of your obligation to provide or ensure the provision of assistance to passengers with disabilities in moving through the terminal (
e.g.,
between the terminal entrance and the gate, between gate and aircraft, from gate to a baggage claim area), you must assist passengers who are unable to carry their luggage because of a disability with transporting their gate-checked or carry-on luggage. You may request the credible verbal assurance that a passenger cannot carry the luggage in question. If a passenger is unable to provide credible assurance, you may require the passenger to provide documentation as a condition of providing this service.
§ 382.93
Must carriers offer preboarding to passengers with a disability?
As a carrier, you must offer preboarding to passengers with a disability who self-identify at the gate as needing additional time or assistance
to board, stow accessibility equipment, or be seated.
§ 382.95
What are carriers' general obligations with respect to boarding and deplaning assistance?
(a) As a carrier, you must promptly provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of passengers with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by passengers with a disability, in enplaning and deplaning. This assistance must include, as needed, the services of personnel and the use of ground wheelchairs, accessible motorized carts, boarding wheelchairs, and/or on-board wheelchairs where provided in accordance with this part, and ramps or mechanical lifts.
(b) As a carrier, you must, except as otherwise provided in this subpart, provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts or ramps at any U.S. commercial service airport with 10,000 or more annual enplanements where boarding and deplaning by level-entry loading bridges or accessible passenger lounges is not available.

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102442, Dec. 17, 2024, § 382.95 was amended by revising paragraph (a), effective Jan. 16, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
§ 382.95
What are carriers' general obligations with respect to boarding and deplaning assistance?
(a) As a carrier, you must provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of passengers with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by passengers with a disability, in enplaning and deplaning. This assistance must include, as needed, the services of personnel and the use of ground wheelchairs, accessible motorized carts, boarding wheelchairs, and/or on-board wheelchairs where provided in accordance with this part, and ramps or mechanical lifts.
§ 382.97
To which aircraft does the requirement to provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts apply?
The requirement of section 382.95(b) of this part to provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts applies with respect to all aircraft with a passenger capacity of 19 or more, with the following exceptions:
(a) Float planes;
(b) The following 19-seat capacity aircraft models: the Fairchild Metro, the Jetstream 31 and 32, the Beech 1900 (C and D models), and the Embraer EMB-120;
(c) Any other aircraft model determined by the Department of Transportation to be unsuitable for boarding and deplaning assistance by lift, ramp, or other suitable device.
The Department will make such a determination if it concludes that—
(1) No existing boarding and deplaning assistance device on the market will accommodate the aircraft without a significant risk of serious damage to the aircraft or injury to passengers or employees, or
(2) Internal barriers are present in the aircraft that would preclude passengers who use a boarding or aisle chair from reaching a non-exit row seat.
§ 382.99
What agreements must carriers have with the airports they serve?
(a) As a carrier, you must negotiate in good faith with the airport operator of each U.S. airport described in § 382.95(b) to ensure the provision of lifts for boarding and deplaning where level-entry loading bridges are not available.
(b) You must have a written, signed agreement with the airport operator allocating responsibility for meeting the boarding and deplaning assistance requirements of this subpart between or among the parties. For foreign carriers, with respect to all covered aircraft, this requirement becomes effective May 13, 2010.
(c) For foreign carriers, the agreement with a U.S. airport must provide that all actions necessary to ensure accessible boarding and deplaning for passengers with a disability are completed as soon as practicable, but no later than May 13, 2011.
(d) Under the agreement, you may, as a carrier, require that passengers wishing to receive boarding and deplaning assistance requiring the use of a lift for a flight check in for the flight one hour
before the standard check-in time for the flight. If the passenger checks in after this time, you must nonetheless provide the boarding and deplaning assistance by lift if you can do so by making a reasonable effort, without delaying the flight.
(e) The agreement must ensure that all lifts and other accessibility equipment are maintained in proper working condition.
(f) All carriers and airport operators involved are jointly and severally responsible for the timely and complete implementation of the agreement.
(g) You must make a copy of this agreement available, on request, to representatives of the Department of Transportation.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009]
§ 382.101
What other boarding and deplaning assistance must carriers provide?
When level-entry boarding and deplaning assistance is not required to be provided under this subpart, you must, as a carrier, provide or ensure the provision of boarding and deplaning assistance by any available means to which the passenger consents. However, you must never use hand-carrying (
i.e.,
directly picking up the passenger's body in the arms of one or more carrier personnel to effect a level change the passenger needs to enter or leave the aircraft), even if the passenger consents, unless this is the only way of evacuating the individual in the event of an emergency. The situations in which level-entry boarding is not required but in which you must provide this boarding and deplaning assistance include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a) The boarding or deplaning process occurs at a U.S. airport that is not a commercial service airport that has 10,000 or more enplanements per year;
(b) The boarding or deplaning process occurs at a foreign airport;
(c) You are using an aircraft subject to an exception from the lift boarding and deplaning assistance requirements under § 382.97 (a)-(c) of this subpart;
(d) The deadlines established in § 382.99(c) have not yet passed; and
(e) Circumstances beyond your control (
e.g.,
unusually severe weather; unexpected mechanical problems) prevent the use of a lift.
§ 382.103
May a carrier leave a passenger unattended in a wheelchair or other device?
As a carrier, you must not leave a passenger who has requested assistance required by this subpart unattended by the personnel responsible for enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance in a ground wheelchair, boarding wheelchair, or other device, in which the passenger is not independently mobile, for more than 30 minutes. This requirement applies even if another person (
e.g.,
family member, personal care attendant) is accompanying the passenger, unless the passenger explicitly waives the obligation.
§ 382.105
What is the responsibility of carriers at foreign airports at which airport operators have responsibility for enplaning, deplaning, and connecting assistance?
At a foreign airport at which enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance is provided by the airport operator, rather than by carriers, as a carrier you may rely on the services provided by the airport operator to meet the requirements of this subpart. If the services provided by the airport operator are not sufficient to meet the requirements of this subpart, you must supplement the airport operator's services to ensure that these requirements are met. If you believe you are precluded by law from supplementing the airport operator's services, you may apply for a conflict of laws waiver under § 382.9 of this part.

# Subpart H—Services on Aircraft
§ 382.111
What services must carriers provide to passengers with a disability on board the aircraft?
As a carrier, you must provide services within the aircraft cabin as requested by or on behalf of passengers with a disability, or when offered by carrier personnel and accepted by passengers with a disability, as follows:
(a) Assistance in moving to and from seats, as part of the enplaning and deplaning processes;
(b) Assistance in preparation for eating, such as opening packages and identifying food;
(c) If there is an on-board wheelchair on the aircraft, assistance with the use of the on-board wheelchair to enable the person to move to and from a lavatory;
(d) Assistance to a semi-ambulatory person in moving to and from the lavatory, not involving lifting or carrying the person; or
(e) Assistance in stowing and retrieving carry-on items, including mobility aids and other assistive devices stowed in the cabin (
see also
382.91(d)). To receive such assistance, the passenger must self-identify as being an individual with a disability needing the assistance.
(f) Effective communication with passengers who have vision impairments or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, so that these passengers have prompt access to information the carrier provides to other passengers (
e.g.
weather, on-board services, flight delays, connecting gates at the next airport).
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010]
§ 382.113

(c) You must not require any passenger with a disability to demonstrate that he or she has listened to, read, or understood the information presented, except to the extent that carrier personnel impose such a requirement on all passengers with respect to the general safety briefing. You must not take any action adverse to a qualified individual with a disability on the basis that the person has not “accepted” the briefing.
(d) When you conduct an individual safety briefing for a passenger with a disability, you must do so as inconspicuously and discreetly as possible.
(e) The accessibility requirements for onboard video safety presentations that carriers must meet are outlined in section 382.69.
§ 382.119
What information must carriers give individuals with vision or hearing impairment on aircraft?
(a) As a carrier, you must ensure that passengers with a disability who identify themselves as needing visual or hearing assistance have prompt access to the same information provided to other passengers on the aircraft as described in paragraph (b) of this section, to the extent that it does not interfere with crewmembers' safety duties as set forth in FAA and applicable foreign regulations.
(b) The covered information includes but is not limited to the following: information concerning flight safety, procedures for takeoff and landing, flight delays, schedule or aircraft changes that affect the travel of persons with disabilities, diversion to a different airport, scheduled departure and arrival time, boarding information, weather conditions at the flight's destination, beverage and menu information, connecting gate assignments, baggage claim, individuals being paged by airlines, and emergencies (
e.g.,
fire or bomb threat).

# Subpart I—Stowage of Wheelchairs, Other Mobility Aids, and Other Assistive Devices
§ 382.121
What mobility aids and other assistive devices may passengers with a disability bring into the aircraft cabin?
(a) As a carrier, you must permit passengers with a disability to bring the following kinds of items into the aircraft cabin, provided that they can be stowed in designated priority storage areas or in overhead compartments or under seats, consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.
(1) Manual wheelchairs, including folding or collapsible wheelchairs;
(2) Other mobility aids, such as canes (including those used by persons with impaired vision), crutches, and walkers; and
(3) Other assistive devices for stowage or use within the cabin (
e.g.,
prescription medications and any medical devices needed to administer them such as syringes or auto-injectors, vision-enhancing devices, and POCs, ventilators and respirators that use non-spillable batteries, as long as they comply with applicable safety, security and hazardous materials rules).
(b) In implementing your carry-on baggage policies, you must not count assistive devices (including the kinds of items listed in paragraph (a) of this section) toward a limit on carry-on baggage.
§ 382.123
What are the requirements concerning priority cabin stowage for wheelchairs and other assistive devices?
(a) The following rules apply to the stowage of passengers' wheelchairs or other assistive devices in the priority stowage area provided for in § 382.67 of this part:
(1) You must ensure that a passenger with a disability who uses a wheelchair and takes advantage of the opportunity to preboard the aircraft can stow his or her wheelchair in this area, with priority over other items brought onto the aircraft by other passengers or crew enplaning at the same airport, consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items. You must move items that you or your personnel have placed in the priority stowage area (
e.g.,
crew luggage, an on-board wheelchair) to make room for the passenger's wheelchair, even if these items were stowed in the priority stowage area before the passenger seeking to stow a wheelchair boarded the aircraft (
e.g.,
the items were placed there on a previous leg of the flight).
(2) You must also ensure that a passenger with a disability who takes advantage of the opportunity to preboard the aircraft can stow other assistive devices in this area, with priority over other items (except wheelchairs) brought onto the aircraft by other passengers enplaning at the same airport consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.
(3) You must ensure that a passenger with a disability who does not take advantage of the opportunity to preboard is able to use the area to stow his or her wheelchair or other assistive device on a first-come, first-served basis along with all other passengers seeking to stow carry-on items in the area.
(b) If a wheelchair exceeds the space provided for in § 382.67 of this part while fully assembled but will fit if wheels or other components can be removed without the use of tools, you must remove the applicable components and stow the wheelchair in the designated space. In this case, you must stow the removed components in areas provided for stowage of carry-on luggage.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 67924, Nov. 12, 2013]
§ 382.125
What procedures do carriers follow when wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices must be stowed in the cargo compartment?
(a) As a carrier, you must stow wheelchairs, other mobility aids, or
other assistive devices in the baggage compartment if an approved stowage area is not available in the cabin or the items cannot be transported in the cabin consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.
(b) You must give wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices priority for stowage in the baggage compartment over other cargo and baggage. Only items that fit into the baggage compartment and can be transported consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of items in the baggage compartment need be transported. Where this priority results in other passengers' baggage being unable to be carried on the flight, you must make your best efforts to ensure that the other baggage reaches the passengers' destination on the carrier's next flight to the destination.
(c) You must provide for the checking and timely return of passengers' wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices as close as possible to the door of the aircraft, so that passengers may use their own equipment to the extent possible, except
(1) Where this practice would be inconsistent with Federal regulations governing transportation security or the transportation of hazardous materials; or
(2) When the passenger requests the return of the items at the baggage claim area instead of at the door of the aircraft.
(d) In order to achieve the timely return of wheelchairs, you must ensure that passengers' wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices are among the first items retrieved from the baggage compartment.
§ 382.125, Nt.

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102442, Dec. 17, 2024, § 382.125 was amended by adding paragraphs (e) and (f), effective Jan. 16, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the added text is set forth as follows:
§ 382.125
What procedures do carriers follow when wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices must be stowed in the cargo compartment?
(e) You must notify passengers in writing when they check wheelchairs or scooters to be stowed in the baggage compartment that they have the right to contact a CRO, how they can contact a CRO, and the right to file a claim with the airline if their wheelchairs or scooters are mishandled while in your custody. You must provide this notification in an accessible format for individuals with disabilities.
(f)(1) You must notify passengers with disabilities, before the aircraft cabin door closes, whether their wheelchairs or scooters have been loaded in the cargo compartments of their flights, including whether their device could not fit on the passenger's scheduled flight because of its size or weight.
(2) If a passenger's wheelchair or scooter is not loaded on his or her scheduled flight for whatever reason, you must offer to disembark the passenger and rebook them at no additional cost on the next available flight operated by you or a partner carrier. In addition, when you become aware that a passenger's wheelchair or scooter does not fit on the passenger's scheduled flight, if that is the case, you must offer to rebook the passenger at no additional cost on the next available flight operated by you or a partner carrier where the wheelchair or scooter will fit, if such an aircraft is available.
(3) You must notify passengers with disabilities, before they deplane, when their wheelchairs or scooters have been unloaded from the cargo compartments of their flights upon arrival.
(4) You must provide the notifications required by paragraphs (f)(1) and (3) of this section in an accessible format for individuals with disabilities.
§ 382.127
What procedures apply to stowage of battery-powered mobility aids?
(a) Whenever baggage compartment size and aircraft airworthiness considerations do not prohibit doing so, you must, as a carrier, accept a passenger's battery-powered wheelchair or other similar mobility device, including the battery, as checked baggage, consistent with the requirements of 49 CFR 175.10(a)(15) and (16) and the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
(b) You may require that passengers with a disability wishing to have battery-powered wheelchairs or other
similar mobility devices transported on a flight check in one hour before the check-in time for the general public. If the passenger checks in after this time, you must nonetheless carry the wheelchair or other similar mobility device if you can do so by making a reasonable effort, without delaying the flight.
(c) If the battery on the passenger's wheelchair or other similar mobility device has been labeled by the manufacturer as non-spillable as provided in 49 CFR 173.159(d)(2), or if a battery-powered wheelchair with a spillable battery can be loaded, stored, secured and unloaded in an upright position, you must not require the battery to be removed and separately packaged. Notwithstanding this requirement, you must remove and package separately any battery that is inadequately secured to a wheelchair or, for a spillable battery, is contained in a wheelchair that cannot be loaded, stowed, secured and unloaded in an upright position, in accordance with 49 CFR 175.10(a)(15) and (16). A damaged or leaking battery should not be transported.
(d) When it is necessary to detach the battery from the wheelchair, you must, upon request, provide packaging for the battery meeting the requirements of 49 CFR 175.10(a)(15) and (16) and package the battery. You may refuse to use packaging materials or devices other than those you normally use for this purpose.
(e) You must not disconnect the battery on wheelchairs or other mobility devices equipped with a non-spillable battery completely enclosed within a case or compartment integral to the design of the device unless an FAA or PHMSA safety regulation, or an applicable foreign safety regulation having mandatory legal effect, requires you to do so.
(f) You must not drain batteries.
§ 382.129
What other requirements apply when passengers' wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices must be disassembled for stowage?
(a) As a carrier, you must permit passengers with a disability to provide written directions concerning the disassembly and reassembly of their wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices. You must carry out these instructions to the greatest extent feasible, consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.
(b) When wheelchairs, other mobility aids, or other assistive devices are disassembled by the carrier for stowage, you must reassemble them and ensure their prompt return to the passenger. You must return wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices to the passenger in the condition in which you received them.
§ 382.130
What are the handling requirements for wheelchairs, scooters, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices and what obligations apply when wheelchairs or other assistive devices are mishandled?
(a) You must return checked wheelchairs, scooters, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices to the passenger in the condition in which you received them. Whenever a passenger's checked wheelchair, scooter, other mobility aid, or other assistive device that was in your custody is not returned to the passenger in the same condition it was received, there is a rebuttable presumption that you mishandled the passenger's wheelchair, scooter, other mobility aid, or other assistive device in violation of the ACAA.
(1) The presumption of a violation in this paragraph (a) can be overcome if you can successfully demonstrate that the alleged mishandling of the wheelchair, scooter, other mobility aid, or other assistive device did not occur while the wheelchair, scooter, other mobility aid, or assistive device was in your control and custody (
e.g.,
the damage occurred before the passenger checked the wheelchair, scooter, other mobility aid, or assistive device; the damage occurred after you returned the wheelchair, scooter, other mobility aid, or assistive device to the passenger) or that the passenger's claim is false or fraudulent.
(2) The presumption of a violation in this paragraph (a) cannot be overcome by demonstrating that the mishandling of a checked wheelchair, scooter, other
mobility aid, or other assistive device is the result of “an act of God” or other circumstances beyond the control of the airline.
(b) When you become aware that a passenger's wheelchair or scooter has been mishandled (
i.e.,
your personnel notices that the wheelchair or assistive device has been mishandled or the passenger notifies airline personnel of the mishandling of the wheelchair or assistive device, whichever occurs first), you must immediately notify the impacted passenger in writing of his or her rights to file a claim with the carrier, to receive a loaner wheelchair or scooter from the carrier with certain customizations described in paragraph (e) of this section, to choose a preferred vendor for repairs or replacement of the device, and to have a Complaints Resolution Official (CRO) available and be provided information on how to contact the CRO. You must provide this notification in an accessible format for individuals with disabilities.
(c)(1) When a passenger's checked wheelchair or scooter has been delayed while in your custody, you must ensure that the device is transported to the passenger's final destination within 24 hours of the passenger's arrival for domestic flights and short international flights between the United States and a foreign point that is 12 hours or less in duration and within 30 hours of the passenger's arrival for long international flights between the United States and a foreign point that is more than 12 hours in duration. You must transport the delayed device by whatever means are available to safely do so.
(2) You must provide passengers a choice between picking up the delayed wheelchair or scooter at the passenger's final destination airport or having the delayed wheelchair or scooter delivered to a reasonable location requested by the passenger, such as the passenger's home or hotel. Depending on the passenger's choice, the delayed wheelchair or scooter is considered to be provided to the passenger either when the passenger or another person authorized to act on behalf of the passenger picks up the delayed wheelchair or scooter at his or her destination airport or when you deliver the delayed wheelchair or scooter to the passenger or another person authorized to act on behalf of the passenger at a reasonable location requested by the passenger, such as the passenger's home or hotel.
(3) If a passenger files a claim with you for a delayed wheelchair or scooter, you must provide them updates when there is a status change for the delayed device.
(4) In consultation with disability rights organizations, you must establish and provide safe and adequate seating accommodations at the airport to be used by individuals with disabilities who are waiting for delayed personal wheelchairs or scooters or waiting for loaner wheelchairs or scooters after a passenger's wheelchair or scooter is mishandled by you and cannot be promptly returned.
(5) You must reimburse passengers for the cost(s) of any transportation to or from the airport that the passenger incurred as a direct result of you delaying the passenger's wheelchair or scooter. You may require passengers to submit documentation that substantiates the cost(s), such as receipts or invoices, to receive reimbursement.
(d) When a passenger's checked wheelchair or scooter has been lost, damaged, or pilfered while in your custody, you must:
(1) Provide the passenger a reasonable timeframe to inspect the wheelchair or scooter and to file a claim with the carrier for the mishandling;
(2) Provide the passenger the following options if repair or replacement is needed:
(i) The passenger may file a claim with you and elect for the carrier to handle the repair or replacement of the wheelchair or scooter. If the passenger selects this option, you must promptly repair or replace the wheelchair or scooter, with a device of equivalent or greater function and safety, and pay the cost of repair or replacement; or
(ii) The passenger may file a claim with you and elect to use the passenger's preferred vendor to repair or replace the wheelchair or scooter. If the passenger selects this option, you are responsible for promptly transporting the passenger's wheelchair or scooter to the passenger's preferred
vendor, unless the passenger has indicated that he or she will arrange for the transport themselves, and for directly paying the cost of transport and repair or replacement, with a device of equivalent or greater function and safety; and
(3) Promptly review all claims received within a reasonable time of the repaired or replaced wheelchair or scooter being returned to the passenger alleging that the provided repairs were not sufficient. If the passenger's claim is warranted and the initial repairs were insufficient, then you must promptly repair or replace the device to the passenger's satisfaction.
(e) While the passenger is waiting for his or her mishandled personal wheelchair or scooter to be returned, repaired, or replaced, you must use your best efforts to work with the passenger and to provide an adequate loaner wheelchair or scooter that meets the passenger's functional, mobility-related and safety-related needs, to the maximum extent possible. You must pay for the cost of the loaner wheelchair or scooter. If the loaner wheelchair or scooter you offer does not meet the passenger's functional and safety-related needs as well as the passenger's existing device, the passenger may find and secure an alternative loaner wheelchair or scooter that is better than the one you offered, and you must reimburse the passenger for the cost of that loaner within 30 days of the passenger's request. You may require the passenger to provide documentation substantiating the cost, such as receipts or invoices, to receive the reimbursement.
(f) The liability limits for carriers under the Montreal Convention will apply if the wheelchair or scooter mishandling occurs on an international flight.

What requirements apply when a passenger who uses a wheelchair or scooter cannot purchase a certain flight because his or her wheelchair or scooter will not fit in the cabin or cargo compartment of the aircraft for that flight?
(a) As part of your obligation under § 382.11 to not exclude a qualified individual with a disability from or deny the person the benefit of any air transportation or related services that are available to other persons, to the extent a passenger who uses a wheelchair or scooter cannot book his or her preferred flight because his or her wheelchair or scooter cannot fit in the cabin or cargo compartment of the aircraft of the preferred flight, and the passenger must book a more expensive flight that can accommodate the passenger's wheelchair or scooter, you must, upon request, reimburse the passenger the difference between the more expensive flight the passenger purchased and had to take and the preferred flight that the passenger would have purchased and taken if his or her wheelchair or scooter had been able to fit.
(b) As a condition for issuing reimbursements in paragraph (a) of this section, you may require the following from passengers with disabilities:
(1) The preferred flight and the more expensive flight are on the same airline;
(2) The preferred flight and the more expensive flight are on the same day;
(3) The preferred flight and the more expensive flight have the same origin and destination;
(4) Reasonable documentation to verify: the dimensions of the passenger's wheelchair or scooter; the cost of the passenger's preferred flight that could not accommodate the passenger's wheelchair or scooter; and the cost of the more expensive flight the passenger purchased and had to take.
(c) You must provide the reimbursement required by paragraph (a) of this
section within 30 days of receiving a request and the reasonable documentation permitted in paragraph (b) of this section, if you require such documentation.
(d) You must disclose on your website accurate information on the documentation you require from the passenger to support a reimbursement claim.

[Doc. No. T-1, 49 FR 50985, Dec. 31, 1984, as amended by Amdt. 1-261, 59 FR 10061, Mar. 3, 1994; 60 FR 66726, Dec. 26, 1995; Doc. No. OST-96-1268, 61 FR 19167, May 1, 1996; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15942, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 385.2
Applicability.
This part describes the organization of the Department insofar as, pursuant to authority conferred on it by section 40113 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, the Department has adopted rules herein or elsewhere which make continuing assignments of authority with respect to any of its functions of making orders or other determinations, many of which are not required to be made on an evidentiary record upon notice and hearing or which are not the subject of contest, and Department personnel have been assigned to perform such functions. Delegations by the Secretary of Transportation to Secretarial Officers of functions under Subparts I, II, and IV of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII appear in 49 CFR part 1. This part also
sets forth the procedures governing discretionary review by the appropriate Reviewing Official of action taken under such assignments. Nothing in this part shall be construed as precluding the Department from issuing, by appropriate order, temporary delegations of authority with respect to any functions described in this part or with respect to any other functions which can be lawfully delegated.
[Doc. No. T-1, 49 FR 50985, Dec. 31, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 66726, Dec. 26, 1995; Doc. No. OST-96-1268, 61 FR 19167, May 1, 1996; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15942, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 385.3
Scope of staff action.
Applications for relief which, pursuant to this part, may be granted by staff members under assigned authority, and proceedings on such requests shall be governed by applicable rules in the same manner as if no assignment had been made (see § 385.5). In such proceedings, each staff member may determine any procedural matters which may arise, including, inter alia, service of documents on additional persons; filing of otherwise unauthorized documents; waivers of procedural requirements; requests for hearing; requests for additional information; dismissal of applications upon the applicant's request, moot applications, or incomplete or otherwise defective applications; and extensions of time. Such determinations, except those which would terminate the matter, shall be subject to review only in connection with review of the staff member's decision on the merits. The dismissal of incomplete or otherwise defective applications under authority set forth in this part shall be without prejudice except where under otherwise applicable law the time for making application has run out or where the defect is not corrected within a reasonable time fixed by the staff member. Under the authority assigned to the staff as set forth in this part to approve, disapprove, grant, or deny, relief may be granted or denied in part and grants may be made subject to lawful and reasonable conditions. Moreover, where applicable, the authority to grant relief also includes authority to renew or extend an existing authorization.
[Doc. No. T-1, 49 FR 50985, Dec. 31, 1984; Amdt. 1, 50 FR 7170, Feb. 21, 1985]
§ 385.4
Form of staff action.
Unless otherwise specified, staff action shall be by order or informal writing (letters, telegrams, decision marked on copy of application form, etc.). Such orders or informal writings shall contain a recital that action is taken pursuant to authority assigned herein, shall, in cases where there are “parties or interveners,” or where there may be an adverse effect upon a person with a substantial interest, contain a brief reference to the right of aggrieved parties to petition the Reviewing Official for review pursuant to applicable procedural rules, including a statement of the time within which petitions must be filed (§ 385.51); shall state whether the filing of a petition shall preclude the action from becoming effective; and shall be in the name of the person exercising the assigned function. They shall contain all findings, determinations and conclusions which would be required or appropriate if they were issued by the Secretary. Upon request, the appropriate Department Official shall attest as Departmental action orders or informal writings issued pursuant to this part which have become the action of the Department (§ 385.52).
[Doc. No. T-1, 49 FR 50985, Dec. 31, 1984; Amdt. 1, 50 FR 7170, Feb. 21, 1985]
§ 385.5
Procedures prescribed in other regulations.
Procedures set forth in this part do not supersede procedures applicable to matters on which decision has been assigned unless otherwise specifically provided herein:
Provided, however,
That any provisions in other regulations which provide for reconsideration of nonhearing determinations are not applicable to decisions made under authority assigned herein or to decisions made upon review thereof by the Reviewing Official.
§ 385.6
Referral to the Reviewing Official.
When the staff member finds that the public interest so requires, or that, with respect to other than matters requiring immediate action as hereafter specified, there will be insufficient time for discretionary review of his or her decision upon petition, the staff member shall, in lieu of exercising the authority, submit the matter to the Reviewing Official for decision. In any case in which the staff member finds that immediate action is required with respect to any matter assigned herein, the disposition of which is governed by prior precedent and policy, the staff member may take appropriate action and specify that the filing of a petition for review shall not preclude such action from becoming effective.
§ 385.7
Exercise of authority by superiors.
Any assignment of authority to a staff member other than the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the Administrative Law Judge, and the General Counsel, shall also be deemed to be made, severally, to each such staff member's respective superiors. In accordance with the Department's principle of management responsibility, the superior may choose to exercise the assigned power personally. Moreover, the Secretary may at any time exercise any authority assigned herein.
[Docket No. T-1, 49 FR 50985, Dec. 31, 1984, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15942, Apr. 16, 2019]

Exercise of authority in “acting” capacity.
Unless the assignment provides otherwise, staff members serving in an “acting” capacity may exercise the authority assigned to the staff members for whom they are acting.

The request should include applicable official government rules, decisions, statements of policy, or comparable evidence concerning filing fees for U.S. air carriers, or for all carriers serving that country. Once a waiver has been granted for a specific country, no further waiver applications need be filed for that country.

# Source:
Docket No. OST-95-397, 60 FR 43529, Aug. 22, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 398.1
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to establish general guidelines for the determination of basic essential air service for each eligible place under 49 U.S.C. 41731 and 41732. Procedures for the determination of the essential air service level for a place are contained in part 325 of this chapter.
§ 398.2
Number and designation of hubs.
(a)
What is a hub?
The Department considers hubs as belonging to any one of three classifications:
(1) A
large
hub is a place accounting for at least 1.00 percent of the total enplanements in the United States;
(2) A
medium
hub is a place accounting for at least 0.25 percent but less than 1.00 percent of the total enplanements in the United States; and
(3) A
small
hub is a place accounting for at least 0.05 percent but less than 0.25 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
(b)
How many hubs?
(1) As a general matter, the Department will require service to one large or medium hub.
(2) In Alaska or when the nearest large or medium hub is more than 400 miles from the eligible place, the Department may instead require service to a small hub or nonhub.
(3) In some cases, the Department may require service to two hubs, of which at least one will be a large or medium hub. The Department will require service to two hubs if an eligible place has close commercial, geographic, and political ties to both hubs and if there is sufficient traffic from the eligible place to support two round trips a day to both hubs. If traffic is not sufficient, the Department may require one round trip a day to both hubs if the community requests such service.
(4) In no event will essential air service consist of service to more than two hubs.
(c)
Which hub?
(1) In designating hubs, the Department will weigh all of the following factors:
(i) The extent to which candidate hubs provide access to the national air transportation system;
(ii) The commercial, geographic, and political ties of candidate hubs to the eligible place;
(iii) The traffic levels to candidate hubs, as shown by traffic studies and origin and designation data;
(iv) The distance of candidate hubs from the eligible place; and
(v) The size of candidate hubs. Large size will be a positive factor, but principally as substantiating the access and community-ties factors.
(2) For Alaska, rather than requiring service to a hub, the Department may instead require that service from an eligible place be provided to a nearby focal point for traffic which, in turn, has service to a hub.
§ 398.3
Specific airports.
(a) At an eligible place, essential air service may be specified as service to a particular airport. In the case of hyphenated places, essential air service will be specified as service to more than one airport only if clearly necessary and if the multi-airport service is economically feasible and justified on the basis of traffic levels at those airports.
(b) At a hub, essential air service is not usually specified as service to a particular airport.
§ 398.4
Equipment.
(a) Except in Alaska, service will be provided by aircraft offering at least 15 passenger seats, unless:
(1) Average daily enplanements at the place did not exceed 11 passengers for any fiscal year from 1976 through 1986;
(2) The requirement would necessitate the payment of compensation in a fiscal year for service at the place when compensation would otherwise not be necessary; or
(3) The affected community agrees in writing to the use of smaller aircraft to provide service at the place.
(b) The aircraft must have at least two engines and use two pilots, unless scheduled air transportation has not been provided to the place in aircraft with at least two engines and using two pilots for at least 60 consecutive operating days at any time since October 31, 1978.
(c) The aircraft must be pressurized when the service regularly involves flights above 8,000 feet in altitude.
(d) All aircraft must meet the applicable safety standards of the Federal Aviation Administration.
(e) The aircraft must be conveniently accessible to passengers by stairs rather than over the wing.
§ 398.5
Frequency of flights.
(a) Except in Alaska, at least two round trips each weekday and two round trips each weekend.
(b) In Alaska, a level of service at least equal to that provided in 1976, or two round trips each week, whichever is greater, except that the Department and the appropriate State authority of Alaska may agree to a different level of service after consulting with the affected community.
(c) An essential air service level may be set at more than that stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if:
(1) Historical traffic data and studies of traffic-generating potential for the place indicate that more frequent service is needed to accommodate passengers and accompanying baggage with the aircraft used at that place;
(2) More flights are needed because the capacity available to the eligible place is being shared with traffic destined for an intermediate stop or for a place beyond the eligible place;
(3) More flights are needed to accommodate passengers because smaller aircraft are being used at the place;
(4) More flights are needed in order to ensure adequate connecting opportunities as provided for by § 398.7; or
(5) For Alaska, the appropriate state agency agrees that more frequent service is needed to accommodate cargo traffic with the aircraft used at the eligible place.
(d) For eligible places where traffic levels vary substantially with the season, a two-tier level of essential air service may be established with required flight frequencies changing accordingly.
§ 398.6
Seat guarantees.
(a) The number of seats guaranteed at the eligible place will be sufficient to accommodate the estimated passenger traffic at an average load factor of 60 percent, except that an average load factor of 50 percent will be used when service is provided with aircraft having fewer than 15 passenger seats.
(b) Only under unusual circumstances will an eligible place's essential air service level be set at a number of flights that will accommodate more than 40 passengers a day in each direction (a total of 80 inbound and outbound passengers). Generally, 40 passengers can be accommodated by guaranteeing 67 seats a day in each direction (a total of 134 inbound and outbound seats).
(c) The Department may guarantee an eligible place more than 67 seats a day if:
(1) The number of stops between or beyond the eligible place and the hub results in available aircraft capacity being shared with passengers at those other places;
(2) The distance between the eligible place and the designated hub requires the use of large aircraft;
(3) The eligible place has suffered an abrupt and significant reduction in its service that warrants a temporary increase in the maximum guaranteed capacity; or
(4) Other unusual circumstances warrant guaranteeing the eligible place more than 67 seats a day.
§ 398.7
Timing of flights.
To qualify as essential air service, flights must depart at reasonable times, considering the needs of passengers with connecting flights at the hub. It is the policy of the Department to consider the reasonableness of the time in view of the purpose for which the local passengers are traveling. If travel is primarily to connect with other flights at the hub, local flight times should be designed to link with those flights. If travel is primarily local (
i.e.,
to and from the hub), there should be at least one morning flight in each direction and one late-afternoon or evening flight in each direction.
§ 398.8
Number of intermediate stops.
(a) Except in Alaska, no more than one intermediate stop is permitted in providing essential air service between the eligible place and its hub, unless otherwise agreed to with the community. In cases where an eligible place receives service to two hubs, however, more than one intermediate stop is permitted between that place and its secondary hub.
(b) In Alaska, more than one intermediate stop is permitted if required by low traffic levels at the eligible place or by the long distance between the eligible place and its hub.
(c) The Department may specify nonstop service when necessary to make the service viable.
(d) Where an eligible place normally is an intermediate stop that shares available capacity with another place, it is the policy of the Department either to require additional capacity (more flights or larger aircraft) between the eligible place and its hub or to specify some turnaround operations on that route segment.
§ 398.9
Load factor standards.
The load factor standards used in this part may be raised for individual eligible places under either of the following circumstances:
(a) The place is served by the carrier as part of a linear route; or
(b) It would be in the interest of the community, the carrier, or the general public to raise the load factor standard for that place.
§ 398.10
Overflights.
The Department considers it a violation of 49 U.S.C. 41732 and the air service guarantees provided under this part for an air carrier providing essential air service to an eligible place to overfly that place, except under one or more of the following circumstances:
(a) The carrier is not compensated for serving that place and another carrier is providing by its flights the service required by the Department's essential air service determination for that place;
(b) Circumstances beyond the carrier's control prevent it from landing at the eligible place;
(c) The flight involved is not in a market where the Department has determined air service to be essential; or
(d) The eligible place is a place in Alaska for which the Department's essential air service determination permits the overflight.

Applicability.
All statements of general policy adopted by the Department for the guidance of the public will be published in this part, except as provided in § 399.2.
§ 399.2
Exclusions.
The following types of policies are generally not included in this part:
(a) Policies relating solely to the internal management of the Department;
(b) Policies requiring secrecy in the public interest or in the interest of national defense;
(c) Policies that are repetitive of 49 U.S.C. 40101;

[PS-21, 29 FR 1446, Jan. 29, 1964, as amended by PS-63, 40 FR 6643, Feb. 13, 1975, Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15947, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 399.3
Statements in other Department documents.
No statement contained in any Department opinion, decision, order, certificate, permit, exemption, or waiver shall be considered a statement of policy within the meaning of this part, even though such statements may constitute a precedent in future cases or declare future policy to be followed in like cases. Similarly, a denial by the Department or relief sought, or statements of the Department's reasons for failure to issue a rule upon which rulemaking proceedings have been commenced shall not be considered statements of policy, except to the extent
that it is specifically stated that such denial or failure is based upon a policy thereafter to be followed.
§ 399.4
Nature and effect of policy statements.
Policy statements published in this part will be observed by the Department until rescinded, but any policy may be amended from time to time as experience or changing conditions may require. Changes in policy may be made with or without advance notice to the public and will become effective upon publication in the
Federal Register
unless otherwise provided. If it appears to the Department, in its consideration of any matter before it, that the application of a policy published in this part would run counter to an express provision of law or policy enunciated by Congress in 49 U.S.C., the published policy shall not be applicable to such matter.
[PS-21, 29 FR 1446, Jan. 29, 1964, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15947, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 399.5
Arrangement of policy statements.
The statements of general policy relating to the various duties and functions of the Department are grouped according to subject matter in the following subparts; the titles of the subparts indicate the general subject matter included therein.

# Subpart B—Policies Relating to Operating Authority
§§ 399.10-399.11
[Reserved]
§ 399.12
Negotiation by air carriers for landing rights in foreign countries.
(a) It is the policy of the Department(jointly with the Department of State) that, as a general rule, landing rights abroad for United States flag air carriers will be acquired through negotiation by the U.S. Government with foreign governments rather than by direct negotiation between an air carrier and a foreign government.
(b) It is corollary to the foregoing policy that no United States air carrier may avail itself of representations by one foreign government to further its interest with another foreign government, especially with respect to landing rights, except insofar as such representations have been specifically authorized by the U.S. Government.
§§ 399.13-399.17
[Reserved]
§ 399.18
Maximum duration of fixed-term route authorization granted by exemption; renewal of such authority.
It is the policy of the Department to limit the duration of exemptions which authorize fixed-term route service to a maximum period of two years, and to entertain requests for renewal of such authority only when incorporated in a duly filed application for substantially equivalent certificate authority under section 401 of the Act. (See § 377.10(c) of this chapter (Special Regulations).)
[PS-21, 29 FR 1446, Jan. 29, 1964, as amended at 65 FR 6457, Feb. 9, 2000]
§ 399.19
[Reserved]
§ 399.21
Charter exemptions (except military).
In deciding applications for exemptions from section 41102 of Title 49 of the United States Code by air carriers seeking to perform charter service in air transportation, we will give primary weight to the chartering public's own assessment of the air carrier services that best meet its transportation needs. Therefore, we will not, as a general rule, consider as relevant to our decision on such applications, objections based upon (1) offers by the objectors to perform the charter service, and/or (2) estimates of revenue or traffic diversion, unless in the latter case the objectors demonstrate that the diversion resulting from grant of the exemption would threaten their ability to fulfill their certificate obligations.
[PS-78, 43 FR 31886, July 24, 1978, as amended at 60 FR 43531, Aug. 22, 1995]

# Subpart C—Policies Relating to Rates and Tariffs
§ 399.35
Special tariff permission.
The Secretary of Transportation may approve, under such terms as the Secretary may require, a carrier's application for Special Tariff Permission to
file a tariff for foreign air transportation required under part 293 of this chapter on less than the notice required by 49 U.S.C. 41504(b).
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15947, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 399.36
Unreasonable discrimination.
(a) As used in this section:
(1)
Unreasonable discrimination
means unjust discrimination or unreasonable preference or prejudice; and
(2)
Rate
means rate, fare, or charge.
(b) Except in unusual circumstances or as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Departmentwill find a rate for domestic air transportation to constitute unreasonable discrimination only if:
(1) There is a reasonable probability that the rate will result in significant long-run economic injury to passengers or shippers;
(2) The rate is in fact discriminatory according to a reasonable cost allocation or other rational basis;
(3) The rate does not provide transportation or other statutorily recognized benefits that justify the discrimination; and
(4) Actual and potential competitive forces cannot reliably be expected to eliminate the undesirable effects of the discrimination within a reasonable period.
(c) A rate that discriminates on the basis of the status of the traffic carried will not be presumed to be unreasonably discriminatory, unless the use of the status categories in question is contrary to established national anti-discrimination policy.
[PS-93, 45 FR 36062, May 29, 1980]
§ 399.39
Equipment purchase deposits.
Equipment purchase deposits are advance payments made by air carriers to manufacturers for the purchase of equipment to be delivered in the future, or funds segregated by air carriers for this purpose. It is the policy of the Department not to recognize equipment purchase deposits in an air carrier's investment base for ratemaking purposes. When equipment is acquired by an air carrier and placed in air-transport service, the Department will recognize in the air carrier's investment base interest on purchase deposits on such equipment capitalized and amortized in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts and Reports for Certificated Air Carriers (part 241 of this chapter).

Subpart D [Reserved]

# Subpart E—Policies Relating to Hearing Matters
§ 399.60
Standards for determining priorities of hearing.
(a)
General.
This policy statement describes the general standards which will be used by the Department in determining the order in which it will designate for hearing those matters on its docket which are to be decided after notice and hearing. Among such matters are applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity or for foreign air carrier permits; complaint cases; and various rate-making proceedings.
(b)
Standards.
Matters will be assigned for hearing in accordance with the degree of relative priority which each matter is entitled to on the basis of the comparative public interest involved therein. Among other things, the Department will take into account:
(1) Statutory requirements for preference or statutory limitations on the time within which the Department shall act;
(2) The impact of delay on the public or particular persons;
(3) The need for promptly securing compliance with the provisions of the Act;
(4) The time for which the matter has already been pending and which would be required to dispose of it;
(5) Whether the application requests renewal of an existing temporary authorization; and
(6) In matters relating to operating authority:
(i) Whether a proposal might reduce subsidy or increase economy of operations;
(ii) Whether an application proposes new service;
(iii) The volume of traffic that might be affected by the grant or denial of the proposal;
(iv) The period that has elapsed since the Department considered the service needs of the places or areas involved; and
(v) The relative availability of necessary staff members of the carriers, communities and the Department, in the light of other proceedings already in progress, to handle the processing of the case.
Interested persons may urge upon the Department such considerations as they believe should lead it to accord a particular application a priority different from that which the Department has given it.
[PS-21, 29 FR 1446, Jan. 29, 1964, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15947, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 399.61
Presentations of public and civic bodies in route proceedings.
For the purpose of implementing the Department's policy to provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence and otherwise to expedite route proceedings, and in light of experience, the following guidelines are hereby established:
(a) Public and civic bodies which represent the same geographic area or community should consolidate their presentation of evidence, briefs or oral argument to the examiner and the Department;
(b) A public body or a civic organization, or several such bodies or organizations whose presentation of evidence is consolidated, should keep to a minimum the number of witnesses used to present the factual evidence in support of the community's position;
(c) Exhibits offered in evidence by a public body or civic organization should be limited to evidence of the economic characteristics of the community and area involved, data as to community of interest and traffic, evidence with respect to the sufficiency of existing service, and airport data, and should not include data relating to number of electricity, water and gas meters, telephones, schools, freight car loadings, building permits, sewer connections, or volume of bank deposits in the community.
§ 399.62
Target dates in hearing cases.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to initial and recommended decisions of administrative law judges, final decisions, and decisions on petitions for review or reconsideration in cases in which the Department has ordered a trial-type hearing before an administrative law judge.
(b)
Issuance of target dates.
In cases to which this section applies, the Department or the administrative law judge, as the situation calls for, shall issue a notice of the target date for the completion of the initial or recommended decision, final decision, or decision on a petition for review or reconsideration. The Department or the administrative law judge shall endeavor to render the pending decision not later than the target date.
(c)
Time for promulgating target dates.
(1) In the case of initial, recommended, or final decisions, notice of target dates shall be issued, served, and filed within 20 days of the submission of closing briefs, or the conclusion of oral argument to the administrative law judge or the Department, as may be appropriate.
(2) In the case of petitions for review or for reconsideration, notices of target dates shall be issued, served, and filed within 20 days of the date for the filing of answers:
Provided,
That, in the case of petitions for reconsideration of Department decisions awarding new route authority, the Department shall, in lieu of issuing individual target dates, endeavor to render its decision no later than the day preceding the effective date of the new authority awarded.
[PS-71, 41 FR 41407, Sept. 22, 1976, as amended by PS-73, 42 FR 21611, Apr. 28, 1977]
§ 399.63
Role of staff in route proceedings.
(a)
General.
This policy statement establishes the standards applicable to staff participation in oral hearing cases involving award of route authority.
(b)
Standards.
The staff's role during such hearings, primarily because it acts in the broad public interest, and not for a particular private or local interest, is to assure that essential evidence is introduced to resolve the public interest issues; that the evidence submitted by the parties is subject to adversary testing, and that decisional options are developed with the public interest in mind. In route cases designated by the Department that offer the opportunity for developing new policies to adapt to the administration of the Federal Aviation Act or that raise unusual evidentiary issues, a prehearing presentation by staff of decisional options will contribute to a better trial record, be consistent with traditional notions of fundamental fairness, better serve the Department's decisionmaking needs and ultimately serve the public interest. In any route case where the Department has not required the staff to participate by making a prehearing presentation, the staff shall present a prehearing presentation of decisional options if the administrative law judge finds that there exists unusual policy or evidentiary issues which clearly require such a presentation. We believe it is not desirable for the staff to advocate the adoption of a single decisional option at the outset of a case. Accordingly,
(1) In route cases designated by the Department that offer the opportunity for developing new policies, the staff shall make a prehearing presentation of the decisional options available, and describe the kinds of evidence needed or available to develop each option. The staff need not and should not be required to develop evidence on each option. In every case, after the close of the hearing, however, the staff shall advocate a position based upon one or more of the decisional options identified in its prehearing presentation or developed at trial.
(2) In any route case in which the administrative law judge finds that there exists unusual policy or evidentiary issues clearly requiring a prehearing presentation, the staff shall submit a prehearing statement of the decisional options available.
(3) To the extent possible, the Department, in its instituting orders, will identify or designate the cases which involve the development of new policies or unusual evidentiary issues that will require the type of staff participation described in § 399.63(b)(1).
[PS-76, 43 FR 19354, May 5, 1978]

# Subpart F—Policies Relating to Rulemaking Proceedings
§ 399.70
Cross-references to the Office of the Secretary's Rulemaking Procedures.
The rules and policies relating to the disposition of rulemaking petitions by the Department of Transportation Office of the Secretary are located in its
rulemaking procedures contained in 49 CFR part 5. The criteria for identifying significant rules and determining whether a regulatory analysis will be performed are set forth in the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, 44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979, and Executive Order 12866.
[Doc. No. OST-96-1429, 61 FR 29019, June 7, 1996]
§ 399.73
Definition of small business for Regulatory Flexibility Act.
For the purposes of the Department's implementation of chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code (Regulatory Flexibility Act), a direct air carrier or foreign air carrier is a small business if it provides air transportation only with small aircraft as defined in § 298.2 of this chapter (up to 60 seats/18,000 pound payload capacity).
[Doc. No. OST-96-1429, 61 FR 29019, June 7, 1996, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15947, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 399.75
Rulemakings relating to unfair and deceptive practices.
(a)
General.
When issuing a proposed or final regulation declaring a practice in air transportation or the sale of air transportation to be unfair or deceptive to consumers under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 41712(a), unless the regulation is specifically required by statute, the Department shall employ the definitions of “unfair” and “deceptive” set forth in § 399.79.
(b)
Procedural requirements.
When issuing a proposed regulation under paragraph (a) of this section, unless the regulation is specifically required by statute, the Department shall adhere to the following procedural requirements:
(1)
Request for a hearing.
Following publication of a proposed regulation, and before the close of the comment period, any interested party may file in the rulemaking docket a petition, directed to the General Counsel, to hold a hearing on the proposed regulation.
(2)
Decision on petition for hearing.
The petition shall be granted if the petitioner makes a clear and convincing showing that granting the petition is in the public interest. Factors in determining whether a petition is in the public interest include, but are not limited to:
(i) Whether the proposed rule depends on conclusions concerning one or more specific scientific, technical, economic, or other factual issues that are genuinely in dispute or that may not satisfy the requirements of the Information Quality Act;
(ii) Whether the ordinary public comment process is unlikely to provide an adequate examination of the issues to permit a fully informed judgment;
(iii) Whether the resolution of the disputed factual issues would likely have a material effect on the costs and benefits of the proposed rule;
(iv) Whether the requested hearing would advance the consideration of the proposed rule and the General Counsel's ability to make the rulemaking determinations required by this section; and
(v) Whether the hearing would unreasonably delay completion of the rulemaking.
(3)
Explanation of decision.
If a petition is granted or denied in whole or in part, the General Counsel shall provide an explanation of the basis for the decision,
(4)
Hearing notice.
If the General Counsel grants the petition, the General Counsel shall publish notification of the hearing in the
Federal Register.
The document shall specify the proposed rule at issue and the specific factual issues to be considered at the hearing. The scope of the hearing shall be limited to the factual issues specified in the notice.
(5)
Hearing process.
(i) A hearing under this section shall be conducted using procedures approved by the General Counsel, and interested parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the hearing.
(ii) The General Counsel shall arrange for a hearing officer to preside over the hearing.
(iii) After the hearing and after the record of the hearing is closed, the hearing officer shall place on the docket minutes of the hearing with sufficient detail as to fully reflect the evidence and arguments presented on the issues. The complete record of the hearing shall be made part of the rulemaking record.
(iv) Interested parties shall be given an opportunity to file statements or comments after the hearing.
(6)
Actions following hearing.
(i) Following the completion of the hearing process, the General Counsel shall consider the record of the hearing, and shall make a reasoned determination whether to terminate the rulemaking; to proceed with the rulemaking as proposed; or to modify the proposed rule.
(ii) If the General Counsel decides to terminate the rulemaking, the General Counsel shall publish a document in the
Federal Register
announcing the decision and explaining the reasons for the decision.
(iii) If the General Counsel decides to finalize the proposed rule without material modifications, the General Counsel shall explain the reasons for the decision and its responses to the hearing record in the preamble to the final rule.
(iv) If the General Counsel decides to modify the proposed rule in material respects, the General Counsel shall publish a new or supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in the
Federal Register
explaining the General Counsel's responses to and analysis of the hearing record, setting forth the modifications to the proposed rule, and providing additional reasonable opportunity for public comment on the proposed modified rule.
(7)
Interagency review process.
The hearing procedures under this paragraph (b) shall not impede or interfere with the interagency review process of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for the proposed rulemaking.
(c)
Basis for rulemaking.
When issuing a proposed or final regulation declaring a practice in air transportation or the sale of air transportation to be unfair or deceptive to consumers under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 41712(a), unless the regulation is specifically required by statute, the Department shall articulate the basis for concluding that the practice is unfair or deceptive to consumers as defined in § 399.79.
[85 FR 78716, Dec. 7, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 17294, Apr. 2, 2021; 87 FR 5658, Feb. 2, 2022]

# Subpart G—Policies Relating to Enforcement
§ 399.79
Policies relating to unfair and deceptive practices.
(a)
Applicability.
This policy shall apply to the Department's aviation consumer protection actions pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 41712(a).
(b)
Definitions.
(1) A practice is “unfair” to consumers if it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition.
(2) A practice is “deceptive” to consumers if it is likely to mislead a consumer, acting reasonably under the circumstances, with respect to a material matter. A matter is material if it is likely to have affected the consumer's conduct or decision with respect to a product or service.
(c)
Intent.
Proof of intent is not necessary to establish unfairness or deception for purposes of 49 U.S.C. 41712(a).
(d)
Specific regulations prevail.
Where an existing regulation applies to the practice of an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent, the terms of that regulation apply rather than the general definitions set forth in this section.
(e)
Informal enforcement proceedings
. (1) Before any determination is made on how to resolve a matter involving a potential unfair or deceptive practice, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Aviation Consumer Protection will provide an opportunity for the alleged violator to be heard and present relevant evidence, including but not limited to:
(i) In cases where a specific regulation applies, evidence tending to establish that the regulation at issue was not violated and, if applicable, that mitigating circumstances apply;
(ii) In cases where a specific regulation does not apply, evidence tending to establish that the conduct at issue was not unfair or deceptive as defined in paragraph (b) of this section; and
(iii) Evidence tending to establish that consumer harm was limited, or that the air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent has taken steps to mitigate consumer harm.
(2) During this informal process, if the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection reaches agreement with the alleged violator to resolve the matter with the issuance of an order declaring a practice in air transportation or the sale of air transportation to be unfair or deceptive to consumers under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 41712(a), and when a regulation issued under the authority of section 41712 does not apply to the practice at issue, then the Department shall articulate in the order the basis for concluding that the practice is unfair or deceptive to consumers as defined in this section.
(f)
Formal enforcement proceedings before an administrative law judge.
When there are reasonable grounds to believe that an airline or ticket agent has violated 49 U.S.C. 41712, and efforts to settle the matter have failed, the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection may issue a notice instituting an enforcement proceeding before an administrative law judge pursuant to 14 CFR 302.407. After the issues have been formulated, if the matter has not been resolved through pleadings or otherwise, the parties will receive reasonable written notice of the time and place of the hearing as set forth in 14 CFR 302.415.
(g)
Formal enforcement proceedings in U.S. District Court.
Alternatively, when there are reasonable grounds to believe that an airline or ticket agent has violated 49 U.S.C. 41712 and efforts to settle the matter have failed, the Department of Transportation may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 46106 or 46107.
[Docket No. DOT-OST-2019-0182, 85 FR 78717, Dec. 7, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 17294, Apr. 2, 2021; Docket No. DOT-OST-2021-0142, 88 FR 39353, June 16, 2023]
§ 399.80
Unfair and deceptive practices of ticket agents.
It is the policy of the Department to regard as an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition the practices enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (o) of this section by a ticket agent of any size and the practice enumerated in paragraph (s) of this section by a ticket agent that sells air transportation online and is not considered a small business under the Small Business Administration's size standards set forth in 13 CFR 121.201:
(a) Misrepresentations
1
which may induce members of the public to believe that the ticket agent is an air carrier.
1
The word “misrepresentation” used in this list includes any statement or representation made in advertising or made orally to members of the public which is false, fraudulent, deceptive or misleading, or which has the tendency or capacity to deceive or mislead.
(b) Using or displaying or permitting or suffering to be used or displayed the name, trade name, slogan or any abbreviation thereof, of the ticket agent, in advertisements, on or in places of business, or on aircraft in connection with the name of an air carrier with whom it does business, in such manner that it may mislead or confuse the traveling public with respect to the agency status of the ticket agent.
(c) Misrepresentations as to the quality or kind of service, type or size of aircraft, time of departure or arrival, points served, route to be flown, stops to be made, or total trip-time from point of departure to destination.
(d) Misrepresentation as to qualifications of pilots or safety record or certification of pilots, aircraft or air carriers.
(e) Misrepresentations that passengers are directly insured when they are not so insured; for example, where the only insurance in force is that protecting the air carrier in event of liability.
(f) Misrepresentations as to fares and charges for air transportation or services in connection therewith.
(g) Misrepresentation that special discounts or reductions are available, when such discounts or reductions are not specific in the lawful tariffs of the air carrier which is to perform the transportation.
(h) [Reserved]
(i) Misrepresentations that special priorities for reservations are available when such special considerations are not in fact granted to members of the public generally.
(j) Selling air transportation to persons on a reservation or charter basis for specified space, flight, or time, or
representing that such definite reservation or charter is or will be available or has been arranged, without a binding commitment with an air carrier for the furnishing of such definite reservation or charter as represented or sold.
(k) Selling or issuing tickets or other documents to passengers to be exchanged or used for air transportation knowing or having reason to know or believe that such tickets or other documents will not be or cannot be legally honored by air carriers for air transportation.
(l) Failing to make a prompt refund of airfare (including any taxes and ancillary fees) to a consumer, upon request, for a cancelled flight or a significantly delayed or changed flight if the consumer chooses not to travel or accept compensation in lieu of a refund in situations described in 14 CFR 260.6(a) and (b) when the ticket agent is the merchant of record. Failing to provide a prompt refund of airfare (including any taxes and ancillary fees), upon request, for a significantly delayed or changed flight itinerary to consumers on the same reservation as an individual with a disability who does not want to continue travel because of a significant change described in paragraph (l)(1)(vii)(E) of this section related to downgrades or paragraph (l)(1)(vii)(G) of this section related to aircraft substitution which result in one or more accessibility features needed by the individual with a disability becoming unavailable or because of the significant change described in paragraph (l)(1)(vii)(F) of this section related to change in connecting airports. A prompt refund is one that is made within 7 business days of the ticket agent receiving information from a carrier as specified in 14 CFR 260.6(d), as required by 12 CFR part 1026 for credit card purchases, and within 20 calendar days of refund becoming due for cash, check, debit card, or other forms of purchases. Ticket agents must provide the refunds in the original form of payment (
i.e.,
money is returned to individual using whatever payment method the individual used to make the original payment, such as a check, a credit card, a debit card, cash, or airline miles), unless the consumer agrees to receive the refund in another form of payment that is cash equivalent. A ticket agent may retain a service fee charged when issuing the original ticket to the extent that service is for more than processing payment for a flight that the consumer found. That fee must be on a per-passenger basis and its existence, amount, and the non-refundable nature if that is the case must be clearly and prominently disclosed to consumers at the time they purchase the airfare. Ticket agents may offer alternative transportation, travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation that remains valid and redeemable by the consumer for a period of at least 5 years from the date on which such voucher, credit, or other form of compensation in lieu of refunds but must first inform consumers that they are entitled to a refund if that is the case. Ticket agents must clearly disclose any material restrictions, conditions, and limitations on travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation they offer, including the expiration date of the travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation, which must be provided, upon request, to an individual who self identifies as an individual with a disability in an electronic format accessible to the recipient.
(1) For purposes of this paragraph (l), the following definitions apply:
(i)
Business days
means Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays in the United States.
(ii)
Cancelled flight
or
cancellation means
a flight with a specific flight number scheduled to be operated between a specific origin-destination city pair that was published in a carrier's Computer Reservation System at the time of the ticket sale but was not operated by the carrier.
(iii)
Cash equivalent
means a form of payment that can be used like cash, including but not limited to a check, a prepaid card, funds transferred to the passenger's bank account, funds provided through digital payment methods (
e.g.,
PayPal, Venmo), or a gift card that is widely accepted in commerce. It is not cash equivalent if consumers bear the burden for maintenance or usage fees related to the payment.
(iv)
Class of service
means seating in the same cabin class such as First,
Business, Premium Economy, or Economy class, which is defined based on seat location in the aircraft and seat characteristics such as width, seat recline angles, or pitch (including the amount of legroom).
(v)
Covered flight
means a scheduled flight to, from, or within the United States.
(vi)
Merchant of record
means the entity responsible for processing payments by consumers for airfare, as shown in the consumer's financial charge statements such as debit or credit card charge statements.
(vii)
Significant delayed or changed flight
means a covered flight itinerary with a delay or change made by a U.S. or foreign carrier where as the result of the delay or change:
(A) The consumer is scheduled to depart from the origination airport three hours or more for domestic itineraries and six hours or more for international itineraries earlier than the original scheduled departure time;
(B) The consumer is scheduled to arrive at the destination airport three hours or more for domestic itineraries or six hours or more for international itineraries later than the original scheduled arrival time;
(C) The consumer is scheduled to depart from a different origination airport or arrive at a different destination airport;
(D) The consumer is scheduled to travel on an itinerary with more connection points than that of the original itinerary;
(E) The consumer is downgraded to a lower class of service;
(F) The consumer with a disability is scheduled to travel through one or more connecting airports that are different from the original itinerary; or
(G) The consumer with a disability is scheduled to travel on substitute aircraft on which one or more accessibility features needed by the passenger are unavailable.
(m) Misrepresentations regarding the handling, forwarding or routing of baggage or other property, or the loss or tracing thereof, or failing or refusing to honor proper claims for loss of or damage to baggage or other property.
(n) Misrepresentation as to the requirements that must be met by persons or organizations in order to qualify for charter or group fare flights.
(o) Failing to disclose ancillary service fee information as required by § 399.85.
(p)-(r) [Reserved]
(s) Failing to disclose and offer web-based discount fares to prospective passengers who contact the agent through other channels (
e.g.,

§ 399.81
Unrealistic or deceptive scheduling.
(a) The unrealistic scheduling of flights by any air carrier providing scheduled passenger air transportation is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.
(b) With respect to the advertising of schedule performance, it is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition to use any figures purporting to reflect schedule or on-time performance without indicating the basis of the calculation, the time period involved, and the pairs of points or the percentage of system-wide operations thereby represented and whether the figures include all scheduled flights or only scheduled flights actually performed.
(c)
Chronically delayed flights.
(1) This paragraph (c) applies to any air carrier that is a “reporting carrier” as defined in Part 234 of Department regulations (14 CFR Part 234).
(2) For the purposes of this paragraph (c), a chronically delayed flight means any domestic flight that is operated at least 10 times a month, and arrives more than 30 minutes late (including cancelled flights) more than 50 percent of the time during that month.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph (c), the Department considers all of a carrier's flights that are operated in a
given city-pair market whose scheduled departure times are within 30 minutes of the most frequently occurring scheduled departure time to be one single flight.
(4) The holding out of a chronically delayed flight for more than four consecutive one-month periods represents one form of unrealistic scheduling and is an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.

§ 399.82
Passing off of carrier identity by affiliation between carriers.
(a)
Applicability.
This policy shall apply to proceedings in which the Department, in exercising its regulatory powers with respect to air carriers and foreign air carriers, is required to determine whether carriers have engaged in unfair or deceptive practices, or unfair methods of competition. The standards herein shall not be construed to supersede any action previously taken by the Department in a particular proceeding dealing with the subject matter of this statement, but to the extent not inconsistent therewith shall provide standards which supplement, or implement such specific Department action. The limitation of this policy statement to certain affiliated carriers should not be construed as an indication that the Department will permit other carriers to pass off by means of activities which are inconsistent with the minimum safeguards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. In such cases the Department may determine in an adjudicatory proceeding that the activities engaged in have a tendency to pass off and constitute an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition.
(b)
Definition.
For the purpose of this statement, the term
affiliation,
as between an air carrier and a foreign air carrier, shall mean that one of the carriers directly or indirectly has one of the following relationships to the other:
(1) Owns or controls 10 percent or more of the securities of the other, with or without an accompanying power to vote;
(2) Is jointly controlled with the other carrier, directly or indirectly by a third person; or
(3) Provides general agency services for the other carrier.
For the purpose of this statement,
general agency services
shall mean services performed under an agreement between an air carrier and a foreign air carrier which provides for the general representation of one by the other in a specified area or point, in relation to services such as the following: Solicitation and sale of passenger, express, and cargo transportation; airport transportation and hotel accommodations; local advertising and publicity, local sales offices; passenger services; local government representation; purchase, lease or other acquisition of equipment; or aircraft and transit services, aircraft inspection, aircraft dispatch.
(c)
Minimum safeguards.
The minimum safeguards which the Department will consider as adequate to foreclose passing off by affiliated carriers are as follows:
(1) An air carrier and any affiliated foreign air carrier shall not engage in joint public relations activities at points served by both carriers which tend to pass off the services of one carrier as the services of the other carrier or as part of a unified system of which each is a part;
(2) Where one affiliated carrier provides general agency services for the other carrier, at points served by both carriers, it shall specifically identify all flights of the other carrier as flights of that carrier without reference to any relationship to the carrier performing the agency services;
(3) All forms of display (including aircraft insignia), scheduled publications, advertising, or printed matter employed by affiliated carriers shall not state or imply that the services of either carrier are performed in common with the other carrier or as part of a single system. In cases where it is necessary to indicate that any agency service is performed by one affiliated carrier for the other, the references to the carrier performing the agency should be sufficiently subordinated to the name of the other carrier as to emphasize the limited role of the agent;
(4) Telephone facilities at points served by both carriers should preserve the identity of the individual carriers;
(5) Where joint traffic or sales facilities are maintained by affiliated carriers, the separate identity of each carrier should be maintained by reasonably comparable use of display advertising, desk-space, personnel uniforms, and other facilities and activities;
(6) Where one carrier sells time payment tickets for travel over the other carrier (except interline travel), the application form should identify the carrier performing the transportation;
(7) The respective personnel of the affiliated carriers shall preserve the individual identity of the respective carriers in all public dealings.
(d)
Unfair and deceptive practice.
It is the policy of the Department to regard any joint activity of an affiliated air carrier and a foreign air carrier as an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition where such joint activity does not satisfy the minimum safeguards enumerated in the preceding subsection.
(e)
Exceptions.
Exceptions to a safeguard set forth in paragraph (c) of this section may be recognized for activities in a foreign country if the Department finds that special circumstances pertaining to the country render the safeguard inappropriate. Exceptions on other grounds may be recognized pursuant to § 399.4.
[PS-29, 30 FR 13781, Oct. 29, 1965, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15947, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 399.83
Unfair or deceptive practice of air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent in orally confirming to prospective passenger reserved space on scheduled flights.
It is the policy of the Department to consider the practice of an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent, of stating to a prospective passenger by telephone or other means of communication that a reservation of space on a scheduled flight in air transportation is confirmed before a passenger has received a ticket specifying thereon his confirmed reserved space, to be an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition in air transportation or the sale thereof within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712, unless the tariff of the particular air carrier or foreign air carrier provides for confirmation of reserved space by the means so used.
[PS-58, 39 FR 38096, Oct. 29, 1974, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15948, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 399.84
Price advertising and opt-out provisions.
(a) The Department considers any advertising or solicitation by a direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent, for passenger air transportation, a tour (
i.e.,
a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component (
e.g.,
a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation that states a price for such air transportation, tour, or tour component to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712, unless the price stated is the entire price (all mandatory charges) to be paid by the customer to the carrier, or agent, for such air transportation, tour, or tour component. Mandatory charges refer to all taxes and fees that are required to purchase air transportation on the channel where the advertising or solicitation occurs (
e.g.,
if a fare is advertised online for $100 then that means the fare must be available for the consumer to purchase for $100 online). Mandatory charges included within the single total price listed may be stated separately or through links or “pop ups” on online platforms that display the total price, but such charges may not be false or misleading, may not be displayed prominently, may not be presented in the same or larger size as the total price, and must provide cost information on a per passenger basis that accurately reflects the cost of the item covered by the mandatory charge.
(b) The Department considers any advertising by the entities listed in paragraph (a) of this section of an each-way airfare that is available only when purchased for round-trip travel to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712, unless such airfare is advertised as “each way” and in such a manner so that the disclosure of the round-trip purchase requirement is
clearly and conspicuously noted in the advertisement and is stated prominently and proximately to the each-way fare amount. The Department considers it to be an unfair and deceptive practice to advertise each-way fares contingent on a round-trip purchase requirement as “one-way” fares, even if accompanied by prominent and proximate disclosure of the round trip purchase requirement.
(c) When offering a ticket for purchase by a consumer, for passenger air transportation or for a tour (
i.e.
, a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation, a direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent, may not offer additional optional services in connection with air transportation, a tour, or tour component whereby the optional service is automatically added to the consumer's purchase if the consumer takes no other action, i.e., if the consumer does not opt out. The consumer must affirmatively “opt in” (
i.e.
, agree) to such a service and the fee for it before that fee is added to the total price for the air transportation-related purchase. The Department considers the use of “opt-out” provisions to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712.
(d) A carrier or ticket agent may display a price that includes all mandatory charges and one or more ancillary service fees (
i.e.,
fees charged for any optional service related to air travel beyond passenger air transportation) in place of or more prominently than a price that only includes all mandatory charges.
(e) The Department considers any offer of a percentage-off discount for passenger air transportation or for a tour (
i.e.,
a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component (
e.g.,
a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation, that does not make clear at the outset the terms and conditions of the offer, including how the discount is calculated, to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712. When used in any advertising or solicitation, the term “base fare” must refer to an amount that includes all mandatory carrier-imposed charges and the terms “flight,” “ticket,” or “fare” must refer to an amount that includes all mandatory carrier-imposed and government charges.
[76 FR 23166, Apr. 25, 2011, as amended by DOT-OST-2022-0109, 89 FR 34674, Apr. 30, 2024]
§ 399.85
Notice of ancillary service fees.
(a)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
Air transportation
means interstate air transportation, foreign air transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(23) and (25).
Ancillary service fee
means the fee charged for any optional service related to air travel that a U.S. or foreign air carrier provides beyond passenger air transportation. Such fees may include, but are not limited to, fees for checked or carry-on baggage, advance seat selection, access to in-flight entertainment programs, in-flight beverages, lounge access, snacks and meals, pillows and blankets, and seat upgrades.
Ancillary service package
means a package or bundle of one or more ancillary services offered for sale by a carrier or ticket agent.
Anonymous itinerary search
means a search that does not take into account information specific to the passenger but does take into account information specific to the itinerary (
e.g.,
geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class) that may impact the critical ancillary service fees to be charged or policies to be applied.
Break in journey
means a deliberate interruption by a passenger of a journey between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country where a stopover at a foreign point is scheduled. The factors to consider to determine whether a stopover is a deliberate interruption include whether the segment between two foreign points and the segment between a foreign point and the United States were purchased in a single transaction and as a single ticket/itinerary, whether the segment between two foreign
points is operated or marketed by a carrier that has no codeshare or interline agreement with the carrier operating or marketing the segment to or from the United States, and whether the stopover at a foreign point involves the passenger picking up checked baggage, leaving the airport, and continuing the next segment after a substantial amount of time.
Clear and conspicuous
means that a disclosure is difficult to miss (
i.e.,
easily noticeable), easily understandable by consumers, and presented in a manner that allows consumers to determine the true cost and enable them to select the best flight options for them.
Critical ancillary service
means any ancillary service critical to consumers' purchasing decisions. Such services are: transporting the first checked bag, the second checked bag, or a carry-on bag, the ability for a consumer to cancel or change a reservation, and any other services determined, after notice and opportunity to comment, to be critical by the Secretary.
Consumer
or
user
refers to a person who seeks to obtain information about or purchase air transportation from a U.S. carrier, a foreign carrier, or a ticket agent, whether through an online platform or other means (
e.g.,
over the telephone, in person).
Corporate travel agent
refers to a ticket agent engaged in providing travel services to the employees of a business entity pursuant to a written contract with that entity for the business travel of its employees.
Online platform
refers to any interactive electronic medium, including, but not limited to, websites and mobile applications, that allow the consumer to search for or purchase air transportation from a U.S. carrier, a foreign carrier, or a ticket agent.
Passenger-specific itinerary search
means a search that takes into account information specific to the passenger (
e.g.,
the passenger's status in the airline's frequent flyer program, the passenger's military status, or the passenger's status as a holder of a particular credit card) that was affirmatively provided by that passenger and information specific to the itinerary (
e.g.,
geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class) that may impact the critical ancillary service fees to be charged or policies to be applied.
(b)
Passenger-specific and anonymous itinerary searches.
Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that advertises or sells air transportation marketed to U.S. consumers must offer consumers both the option to conduct a passenger-specific itinerary search and the option to conduct an anonymous itinerary search.
(c)
Online disclosures of ancillary service fees
—(1)
Critical ancillary service fees.
Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose on its online platform the accurate fee that applies, if any, for all critical ancillary services. The fee cannot be designated as $0 in circumstances where a critical ancillary service is not available to the consumer but rather must state “not available” or a similar notation. The fee information must be provided the first time that fare and schedule information is disclosed after a consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search or an anonymous itinerary search. The fees cannot be displayed through a hyperlink.
(2)
Other ancillary service fees.
Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation may disclose ancillary service fees that are not critical ancillary service fees at the same time as critical ancillary service fees.
(3)
Ancillary service packages.
Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must disclose the standalone fee for each critical ancillary service required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section when fare and schedule information is provided. Nothing in this section requires or prohibits a carrier or ticket agent from disclosing an ancillary
service package that includes critical ancillary services if it chooses to do so.
(4)
Air tour packages.
Each ticket agent that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air tour packages must clearly and conspicuously disclose, at the time the ticket agent offers a package fare quotation for a specific itinerary selected by a consumer, where the carrier providing air transportation is not known, that additional fees for baggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced or waived based on the passenger's frequent flyer status, method of payment, or other consumer characteristic. When the carrier providing air transportation for an air-tour package is known, that ticket agent must provide baggage fee information as prescribed by this paragraph (c) at the time that the ticket agent discloses the name of the carrier to the consumer.
(5)
Website disclosure of all ancillary service fees.
A U.S. or foreign air carrier that has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose on its website accurate information on ancillary service fees available to a passenger purchasing air transportation with a clear and conspicuous link from the carrier's homepage directly to a page or a place on a page where all such ancillary services and related fees are disclosed. In general, fees for particular services may be expressed as a range; however, baggage fees must be expressed as specific charges taking into account any factors (
e.g.,
frequent flyer status, early purchase) that affect those charges.
(d)
Online disclosure of baggage policies.
Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose on its online platform, before ticket purchase, the accurate weight and dimension limitations that the carrier imposes for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag after a consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search or an anonymous itinerary search.
(e)
Intent to travel with a bag.
Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation may clearly and conspicuously solicit information from a consumer prior to the consumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search for air transportation regarding the consumer's intention to travel with a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, or a second checked bag. If the consumer affirmatively takes action to indicate that the consumer and all others in the booking party do not intend to travel with a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, or a second checked bag, then the carrier or ticket agent may forego disclosing the fees for that bag with the fare and schedule information as required by paragraph (c) of this section. Carriers and ticket agents (except a corporate travel agent) must disclose the baggage policies before ticket purchase as required by paragraph (d) of this section and must disclose information regarding the passenger's free baggage allowance and fee information for a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, and a second checked bag on e-ticket confirmations as required by paragraph (k) of this section even if a consumer indicates an intention not to travel with a bag.
(f)
Online disclosure of cancellation and change policies.
Each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must accurately, clearly, and conspicuously, disclose on its online platform, before ticket purchase, the components of change and cancellation policies identified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1)
Restrictions and prohibitions.
A summary of the applicable restrictions and prohibitions to change or cancel a ticket that apply to the consumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search, including any prohibitions or restrictions to obtaining a refund of the full amount paid;
(2)
Form of refund.
A summary of the applicable policy regarding the form of
the refund for a change or cancellation (
e.g.,
a credit to the original form of payment, airline credits or voucher) that apply to the consumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search;
(3)
Fare differential.
A summary of the applicable policy regarding a consumer's right to, or responsibility for, any fare differential, including whether the consumer is entitled to a refund in fare difference if the consumer changes to a lower cost replacement flight, that apply to the consumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search; and
(4)
24-Hour hold or cancellation.
A statement disclosed clearly and conspicuously on the last page of the booking process on allowing the reservation to be held at the quoted fare without payment, or cancelled without penalty, for at least twenty-four hours after the reservation is made, consistent with a carrier's customer service plan in § 259.5(b)(4) of this chapter and consistent with a ticket agent's policy. A ticket agent that has a policy of not allowing a 24-hour hold or cancellation must disclose that information clearly and conspicuously on the last page of the booking process. The disclosures in this paragraph (f)(4) are required if the reservation is made one week or more prior to a flight's departure.
(g)
Disclosures on landing page.
Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it sells air transportation and that accepts a redirect of consumers to its online platform to complete the booking must ensure that the required critical ancillary service fee information in paragraph (c) of this section is accurately, clearly, and conspicuously displayed on the first page of the online platform to which the consumer has been directed, unless the consumer was provided accurate fee information of critical ancillary services on the directing entity's online platform.
(h)
Seat guarantee notice.
Each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose the following notice on any page or step of the booking process in which a consumer is offered a seat selection for a fee: “A seat is included in your fare. You are not required to purchase a seat assignment to travel. If you decide to purchase a ticket and do not select a seat prior to purchase, a seat will be provided to you without additional charge when you travel.”
(i)
Code-share partner disclosures.
For air transportation within, to or from the United States, a carrier marketing a flight under its identity that is operated by a different carrier, otherwise known as a code-share flight, must through its website disclose to consumers booked on a code-share flight any differences between its optional services and related fees and those of the carrier operating the flight. This disclosure may be made through a conspicuous notice of the existence of such differences on the marketing carrier's website or a conspicuous hyperlink taking the reader directly to the operating carrier's fee listing or to a page on the marketing carrier's website that lists the differences in policies among code-share partners.
(j)
Offline fee disclosures of ancillary services.
Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that markets air transportation to U.S. consumers in person or by phone must disclose to consumers, at the time a fare is quoted for an itinerary, that baggage fees (for a first checked, second checked, or carry-on bag), change fees, and cancellation fees apply, if that is the case. The U.S. carrier, foreign carrier, or ticket agent (other than a corporate travel agent) must then ask the consumer if they wish to hear more about the specific baggage fees, change fees, cancellation fees, and any other critical ancillary service fees that apply. These carriers and ticket agents, upon request from the consumer, must disclose those specific fees taking into account passenger-specific information provided by the consumer.
(k)
Disclosures of baggage fees on e-ticket confirmations.
A U.S. carrier, a foreign air carrier, or a ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that
has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must include information regarding the passenger's free baggage allowance (including personal item) and the applicable fee for a carry-on bag and the first and second checked bag on all e-ticket confirmations for air transportation within, to or from the United States, including on the summary page at the completion of an online purchase and in a post-purchase email confirmation. Carriers and ticket agents must provide the fee information for a carry-on bag, first checked bag, and second checked bag in text form in the e-ticket confirmation taking into account any passenger-specific factors that affect those charges.
(l)
Sharing information on fee rules and policies.
Each U.S. and foreign air carrier that provides fare, schedule, and availability information for air transportation within, to, or from the United States to an entity that is required by law to disclose critical ancillary service fee and policy information directly to consumers must disclose fee and policy information for critical ancillary fee services to that entity. The information provided must be useable, current, accurate, and sufficient to ensure compliance by such entities.
(m)
Unfair and deceptive practice.
The Department considers the failure to provide and adhere to the disclosures required by this section to be an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.
[DOT-OST-2022-0109, 89 FR 34675, Apr. 30, 2024]
§ 399.86
Payments for non-air transportation services for air cargo.
The Department considers that payments by air carriers and foreign air carriers to shippers, indirect air carriers, or foreign indirect air carriers for non-air transportation preparation of air cargo shipments are for services ancillary to the air transportation, and are not prohibited under section 403 of the Act.
[PS-86, 44 FR 45609, Aug. 3, 1979]
§ 399.87
Baggage allowances and fees.
For passengers whose ultimate ticketed origin or destination is a U.S. point, U.S. and foreign carriers must apply the baggage allowances and fees that apply at the beginning of a passenger's itinerary throughout his or her entire itinerary. In the case of code-share flights that form part of an itinerary whose ultimate ticketed origin or destination is a U.S. point, U.S. and foreign carriers must apply the baggage allowances and fees of the marketing carrier throughout the itinerary to the extent that they differ from those of any operating carrier.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2010-0140, 76 FR 23167, Apr. 25, 2011]
§ 399.88
Prohibition on post-purchase price increase.
(a) It is an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 for any seller of scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, or of a tour (
i.e.,
a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component (
e.g.,
a hotel stay) that includes scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, to increase the ticket price of that air transportation, tour or tour component, or to raise the price for critical ancillary services as defined in § 399.85(a) to a consumer after the air transportation has been purchased by the consumer, except in the case of an increase in a government-imposed tax or fee. A purchase is deemed to have occurred when the full amount agreed upon has been paid by the consumer.
(b) A seller of scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States or a tour (
i.e.
, a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that includes scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, must notify a consumer of the potential for a post-purchase price increase due to an increase in a government-imposed tax or fee and must obtain the consumer's written consent to the potential for such an increase prior to purchase of the scheduled air transportation, tour
or tour component that includes scheduled air transportation. Imposition of any such increase without providing the consumer the appropriate notice and without obtaining his or her written consent of the potential increase constitutes an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2010-0140, 76 FR 23167, Apr. 25, 2011, as amended by DOT-OST-2022-0109, 89 FR 34677, Apr. 30, 2024]
§ 399.89
Disclosure of potential for price increase before payment.
Any seller of scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, or of a tour (
i.e.
, a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that includes scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, must notify a consumer of the potential for a price increase that could take place prior to the time that the full amount agreed upon has been paid by the consumer, including but not limited to an increase in the price of the seat, an increase in the price for the carriage of passenger baggage, an increase in an applicable fuel surcharge, or an increase in a government-imposed tax or fee and must obtain the consumer's written consent to the potential for such an increase prior to accepting any payment for the scheduled air transportation, or tour or tour component that includes scheduled air transportation. Imposition of any such increase without providing the consumer the appropriate notice and obtaining his or her written consent to the potential increase constitutes an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.

Under 51 U.S.C. 50917(c), a person found by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to have violated a requirement of the Act, a regulation issued under the Act, or any term or condition of a license or permit issued or transferred
under the Act, is liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than $299,772 for each violation. A separate violation occurs for each day the violation continues.
(b)
Delegations.
The authority to impose civil penalties is exercised by an agency attorney as described in § 406.105.
(c)
Notice of proposed civil penalty.
A civil penalty action is initiated when the agency attorney advises a person, referred to as the respondent, of the charges or other reasons upon which the FAA bases the proposed action and allows the respondent to answer the charges and to be heard as to why the civil penalty should not be imposed. A notice of proposed civil penalty states the facts alleged; any requirement of the Act, a regulation issued under the Act, or any term or condition of a license or permit issued or transferred under the Act allegedly violated by the respondent; and the amount of the proposed civil penalty. Not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice of proposed civil penalty the respondent may elect to proceed by one or more of the following:
(1) Pay the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed upon amount, in which case the agency attorney will issue either an order imposing civil penalty or a compromise order in that amount.
(2) Submit to the agency attorney one of the following:
(i) Written information, including documents and witnesses statements, demonstrating that a violation did not occur or that a penalty, or the amount of the proposed penalty, is not warranted by the circumstances.
(ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the amount of reduction, and the reasons and any document supporting a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including records indicating a financial inability to pay or records showing that payment of the proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in business.
(iii) A written request for an informal conference to discuss the matter with the agency attorney and to submit relevant information.
(3) Request that a final notice of proposed civil penalty be issued so that the respondent may request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
(d)
Final notice of proposed civil penalty.
A final notice of proposed civil penalty (final notice) provides the last opportunity for the respondent to request a hearing.
(1) The agency attorney issues a final notice if one of the following occurs:
(i) The respondent fails to respond to the notice of proposed civil penalty not later than 30 days after the date the respondent received the notice of proposed civil penalty.

(iv) Unless a complaint is filed with a United States district court in accordance with § 406.176, if the FAA decisionmaker finds that a violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found appropriate by the FAA decisionmaker, is warranted, a final decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker under subpart B of this part becomes an order imposing civil penalty. If a person seeks judicial review not later than 60 days after the final decision and order has been served on the respondent, the final decision and order is stayed.
(2) [Reserved]
(f)
Compromise order.
The agency attorney at any time may agree to compromise any civil penalty with no finding of violation. Under such agreement, the agency attorney issues a compromise order stating:

Filing confidential information.
If a party wants certain information that the party is filing not made available to the public, the party must do the following:

(i)
Respondent's motion to dismiss complaint for failure to state a claim for which a civil penalty may be imposed.
A respondent may file a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which a civil penalty may be imposed instead of filing an answer. The motion must show that the complaint fails to state a violation of the Act, a regulation issued under the Act, or any term or condition of a license issued or transferred under the Act.
(ii)
Respondent's motion to dismiss allegations or complaint for staleness.
Instead of filing an answer to the complaint, a respondent may move to dismiss the complaint, or that part of the complaint that alleges a violation that occurred more than 5 years before an agency attorney issued a notice of proposed civil penalty to the respondent, as provided by 28 U.S.C. 2462.
(iii)
Respondent's motion for more definite statement.
A respondent may file a motion requesting a more definite statement of the allegations contained in the complaint instead of filing an answer. The respondent must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or uncertain allegations contained in a complaint or response to any pleading and must submit the details that the party believes would make the allegation or response definite and certain. If the administrative law judge grants the motion, the complainant must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling granting the motion. If the complainant fails to supply a more definite statement, the administrative law judge must strike the allegations in the complaint to which the motion is directed.

(3)
Other motions to dismiss.
A party may file a motion to dismiss, specifying the grounds for dismissal.
(4)
Complainant's motion for more definite statement.
The complainant may file a motion requesting a more definite statement if an answer fails to respond clearly to the allegations in the complaint. The complainant must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or uncertain allegations contained in the answer and must submit the details that the complainant believes would make the allegation or response definite and certain. If the administrative law judge grants the motion, the respondent must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling on the motion. If the respondent fails to supply a more definite
statement, the administrative law judge must strike those statements in the answer to which the motion is directed. An administrative law judge shall treat a respondent's failure to supply a more definite statement as an admission of unanswered allegations in the complaint.
(5)
Other motions for more definite statement.
A party may file a motion for more definite statement of any pleading that requires or permits a response under this subpart. A party must set forth, in detail, each indefinite or uncertain allegation contained in a pleading or response and must submit the details that would make each allegation definite and certain.
(6)
Motion to strike.
Any party may make a motion to strike any insufficient allegation or defense, or any redundant, immaterial, or irrelevant matter in a pleading.

(7)
Motion for decision.
A party may make a motion for decision, regarding all or any part of the proceedings, at any time before the administrative law judge has issued an initial decision in the proceedings. The administrative law judge must grant a party's motion for decision if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, matters that the administrative law judge has officially noticed, or evidence introduced during the hearing show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the party making the motion is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party making the motion for decision has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact disputed by the parties.
(8)
Motion for disqualification.

(iii)
Decision on motion for disqualification.
The administrative law judge must issue a decision on the motion for disqualification not later than 15 days after the motion has been filed. If the administrative law judge finds that the motion for disqualification and supporting affidavit show a basis for disqualification, the administrative law judge must withdraw from the proceedings immediately. If the administrative law judge finds that disqualification is not warranted, the administrative law judge must deny the motion and state the grounds for the denial on the record. If the administrative law judge fails to rule on a party's motion for disqualification within 15 days after the motion has been filed, the motion is granted.

A party may discover facts known, or opinions held, by an expert who any other party expects to call to testify at the hearing. A party has no ground to object to a discovery request on the basis that the information sought would not be admissible at the hearing if the information sought during discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(f)
Limiting discovery.
The administrative law judge must limit the frequency and extent of discovery permitted by this section if a party shows that—
(1) The information requested is cumulative or repetitious;
(2) The information requested can be obtained from another less burdensome and more convenient source;
(3) The party requesting the information has had ample opportunity to obtain the information through other discovery methods permitted under this section; or

(h)
Protective order.
A party or a person who has received a request for discovery may file a motion for protective order and must serve a copy of the motion for protective order on each party. The party or person making the motion must show that the protective order is necessary to protect the party or the person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. As part of the protective order, the administrative law judge may:
(1) Deny the discovery request;
(2) Order that discovery be conducted only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place for discovery or a determination of the method of discovery; or
(3) Limit the scope of discovery or preclude any inquiry into certain matters during discovery.

(3) A party must supplement or amend any response that was incorrect when made or any response that was correct when made but is no longer correct, accurate, or complete.
(j)
Depositions.
The following rules apply to all depositions taken pursuant to this section:

Form.
A deposition must be taken on the record and reduced to writing.
The person being deposed must sign the deposition unless the parties agree to waive the requirement of a signature.
(2)
Administration of oaths.
Within the United States, or a territory or possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, a party must take a deposition before a person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or authorized by the law of the place where the examination is held. In a foreign country, a party must take a deposition in any manner allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Notice of deposition.
A party must serve a notice of deposition, stating the time and place of the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, on the person to be deposed, must submit the notice to the administrative law judge, and must file the notice with the Federal Docket Management System, and must serve the notice on each party, not later than 7 days before the deposition. A party may serve a notice of deposition less than 7 days before the deposition only with consent of the administrative law judge. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the person to be examined, the party must attach to the notice of deposition a copy of the subpoena duces tecum that describes the materials to be produced at the deposition.
(4)
Use of depositions.
A party may use any part or all of a deposition at a hearing authorized under this subpart only upon a showing of good cause. The deposition may be used against any party who was present or represented at the deposition or who had reasonable notice of the deposition.
(k)
Interrogatories.
(1) A party may not serve more than 30 interrogatories to each other party. Each subpart of an interrogatory must be counted as a separate interrogatory.
(2) A party must file a motion for leave to serve more than 30 interrogatories on a party before serving additional interrogatories on a party. The administrative law judge must grant the motion only if the party shows good cause for the party's failure to inquire about the information previously and that the information cannot reasonably be obtained using less burdensome discovery methods or be obtained from other sources.
(3) A party must answer each interrogatory separately and completely in writing.
(4) A party, or the party's attorney or representative of record, must sign the party's responses to interrogatories.
(5) If a party objects to an interrogatory, the party must state the objection and the reasons for the objection.

(l)
Requests for admission.
A party may serve a written request for admission of the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery under this section or the authenticity of any document described in the request. A party must set forth each request for admission separately. A party must serve a copy of each document referenced in the request for admission unless the document has been provided or is reasonably available for inspection and copying.
(1)
Time.
A party's failure to respond to a request for admission is not later than 30 days after service of the request constitutes an admission of the truth of the statement or statements contained in the request for admission. The administrative law judge may determine that a failure to respond to a request for admission does not constitute an admission of the truth if a party shows that the failure was due to circumstances beyond the control of the party or the party's attorney or representative.
(2)
Response.
A party may object to a request for admission. The objection must be in writing and signed by the party or the party's attorney or representative of record, and must state the reasons for objection. A party may specifically deny the truth of the matter or describe the reasons why the party is unable to truthfully deny or admit the matter. If a party is unable to deny or admit the truth of the matter, the party must show that the party has made reasonable inquiry into the matter or that the information known to, or readily obtainable by, the
party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny the matter. A party may admit or deny any part of the request for admission. If an administrative law judge determines that a response does not comply with the requirements of this rule or that the response is insufficient, the matter is admitted.
(3)
Effect of admission.
Any matter admitted or treated as admitted under this section is conclusively established for the purpose of the hearing and appeal.
(m)
Motion to compel discovery.
A party may make a motion to compel discovery if a person refuses to answer a question during a deposition, a party fails or refuses to answer an interrogatory, a person gives an evasive or incomplete answer during a deposition or when responding to an interrogatory, or a party fails or refuses to produce documents or tangible items. During a deposition, the proponent of a question may complete the deposition or may adjourn the examination before making a motion to compel if a person refuses to answer.
(n)
Failure to comply with a discovery order or order to compel.
If a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to compel, the administrative law judge, limited to the extent of the party's failure to comply with the discovery order or motion to compel, may:

(2) Preclude prehearing or discovery motions by that party;
