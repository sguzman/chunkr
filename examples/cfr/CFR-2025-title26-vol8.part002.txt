) Any material portion of the property that was used, at any time before the disposition, in any activity at a time when the remainder of the property was not used in such activity shall be treated as a separate interest in property; and
(
2
) The amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of the property must be allocated among the separate interests in a reasonable manner.
(D)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(i):

# Example 1.
A owns an interest in a trade or business activity in which A has never materially participated. In 1987, A sells equipment that was used exclusively in the activity and realizes a gain on the sale. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section, the gain is passive activity gross income.

# Example 2.
B owns an interest in a trade or business activity in which B materially participates for 1987. In 1987, B sells a building used in the activity in an installment sale and realizes a gain on the sale. B does not materially participate in the activity for 1988 or any subsequent year. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(
3
) of this section, none of B's gain from the sale (including gain taken into account after 1987) is passive activity gross income.

# Example 3.
C enters into a contract to acquire property used by the seller in a rental activity. Before acquiring the property pursuant to the contract, C sells all rights under the contract and realizes a gain on the sale. Since C's rights under the contract are not property used in a rental activity, the gain is not income from a rental activity. The result would be the same if C owned an option to acquire the property and sold the option.

# Example 4.
D sells a ten-floor office building. D owned the building for three years preceding the sale and at all times during that period used seven floors of the building in a trade or business activity and three floors in a rental activity. The fair market value per square foot is substantially the same throughout the building, and D did not
maintain a separate adjusted basis for any part of the building. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(
1
) of this section, the seven floors used in the trade or business activity and the three floors used in the rental activity are treated as separate interests in property. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section, the amount realized and the adjusted basis of the building must be allocated between the separate interests in a reasonable manner. Under these facts, an allocation based on the square footage of the parts of the building used in each activity would be reasonable.

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that two of the seven floors used in the trade or business activity were used in the rental activity until five months before the sale. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(
1
) of this section, the five floors used exclusively in the trade or business activity and the two floors used first in the rental activity and then in the trade or business activity are treated as separate interests in property. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for rules for allocating amount realized and adjusted basis upon a disposition of an interest in property used in more than one activity during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition.
(ii)
Disposition of property used in more than one activity in 12-month period preceding disposition.
In the case of a disposition of an interest in property that is used in more than one activity during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition, the amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of such interest must be allocated among such activities on a basis that reasonably reflects the use of such interest in property during such 12-month period. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), an allocation of the amount realized and adjusted basis solely to the activity in which an iterest in property is predominantly used during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition reasonably reflects the use of such interest in property if the fair market value of such interest does not exceed the lesser of—
(A) $10,000; and
(B) 10 percent of the sum of the fair market value of such interest and the fair market value of all other property used in such activity immediately before the disposition.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii):

# Example 1.
The facts are the same as in Example 5 of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section, D allocates the amount realized and adjusted basis of the building 30 percent to the three floors used exclusively in the rental activity, 50 percent to the five floors used exclusively in the trade or business activity, and 20 percent to the two floors used first in the rental activity and then in the trade or business activity. Under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), the amount realized and adjusted basis allocated to the two floors that were used in both activities during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition must also be allocated between such activities. Under these facts, an allocation of
7/12
of such amounts to the rental activity and
5/12
of such amounts to the trade or business activity would reasonably reflect the use of the two floors during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition.

# Example 2.
B is a limited partner in a partnership that sells a tractor-trailer. During the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale, the tractor-trailer was used in several activities, and the partnership allocates the amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of the tractor-trailer among the activities based on the number of days during the 12-month period that the partnership used the tractor-trailer in each activity. Under these facts, the partnership's allocation reasonably reflects the use of the tractor-trailer during the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale.

# Example 3.
C sells a personal computer for $8,000. During the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale, 70 percent of C's use of the computer was in a passive activity. Immediately before the sale, the fair market value of all property used in the passive activity (including the personal computer) was $200,000. Under these facts, the computer was predominatly used in the passive activity during the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale, and the value of the computer, as measured by its sale price ($8,000), does not exceed the lesser of (a) $10,000, and (b) 10 percent of the value of all property used in the activity immediately before the sale ($20,000). C allocates the amount realized and the adjusted basis solely to the passive activity. Under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), C's allocation reasonably reflects the use of the computer during the 12-month period ending on the date of the sale.
(iii)
Disposition of substantially appreciated property formerly used in nonpassive activity.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-4(c)(2)(iii) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(iv)
Taxable acquisitions.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(iv) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(v)

(3)
Items of portfolio income specifically excluded
—(i)
In general.
Passive activity gross income does not include portfolio income. For purposes of the preceding sentence, portfolio income includes all gross income, other than income derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section), that is attributable to—
(A) Interest (including amounts treated as interest under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, relating to certain payments to partners for the use of capital); annuities; royalties (including fees and other payments for the use of intangible property); dividends on C corporation stock; and income (including dividends) from a real estate investment trust (within the meaning of section 856), regulated investment company (within the meaning of section 851), real estate mortgage investment conduit (within the meaning of section 860D), common trust fund (within the meaning of section 584), controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957), qualified electing fund (within the meaning of section 1295(a)), or cooperative (within the meaning of section 1381(a));

(C) The disposition of property that produces income of a type described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section; and
(D) The disposition of property held for investment (within the meaning of section 163 (d)).
(ii)
Gross income derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business.

(A) Interest income on loans and investments made in the ordinary course of a trade or business of lending money;
(B) Interest on accounts receivable arising from the performance of services or the sale of property in the ordinary course of a trade or business of performing such services or selling such property, but only if credit is customarily offered to customers of the business;

(D) Income or gain derived in the ordinary course of an activity of trading or dealing in any property if such activity constitutes a trade or business (but see paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section);
(E) Royalties derived by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of a trade or business of licensing intangible property (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section);
(F) Amount included in the gross income of a patron of a cooperative (within the meaning of section 1381(a), without regard to paragraph (2)(A) or (C) thereof) by reason of any payment or allocation to the patron based on patronage occurring with respect to a trade or business of the patron; and
(G) Other income identified by the Commissioner as income derived by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
(iii)
Special rules
—(A)
Income from property held for investment by dealer.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a dealer's income or gain from an item of property is not dervied by the dealer in the ordinary course of a trade or business of dealing in such property if the dealer held the property for investment at any time before such income or gain is recognized.
(B)
Royalties derived in the ordinary course of the trade or business of licensing intangible property
—(
1
)
In general.
Royalties received by any person with respect to a license or other transfer of any rights in intangible property shall be considered to be derived in the ordinary course of the trade or business of licensing such property only if such person—
(
i
) Created such property; or
(
ii
) Performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of such property.
(
2
)
Substantial services or costs
—(
i
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section,
the determination of whether a person has performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of an item of intangible property shall be made on the basis of all the facts and circumstances.
(
ii
)
Exception.
A person has performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs for a taxable year with respect to the development or marketing of an item of intangible property if—
(
a
) The expenditures reasonably incurred by such person in such taxable year with respect to the development or marketing of the property exceed 50 percent of the gross royalties from licensing such property that are includible in such person's gross income for the taxable year; or
(
b
) The expenditures reasonably incurred by such person in such taxable year and all prior taxable years with respect to the development or marketing of the property exceed 25 percent of the aggregate capital expenditures (without any adjustment of amortization) made by such person with respect to the property in all such taxable years.
(
iii) Expenditures taken into account.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section, expenditures in a taxable year include amounts chargeable to capital account for such year without regard to the year or years (if any) in which any deduction for such expenditure is allowed.
(
3) Passthrough entities.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B), in the case of any intangible property held by a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, the determination of whether royalties from such property are derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business shall be made by applying the rules of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) to such entity and not to any holder of an interest in such entity.

)
Cross reference.
For special rules applicable to certain gross income from a trade or business of licensing intangible property, see paragraph (f)(7) of this section.
(C)
Mineral production payments.
For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder—
(
1
) If a mineral production payment is treated as a loan under section 636, the portion of any payment in discharge of the production payment that is the equivalent of interest shall be treated as interest; and
(
2
) If a mineral production payment is not treated as a loan under section 636, payments in discharge of the production payment shall be treated as royalties.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(3):

# Example 1.
A, an individual engaged in the trade or business of farming, disposes of farmland in an installment sale. A is not engaged in a trade or business of selling farmland. Therefore, A's interest income from the installment note is not gross income derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business.

# Example 2.
P, a partnership, operates a rental apartment building for low-income tenants in City Y. Under Y's laws relating to the operation of low-income housing, P is required to maintain a reserve fund to pay for the maintenance and repair of the building. P invests the reserve fund in short-term interest-bearing deposits. Because P's interest income from the investment of the reserve fund is not interest income described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, such income is not treated as derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Accordingly, P's interest income from the deposits is portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section).

# Example 3.
(i) B is a partner in a partnership that is engaged in an activity involving the conduct of a trade or business of dealing in securities. On February 1, the partnership acquires certain securities for investment (within the meaning of section 163(d)). On February 2, before recognizing any income with respect to the securities, the partnership determines that it would be advisable to hold the securities primarily for sale to customers and subsequently sells them to customers in the ordinary course of its business.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, income or gain from any security (including any security acquired pursuant to an investment of working capital) held by a dealer for investment at any time before such income or gain is recognized is not treated for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section as derived by the dealer in the ordinary course of its trade or business of dealing in securities. Accordingly, B's distributive share of the partnership's interest, dividends, or gains from the securities acquired by the partnership for investment on February 1 is portfolio income of B, notwithstanding that such securities were held by
the partnership, subsequent to February 1, primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the partnership's trade or business of dealing in securities.

# Example 4.
C is a partner in a partnership that is engaged in an activity of trading or dealing in royalty interests in mineral properties. The partnership derives royalty income from royalty interests held in the activity. If the activity is a trade or business activity, C's distributive share of the partnership's royalty income from such royalty interests is treated under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section as derived in the ordinary course of the partnership's trade or business.

# Example 5.
(i) D, a calendar year individual, is a partner in a calendar year partnership that is engaged in an activity of developing and marketing a design for a system that reduces air pollution in office buildings. D has a 10 percent distributive share of all items of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit. In 1987, the partnership acquired the rights to the design for $100,000. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, the partnership incurs expenditures with respect to the development and marketing of the design, and derives gross royalties from licensing the design, in the amounts set forth in the table below. The expenditures incurred in 1987 and 1988 are currently deductible expenses. The expenditures incurred in 1989 are capitalized and may be deducted only in subsequent taxable years.

(ii) Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section, the determination of whether royalties from intangible property are derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business of a partnership is made by applying the rules of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section to the partnership rather than the partners. The expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership in 1987 with respect to the development or marketing of the design ($8,000) do not exceed 50 percent of the partnership's gross royalties for such year from licensing the design ($20,000). In addition, the sum of such expenditures incurred in 1987 and all prior taxable years ($8,000) does not exceed 25 percent of the aggregate capital expenditures made by the partnership in all such taxable years with respect to the design ($100,000). Accordingly, for 1987, the partnership is not treated under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section as performing substantial services or incurring substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design. Therefore, unless all of the facts and circumstances indicate that the partnership performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design, D's distributive share of the partnership's royalty income for 1987 is portfolio income.
(iii) As of the end of 1988, the sum of the expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership during such taxable year and all prior taxable years with respect to the development or marketing of the design ($20,000) does not exceed 25 percent of the aggregate capital expenditures made by the partnership in all such years with respect to the design ($100,000). However, the amount of such expenditures incurred by the partnership in 1988 ($12,000) exceeds 50 percent of the partnership's gross royalties for such year from licensing the design ($20,000). Accordingly, for 1988, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
)(
a
) of this section, the partnership is treated as performing substantial services or incurring substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design, and D's distributive share of the partnership's royalty income for 1988 is considered for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section to be derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is not portfolio income.
(iv) The expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership in 1989 with respect to the development or marketing of the design ($15,000) do not exceed 50 percent of the partnership's gross royalties for such year from licensing the design ($60,000). However, the sum of such expenditures incurred by the partnership in 1989 and all prior taxable years ($35,000) exceeds 25 percent of the partnership's aggregate capital expenditures made in all such years with respect to the design ($115,000). Accordingly, for 1989, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
)(
b
) of this section, the partnership is treated as performing substantial services or incurring substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design, and D's distributive share of the partnership's royalty income in 1989 is considered for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section to be derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is not portfolio income.
(v) The result for 1990 is the same as for 1989, notwithstanding that the partnership incurs no expenditures in 1990 with respect to the development or marketing of the design.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that, for 1987, D's distributive share of the partnership's development and marketing costs is 15 percent, while D's distributive share of the partnership's gross royalties is 10 percent. Although D's distributive share of the expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership during 1987
with respect to the development and marketing of the design ($1,200) is more than 50 percent of D's distributive share of the partnership's gross royalties from licensing the design ($2,000), D is not treated as performing substantial services or incurring substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of the design for 1987 under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
)(
a
) of this section. This is because, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section, the determination of whether the royalties are derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business is made by applying paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section to the partnership, and not to D.
(4)
Items of personal service income specifically excluded
—(i)
In general.
Passive activity gross income does not include compensation paid to or on behalf of an individual for personal services performed or to be performed by such individual at any time. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), compensation for personal services includes only—
(A) Earned income (within the meaning of section 911(d)(2)(A)), including gross income from a payment described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section that represents compensation for the performance of services by a partner;
(B) Amounts includible in gross income under section 83;
(C) Amounts includible in gross income under sections 402 and 403;
(D) Amounts (other than amounts described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section) paid pursuant to retirement, pension, and other arrangements for deferred compensation for services;
(E) Social security benefits (within the meaning of section 86(d)) includible in gross income under section 86; and
(F) Other income identified by the Commissioner as income derived by the taxpayer from personal services;
provided, however, that no portion of a partner's distributive share of partnership income (within the meaning of section 704(b)) or a shareholder's pro rata share of income from an S corporation (within the meaning of section 1377(a)) shall be treated as compensation for personal services.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(4):

# Example.
C owns 50 percent of the stock of X, an S corporation. X owns rental real estate, which it manages. X pays C a salary for services performed by C on behalf of X in connection with the management of X's rental properties. Under this paragraph (c)(4), although C's pro rata share of X's gross rental income is passive activity gross income (even if the salary paid to C is less than the fair market value of C's services), the salary paid to C does not constitute passive activity gross income.
(5)
Income from section 481 adjustment
—(i)
In general.
If a change in accounting method results in a positive section 481 adjustment with respect to an activity, a ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section) of the amount taken into account for a taxable year as a net positive section 481 adjustment by reason of such change shall be treated as gross income from the activity for such taxable year, and such gross income shall be treated as passive activity gross income if and only if such activity is a passive activity for the year of the change (within the meaning of section 481(a)).
(ii)
Positive section 481 adjustments.
For purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(5)—
(A) The term “net positive section 481 adjustment” means the increase (if any) in taxable income taken into account under section 481(a) to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted by reason of a change in accounting method; and
(B) The term “positive section 481 adjustment with respect to an activity” means the increase (if any) in taxable income that would be taken into account under section 481(a) to prevent only the duplication or omission of amounts from such activity by reason of the change in accounting method.
(iii)
Ratable portion.
The ratable portion of the amount taken into account as a net positive section 481 adjustment for a taxable year by reason of a change in accounting method is determined with respect to an activity by multiplying such amount by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(A) The positive section 481 adjustment with respect to the activity; by
(B) The sum of the positive section 481 adjustments with respect to all of the activities of the taxpayer.
(6)
Gross income from certain oil or gas properties
—(i)
In general.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(6)(i) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(ii)
Gross and net passive income from the property.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(6)(ii) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(iii)
Property.
[Reserved]. See 1.469-2(c)(6)(iii) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this (c)(6):

# Example 1.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(6)(iv)
Example 1.

# Example 2.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(6)(iv)
Example 2.

# Example 3.
C is a general partner in partnership T and a limited partner in partnership U. T and U both own oil and gas working interests in tracts of land in County X. In 1987, T drills a well, and C's distributive share of T's losses from drilling the well is treated under § 1.469-1T(e)(4) as not from a passive activity. In the course of selecting the drilling site and drilling the well, T develops information indicating a significant probability that substantial oil and gas reserves underlie most portions of County X. As a result, the value of all oil and gas properties in County X is enhanced. The information developed by T does not, however, indicate that the reservoir in which T's well is drilled underlies U's tract. Under these facts, T's and U's tracts are not treated as one property for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), because the value of U's tract is not directly enhanced by T's activities.
(7)
Other items specifically excluded.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the regulations under section 469, passive activity gross income does not include the following:
(i) Gross income of an individual from intangible property, such as a patent, copyright, or literary, musical, or artistic composition, if the taxpayer's personal efforts significantly contributed to the creation of such property;
(ii) Gross income from a qualified low-income housing project (within the meaning of section 502 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986) for any taxable year in the relief period (within the meaning of section 502(b) of such Act;
(iii) Gross income attributable to a refund of any state, local, or foreign income, war profits, or excess profits tax;
(iv) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(7)(iv) for rules relating to this paragraph (c)(7)(iv).
(v) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(7)(v) for rules relating to this paragraph (c)(7)(v).
(vi) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(7)(vi) for rules relating to this paragraph (c)(7)(vi).
(d)
Passive activity deductions
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in section 469 and the regulations thereunder, a deduction is a passive activity deduction for a taxable year if and only if such deduction—
(i) Arises (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(8) of this section) in connection with the conduct of an activity that is a passive activity for the taxable year; or
(ii) Is treated as a deduction from an activity under § 1.469-1T(f)(4) for the taxable year.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(1):

# Example.
(i) In 1987, A, a calendar year individual, acquires a partnership interest in R, a calendar year partnership. R's only activity is a trade or business activity in which A materially participates for 1987. R incurs a loss in 1987. A's distributive share of R's 1987 loss is $1,000. However, A's basis in the partnership interest at the end of 1987 (without regard to A's distributive share of partnership loss) is $600; accordingly, section 704(d) disallows any deduction in 1987 for $400 of A's distributive share of R's loss. The remainder of A's distributive share of R's loss would be allowed as a deduction for 1987 if taxable income for all taxable years were determined without regard to sections 469, 613A(d), and 1211. See paragraph (d)(8) of this section.
(ii) A does not materially participate in R's activity for 1988. In 1988, R again incurs a loss, and A's distributive share of the loss is again $1,000. At the end of 1988, A's basis in the partnership interest (without regard to A's distributive share of partnership loss) is $2,000; accordingly, in 1988 section 704(d) does not limit A's deduction for either A's $1,000 distributive share of R's 1988 loss or the $400 loss carried over from 1987 under the second sentence of section 704(d). These losses would be allowed as a deduction for 1988 if taxable income for all taxable years were determined without regard to sections 469, 613A(d) and 1211. See paragraph (d)(8) of this section.
(iii) Under these facts, only $400 of A's distributive share of R's deductions from the activity are disallowed under section 704(d) in 1987. A's remaining deductions from the activity are treated as deductions that arise in connection with the activity for 1987 under paragraph (d)(8) of this section. Because A materially participates in the activity for 1987, the activity is not a passive activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(1)) of A for such year. Accordingly, the deductions that are not disallowed in 1987 are not passive activity deductions.
(iv) A does not materially participate in R's activity for 1988. Accordingly, the activity is a passive activity of A for such year. No portion of A's distributive share of R's deductions from the activity is disallowed under section 704(d) in 1988. Accordingly, A's distributive share of R's deductions for 1988 and the $400 of deductions carried over from 1987 are both treated under paragraph (d)(8) of this section as deductions that arise in 1988. Since the activity is a passive activity for 1988, such deductions are passive activity deductions.
(2)
Exceptions.
Passive activity deductions do not include—
(i) A deduction for an item of expense (other than interest) that is clearly and directly allocable (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4) of this section) to portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section);
(ii) A deduction allowed under section 243, 244, or 245 with respect to any dividend that is not included in passive activity gross income;
(iii) Interest expense (other than interest expense described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section);
(iv) A deduction for a loss from the disposition of property of a type that produces portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section);
(v) A deduction that, under section 469(g) and § 1.469-6T (relating to the allowance of passive activity losses upon certain dispositions of interests in passive activities), is treated as a deduction that is not a passive activity deduction;
(vi) A deduction for any state, local, or foreign income, war profits, or excess profits tax;
(vii) A miscellaneous itemized deduction (within the meaning of section 67(b)) that is subject to disallowance in whole or in part under section 67(a) (without regard to whether any amount of such deduction is disallowed under section 67);
(viii) A deduction allowed under section 170 for a charitable contribution;
(ix) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(2)(ix) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(x) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(2)(x) for rules relating to this paragraph (d)(2)(x).
(xi) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(2)(xi) for rules relating to this paragraph (d)(2)(xi).
(xii) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(2)(xii) for rules relating to this paragraph (d)(2)(xii).
(3)
Interest expense.
Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, interest expense is taken into account as a passive activity deduction if and only if such interest expense—
(i) Is allocated under § 1.163-8T to a passive activity expenditure (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T(b)(4)); and
(ii) Is not—
(A) Qualified residence interest (within the meaning of § 1.163-10T); or
(B) Capitalized pursuant to a capitalization provision (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T(m)(7)(i)).
(4)
Clearly and directly allocable expenses.
For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, an expense (other than interest expense) is clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) if and only if such expense is incurred as a result of, or incident to, an activity in which such gross income is derived or in connection with property from which such gross income is derived. For example, general and administrative expenses and compensation paid to officers attributable to the performance of services that do not directly benefit or are not incurred by reason of a particular activity or particular property are not clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section).
(5)
Treatment of loss from disposition
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469—
(A) Any loss recognized in any year upon the sale, exchange, or other disposition (a “disposition”) of an interest in property used in an activity at the time of the disposition or of an interest in an activity held through a partnership or S corporation and any deduction allowed on account of the abandonment or worthlessness of such an interest is treated as a deduction from such activity; and
(B) Any such deduction is a passive activity deduction if and only if the activity is a passive activity of the taxpayer for the taxable year of the disposition (or other event giving rise to the deduction).
(ii)
Disposition of property used in more than one activity in 12-month period preceding disposition.
In the case of a disposition of an interest in property that is used in more than one activity during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition, the amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of such interest must be allocated among such activities in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Other applicable rules
—(A)
Applicability of rules in paragraph (c)(2).
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(5)(iii)(A) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(B)
Dispositions of partnership interests and S corporation stock.
A partnership interest or S corporation stock is not property used in an activity for purposes of this paragraph (d)(5). See paragraph (e)(3) of this section for rules treating the loss recognized upon the disposition of a partnership interest or S corporation stock as loss from the disposition of interests in the activities in which the partnership or S corporation has an interest.
(6)
Coordination with other limitations on deductions that apply before section 469
—(i)
In general.
An item of deduction from a passive activity that is disallowed for a taxable year under section 704(d), 1366(d), or 465 is not a passive activity deduction for the taxable year. Paragraphs (d)(6) (ii) and (iii) of this section provide rules for determining the extent to which items of deduction from a passive activity are disallowed for a taxable year under sections 704(d), 1366(d), and 465.
(ii)
Proration of deductions disallowed under basis limitations
—(A)
Deductions disallowed under section 704(d).
If any amount of a partner's distributive share of a partnership's loss for the taxable year is disallowed under section 704(d), a ratable portion of the partner's distributive share of each item of deduction or loss of the partnership is disallowed for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of an item of deduction or loss is the amount of such item multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(
1
) The amount of the partner's distributive share of partnership loss that is disallowed for the taxable year; by
(
2
) The sum of the partner's distributive shares of all items of deduction and loss of the partnership for the taxable year.
(B)
Deductions disallowed under section 1366(d).
If any amount of an S corporation shareholder's pro rata share of an S corporation's loss for the taxable year is disallowed under section 1366(d), a ratable portion of the taxpayer's pro rata share of each item of deduction or loss of the S corporation is disallowed for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of an item of deduction or loss is the amount of such item multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(
1
) The amount of the shareholder's pro rata share of S corporation loss that is disallowed for the taxable year; by
(
2
) The sum of the shareholder's pro rata shares of all items of deduction and loss of the corporation for the taxable year.
(iii)
Proration of deductions disallowed under at-risk limitation.
If any amount of the taxpayer's loss from an activity (within the meaning of section 465(c)) is disallowed under section 465 for the taxable year, a ratable portion of each item of deduction or loss from the activity is disallowed for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of an item of deduction or loss is the amount of such item multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(
1
) The amount of the loss from the activity that is disallowed for the taxable year; by
(
2
) The sum of all deductions from the activity for the taxable year.
(iv)
Coordination of basis and at-risk limitations.
The portion of any item of deduction or loss that is disallowed for the taxable year under section 704(d) or 1366(d) is not taken into account for the taxable year in determining the loss from an activity (within the meaning of section 465(c)) for purposes of applying section 465.
(v)
Separately identified items of deduction and loss.
In identifying the items of deduction and loss from an activity that are not disallowed under sections 704(d), 1366(d), and 465 (and that therefore may be treated as passive activity deductions), the taxpayer need not account separately for any item of deduction or loss unless such item may, if separately taken into account, result in an income tax liability different from that which would result were such item of deduction or loss taken into account separately. For related rules applicable to partnerships and S corporations, see § 1.702-1(a)(8)(ii) and section 1366(a)(1)(A), respectively. Items of deduction or loss that must be accounted for separately include (but are not limited to) items of deduction or loss that—
(A) Are attributable to separate activities (within the meaning of the rules to be contained in § 1.469-4T);
(B) Arise in a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in taxable years in which the taxpayer activity participates (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;
(C) Arise in a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in taxable years in which the taxpayer does not actively participate (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;
(D) Arose in a taxable year beginning before 1987 and were not allowed for such taxable year under section 704(d), 1366(d), or 465(a)(2);
(E) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(6)(v)(E) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(F) Are attributable to pre-enactment interests in activities (within the meaning of § 1.469-11T(c)).
(7)
Deductions from section 481 adjustment
—(i)
In general.
If a change in accounting method results in a negative section 481 adjustment with respect to an activity, a ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(7)(iii) of this section) of the amount taken into account for a taxable year as a net negative section 481 adjustment by reason of such change shall be treated as a deduction from the activity for such taxable year, and such deduction shall be treated as a passive activity deduction if and only if such activity is a passive activity for the year of the change (within the meaning of section 481(a)). See the rules to be contained in § 1.469-1T(k) for the treatment of passive activity deductions from an activity in taxable years in which the activity is a former passive activity.
(ii)
Negative section 481 adjustments.
For purposes of applying this paragraph (d)(7)—
(A) The term “net negative section 481 adjustment” means the decrease (if any) in taxable income taken into account under section 481(a) to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted by reason of a change in accounting method; and
(B) The term “negative section 481 adjustment with respect to an activity” means the decrease (if any) in taxable income that would be taken into account under section 481(a) to prevent only the duplication or omission of amounts from such activity by reason of the change in accounting method.
(iii)
Ratable portion.
The ratable portion of the amount taken into account as a net negative section 481 adjustments for a taxable year by reason of a change in accounting method is determined with respect to an activity by multiplying such amount by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(A) The negative section 481 adjustment with respect to the activity; by
(B) The sum of the negative section 481 adjustments with respect to all of the activities of the taxpayer.
(8)
Taxable year in which item arises.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(8) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(e)
Special rules for partners and S corporation shareholders
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, the character (as an item of passive activity gross income or passive activity deduction) of each item of gross income and deduction allocated to a taxpayer from a partnership or S corporation (a “passthrough entity”) shall be determined, in any case in which participation is relevant, by reference to the participation of the taxpayer in the activity (or activities) that generated such item.
Such participation is determined for the taxable year of the passthrough entity (and not the taxable year of the taxpayer). The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e)(1):

# Example.
A, a calendar year individual, is a partner in a partnership that has a taxable year ending January 31. During its taxable year ending on January 31, 1988, the partnership engages in a single trade or business activity. For the period from February 1, 1987, through January 31, 1988, A does not materially participate in this activity. In A's calendar year 1988 return, A's distributive share of the partnership's gross income and deductions from the activity must be treated as passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions, without regard to A's participation in the activity from February 1, 1988, through December 31, 1988. See also § 1.469-11T(a)(4) (relating to the effective date of, and transition rules under, section 469 and the regulations thereunder).
(2)
Payments under sections 707(a), 707(c), and 736(b).
Items of gross income and deduction attributable to a transaction described in section 707(a), 707(c), or 736(b) shall be characterized for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder in accordance with the following rules:
(i)
Section 707(a).
Any item of gross income or deduction attributable to a transaction that is treated under section 707(a) as a transaction between a partnership and a partner acting in a capacity other than as a member of such partnership shall be characterized for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder in a manner that is consistent with the treatment of such transaction under section 707(a).
(ii)
Section 707(c).
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(e)(ii) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(iii)
Payments in liquidation of a partner's interest in partnership property.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(e)(iii) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(3)
Sale or exchange of interest in passthrough entity
—(i)
Application of this paragraph (e)(3).
In the case of the sale, exchange, or other disposition (a “disposition”) of an interest in a passthrough entity, the amount of the seller's gain or loss from each activity in which such entity has an interest is determined, for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, under this paragraph (e)(3). In the case of any such disposition, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section, paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section shall apply. See paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(5) of this section for rules for determining the character of gain or loss, respectively, recognized upon a disposition of an interest in an activity held through a passthrough entity.
(ii)
General rule
—(A)
Allocation among activities.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or in paragraph (e)(3) (iii) or (iv) of this section, if a holder of an interest in a passthrough entity disposes of such interest, a ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section) of any gain or loss from such disposition shall be treated as gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in each trade or business, rental, or investment activity in which such passthrough entity owns an interest on the applicable valuation date.
(B)
Ratable portion
—(
1
)
Dispositions on which gain is recognized.
The ratable portion of any gain from the disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity that is allocable to an activity described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is determined by multiplying the amount of such gain by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(
i
) The amount of net gain (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E)(
3
) of this section) that would have been allocated to the holder of such interest with respect thereto if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in such activity for its fair market value on the applicable valuation date; by
(
ii
) The sum of the amounts of net gain that would have been allocated to the holder of such interest with respect thereto if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in each appreciated activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section) described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for the fair market value of each such activity on the applicable valuation date.
(
2
)
Dispositions on which loss is recognized.
The ratable portion of any loss from the disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity that is allocable to
an activity described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is determined by multiplying the amount of such loss by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(
i
) The amount of net loss (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E)(
4
) of this section) that would have been allocated to the holder of such interest with respect thereto if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in such activity for its fair market value on the applicable valuation date; by
(
ii
) The sum of the amounts of net loss that would have been allocated to the holder of such interest with respect thereto if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in each depreciated activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E)(
2
) of this section) described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for the fair market value of each such activity on the applicable valuation date.
(C)
Default rule.
If the gain or loss recognized upon the disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity cannot be allocated under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, such gain or loss shall be allocated among the activities described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in proportion to the respective fair market values of the passthrough entity's interests in such activities at the applicable valuation date, and the gain or loss allocated to each activity of the passthrough entity shall be treated as gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in such activity.
(D)
Special rules.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), the following rules shall apply:
(
1
)
Applicable valuation date
—(
i
)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, the applicable valuation date with respect to any disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity is whichever one of the following dates is selected by the passthrough entity:
(
a
) The beginning of the taxable year of the passthrough entity in which such disposition occurs; or
(
b
) The date on which such disposition occurs.
(
ii
)
Exception.
If, after the beginning of a passthrough entity's taxable year in which a holder's disposition of an interest in such passthrough entity occurs and before the time of such disposition—
(
a
) The passthrough entity disposes of more than 10 percent of its interest (by value as of the beginning of such taxable year) in any activity;
(
b
) More than 10 percent of the property (by value as of the beginning of such taxable year) used in any activity of the passthrough entity is disposed of; or
(
c
) The holder of such interest contributes to the passthrough entity substantially appreciated property or substantially depreciated property with a total fair market value or adjusted basis, respectively, which exceeds 10 percent of the total fair market value of the holder's interest in the passthrough entity as of the beginning of such taxable year;
then the applicable valuation date shall be the date immediately preceding the date on which such disposition occurs.
(
2
)
Basis adjustments.
Any adjustment to the basis of partnership property under section 743(b) made with respect to the holder of an interest in a partnership shall be taken into account in computing the net gain or net loss that would have been allocated to the holder with respect to such interest if the partnership had sold its entire interest in an activity.
(
3
)
Tiered passthrough entities.
In the case of a disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity (the “subsidiary passthrough entity”) by a holder that is also a passthrough entity, any gain or loss from such disposition that is taken into account by any person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in such holder shall be allocated among the activities of the subsidiary passthrough entity by applying the rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) to the person taking such gain or loss into account as if such person has been the holder of an interest in such subsidiary passthrough entity and had recognized such gain or loss as a result of a disposition of such interest.
(E)
Meaning of certain terms.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii)—
(
1
) An activity is an appreciated activity with respect to a holder that has
disposed of an interest in a passthrough entity if a net gain would have been allocated to the holder with respect to such interest if the passthrough entity has sold its entire interest in such activity for its fair market value on the applicable valuation date;
(
2
) An activity is a depreciated activity with respect to a holder that has disposed of an interest in a passthrough entity if a net loss would have been allocated to the holder with respect to such interest if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in such activity for its fair market value on the applicable valuation date;
(
3
) The term “net gain” means, with respect to the sale of a passthrough entity's entire interest in an activity, the amount by which the gains from the sale of all of the property used by (or representing the interest of) the passthrough entity in such activity exceed the losses (if any) from such sale;
(
4
) The term “net loss” means, with respect to the sale of a passthrough entity's entire interest in an activity, the amount by which the losses from the sale of all of the property used by (or representing the interest of) the passthrough entity in such activity exceed the gains (if any) from such sale.
(iii)
Treatment of gain allocated to certain passive activities as not from a passive activity.
If, in the case of a disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity—
(A) An amount of gain recognized on account of such disposition by the holder of such interest (or any other person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in such holder if such holder is a passthrough entity) is allocated to a passive activity of such holder (or such other person) under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section;
(B) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(e)(3)(iii)(B) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(C) The amount of the gain of the holder (or such other person) described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section exceeds 10 percent of the amount of the gain of the holder (or such other person) described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section;
then the gain of the holder (or such other person) that is described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section shall be treated as gain that is not from a passive activity to the extent that such gain does not exceed the amount of the gain of the holder (or such other person) described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. For purposes of applying the preceding sentence to the disposition of an interest in a partnership, the amount of gain that would have been allocated to the holder (or such other person) if all of the property used in an activity had been sold shall be determined by taking into account any adjustment to the basis of partnership property made with respect to such holder (or such other person) under section 743(b).
(iv)
Dispositions occurring in taxable years beginning before February 19, 1988
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(3)(iv), if the holder of an interest in a passthrough entity sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of all or part of such interest during a taxable year of such entity beginning prior to February 19, 1988, any gain or loss recognized from such disposition shall be allocated among the activities of the passthrough entity under any reasonable method selected by the passthrough entity, and the gain or loss allocated to each activity of the passthrough entity shall be treated as gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in such activity. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a reasonable method shall include the method prescribed by paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. In addition, a method that allocates gain or loss among the passthrough entity's activities on the basis of the fair market value, cost, or adjusted basis of the property used in such activities shall generally be considered a reasonable method for purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
(B)
Exceptions.
This paragraph (e)(3)(iv) shall not apply to any disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity occurring after February 19, 1988, if after such date, but before the holder's disposition of such interest, the holder (or any other person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in
such holder if such holder is a passthrough entity) contributes to the passthrough entity substantially appreciated portfolio assets or any other substantially appreciated property that was used in any trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)) of the holder (or such other person) during—
(
1
) The taxable year of such person in which such contribution occurs; or
(
2
) The immediately preceding taxable year of such person;
but only if such person materially participated (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) in the activity for such year.
(v)
Treatment of portfolio assets.
For purposes of the paragraph (e)(3), all portfolio assets owned by a passthrough entity shall be treated as held in a single investment activity.
(vi)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)—
(A) The term “portfolio asset” means any property of a type that produces portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section);
(B) The term “substantially appreciated property” means property with a fair market value that exceeds 120 percent of its adjusted basis; and
(C) The term “substantially depreciated property” means property with an adjusted basis that exceeds 120 percent of its fair market value.
(vii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(3):

# Example 1.
(i) A owns a one-half interest in P, a calendar year partnership. In 1993, A sells 50 percent of such interest for $50,000. A's adjusted basis for the interest sold is $30,000. Thus, A recognizes $20,000 of gain from the sale. P is engaged in three trade or business activities, X, Y, and Z, and owns marketable securities that are portfolio assets. For 1993, A materially participates in activity Z, but does not participate in activities X and Y. Paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section would not have applied to any of the gain that A would have been allocated if, immediately before A's sale, P had disposed of all of the property used in its trade or business activities. During the portion of 1993 preceding A's sale, P did not sell any of the property used in its activities, and A did not contribute any property to P.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, a ratable portion of A's $20,000 gain is allocated to each appreciated activity in which P owned an interest on the applicable valuation date (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section). For this purpose, paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section treats the marketable securities owned by P as a single investment activity.
(iii) P selects the beginning of 1993 as the applicable valuation date pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D)(
1
)(
i
) of this section. P is not required to use the date of A's sale as the applicable valuation date under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section because during the portion of 1993 preceding A's sale, P did not sell any of its property and A did not contribute any property to P. At the beginning of 1993, the fair market value and adjusted basis of the property used in P's activities are as follows:
Adjusted basis
Fair market value
X
$68,000
$48,000
Y
30,000
62,000
Z
20,000
80,000
Marketable securities
2,000
10,000
Total
120,000
200,000
(iv) Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the portion of A's $20,000 gain that is allocated to an appreciated activity of P (i.e., activities Y and Z and the marketable securities) is the amount of such gain multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing (a) the net gain that would have been allocated to A with respect to the interest sold by A if P had sold its entire interest in such activity at the beginning of 1993 by (b) the sum of the amounts of net gain that would have been allocated to A with respect to the interest sold by A if P had sold its entire interest in each appreciated activity at the beginning of 1993.
(v) If P had sold its entire interest in activities Y and Z and the marketable securities at the beginning of 1993, A would have been allocated the following amounts of net gain with respect to the interest in P that A sold in 1993:
Activity
Net gain
Y
$8,000
Z
15,000
Marketable securities
2,000
Total
25,000
(vi) Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, $6,400 of A's $20,000 gain ($20,000 × $8,000/$25,000) is allocated to activity Y, $12,000 of A's $20,000 gain ($20,000 × $15,000/$25,000) is allocated to activity Z, and $1,600 of A's $20,000 gain ($20,000 × $2,000/$25,000) is allocated to the marketable securities. The gain allocated to activity Y is passive activity gross income. None of that gain is treated as gain that is not from a passive activity under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section because paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of
this section would not have applied to any of the gain that A would have been allocated if P had sold all of the property used in activity Y immediately prior to A's sale.

# Example 2.
(i) B and C, calendar year individuals, are equal partners in calendar year partnership R, which they formed on January 1, 2005, with contributions of property and money. The only item of property (other than money) contributed by B was a building that B had used for 12 years preceding the contribution in an activity that was not a passive activity during such period. At the time of its contribution, the building had an adjusted basis of $40,000 and a fair market value of $66,000. R is engaged in a single activity: the sale of equipment to customers in the ordinary course of the business of dealing in such property. R uses the building contributed by B in the dealership activity. B did not materially participate in the dealership activity during 2005. On July 1, 2005, D purchases one-half of B's interest in R for $37,500 in cash. At the time of the sale, the balance sheet of R, which uses the accrual method of accounting, is as follows:
Adjusted basis per books

Thus, B's gain from the sale is $14,000 ($45,000 amount realized from the sale (consisting of $37,500 of cash and $7,500 of liabilities assumed by the purchaser) minus B's $31,000 adjusted basis for the interest sold (one-half of B's total adjusted basis of $62,000)).
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, all $14,000 of B's gain from the sale is allocated to R's dealership activity, which is a passive activity of B for 2005. If, however, R had sold its interest in the building immediately prior to B's sale for its fair market value on the applicable valuation date (the valuation date selected by R is irrelevant since the building had a fair market value of $66,000 at the beginning of 2005 and at the time of the sale), B would have been allocated $13,000 of gain under section 704(c) with respect to the interest in R that B sold to D. This gain would have been treated as gain that is not from a passive activity under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section and would have exceeded 10 percent of the total amount of B's gain that is allocated to the dealership activity under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, B's gain from the sale ($14,000) is treated as gain that is not from a passive activity to the extent that such gain does not exceed the amount of gain subject to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section that B would have been allocated with respect to the interest sold to D if R had sold all of the property used in the dealership activity immediately prior to B's sale ($13,000). Thus, $13,000 of B's gain from the sale is treated as gain that is not from a passive activity.
(f)
Recharacterization of passive income in certain situations
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (f) sets forth rules that require income from certain passive activities to be treated as income that is not from a passive activity (regardless of whether such income is treated as passive activity gross income under section 469 or any other provision of the regulations thereunder). For definitions of certain terms used in this paragraph (f), see paragraph (f)(9) of this section.
(2)
Special rule for significant participation
—(i)
In general.
An amount of the taxpayer's gross income from each significant participation passive activity for the taxable year equal to a ratable portion of the taxpayer's net passive income from such activity for the taxable year shall be treated as not from a passive activity if the taxpayer's passive activity gross income from all significant participation passive activities for the taxable year (determined without regard to paragraphs (f) (2) through (4) of this section) exceeds the taxpayer's passive activity deductions from all such activities for such year. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), the ratable portion of the net passive income from an activity is determined by multiplying the amount of such income by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(A) The amount of the excess described in the preceding sentence; by
(B) The amount of the excess described in the preceding sentence taking into account only significant participation passive activities from which the taxpayer has net passive income for the taxable year.
(ii)
Significant participation passive activity.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), the term “significant participation passive activity” means any trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(2)) in which the taxpayer significantly participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(c)(2)) for the taxable year but in which the taxpayer does not materially participate (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) for such year.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(2):

# Example.
(i) A owns interests in three trade or business activities, X, Y, and Z. A does not materially participate in any of these activities for the taxable year, but participates in activity X for 110 hours, in activity Y for 160 hours, and in activity Z for 125 hours. A owns no interest in any other trade or business activity in which A does not materially participate for the taxable year but in which A participates for more than 100 hours during the taxable year. A's net passive income (or loss) for the taxable year from activities X, Y, and Z is as follows:
X
Y
Z
Passive activity gross income
$600
$700
$900
Passive activity deductions
(200)
(1,000)
(300)
Net passive income
400
(300)
600
(ii) Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, activities X, Y, and Z are A's only significant participation passive activities for the taxable year. A's passive activity gross income from significant participation passive activities ($2,200) exceeds A's passive activity deductions from significant participation passive activities ($1,500) by $700 for such year. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, a ratable portion of A's gross income from activities X and Z (A's significant participation passive activities with net passive income for the taxable year) is treated as gross income that is not from a passive activity. The ratable portion is determined by dividing (a) the amount by which A's passive activity gross income from significant participation passive activities exceeds A's passive activity deductions from significant participation passive activities for the taxable year ($700) by (b) such excess taking into account only A's significant participation passive activities having net passive income for the taxable year ($1,000). Accordingly, $280 of gross income from activity X ($400 × 700/1000) and $420 of gross income from activity Z ($600 × 700/1000) is treated as gross income that is not from a passive activity.
(3)
Rental of nondepreciable property.
If less than 30 percent of the unadjusted basis of the property used or held for use by customers in a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)) during the taxable year is subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167, an amount of the taxpayer's gross income from the activity equal to the taxpayer's net passive income from the activity shall be treated as not from a passive activity. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), the term “unadjusted basis” means adjusted basis determined without regard to any adjustment described in section 1016 that decreases basis. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(3):

# Example.
C is a limited partner in a partnership. The partnership acquires vacant land for $300,000, constructs improvements on the land at a cost of $100,000, and leases the land and improvements to a tenant. The partnership then sells the land and improvements for $600,000, thereby realizing a gain on the disposition. The unadjusted basis of the improvements ($100,000) equals 25 percent of the unadjusted basis of all property ($400,000) used in the rental activity. Therefore, under this paragraph (f)(3), an amount of C's gross income from the activity equal to the net passive income from the activity (which is computed by taking into account the gain from the disposition, including gain allocable to the improvements) is treated as not from a passive activity.
(4)
Net interest income from passive equity-financed lending activity
—(i)
In general.
An amount of the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year from any equity-financed lending activity equal to the lesser of—
(A) The taxpayer's equity-financed interest income from the activity for such year; and
(B) The taxpayer's net passive income from the activity for such year
shall be treated as not from a passive activity.
(ii)
Equity-financed lending activity
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), an activity is an equity-financed lending activity for a taxable year if—
(
1
) The activity involves a trade or business of lending money; and
(
2
) The average outstanding balance of the liabilities incurred in the activity for the taxable year does not exceed
80 percent of the average outstanding balance of the interest-bearing assets held in the activity for such year.
(B)
Certain liabilities not taken into account.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section, liabilities incurred principally for the purpose of increasing the percentage described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section shall not be taken into account in computing such percentage.
(iii)
Equity-financed interest income.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), the taxpayer's equity-financed interest income from an activity for a taxable year is the amount of the taxpayer's net interest income from the activity for such year multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(A) The excess of the average outstanding balance for such year of the interest-bearing assets held in the activity over the average outstanding balance for such year of the liabilities incurred in the activity; by
(B) The average outstanding balance for such year of the interest-bearing assets held in the activity.
(iv)
Net interest income.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), the net interest income from an activity for a taxable year is—
(A) The gross interest income from the activity for such year; reduced by
(B) Expenses from the activity (other than interest on liabilities described in paragraph (f)(4)(vi) of this section) for such year that are reasonably allocable to such gross interest income.
(v)
Interest-bearing assets.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), the interest-bearing assets held in an activity include all assets that produce interest income, including loans to customers.
(vi)
Liabilities incurred in the activity.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), liabilities incurred in an activity include all fixed and determinable liabilities incurred in the activity that bear interest or are issued with original issue discount other than debts secured by tangible property used in the activity. In the case of an activity conducted by an entity in which the taxpayer owns an interest, liabilities incurred in an activity include only liabilities with respect to which the entity is the borrower.
(vii)
Average outstanding balance.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), the average outstanding balance of liabilities incurred in an activity or of the interest-bearing assets held in an activity may be computed on a daily, monthly, or quarterly basis at the option of the taxpayer.
(viii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(4):

# Example:
(i) A, a calendar year individual, acquires on January 1, 1988, a limited partnership interest in P, a calendar year partnership. Under the partnership agreement, A has a one percent share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit of P. A acquires the partnership interest for $90,000, using $50,000 of unborrowed funds and $40,000 of proceeds of a loan bearing interest at an annual rate of 10 percent. A pays $4,000 of interest on the loan in 1988.
(ii) P's sole activity is a trade or business of lending money. A does not materially participate in the activity for 1988. During 1988, the average outstanding balance of P's interest-bearing assets (including loans to customers, temporary deposits with other lending institutions, and government and corporate securities) is $20 million. P incurs numerous interest-bearing liabilities in connection with its lending activity, including liabilities for deposits taken from customers, unsecured short-term and long-term loans from other lending institutions, and a mortgage loan secured by the building, owned by P, in which P conducts its business. For 1988, the average outstanding balance of all of these liabilities (other than the mortgage loan) is $11 million. None of these liabilities was incurred by P principally for the purpose of increasing the percentage described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section.
(iii) The interest income derived by P for 1988 from its interest-bearing assets is $2.2 million. The interest expense paid by P for 1988 with respect to the liabilities incurred in connection with its lending activity (other than the mortgage loan) is $990,000. P's other expenses for 1988 that are reasonably allocable to P's gross interest income (including expenses for advertising, loan processing and servicing, and insurance, and depreciation on P's building) total $250,000. P's interest expense for 1988 on the mortgage loan secured by the building used in P's lending activity is $50,000. All of the interest expense paid or incurred by P for 1988 is allocated under § 1.63-8T to expeditures in connection with P's lending activity.
(iv) Under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, P's activity is an equity-financed lending activity for 1988, since, for 1988, the activity involves a trade or business of lending money and the average outstanding balance
of the liabilities incurred in the activity ($11 million) does not exceed 80 percent of the average outstanding balance of the interest-bearing assets held in the activity ($20 million). Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, an amount of A's gross income from the activity equal to the lesser of (a) A's equity-financed interest income from the activity for 1988, or (b) A's net passive income from the activity for 1988, is treated as income that is not from a passive activity.
(v) Under paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, A's equity-financed interest income from the activity for 1988 is determined by multiplying A's net interest income from the activity for 1988 by the fraction obtained by dividing $9 million (the excess of the average interest-bearing assets for 1988 over the average interest-bearing liabilities for 1988) by $20 million (the average interest-bearing assets for 1988). Under paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section, A's net interest income from the activity for 1988 is $19,000 (A's distributive share of $2.2 million of gross interest income less A's distributive share of $300,000 of expenses described in paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, including interest expense on the mortgage loan). A's distributive share of P's other interest expense ($990,000) is not taken into account in computing A's net interest income for 1988. Accordingly, A's equity-financed interest income from the activity for 1988 is $8,550 ($19,000 × $9 million/$20 million).
(vi) Under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section, A's net passive income from the activity for 1988 is determined by taking into account A's distributive share of P's gross income and deductions from the activity for 1988, as well as any interest expense incurred by A individually that is taken into account under § 1.163-8T in determining A's income or loss from the activity for 1988. Assuming that for 1988 all $4,000 of interest expense on the loan that A used to finance the acquisition of A's interest in P is allocated under § 1.163-8T to expenditures of A in connection with the lending activity for 1988, A's net passive income from the activity for 1988 is $5,100, computed as set forth in the following table:
Gross income:
Interest income
$22,000
Deductions:
Distributive share of P's expenses from the activity
(12,900)
Interest expense on A's acquisition debt
(4,000)
Net passive income
5,100
(vii) A's net passive income from the activity for 1988 ($5,100) is less than A's equity-financed income from the activity for 1988 ($8,550). Accordingly, under this paragraph (f)(4), $5,100 of A's gross income from the activity for 1988 is treated as not from a passive activity.

(7)
Special rules applicable to the acquisition of an interest in a passthrough entity engaged in the trade or business of licensing intangible property
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer acquires an interest in an entity described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section (the “development entity”) after the development entity has created an item of intangible property or performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of an item of intangible property, an amount of the taxpayer's gross royalty income for the taxable year from such item of property equal to the taxpayer's net royalty income for the year from such item of property shall be treated as not from a passive activity.
(ii)
Royalty income from property.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(7)—
(A) A taxpayer's gross royalty income for a taxable year from an item of property is the taxpayer's share of passive activity gross income for such year (determined without regard to paragraphs (f)(2) through (7) of this section) from the licensing or transfer of any right in such property; and
(B) A taxpayer's net royalty income for a taxable year from an item of property is the excess, if any, of—
(
1
) The taxpayer's gross royalty income for the taxable year from such item of property; over
(
2
) Any passive activity deductions for such taxable year (including any deduction treated as a deduction for such year under § 1.469-1T (f)(4)) that
are reasonably allocable to such item of property.
(iii)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section shall not apply to a taxpayer's gross royalty income for a taxable year from the licensing of an item of intangible property if—
(A) The expenditures reasonably incurred by the development entity for the taxable year of the entity ending with or within the taxpayer's taxable year with respect to the development or marketing of such property satisfy paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) (
a
) of this section; or
(B) The taxpayer's share of the expenditures reasonably incurred by the development entity with respect to the development or marketing of such property for all taxable years of the entity beginning with the taxable year of the entity in which the taxpayer acquired the interest in the entity and ending with the taxable year of the entity ending with or within the taxpayer's current taxable year exceeds 25 percent of the fair market value of the taxpayer's interest in such property at the time the taxpayer acquired the interest in the entity.
(iv)
Capital expenditures.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(7)(iii)(B) of this section, a capital expenditure shall be taken into account for the taxable year of the entity in which such expenditure is chargeable to capital account, and the taxpayer's share of such expenditure shall be determined as though such expenditure were allowed as a deduction for such year.
(v)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(7):

# Example.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 5 in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, except that, in 1988, D's 10 percent partnership interest is sold to F for $13,000, all of which is attributable to the design licensed by the partnership.
(ii) For 1988, the expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership with respect to the development or marketing of the design satisfy paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
)(
a
) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(7)(iii)(A) of this section, paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section does not apply to F's distributive share of the partnership's gross income from licensing the design.
(iii) For 1989, the expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership with respect to the development or marketing of the design do not satisfy paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
)(
a
) of this section. Moreover, F's distributive share of such expenditures reasonably incurred by the partnership for 1988 and 1989 ($27,000 × .10 = $2,700) does not exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of F's interest in the design at the time F acquired the partnership interest ($13,000). Accordingly, neither of the exceptions provided in paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section applies for 1989 and, under paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section, an amount of F's gross royalty income from the design equal to F's net royalty income from the design is treated as not from a passive activity.
(8)
Limitation on recharacterized income.
The amount of gross income from an activity that is treated as not from a passive activity for the taxable year under subparagraphs (f) (2) through (4) of this paragraph (f) shall not exceed the greatest amount of gross income treated as not from a passive activity under any one of such subparagraphs.
(9)
Meaning of certain terms.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the terms set forth below shall have the following meanings:
(i) The net passive income from an activity for a taxable year is the amount by which the taxpayer's passive activity gross income from the activity for the taxable year (determined without regard to paragraphs (f) (2) through (4) of this section) exceeds the taxpayer's passive activity deductions from the activity for such year;
(ii) The net passive loss from an activity for a taxable year is the amount by which the taxpayer's passive activity deductions from the activity for the taxable year exceeds the taxpayer's passive activity gross income from the activity for such year (determined without regard to paragraphs (f) (2) through (4) of this section).

(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) A, a calendar year individual, is a general partner in calendar year partnership P. P purchases a building in 1987 and, in 1987, 1988, and 1989, incurs rehabilitation costs with respect to the building. The building is placed in service in the rental activity in 1989. P's rehabilitation costs are qualified rehabilitation expenditures (within the meaning of section 48(g)(2)) and are taken into account in determining the amount of the investment credit for rehabilitation expenditures. P's qualified rehabilitation expenditures are not qualified progress expenditures (within the meaning of section 46(d)).
(ii) Because, under section 46(c)(1), the credit is allowable for the taxable year in which the rehabilitated property is placed in service, the credit allowable for P's qualified rehabilitation expenditures arises in connection with the activity in which the property is placed in service. In addition, the credit is attributable to 1989, the year in which the property is placed in service, because it would be allowed for such year if A's credits allowed for all taxable years were determined without regard to the limitations contained in sections 26(a), 28(d)(2), 29(b)(5), 38(c), and 469. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's distributive share of the credit is subject to section 469 for 1989 because the credit arises in connection with a rental activity for such year.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the rehabilitation costs are incurred in anticipation of placing the building in service in a rental activity, the qualified rehabilitation expenditures in 1987 and 1988 are qualified progress expenditures (“QPEs”) (within the meaning of section 46(d)(3)), the improvements resulting from the expenditures are progress expenditure property (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section), and it is reasonable to expect that such property will be transition property (within the meaning of section 49(e)) when the property is placed in service. Therefore, under section 46(d)(1)(A), the qualified investment for 1987 and 1988 is increased by an amount equal to the aggregate of the applicable percentage of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred in such years. The credits that are based on these expenditures are attributable (under paragraph (c) of this section) to 1987 and 1988, respectively. It is reasonable to believe in 1987 and 1988 that the progress expenditure property will be used in a rental activity when it is placed in service. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, A's distributive share of the credit for 1987 and 1988 is subject to section 469. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section (as in Example 1), A's distributive share of the credit for 1989 is also subject to section 469.

# Example 3.
(i) B, a single individual, acquires an interest in a partnership that, in 1988, rehabilitates a building and places it in service in a trade or business activity in which B does not materially participate. For 1988, B has the following items of gross income, deduction, and credit:
Gross income:
Income other than passive activity gross income
$110,000
Passive activity gross income
20,000
$130,000
Deductions:
Deductions other than passive activity deductions
23,950
Passive activity deductions
18,000
(41,950)
Taxable income
88,050
Credits:
Rehabilitation credit from the passive activity
8,000
(ii) For 1988, the amount by which B's passive activity gross income exceeds B's passive activity deductions (B's net passive income) is $2,000. Under paragraph (d) of this section, B's regular tax liability allocable to passive activities for 1988 is determined as follows:
(A) Taxable income
$88,050
(B) Regular tax liability
$24,578.50
(C) Taxable income minus net passive income
86,050
(D) Regular tax liability for taxable income of $86,050.00
23,918.50
(E) Regular tax liability allocable to passive activities ((B) minus (D))
$660.00
(iii) Under paragraph (a) of this section, B's passive activity credit for 1988 is the amount by which B's credits that are subject to section 469 for 1988 ($8,000) exceed B's regular tax liability allocable to passive activities for 1988 ($660.00). Accordingly, B's passive activity credit for 1988 is $7,340.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that, in 1988, B also has additional deductions of $100,000 from a trade or business activity in which B materially participates for 1988. Thus, B has a taxable loss for 1988 of $11,950, determined as follows:
Gross income:
Income other than passive activity gross income
$110,000
Passive activity gross income
20,000
$130,000
Deductions:
Deductions other than passive activity deductions
123,950
Passive activity deductions
18,000
(141,950)
Taxable income
(11,950)
(ii) Under section 26(b) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the regular tax liability for a taxable year cannot exceed the tax imposed by chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code for the taxable year. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, B's regular tax liability allocable to passive activities for 1988 is zero. Although B's net operating loss for the taxable year is reduced by B's net passive income, and B's regular tax liability for other taxable years may increase as a result of the reduction, such an increase does not change B's regular tax liability allocable to passive activities for 1988. Accordingly, B's passive activity credit for 1988 is $8,000.

§ 1.469-4
Definition of activity.
(a)
Scope and purpose.
This section sets forth the rules for grouping a taxpayer's trade or business activities and rental activities for purposes of applying the passive activity loss and credit limitation rules of section 469. A taxpayer's activities include those conducted through C corporations that are subject to section 469, S corporations, and partnerships.
(b)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section—
(1)
Trade or business activities. Trade or business activities
are activities, other than rental activities or activities that are treated under § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)(B) as incidental to an activity of holding property for investment, that—
(i) Involve the conduct of a trade or business (within the meaning of section 162);
(ii) Are conducted in anticipation of the commencement of a trade or business; or
(iii) Involve research or experimental expenditures that are deductible under section 174 (or would be deductible if the taxpayer adopted the method described in section 174(a)).
(2)
Rental activities. Rental activities
are activities that constitute rental activities within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3).
(c)
General rules for grouping activities
—(1)
Appropriate economic unit.
One or more trade or business activities or rental activities may be treated as a single activity if the activities constitute an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss for purposes of section 469.
(2)
Facts and circumstances test.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, whether activities constitute an appropriate economic unit and, therefore, may be treated as a single activity depends upon all the relevant facts and circumstances. A taxpayer may use any reasonable method of applying the relevant facts and circumstances in grouping activities. The factors listed below, not all of which are necessary for a taxpayer to treat more than one activity as a single activity, are given the greatest weight in determining whether activities constitute an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss for purposes of section 469—
(i) Similarities and differences in types of trades or businesses;
(ii) The extent of common control;
(iii) The extent of common ownership;
(iv) Geographical location; and
(v) Interdependencies between or among the activities (for example, the extent to which the activities purchase or sell goods between or among themselves, involve products or services that are normally provided together, have the same customers, have the same employees, or are accounted for with a single set of books and records).
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c).

# Example 1.
Taxpayer
C
has a significant ownership interest in a bakery and a movie theater at a shopping mall in Baltimore and in a bakery and a movie theater in Philadelphia. In this case, after taking into account all the relevant facts and circumstances, there may be more than one reasonable method for grouping
C
's activities. For instance, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances, the following groupings may or may not be permissible: a single activity; a movie theater activity and a bakery activity; a Baltimore activity and a Philadelphia activity; or four separate activities. Moreover, once
C
groups these activities into appropriate economic units, paragraph (e) of this section requires
C
to continue using that grouping in subsequent taxable years unless a material change in the facts and circumstances makes it clearly inappropriate.

# Example 2.
Taxpayer
B,
an individual, is a partner in a business that sells non-food items to grocery stores (partnership
L
).
B
also is a partner in a partnership that owns and operates a trucking business (partnership
Q
). The two partnerships are under common control. The predominant portion of
Q
's business is transporting goods for
L,
and
Q
is the only trucking business in which
B
is involved. Under this section,
B
appropriately treats
L
's wholesale activity and
Q
's trucking activity as a single activity.
(d)
Limitation on grouping certain activities.
The grouping of activities under this section is subject to the following limitations:
(1)
Grouping rental activities with other trade or business activities
—(i)
Rule.
A rental activity may not be grouped with a trade or business activity unless the activities being grouped together constitute an appropriate economic unit under paragraph (c) of this section and—
(A) The rental activity is insubstantial in relation to the trade or business activity;
(B) The trade or business activity is insubstantial in relation to the rental activity; or
(C) Each owner of the trade or business activity has the same proportionate ownership interest in the rental activity, in which case the portion of the rental activity that involves the rental of items of property for use in the trade or business activity may be grouped with the trade or business activity.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section:

# Example 1.
(i)
H
and
W
are married and file a joint return.
H
is the sole shareholder of an S corporation that conducts a grocery store trade or business activity.
W
is the sole shareholder of an S corporation that owns and rents out a building. Part of the building is rented to
H
's grocery store trade or business activity (the grocery store rental). The grocery store rental and the grocery store trade or business are not insubstantial in relation to each other.
(ii) Because they file a joint return,
H
and
W
are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of section 469. See § 1.469-1T(j). Therefore, the sole owner of the trade or business activity (taxpayer
H
-
W
) is also the sole owner of the rental activity. Consequently, each owner of the trade or business activity has the same proportionate ownership interest in the rental activity. Accordingly, the grocery store rental and the grocery store trade or business activity may be grouped together (under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) into a single trade or business activity, if the grouping is appropriate under paragraph (c) of this section.

# Example 2.
Attorney
D
is a sole practitioner in town
X. D
also wholly owns residential real estate in town
X
that
D
rents to third parties.
D
's law practice is a trade or business activity within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The residential real estate is a rental activity within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3) and is insubstantial in relation to
D
's law practice. Under the facts and circumstances, the law practice and the residential real estate do not constitute an appropriate economic unit under paragraph (c) of this section. Therefore,
D
may not treat the law practice and the residential real estate as a single activity.
(2)
Grouping real property rentals and personal property rentals prohibited.
An activity involving the rental of real property and an activity involving the rental of personal property (other than personal property provided in connection with the real property or real property provided in connection with the personal property) may not be treated as a single activity.
(3)
Certain activities of limited partners and limited entrepreneurs
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph, a taxpayer that owns an interest, as a limited partner or a limited entrepreneur (as defined in section 464(e)(2)), in an activity described in section 465(c)(1), may not group that activity with any other activity. A taxpayer
that owns an interest as a limited partner or a limited entrepreneur in an activity described in the preceding sentence may group that activity with another activity in the same type of business if the grouping is appropriate under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(3):

# Example.
(i) Taxpayer
A,
an individual, owns and operates a farm.
A
is also a member of
M,
a limited liability company that conducts a cattle-feeding business.
A
does not actively participate in the management of
M
(within the meaning of section 464(e)(2)(B)). In addition,
A
is a limited partner in
N,
a limited partnership engaged in oil and gas production.
(ii) Because
A
does not actively participate in the management of
M, A
is a limited entrepreneur in
M
's activity.
M
's cattle-feeding business is described in section 465(c)(1)(B) (relating to farming) and may not be grouped with any other activity that does not involve farming. Moreover,
A
's farm may not be grouped with the cattle-feeding activity unless the grouping constitutes an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss for purposes of section 469.
(iii) Because
A
is a limited partner in
N
and
N
's activity is described in section 465(c)(1)(D) (relating to exploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas resources),
A
may not group
N
's oil and gas activity with any other activity that does not involve exploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas resources. Thus,
N
's activity may not be grouped with
A
's farm or with
M
's cattle-feeding business.
(4)
Other activities identified by the Commissioner.
A taxpayer that owns an interest in an activity identified in guidance issued by the Commissioner as an activity covered by this paragraph (d)(4) may not group that activity with any other activity, except as provided in the guidance issued by the Commissioner.
(5)
Activities conducted through section 469 entities
—(i)
In general.
A C corporation subject to section 469, an S corporation, or a partnership (a section 469 entity) must group its activities under the rules of this section. Once the section 469 entity groups its activities, a shareholder or partner may group those activities with each other, with activities conducted directly by the shareholder or partner, and with activities conducted through other section 469 entities, in accordance with the rules of this section. A shareholder or partner may not treat activities grouped together by a section 469 entity as separate activities.
(ii)
Cross reference.
An activity that a taxpayer conducts through a C corporation subject to section 469 may be grouped with another activity of the taxpayer, but only for purposes of determining whether the taxpayer materially or significantly participates in the other activity. See § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)(A) and (c)(4)(i) for the rules regarding dividends on C corporation stock and compensation paid for personal services.
(6)
Activities described in section 163(d)(5)(A)(ii).
With respect to any taxpayer that is an individual, trust, estate, closely held C corporation or personal service corporation, an activity described in § 1.469-1T(e)(6) and subject to section 163(d)(5)(A)(ii) that involves the conduct of a trade or business which is not a passive activity of the taxpayer and with respect to which the taxpayer does not materially participate may not be grouped with any other activity or activities of the taxpayer, including any other activity described in § 1.469-1T(e)(6) and subject to section 163(d)(5)(A)(ii).
(e)
Disclosure and consistency requirements
—(1)
Original groupings.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and § 1.469-11, once a taxpayer has grouped activities under this section, the taxpayer may not regroup those activities in subsequent taxable years. Taxpayers must comply with disclosure requirements that the Commissioner may prescribe with respect to both their original groupings and the addition and disposition of specific activities within those chosen groupings in subsequent taxable years.
(2)
Regroupings.
If it is determined that a taxpayer's original grouping was clearly inappropriate or a material change in the facts and circumstances has occurred that makes the original grouping clearly inappropriate, the taxpayer must regroup the activities and must comply with disclosure requirements that the Commissioner may prescribe.
(f)
Grouping by Commissioner to prevent tax avoidance
—(1)
Rule.
The Commissioner may regroup a taxpayer's activities if any of the activities resulting from the taxpayer's grouping is not an appropriate economic unit and a principal purpose of the taxpayer's grouping (or failure to regroup under paragraph (e) of this section) is to circumvent the underlying purposes of section 469.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f):

# Example.
(i) Taxpayers
D, E, F, G,
and
H
are doctors who operate separate medical practices.
D
invested in a tax shelter several years ago that generates passive losses and the other doctors intend to invest in real estate that will generate passive losses. The taxpayers form a partnership to engage in the trade or business of acquiring and operating X-ray equipment. In exchange for equipment contributed to the partnership, the taxpayers receive limited partnership interests. The partnership is managed by a general partner selected by the taxpayers; the taxpayers do not materially participate in its operations. Substantially all of the partnership's services are provided to the taxpayers or their patients, roughly in proportion to the doctors' interests in the partnership. Fees for the partnership's services are set at a level equal to the amounts that would be charged if the partnership were dealing with the taxpayers at arm's length and are expected to assure the partnership a profit. The taxpayers treat the partnership's services as a separate activity from their medical practices and offset the income generated by the partnership against their passive losses.
(ii) For each of the taxpayers, the taxpayer's own medical practice and the services provided by the partnership constitute an appropriate economic unit, but the services provided by the partnership do not separately constitute an appropriate economic unit. Moreover, a principal purpose of treating the medical practices and the partnership's services as separate activities is to circumvent the underlying purposes of section 469. Accordingly, the Commissioner may require the taxpayers to treat their medical practices and their interests in the partnership as a single activity, regardless of whether the separate medical practices are conducted through C corporations subject to section 469, S corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships. The Commissioner may assert penalties under section 6662 against the taxpayers in appropriate circumstances.
(g)
Treatment of partial dispositions.
A taxpayer may, for the taxable year in which there is a disposition of substantially all of an activity, treat the part disposed of as a separate activity, but only if the taxpayer can establish with reasonable certainty—
(1) The amount of deductions and credits allocable to that part of the activity for the taxable year under § 1.469-1(f)(4) (relating to carryover of disallowed deductions and credits); and
(2) The amount of gross income and of any other deductions and credits allocable to that part of the activity for the taxable year.
(h)
Rules for grouping rental real estate activities for taxpayers qualifying under section 469(c)(7).
See § 1.469-9 for rules for certain rental real estate activities.
[T.D. 8565, 59 FR 50487, Oct. 4, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8645, 60 FR 66499, Dec. 22, 1995; T.D. 9943, 86 FR 5540, Jan. 19, 2021]
§ 1.469-4T
Definition of activity (temporary).
(a)
Overview
—(1)
Purpose and effect of overview.
This paragraph (a) contains a general description of the rules contained in this section and is intended solely as an aid to readers. The provisions of this paragraph (a) are not a substitute for the more detailed rules contained in the remainder of this section and cannot be relied upon in cases in which those rules qualify the general description contained in this paragraph (a).
(2)
Scope and structure of § 1.469-4T.
This section provides rules under which a taxpayer's business and rental operations are treated as one or more activities for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder. (See paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for the definition of business and rental operations.) In general, these rules are divided into three groups:
(i) Rules that identify the business and rental operations that constitute an undertaking (the undertaking rules).
(ii) Rules that identify the undertaking or undertakings that constitute an activity (the activity rules).
(iii) Rules that apply only under certain special circumstances (the special rules).
(3)
Undertaking rules
—(i)
In general.
The undertaking is generally the smallest unit that can constitute an
activity. (See paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the general rule and paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section for a special rule that permits taxpayers to treat a single rental real estate undertaking as multiple activities.) An undertaking may include diverse business and rental operations.
(ii)
Basic undertaking rule.
The basic undertaking rule identifies the business and rental operations that constitute an undertaking by reference to their location and ownership. Under this rule, business and rental operations that are conducted at the same location and are owned by the same person are generally treated as part of the same undertaking. Conversely, business and rental operations generally constitute separate undertakings to the extent that they are conducted at different locations or are not owned by the same person. (See paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.)
(iii)
Circumstances in which location is disregarded.
In some circumstances, the undertaking in which business and rental operations are included does not depend on the location at which the operations are conducted. Operations that are not conducted at any fixed place of business or that are conducted at the customer's place of business are treated as part of the undertaking with which the operations are most closely associated (see paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C) of this section). In addition, operations that are conducted at a location but do not relate to the production of property at that location or to the transaction of business with customers at that location are treated, in effect, as part of the undertaking or undertakings that the operations support (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section).
(iv)
Rental undertakings.
The basic undertaking rule is also modified if the undertaking determined under that rule includes both rental and nonrental operations. In such cases, the rental operations and the nonrental operations generally must be treated as separate undertakings (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section). This rule does not apply if more than 80 percent of the income of the undertaking determined under the basic rule is attributable to one class of operations (
i.e.,
rental or nonrental) or if the rental operations would not be treated as part of a rental activity because of the exceptions contained in § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii) (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section). In applying the rental undertaking rules, short-term rentals of real property (
e.g.,
hotel-room rentals) are generally treated as nonrental operations (see paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section).
(v)
Oil and gas wells.
Another exception to the basic undertaking rule treats oil and gas wells that are subject to the working-interest exception in § 1.469-1T(e)(4) as separate undertakings (see paragraph (e) of this section).
(4)
Activity rules
—(i)
In general.
The basic activity rule treats each undertaking in which a taxpayer owns an interest as a separate activity of the taxpayer (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section). In the case of trade or business undertakings, professional service undertakings, and rental real estate undertakings, additional rules may either require or permit the aggregation of two or more undertakings into a single activity.
(ii)
Aggregation of trade or business undertakings
—(A)
Trade or business undertakings.
Trade or business undertakings include all nonrental undertakings other than oil and gas undertakings described in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section and professional service undertakings described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section (see paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section).
(B)
Similar, commonly-controlled undertakings treated as a single activity.
An aggregation rule treats trade or business undertakings that are both similar and controlled by the same interests as part of the same activity. This rule is, however, generally inapplicable to small interests held by passive investors in such undertakings, except to the extent such interests are held through the same passthrough entity. (See paragraph (f)(2) of this section.) Undertakings are similar for purposes of this rule if more than half (by value) of their operations are in the same line of business (as defined in a revenue procedure issued pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section) or if the undertakings are vertically integrated (see paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section). All the facts and circumstances are taken into account in determining whether
undertakings are controlled by the same interests for purposes of the aggregation rule (see paragraph (j)(1) of this section). If, however, each member of a group of five or fewer persons owns a substantial interest in each of the undertakings, the undertakings may be rebuttably presumed to be controlled by the same interests (see paragraph (j) (2) and (3) of this section).
(C)
Integrated businesses treated as a single activity.
Trade or business undertakings (including undertakings that have been aggregated because of their similarity and common control) are subject to a second aggregation rule. Under this rule undertakings that constitute an integrated business and are controlled by the same interests must be treated as part of the same activity. (See paragraph (g) of this section.)
(iii)
Aggregation of professional service undertakings.
Professional service undertakings are nonrental undertakings that predominantly involve the provision of services in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting (see paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section). In general, professional service undertakings that are either similar, related, or controlled by the same interests must be treated as part of the same activity (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section). The rules for determining whether trade or business undertakings are controlled by the same interests also apply with respect to professional service undertakings. Professional service undertakings are similar, however, if more than 20 percent (by value) of their operations are in the same field, and two professional service undertakings are related if one of the undertakings derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from persons who are customers of the other undertaking (see paragraph (h)(3) of this section).
(iv)
Rules for rental real estate
—(A)
Taxpayers permitted to determine rental real estate activities.
The rules for aggregating rental real estate undertakings are generally elective. They permit taxpayers to treat any combination of rental real estate undertakings as a single activity. Taxpayers may also divide their rental real estate undertakings and then treat portions of the undertakings as separate activities or recombine the portions into activities that include parts of different undertakings. (See paragraph (k)(2) (i) and (iii) of this section.)
(B)
Limitations on fragmentation and aggregation of rental real estate.
Taxpayers may not fragment their rental real estate in a manner that is inconsistent with their treatment of such property in prior taxable years or with the treatment of such property by the passthrough entity through which it is held (see paragraph (k) (2)(ii) and (3) of this section). There are no comparable limitations on the aggregation of rental real estate into a single activity. If however, the income or gain from a rental real estate undertaking is subject to recharacterization under § 1.469-2T(f)(3) (relating to the rental of nondepreciable property), a coordination rule provides that the undertaking must be treated as a separate activity (see paragraph (k)(6) of this section.)
(v)
Election to treat nonrental undertakings as separate activities.
Another elective rule permits taxpayers to treat a nonrental undertaking as a separate activity even if the undertaking would be treated as part of a larger activity under the aggregation rules applicable to the undertaking (see paragraph (o)(2) of this section). This elective rule is limited by consistency requirements similar to those that apply to rental real estate operations (see paragraph (o) (3) and (4) of this section). Moreover, in cases in which a taxpayer elects to treat a nonrental undertaking as a separate activity, the taxpayer's level of participation (
i.e.,
material, significant, or otherwise) in the separate activity is the same as the taxpayer's level of participation in the larger activity in which the undertaking would be included but for the election (see paragraph (o)(6) of this section).
(5)
Special rules
—(i)
Consolidated groups and publicly traded partnerships.
Special rules apply to the business and rental operations of consolidated groups of corporations and publicly traded partnerships. Under these rules, a consolidated group is treated as one taxpayer in determining its activities and those of its members (see paragraph (m) of this section), and business
and rental operations owned through a publicly traded partnership cannot be aggregated with operations that are not owned through the partnership (see paragraph (n) of this section).
(ii)
Transitional rule.
A special rule applies for taxable years ending before August 10, 1989. In those years, taxpayers may organize business and rental operations into activities under any reasonable method (see paragraph (p)(1) of this section). A taxpayer will also be permitted to use any reasonable method to allocate disallowed deductions and credits among activities for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer's activities are determined under the general rules of § 1.469-4T (see paragraph (p)(3) of this section).
(b)
General rule and definitions of general application
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, each undertaking in which a taxpayer owns an interest shall be treated as a separate activity of the taxpayer. See paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section for rules requiring certain nonrental undertakings to be treated as part of the same activity and paragraph (k) of this section for rules identifying the rental real estate undertakings (or portions thereof) that are included in an activity.
(2)
Definitions of general application.
The following definitions set forth the meaning of certain terms for purposes of this section:
(i)
Passthrough entity.
The term “passthrough entity” means a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust.
(ii)
Business and rental operations
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the term “business and rental operations” means all endeavors that are engaged in for profit or the production of income and satisfy one or more of the following conditions for the taxable year:
(
1
) Such endeavors involve the conduct of a trade or business (within the meaning of section 162) or are conducted in anticipation of such endeavors becoming a trade or business;
(
2
) Such endeavors involve making tangible property available for use by customers; or
(
3
) Research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred with respect to such endeavors are deductible under section 174 (or would be deductible if the taxpayer adopted the method described in section 174(a)).
(B)
Operations conducted through nonpassthrough entities.
For purposes of applying section 469 and the regulations thereunder, a taxpayer's activities do not include operations that a taxpayer conducts through one or more entities (other than passthrough entities). The following example illustrates the operation of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B):

# Example.
(i) A, an individual, owns stock of X, a closely held corporation (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii) that is directly engaged in the conduct of a real estate development business. A participates in X's real estate development business, but does not own any interest in the business other than through ownership of the stock of X.
(ii) X is subject to section 469 (see § 1.469-1T(b)(5)) and does not hold the real estate development business through another entity. Accordingly, for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, the operations of X's real estate development business are treated as part of X's activities.
(iii) A is also subject to section 469 (see § 1.469-1T(b)(1)), but A's only interest in the real estate development business is held through X. X is a C corporation and therefore is not a passthrough entity. Thus, for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, A's activities do not include the operations of X's real estate development business. Accordingly, A's participation in X's busines is not participation in an activity of A, and is not taken into account in determining whether A materially participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) or significantly participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(c)(2)) in any activity. (See, however, § 1.469-1T(g)(3) for rules under which a shareholder's participation is taken into account for purposes of determining whether a corporation materially or significantly participates in an activity.
(c)
Undertaking
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d), (e), and (k)(2)(iii) of this section, business and rental operations that constitute a separate source of income production shall be treated as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings.
(2)
Operations treated as a separate source of income production
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in
this paragraph (c)(2), business and rental operations shall be treated for purposes of this paragraph (c) as a separate source of income production if and only if—
(A) Such operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section); and
(B) Income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) owned by such person are conducted at such location.
(ii)
Treatment of support operations
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder—
(
1
) The support operations conducted at a location shall not be treated as part of an undertaking under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and
(
2
) The income and expenses that are attributable to such operations and are reasonably allocable to an undertaking conducted at a different location shall be taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include such undertaking.
(B)
Support operations.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the business and rental operations conducted at a location are treated as support operations to the extent that—
(
1
) Such operations and an undertaking that is conducted at a different location are owned by the same person (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section);
(
2
) Such operations involve the provision of property or services to such undertaking; and
(
3
) Such operations are not income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section).
(iii)
Location.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)—
(A) The term “location” means, with respect to any business and rental operations, a fixed place of business at which such operations are regularly conducted;
(B) Business and rental operations are conducted at the same location if they are conducted in the same physical structure or within close proximity of one another;
(C) Business and rental operations that are not conducted at a fixed place of business or that are conducted on the customer's premises shall be treated as operations that are conducted at the location (other than the customer's premises) with which they are most closely associated;
(D) All the facts and circumstances (including, in particular, the factors listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) are taken into account in determining the location with which business and rental operations are most closely associated; and
(E) Oil and gas operations that are conducted for the development of a common reservoir are conducted within close proximity of one another.
(iv)
Income-producing operations.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the term “income-producing operations” means business and rental operations that are conducted at a location and relate to (or are conducted in reasonable anticipation of)—
(A) The production of property at such location;
(B) The sale of property to customers at such location;
(C) The performance of services for customers at such location;
(D) Transactions in which customers take physical possession at such location of property that is made available for their use; or
(E) Any other transactions that involve the presence of customers at such location.
(v)
Ownership by the same person.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), business and rental operations are owned by the same person if and only if one person (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(1)) is the direct owner of such operations.
(3)
Facts and circumstances determinations.
In determining whether a location is the location with which business and rental operations are most closely associated for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, the following relationships between operations that are conducted at such location and other operations are generally the most significant:
(i) The extent to which other persons conduct similar operations at one location;
(ii) Whether such operations are treated as a unit in the primary accounting records reflecting the results of such operations;
(iii) The extent to which other persons treat similar operations as a unit in the primary accounting records reflecting the results of such similar operations;
(iv) The extent to which such operations involve products or services that are commonly provided together;
(v) The extent to which such operations serve the same customers;
(vi) The extent to which the same personnel, facilities, or equipment are used to conduct such operations;
(vii) The extent to which such operations are conducted in coordination with or reliance upon each other;
(viii) The extent to which the conduct of any such operations is incidental to the conduct of the remainder of such operations;
(ix) The extent to which such operations depend on each other for their economic success; and
(x) Whether such operations are conducted under the same trade name.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c). In each example that does not state otherwise, the taxpayer is an individual and the facts, analysis, and conclusion relate to a single taxable year.

# Example 1.
The taxpayer is the sole owner of a department store and a restaurant and conducts both businesses in the same building. Thus, the department store and restaurant operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (
i.e.,
property is sold to customers and services are performed for customers on the premises of the department store). Accordingly, the department store and restaurant operations are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the taxpayer is also the sole owner of an automotive center that services automobiles and sells tires, batteries, motor oil, and accessories. The taxpayer operates the automotive center in a separate structure in the shopping mall in which the department store is located. Although the automotive center operations and the department store and restaurant operations are not conducted in the same physical structure, they are conducted within close proximity (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) of one another. Thus, the department store, restaurant, and automotive center operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section).
(ii) As in Example 1, the operations conducted at the same location are owned by the same person, and the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location. Accordingly, the department store, restaurant, and automotive center operations are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that the automotive center is located several blocks from the shopping mall. As in Example 1, the department store and restaurant operations are treating as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings. Because, however, the automotive center operations are not conducted within close proximity (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) of the department store and restaurant operations, all of the taxpayer's operations are not conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section).
(ii) All of the automotive center operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (
i.e.,
property is sold to customers and services are performed for customers on the premises of the automotive center). Accordingly, the automotive center operations are also treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See, however, paragraph (g) of this section for rules under which certain trade or business activities are treated as a single activity.

# Example 4.
The taxpayer is the sole owner of a building and rents residential, office, and retail space in the building to various tenants. The taxpayer manages these rental operations from an office located in the
building. The rental operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (
i.e.,
customers take physical possession in the building of property made available for their use). Accordingly, the rental operations are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See paragraph (d) of this section for rules for determining whether this undertaking is a rental undertaking and paragraph (k) of this section for rules for identifying rental real estate activities.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the taxpayer also uses the rental office in the building (“Building #1”) to manage rental operations in another building (“Building #2”) that the taxpayer owns. The rental operations conducted in Building #2 are treated as a separate source of income production under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (the “Building #2 undertaking”) under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(ii) The operations conducted at the rental office in Building #1 and the Building #2 undertaking are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the operations conducted at the rental office with respect to the Building #2 undertaking relate to transactions in which customers take physical possession at another location of property that is made available for their use (
i.e.,
the operations are not income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section)). Thus, to the extent the operations conducted at the rental office involve the management of the Building #2 undertaking, they are support operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) with respect to the Building #2 undertaking.
(iii) Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section provides that support operations are not treated as part of an undertaking under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Therefore, the support operations conducted at the rental office are not treated as part of the undertaking that consists of the rental operations conducted in Building #1 (the “Building #1 undertaking”). Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section provides that the income and expenses that are attributable to support operations and are reasonably allocable to an undertaking conducted at a different location shall be taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity that includes such undertaking. Accordingly, the income and expenses of the rental office that are reasonably allocable to the Building #2 undertaking are taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include the Building #2 undertaking. See paragraph (k) of this section for rules for identifying rental real estate activities.
(iv) Rental office operations that involve the management of rental operations conducted in Building #1 are not support operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) because they relate to an undertaking that is conducted at the same location (the “Building #1 undertaking”). Thus, the rules for support operations in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section do not apply to such operations, and they are treated as part of the Building #1 undertaking.

# Example 6.
(i) The taxpayer conducts business and rental operations at eleven different locations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section). At ten of the locations the taxpayer owns grocery stores, and at the eleventh location the taxpayer owns a warehouse that receives goods and supplies them to the taxpayer's stores. The operations of each store are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at each location (
i.e.,
property is sold to customers on the store premises, and customers take physical possession on the store premises of property made available for their use). Accordingly, the operations of each of the ten grocery stores are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section), and each store is treated as a single undertaking (a “grocery store undertaking”) that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). The operations conducted at the warehouse, however, do not include any income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section). Accordingly, the warehouse operations do not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and are not treated as a separate undertaking under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(ii) The warehouse operations and the grocery store undertakings are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations), the operations conducted at the warehouse involve the provision of property to the grocery store undertakings, and the warehouse operations are not income-producing operations (within the
meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section). Thus, the warehouse operations are support operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) with respect to the grocery store undertakings. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section provides that the income and expenses that are attributable to support operations and are reasonably allocable to an undertaking conducted at a different location shall be taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include such undertaking. Accordingly, the income and expenses of the warehouse operations that are reasonably allocable to a grocery store undertaking are taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include such undertaking. See paragraph (f) of this section for rules under which certain similar, commonly-controlled undertakings are treated as a single activity.

# Example 7.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that the warehouse operations also include the sale of goods to grocery stores that the taxpayer does not own (“other grocery stores”). Because of these sales, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the warehouse. The warehouse operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). Accordingly, prior to the application of the rules for support operations in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the warehouse operations are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking (the “separate warehouse undertaking”) that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(ii) As in Example 6, the warehouse operations that involve supplying goods to the taxpayer's grocery store undertakings are support operations with respect to those undertakings. Therefore, those operations are not treated as part of the separate warehouse undertaking (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section), and the income and expenses of such operations are taken into account, as in Example 6, in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include the taxpayer's grocery store undertakings.

# Example 8.
(i) A partnership is formed to acquire real property and construct a building on the property. The partnership hires brokers to locate a suitable parcel of land, lawyers to negotiate zoning variances, easements, and building permits, and architects and engineers to design the improvements. After the architects and engineers have designed the improvements and other preliminaries have been completed, the partnership hires a general contractor who hires subcontractors and oversees construction. During the construction process and after construction has been completed, the partnership leases out space in the building. The partnership then operates the building as a rental property. The operations of acquiring the real property, negotiating contracts, overseeing the designing and construction of the improvements, leasing up the building, and operating the building are conducted at an office (the “management office”) that is not at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) as the building.
(ii) The operations conducted at the building site (
e.g.,
excavating the land, pouring the concrete for the foundation, erecting the frame of the building, completing the exterior of the building, and building out the interior of the building) are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the partnership is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the partnership conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (
i.e.,
during the construction period property (the building) is produced at the building site, and during the rental period customers take physical possession in the building of property made available for their use). Accordingly, the operations conducted at the building site are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(iii) The operations conducted at the management office and the undertaking conducted at the building site are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the partnership is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the operations conducted at the management office relate to transactions in which customers take physical possession at another location of property that is made available for their use (
i.e.,
the operations are not income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section)). Thus, to the extent the operations conducted at the management office involve the provision of services to the undertaking conducted at the building site, they are support operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) with respect to such undertaking.
(iv) Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section provides that the income and expenses of support operations that are reasonably allocable to an undertaking conducted at a different location shall be taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity that includes such undertaking. Accordingly, the income and expenses of the
management office that are reasonably allocable to the undertaking conducted at the building site are taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include such undertaking.
(v) Until the building is first held out for rent and is in a state of readiness for rental, the undertaking conducted at the building site is a trade or business undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section). See paragraph (d) of this section for rules for determining whether the undertaking is a rental undertaking for periods after the building is first held out for rent and is in a state of readiness for rental and paragraph (k) of this section for rules for identifying rental real estate activities.

# Example 9.
The taxpayer owns 15 oil wells pursuant to a single working interest (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T (e)(4)(iv). All of the wells are drilled and operated for the development of a common reservoir. Thus, all of the wells are at the same location (see paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(E) of this section). All of the wells are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations), and the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (
i.e.,
oil wells are drilled in reasonable anticipation of producing oil at the location). Accordingly, the operations of the wells are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See paragraph (e) of this section for rules under which certain oil and gas operations are treated as multiple undertakings even if they would be part of the same undertaking under the rules of this paragraph (c).

# Example 10.
(i) Partnership X owns an automobile dealership and partnership Y owns an automobile repair shop. The dealership and repair shop operations are conducted in the same physical structure. Individuals A, B, and C are the only partners in partnerships X and Y, and each of the partners owns a one-third interest in both partnerships.
(ii) The dealership operations and the repair-shop operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section), but are owned by different persons (
i.e.,
X is the direct owner of the dealership operations, and Y is the direct owner of the repair-shop operations). Moreover, indirect ownership of the operations is not taken into account under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section. Thus, it is irrelevant that the two partnerships are owned by the same persons in identical proportions. Accordingly, the dealership and repair-shop operations are not treated as part of the same source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) or as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See, however, paragraph (g) of this section for rules under which certain trade or business activities are treated as a single activity.

# Example 11.
(i) The taxpayer owns and operates a delivery service. The business consists of a central office, retail establishments, and messengers who transport packages from one place to another. Customers may bring their packages to a retail establishment for delivery elsewhere or, by calling the central office, may have packages picked up at their homes or offices. The central office dispatches messengers and coordinates all pickups and deliveries. Customers may pay for deliveries when they drop off or pick up packages at a retail establishment, or the central office will bill the customer for services rendered. In addition, many packages are routed through the central office.
(ii) The operations conducted at the central office are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). The operations actually conducted at the central office, however, do not include any income-producting operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section).
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) (C) and (D) of this section, business and rental operations that are not conducted at a fixed place of business or that are conducted on the customer's premises are treated as operations that are conducted at the location (other than the customer's premises) with which they are most closely associated, and all the facts and circumstances are taken into account in determining the location with which business and rental operations are most closely associated. The facts and circumstances in this case (including the facts that the central office dispatches messengers, coordinates all pickups and deliveries, and is the transshipment point for many packages) establish that the operations of delivering packages from one location to another are most closely associated with the central office. Thus, the delivery operations are treated as operations that are conducted at the central office, and the deliveries are treated as income-producing operations (
i.e.,
the performance of services for customers) that the taxpayer conducts at the central office. Accordingly, the operations conducted at the central office are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(iv) The operations conducted at each retail establishment are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by
the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). At each retail establishment, the taxpayer's operations include transactions that involve the presence of customers at the establishment. Thus, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(E) of this section) at the retail establishments. Accordingly, the operations of each retail establishment are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See, however, paragraph (f) of this section for rules under which certain similar, commonly-controlled undertakings are treated as a single activity.

# Example 12.
(i) The taxpayer is the sole owner of a saw mill and a lumber yard. The taxpayer's business operations consist of converting timber into lumber and other wood products and selling the resulting products. The timber is processed at the saw mill, and the resulting products are transported to the lumber yard where they are sold. The saw mill and the lumber yard are at different locations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section). The transportation operations are managed at the saw mill.
(ii) The operations conducted at the saw mill are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (
i.e.,
lumber is produced at the mill). Similarly, the selling operations at the lumber yard are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (
i.e.,
the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (
i.e.,
lumber is sold to customers at the lumber yard). Thus, the milling operations and the selling operations are treated as separate sources of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as separate undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(iii) The operations conducted at the mill involve the provision of property to the lumber-yard undertaking. Nonetheless, the milling operations are income-producing operations because they relate to the production of property at the mill, and an undertaking's income-producing operations are not treated as support operations (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section). Accordingly, the milling operations are not support operations with respect to the lumber-yard undertaking. See, however, paragraph (f) of this section for rules under which certain vertically-integrated undertakings are treated as part of the same activity.
(iv) The operations of transporting finished products from the saw mill to the lumber yard are not conducted at a fixed location. Under paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) (C) and (D) of this section, business and rental operations that are not conducted at a fixed place of business or that are conducted on the customer's premises are treated as operations that are conducted at the location (other than the customer's premises) with which they are most closely associated, and all the facts and circumstances are taken into account in determining the location with which business and rental operations are most closely associated. The facts and circumstances in this case (including the fact that the transportation operations are managed at the saw mill) establish that the transportation operations are most closely associated with the saw mill. Thus, the transportation operations are treated as operations that are conducted at the mill and as part of the undertaking that consists of the milling operations.
(d)
Rental undertaking
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (d) applies to operations that are treated, under paragraph (c) of this section and before the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (a “paragraph (c) undertaking”). For purposes of this section—
(i) A paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations shall be treated, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, as two separate undertakings;
(ii) The income and expenses that are reasonably allocable to an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) shall be taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include such undertaking; and
(iii) An undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) shall be treated as a rental undertaking if and only if such undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)).
(2)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section shall not apply to a paragraph (c) undertaking for any taxable year in which—
(i) The rental operations of the paragraph (c) undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3));
(ii) Less than 20 percent of the gross income of the paragraph (c) undertaking is attributable to rental operations; or
(iii) Less than 20 percent of the gross income of the paragraph (c) undertaking is attributable to operations other than rental operations.
(3)
Rental operations.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations are determined under the following rules:
(i)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3) (ii) or (iii) of this section, a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations are all of the undertaking's business and rental operations that involve making tangible property available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith.
(ii)
Real property provided for short-term use.
A paragraph (c) undertaking's operations that involve making short-term real property available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith shall not be treated as rental operations if such operations, considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity. An item of property is treated as short-term real property for this purpose if and only if such item is real property that the paragraph (c) undertaking makes available for use by customers and the average period of customer use (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for all of the paragraph (c) undertaking's real property of the same type as such item is 30 days or less.
(iii)
Property made available to licensees.
A paragraph (c) undertaking's operations that involve making tangible property available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers shall not be treated as rental operations. (See § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(E).)
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d). In each example that does not state otherwise, the taxpayer is an individual and the facts, analysis, and conclusions relate to a single taxable year.

# Example 1.
(i) The taxpayer owns a building in which the taxpayer rents office space to tenants and operates a parking garage that is used by tenants and other persons. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) The taxpayer's tenants typically occupy an office for at least one year, and the services provided to tenants are those customarily provided in office buildings. Some persons (including tenants) rent spaces in the parking garage on a monthly or annual basis. In general, however, spaces are rented on an hourly or daily basis, and the average period for which all customers (including tenants) use the parking garage is less than 24 hours. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 75 percent of its gross income from office-space rentals and 25 percent of its gross income from the parking garage. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).
(ii) The parking spaces are real property and the average period of customer use (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for the parking spaces is 30 days or less. Thus, the parking spaces are short-term real properties (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section). (For this purpose, individual parking spaces that are rented on a monthly or annual basis are, nevertheless, short-term real properties because all the parking spaces are property of the same type, and the average rental period taking all parking spaces into account is 30 days or less.) In addition, the parking-garage operations involve making short-term real properties available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith.
(iii) Paragraph (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section provides, in effect, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's operations that involve making short-term real properties available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith are treated as rental operations if and only if the operations, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)). In this case, the parking-garage operations, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity because the average period of customer use for the parking spaces is seven days or less (see § 1.469-
1T(e)(3)(ii)(A)). Accordingly, the parking-garage operations are not treated as rental operations.
(iv) The paragraph (c) undertaking's remaining operations involve the provision of tangible property (the office spaces) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith. The average period of customer use for the office spaces exceeds 30 days. Thus, the office spaces are not short-term real properties, and the undertaking's operations involving the rental of office spaces are rental operations.
(v) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, at least 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to rental operations (the office-space operations) and at least 20 percent is attributable to operations other than rental operations (the parking-garage operations). Thus, the exceptions in paragraph (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section do not apply. In addition, the average period of customer use for the office spaces exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the rental of the office spaces is not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a rental activity). Thus, the rental operations, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity, and the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, the rental operations and the parking-garage operations are treated as two separate undertakings (the “office-space undertaking” and the “parking-garage undertaking”).
(vi) Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the office-space undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity (see (v) above), and the parking-garage undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity (see (iii) above). Accordingly, the office-space undertaking is treated as a rental undertaking, and the parking-garage undertaking is not.

# Example 2.
(i) The taxpayer owns a building in which the taxpayer rents apartments to tenants and operates a restaurant. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) The taxpayer's tenants typically occupy an apartment for at least one year, and the services provided to tenants are those customarily provided in residential apartment buildings. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 85 percent of its gross income from apartment rentals and 15 percent of its gross income from the restaurant. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).
(ii) The operations with respect to apartments (the “apartment operations”) involve the provision of tangible property (the apartments) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith. In addition, the apartments are not short-term real properties (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) because the average period of customer use (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for the apartments exceeds 30 days. Accordingly, the apartment operations are rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The restaurant operations do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Thus, the restaurant operations are not rental operations.
(iii) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, however, the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section applies because less than 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to operations other than rental operations (the restaurant operations). Accordingly, the rental operations and the restaurant operations are not treated as two separate undertakings under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
(iv) Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) includes both the apartment operations and the restaurant operations, and the gross income of this undertaking represents amounts paid principally for the use of tangible property (the apartments). Moreover, the average period of customer use for the apartments exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the rental of the apartments is not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a rental activity). Thus, the undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. Accordingly, the
undertaking is treated as a rental undertaking.

# Example 3.
(i) The taxpayer owns a building in which the taxpayer rents hotel rooms, meeting rooms, and parking spaces to customers, rents space to various retailers, and operates a restaurant and health club. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) Although some customers occupy hotel rooms for extended periods (including some customers who reside in the hotel), customers use hotel rooms for an average period of two days and meeting rooms for an average period of one day. The services provided to persons using the hotel rooms and meeting rooms are those customarily provided in hotels (including wake-up calls, valet services, and delivery of food and beverages to rooms). Some customers rent spaces in the parking garage on a monthly or annual basis. In general, however, parking spaces are rented on an hourly or daily basis, and the average period for which customers use the parking garage is less than 24 hours. Retail tenants typically occupy their space for at least one year, and the services provided to retail tenants are those customarily provided in commercial buildings. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 45 percent of its gross income from renting hotel rooms, meeting rooms, and parking spaces, 35 percent of its gross income from renting retail space, and 20 percent of its gross income from the restaurant and health club. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).
(ii) The parking spaces, hotel rooms, and meeting rooms are real property of three different types, but the average period of customer use (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T (e)(3)(iii)) for property of each type is 30 days or less. Thus, the parking spaces, hotel rooms, and meeting rooms are short-term real properties. (For this purpose, individual parking spaces or hotel rooms that are rented for extended periods are, nevertheless, short-term real properties if the average rental period for all parking spaces is 30 days or less and the average rental period for all hotel rooms is 30 days or less.) In addition, the parking garage operations, the operations with respect to hotel rooms (the “hotel-room operations”), and the operations with respect to meeting rooms (the “meeting-room operations”) involve making short-term real properties available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith.
(iii) Paragraph (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section provides, in effect, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's operations that involve making short-term real properties available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith are treated as rental operations if and only if the operations, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T (e)(3)). In this case the parking-garage, hotel-room and meeting-room operations, if considered as separate activities, would not constitute rental activities because the average period of customer use for parking spaces, hotel rooms, and meeting rooms does not exceed seven days (see § 1.469-1T (e)(3)(ii)(A)). Accordingly, the parking-garage, hotel-room, and meeting-room operations are not treated as rental operations.
(iv) The operations with respect to retail space in the building (the “retail-space operations”) involve the provision of tangible property (the retail spaces) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith. In addition, the retail spaces are not short-term real properties (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) because the average period of customer use (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T (e)(3)(iii)) for the retail spaces exceeds 30 days. Accordingly, the retail-space operations are rental operations.
(v) The health-club operations involve making tangible property available for use by customers, but the property is customarily made available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers. Accordingly, the health-club operations are not rental operations (see paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this seciton). The restaurant operations do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Accordingly, the restaurant operations also are not rental operations.
(vi) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, at least 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to rental operations (35 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is from the retail-space operations) and at least 20 percent is attributable to operations other than rental operations (45 percent from the hotel-room, meeting-room and parking-garage operations and 20 percent from the restaurant and health-club operations). Thus, the exceptions in paragraph (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section do not apply. In addition, the average period of customer use for the retail space exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T (e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the rental of the retail space is not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under § 1.469-1T (e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a
rental activity). Thus, the retail-space operations, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity, and the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, the retail-space operations are treated as an undertaking (the “retail-space undertaking”) and all the other operations conducted in the building (
i.e.,
renting hotel and meeting rooms and parking spaces and operating the restaurant and health club) are treated as a separate undertaking (the “hotel undertaking”).
(vii) Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the retail-space undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity (see (iv) above). Accordingly, the retail-space undertaking is treated as a rental undertaking. The hotel undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity because all tangible property provided for the use of customers in the hotel undertaking is either property for which the average period of customer use is seven days or less (see § 1.469-1T (e)(3)(ii)(A)) or property customarily made available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers (see § 1.469-1T (e)(3)(ii)(E)). Accordingly, the hotel undertaking is not treated as a rental undertaking.

# Example 4.
(i) A law partnership owns a ten-story building. The partnership uses eight floors of the building in its law practice and leases two floors to one or more tenants. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) Tenants typically occupy space on the two rented floors for at least one year, and the services provided to tenants are those customarily provided in office buildings. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 90 percent of its gross income from rendering legal services and 10 percent of its gross income from renting space. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T (e)(3)(vi)).
(ii) The operations with respect to the office space leased to tenants (the “office-space operations”) involve the provision of tangible property (the office space) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith. In addition, the office spaces are not short-term real properties (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) because the average period of customer use (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for the office space exceeds 30 days. Accordingly, the office-space operations are rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section).
(iii) The operations that involve the performance of legal services (the “law-practice operations”) do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Accordingly, the law-practice operations are not rental operations.
(iv) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, however, the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section applies because less than 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to rental operations (the office-space operations). Accordingly, the law-practice operations and the office-space operations are not treated as two separate undertakings under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
(v) Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) includes both the law-practice operations and the office-space operations, and the gross income of this undertaking does not represent amounts paid principally for the use of tangible property. Thus, the undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity. Accordingly, the undertaking is not treated as a rental undertaking.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the building is owned by a separate partnership (the “real estate partnership”), which leases eight floors of the building to the law partnership for use in its law practice and two floors to one or more other tenants. The law partnership and real estate partnership are owned by the same individuals in identical proportions.
(ii) The operations conducted in the building are owned by two different persons (
i.e.,
the law partnership and the real estate partnership). (See paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.) Thus, the operations conducted in the building are not treated as a single undertaking under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Instead, each partnership's share of such operations is treated as a separate paragraph (c) undertaking (the “law-practice undertaking” and the “office-space undertaking”).
(iii) Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of
this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the office-space undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity because all of the undertaking's gross income (including rents paid by the law partnership) represents amounts paid principally for the use of tangible property (the office space), the average period of customer use for the office space exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the rental of the office space is not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a rental activity). Accordingly, the office-space undertaking is treated as a rental undertaking. See, however, § 1.469-2T(f)(6) (relating to certain rentals of property to a trade or business activity in which the taxpayer materially participates).
(iv) The law-practice undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity because none of the undertaking's gross income represents amounts paid principally for the use of tangible property. Accordingly, the law-practice undertaking is not treated as a rental undertaking.

# Example 6.
(i) The taxpayer owns a building in which the taxpayer operates a nursing home and a medical clinic. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) The nursing-home operations consist of renting apartments in the nursing home to elderly and handicapped persons and providing medical care, meals, and social activities. (Assume that these services are extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)). The medical clinic provides medical care to nursing-home residents and other individuals. Nursing-home residents typically occupy an apartment for at least one year. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 55 percent of its gross income from nursing-home operations (including the provision of medical services to nursing-home residents) and 45 percent of its gross income from medical-clinic operations. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).
(ii) The paragraph (c) undertaking's nursing-home operations involve the provision of tangible property (the apartments) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith. In addition, the apartments are not short-term real properties (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) because the average period of customer use (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for the apartments exceeds 30 days. Accordingly, the nursing-home operations are rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The medical-clinic operations do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Thus, the medical-clinic operations are not rental operations.
(iii) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, however, the nursing-home operations, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity because extraordinary personal services are provided in connection with making nursing-home apartments available for use by customers (see § 1.469-T(e)(3)(ii)(C)). Thus, the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section applies, and the nursing-home operations and the medical-clinic operations are not treated as two separate undertakings under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
(iv) Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the nursing-home operations, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity (see (iii) above). Thus, an undertaking that includes no rental operations other than the nursing-home operations would not, if considered as a separate activity, constitute a rental activity. Accordingly, the undertaking is not treated as a rental undertaking.

# Example 7.
(i) The taxpayer rents and sells videocassettes. (Assumes that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the videocassette operations are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) Renters of videocassettes typically keep the videocassettes for one or two days, and do not receive any other property or services in connection with videocassette rentals. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 70 percent of its gross income from renting videocassettes and 30 percent of its gross income from selling videocassettes. The videocassette operations are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).
(ii) The rental of videocassettes involves the provision of tangible property (the videocassettes) for use by customers. In addition, the special rules for short-term real properties contained in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section do not apply in this case because the videocassettes are not real property. Thus, the operations that involve videocassette rentals are rental operations (within the
meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The sale of videocassettes does not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Thus, the operations that involve videocassette sales are not rental operations.
(iii) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, however, the rental operations, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity because the average period of customer use for rented videocassettes does not exceed seven days (see § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A)). Accordingly, the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section applies, and the videocassette-rental operations and videocassette-sales operations are not treated as two separate undertakings under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
(iv) Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the videocassette-rental operations, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity (see (iii) above). Thus, an undertaking that includes no rental operations other than the videocassette-rental operations would not, if considered as a separate activity, constitute a rental activity. Accordingly, the undertaking is not treated as a rental undertaking.

# Example 8.
(i) The taxpayer owns a building in which the taxpayer sells, leases, and services automobiles. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) The minimum lease term for any leased automobile is 31 days, and the services provided to lessees (including periodic oil changes, lubrication, and routine services and repairs) are those customarily provided in long-term automobile leases. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 75 percent of its gross income from selling automobiles, 15 percent of its gross income from servicing automobiles other than leased automobiles, and 10 percent of its gross income from leasing automobiles. The taxpayer's automobile operations are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).
(ii) The paragraph (c) undertaking's automobile-leasing operations involve the provision of tangible property (the automobiles) for use by customers and the provision of services in connection therewith. In addition, the special rules for short-term real properties contained in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section do not apply in this case because the automobiles are not real property. Accordingly, the automobile-leasing operations are rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The paragraph (c) undertaking's automobile-sales operations and servicing operations for automobiles other than leased automobiles (the “selling-and-servicing operations”) do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Thus, the selling-and-servicing operations are not rental operations.
(iii) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, however, the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section applies because less than 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to rental operations (the “automobile-leasing operations”). Accordingly, the rental operations and the selling-and-servicing operations are not treated as two separate undertakings under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
(iv) Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) includes both the selling-and-servicing operations and the automobile-leasing operations, and the gross income of the undertaking does not represent amounts paid principally for the use of tangible property. Thus, the undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity. Accordingly, the undertaking is not treated as a rental undertaking.

# Example 9.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 8, except that the paragraph (c) undertaking derives 60 percent of its gross income from selling automobiles, 15 percent of its gross income from servicing automobiles other than leased automobiles, and 25 percent of its gross income from leasing automobiles.
(ii) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, more than 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to rental operations (the automobile-leasing operations), and more than 20 percent is attributable to operations other than rental operations (the selling-
and-servicing operations). Thus, the exceptions in paragraph (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section do not apply. In addition, the average period of customer use for leased automobiles exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the leasing of the automobiles is not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a rental activity). Thus, the leasing operations, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity, and the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, the rental operations and the selling-and-servicing operations are treated as two separate undertakings (the “automobile-leasing undertaking” and the “automobile selling-and-servicing undertaking”).
(iii) Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the automobile-leasing undertaking would, if considered as a separate activity, constitute a rental activity, and the automobile selling-and-servicing undertaking would not, if considered as a separate activity, constitute a rental activity (see Example 8 and (ii) above). Accordingly, the automobile-leasing undertaking is treated as a rental undertaking, and the automobile selling-and-servicing undertaking is not.
(e)
Special rules for certain oil and gas operations
—(1)
Wells treated as nonpassive under § 1.469-1T(e)(4)(i).
An oil or gas well shall be treated as an undertaking that is separate from other undertakings in determining the activities of a taxpayer for a taxable year if the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) The well is drilled or operated pursuant to a working interest (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(4)(iv)) and at any time during such taxable year the taxpayer holds such working interest either—
(A) Directly; or
(B) Through an entity that does not limit the liability of the taxpayer with respect to the drilling or operation of such well pursuant to such working interest; and
(ii) The taxpayer would not be treated as materially participating (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) for the taxable year in the activity in which such well would be included if the taxpayer's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (e).
(2)
Business and rental operations that constitute an undertaking.
In any case in which an oil or gas well is treated under this paragraph (e) as an undertaking that is separate from other undertakings, the business and rental operations that constitute such undertaking are the business and rental operations that are attributable to such well.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e). In each example, the taxpayer is an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year.

# Example 1.
During 1989, A directly owns an undivided interest in a working interest (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(4)(iv)) in two oil wells. A does not participate in the activity in which the wells would be included if A's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (e). Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, each well is treated as a separate undertaking in determining A's activities for 1989 because A holds the working interest directly and would not be treated as materially participating for 1989 in the activity in which the wells would be included if A's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (e). The aggregation rules in paragraph (f) of this section do not apply to these undertakings (see paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section). Thus, each of the undertakings is treated as a separate activity under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The result is the same even if A has net income from one or both wells for 1989 and even if the wells would otherwise be treated as part of the same undertaking under paragraph (c) of this section. The result would also be the same if A held the working interest through an entity, such as a general partnership, that does not limit A's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of the wells pursuant to the working interest.

# Example 2.
(i) During 1989, B is a general partner in a partnership that owns a working interest (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(4)(iv)) in an oil well. B does not own any interest in the well other than through the partnership. At the end of 1989, however, B's partnership interest is converted into a limited partnership interest, and during 1990 B holds the working interest only as a limited partner. B does not participate in the activity in which the well would be included if B's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (e).
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the well is treated as a separate undertaking in determining B's activities for 1989 because B holds the working interest during 1989
through an entity that does not limit B's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of the well pursuant to the working interest, and B would not be treated as materially participating for 1989 in the activity in which the well would be included if B's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (e). Throughout 1990, however, B's liability with respect to the drilling and operation of the well is limited by the entity through which B holds the working interest (
i.e.,
the limited partnership). Accordingly, paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply to the well in 1990, and the well may be included under paragraph (c) of this section in an undertaking that includes other operations.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that B's partnership interest is converted into a limited partnership interest at the end of November 1989. An oil or gas well may be treated as a separate undertaking under paragraph (e)(1) of this section if at any time during the taxable year the taxpayer holds a working interest in the well directly or through an entity that does not limit the taxpayer's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of the well pursuant to the working interest (see § 1.469-1T(e)(4)(i)). Thus, although B's liability with respect to the drilling and operation of the well is limited during December 1989, the result in both 1989 and 1990 is the same as in Example 2. In 1989, however, disqualified deductions and a ratable portion of the gross income from the well may be treated under § 1.469-1T(e)(4)(ii) as passive activity deductions and passive activity gross income, respectively.
(f)
Certain trade or business undertakings treated as part of the same activity
—(1)
Applicability
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (f) applies to a taxpayer's interests in trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section).
(ii)
Trade or business undertaking.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the term “trade or business undertaking” means any undertaking in which a taxpayer has an interest, other than—
(A) A rental undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section);
(B) An oil or gas well treated as an undertaking that is separate from other undertakings under paragraph (e) of this section; or
(C) A professional service undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (h) of this section).
(2)
Treatment as part of the same activity.
A taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business undertakings that are similar (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section) and controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section) shall be treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer for any taxable year in which the taxpayer—
(i) Owns interests in each such undertaking through the same passthrough entity;
(ii) Owns a direct or substantial indirect interest (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3) of this section) in each such undertaking; or
(iii) Materially or significantly participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) in the activity that would result if such undertakings were treated as part of the same activity.
(3)
Substantial indirect interest
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), a taxpayer owns a substantial indirect interest in an undertaking for a taxable year if at any time during such taxable year the taxpayer's ownership percentage (determined in accordance with paragraph (j)(3) of this section) in a passthrough entity that directly owns such undertaking exceeds ten percent.
(ii)
Coordination rule.
A taxpayer shall be treated for purposes of this paragraph (f) as owning a substantial indirect interest in each of two or more undertakings for any taxable year in which—
(A) Such undertakings are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section; and
(B) The taxpayer owns a substantial indirect interest (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section) in any such undertaking.
(4)
Similar undertakings
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, two undertakings are similar for purposes of this paragraph (f) if and only if—
(A) There are predominant operations in each such undertaking; and
(B) The predominant operations of both undertakings are in the same line of business.
(ii)
Predominant operations.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, there are predominant operations in an undertaking if more than
50 percent of the undertaking's gross income is attributable to operations in a single line of business.
(iii)
Vertically-integrated undertakings.
If an undertaking (the “supplier undertaking”) provides property or services to other undertakings (the “recipient undertakings”), the following rules apply for purposes of this paragraph (f):
(A)
Supplier undertaking similar to recipient undertaking.
If the supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property and services to a recipient undertaking that is controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section), the supplier undertaking shall be treated as similar to the recipient undertaking. For purposes of applying the preceding sentence—
(
1
) If a supplier undertaking and two or more recipient undertakings that are similar (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section) are controlled by the same interests, such recipient undertakings shall be treated as a single undertaking; and
(
2
) A supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property and services to a recipient undertaking for any taxable year in which such recipient undertaking obtains more than 50 percent (by value) of all property and services provided by the supplier undertaking.
(B)
Recipient undertaking similar to supplier undertaking.
If the supplier undertaking is the predominant provider of property and services to a recipient undertaking that is controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section), the recipient undertaking shall be treated, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C) of this section, as similar to the supplier undertaking. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a supplier undertaking is the predominant provider of property and services to a recipient undertaking for any taxable year in which the supplier undertaking provides more than 50 percent (by value) of all property and services obtained by the recipient undertaking.
(C)
Coordination rules.
(
1
) Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section does not apply if, under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section—
(
i
) The supplier undertaking is treated as an undertaking that is similar to any recipient undertaking;
(
ii
) The recipient undertaking is treated as a supplier undertaking that is similar to another recipient undertaking; or
(
iii
) Another supplier undertaking is treated as an undertaking that is similar to the recipient undertaking.
(
2
) If paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to a supplier undertaking, the supplier undertaking shall be treated as similar to undertakings that are similar to the recipient undertaking and shall not otherwise be treated as similar to undertakings to which the supplier undertaking would be similar without regard to paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section.
(
3
) If paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section applies to a recipient undertaking, the recipient undertaking shall be treated as similar to undertakings that are similar to the supplier undertaking and shall not otherwise be treated as similar to undertakings to which the recipient undertaking would be similar without regard to paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section.
(iv)
Lines of business.
The Commissioner shall establish, by revenue procedure, lines of business for purposes of this paragraph (f)(4). Business and rental operations that are not included in the lines of business established by the Commissioner shall nonetheless be included in a line of business for purposes of this paragraph (f)(4). Such operations shall be included in a single line of business or in multiple lines of business on a basis that reasonably reflects—
(A) Similarities and differences in the property or services provided pursuant to such operations and in the markets to which such property or services are offered; and
(B) The treatment within the lines of business established by the Commissioner of operations that are comparable in their similarities and differences.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f). In each example that does not state otherwise, the taxpayer is an individual and the facts, analysis, and
conclusions relate to a single taxable year.

# Example 1.
(i) The taxpayer is a partner in partnerships A, B, C, and D and owns a five-percent interest in each partnership. Each partnership owns a single undertaking (undertakings A, B, C, and D), and the undertakings are trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section) that are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section). In addition, undertakings A, B, and D are similar (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section). The taxpayer is not related to any of the other partners, and does not participate in any of the undertakings.
(ii) In general, each undertaking in which a taxpayer owns an interest is treated as a single activity that is separate from other activities of the taxpayer (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section). This paragraph (f) provides aggregation rules for trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests. These aggregation rules do not apply, however, unless the taxpayer owns interests in the undertakings through the same passthrough entity, owns direct or substantial indirect interests in the undertakings, or materially or significantly participates in the undertakings. In this case, the taxpayer does not satisfy any of these conditions, and the aggregation rules in this paragraph (f) do not apply. Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to an aggregation rule for integrated businesses), undertakings A, B, C, and D are treated as separate activities of the taxpayer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the taxpayer owns a 25-percent interest in partnership A, a 15-percent interest in partnership B, and a 40-percent interest in partnership C.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section provides that trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer if the taxpayer owns a direct or substantial indirect interest in each such undertaking. In this case, the taxpayer owns more than ten percent of partnerships A, B, and C, and these partnerships directly own undertakings A, B, and C. Thus, the taxpayer owns a substantial indirect interest in undertakings A, B, and C (see paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section). Of these undertakings, only undertakings A and B are both similar and controlled by the same interests. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in undertakings A and B are treated as part of the same activity. As in Example 1, the aggregation rules in this paragraph (f) do not apply to undertakings C and D, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this section, undertakings C and D are treated as separate activities.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the taxpayer participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(f)) for 60 hours in undertaking A and for 60 hours in undertaking B.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section provides that trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer if the taxpayer materially or significantly participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) in the activity that would result from the treatment of similar, commonly-controlled undertakings as part of the same activity. In this case, the activity that would result from treating the similar, commonly-controlled undertakings as part of the same activity consists of undertakings A, B, and D, and the taxpayer participates for 120 hours in the activity that results from this treatment. Accordingly, undertakings A, B, and D are treated as part of the same activity because the taxpayer significantly participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(c)(2)) in the activity that results from this treatment. The result is the same whether the taxpayer participates in one, two, or all three of the similar, commonly-controlled undertakings, so long as the taxpayer's aggregate participation in undertakings A, B, and D exceeds 100 hours. As in Example 1, the aggregation rules in this paragraph (f) do not apply to undertaking C, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this section, undertaking C is treated as a separate activity.

# Example 4.
(i) The taxpayer owns a 5-percent interest in partnership A. Partnership A owns interests in partnerships B and C, each of which owns a single undertaking (undertakings B and C). In addition, the taxpayer is a partner in partnerships C and D and directly owns a 15-percent interest in each partnership. Partnership D also owns a single undertaking (undertaking D). Undertakings B, C, and D are trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section) that are similar (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section) and controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section). The taxpayer does not participate in undertaking B, C, or D.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section provides that trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer if the taxpayer owns interests in the undertakings through the same passthrough entity. In this case, the taxpayer owns interests in undertakings B and C through partnership A. Thus, the taxpayer's interests in undertakings B and C are treated as part of the same activity.
(iii) Paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section provides that trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer if the taxpayer owns a direct or substantial indirect interest in each such undertaking. In this case, the taxpayer owns more than ten percent of partnerships C and D, and these partnerships directly own undertakings C and D. Thus, the taxpayer owns a substantial indirect interest in undertakings C and D (see paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section).
(iv) The coordination rule in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section applies to undertakings B and C because they are treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, and the taxpayer owns a substantial indirect interest in undertaking C. Under the coordination rule, the taxpayer is treated as owning a substantial indirect interest in undertaking B as well as undertaking C. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in undertakings B, C, and D are treated as part of the same activity.

# Example 5.
(i) Undertakings A, B, C, and D are trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section), each of which involves the operation of a department store, restaurants, and movie theaters. The following table shows, for each undertaking, the percentages of gross income attributable to the various operations of the undertaking.
Department store
Restaurants
Movie Theaters
Undertaking A
70%
20%
10%
Undertaking B
60%
20%
20%
Undertaking C
35%
35%
30%
Undertaking D
35%

55%
(ii) Paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section provides that two undertakings are similar for purposes of this paragraph (f) if and only if there are predominant operations in each undertaking and the predominant operations of the two undertakings are in the same line of business. (Assume that the applicable revenue procedure provides that “general merchandise stores,” “eating and drinking places,” and “motion picture services” are three separate lines of business.)
(iii) Undertaking A and undertaking B each derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from department-store operations, which are in the general-merchandise-store line of business. Thus, there are predominant operations in undertaking A and undertaking B, and the predominant operations of the two undertakings are in the same line of business. Accordingly, undertakings A and B are similar.
(iv) Undertaking C does not derive more than 50 percent of its gross income from operations in any single line of business. Thus, there are no predominant operations in undertaking C, and undertaking C is not similar to any of the other undertakings.
(v) Undertaking D derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from movie-theater operations, which are in the motion-picture-services line of business. Thus, there are predominant operations in undertaking D. The predominant operations of undertaking D, however, are not in the same line of business as those of undertakings A and B. Accordingly, undertaking D is not similar to undertakings A and B.

# Example 6.
(i) Undertakings A and B are trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section) that derive all of their gross income from the sale of automobiles. Undertakings C and D derive all of their gross income from the rental of automobiles. Undertaking C is not a rental undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section) because the average period of customer use (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for its automobiles does not exceed seven days (see § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A)). Undertaking D, on the other hand, leases automobiles for periods of one year or more and is a rental undertaking.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section provides that two undertakings are similar for purposes of this paragraph (f) if and only if there are predominant operations in each undertaking and the predominant operations of the two undertakings are in the same line of business. (Assume that the applicable revenue procedure provides that (a) “automotive dealers and service stations” (automotive retail) and (b) “auto repair, services (including rentals), and parking” (automotive services) are two separate lines of business.)
(iii) Undertakings A and B both derive more than 50 percent of their gross income from operations in the automotive-retail line of business (the automobile-sales operations). Similarly, undertakings C and D both derive more than 50 percent of their gross income from operations in the automotive-services line of business (the automobile-rental operations). Thus, there are predominant operations in each undertaking, the predominant operations of undertakings A and B are in the same line of business, and the predominant operations of undertakings C and D are in the same line of business. Accordingly, undertakings A and B are similar, undertakings C and D are similar, and undertakings A and B are not similar to undertakings C and D.
(iv) Paragraph (f)(1) of this section provides that this paragraph (f) applies only to trade or business undertakings and that a rental undertaking is not a trade or business undertaking. Accordingly, this paragraph (f) does not apply to undertaking D, and undertakings C and D, although similar, are not
treated, under this paragraph (f), as part of the same activity.

# Example 7.
(i) Undertakings A, B, and C are trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section) that involve real estate operations. Undertaking A derives all of its gross income from the development of real property, undertaking B derives all of its gross income from the management of real property and the performance of services as a leasing agent with respect to real property, and undertaking C derives all of its gross income from buying, selling, or arranging purchases and sales of real property. Undertaking D derives all of its gross income from the rental of residential apartments and is a rental undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section).
(ii) Paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section provides that two undertakings are similar for purposes of this paragraph (f) if there are predominant operations in each undertaking and the predominant operations of the two undertakings are in the same line of business. (Assume that the applicable revenue procedure provides that real estate development and services (including the development and management of real property, dealing in real property, and the performance of services as a leasing agent with respect to real property) is a single line of business (the “real-estate” line of business).)
(iii) Undertakings A, B, and C all derive more than 50 percent of their gross income from operations in the real-estate line of business. Thus, there are predominant operations in undertakings A, B, and C, and the predominant operations of the three undertakings are in the same line of business. Accordingly, undertakings A, B, and C are similar.
(iv) Undertaking D also derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from operations in the real-estate line of business. Thus, there are predominant operations in undertaking D, and the predominant operations of undertaking D are in the same line of business as those of undertakings A, B, and C. Paragraph (f)(1) of this section provides, however, that this paragraph (f) applies only to trade or business undertakings and that a rental undertaking is not a trade or business undertaking. Accordingly, this paragraph (f) does not apply to undertaking D, and undertaking D, although similar to undertakings A, B, and C, is not treated, under this paragraph (f), as part an activity that includes undertaking A, B, or C.

# Example 8.
(i) Undertakings A and B are trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section), both of which involve the provision of moving services. Undertaking A derives its gross income principally from local moves, and undertaking B derives its gross income principally from long-distance moves.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section provides that two undertakings are similar for purposes of this paragraph (f) if there are predominant operations in each undertaking and the predominant operations of the two undertakings are in the same line of business. Under paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section, operations that are not in the lines of business established by the applicable revenue procedure are nonetheless included in a line of business. In addition, such operations are included in a single line of business or in multiple lines of business on a basis that reasonably reflects (a) similarities and differences in the property or services provided pursuant to such operations and in the markets to which such property or services are offered, and (b) the treatment within the lines of business established by the Commissioner of operations that are comparable in their similarities and differences. (Assume that the provision of moving services is not in any line of business established by the Commissioner and that within the lines of business established by the Commissioner services that differ only in the distance over which they are performed (
e.g.,
local and long-distance telephone services) are generally treated as part of the same line of business.)
(iii) Undertakings A and B provide the same types of services to similar customers, and the only significant difference in the services provided is the distance over which they are performed. Thus, treating local and long-distance moving services as a single line of business (the “moving-services” line of business) reasonably reflects the treatment within the lines of business established by the Commissioner of operations that are comparable in their similarities and differences.
(iv) Each undertaking derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from operations in the moving-services line of business. Thus, there are predominant operations in each undertaking, and the predominant operations of the two undertakings are in the same line of business. Accordingly, undertakings A and B are similar.

# Example 9.
(i) Undertakings A, B, C, D, and E are trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section) and are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section). Undertakings A, B, and C derive all of their gross income from retail sales of dairy products, and undertakings D and E derive all of their gross income from the processing of dairy products. Undertakings D and E sell less than ten percent of their dairy products to undertakings A, B, and C, and sell the remainder to unrelated
undertakings. Undertakings A, B, and C purchase less than ten percent of their inventory from undertakings D and E and purchase the remainder from unrelated undertakings.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section provides that, except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, undertakings are similar for purposes of this paragraph (f) if and only if there are predominant operations in each undertaking and the predominant operations of the undertakings are in the same line of business. (Assume that the applicable revenue procedure provides that (a) “food stores” and (b) “manufacturing—food and kindred products” are two separate lines of business.)
(iii) Undertakings A, B, and C all derive more than 50 percent of their gross income from operations in the food-store line of business (the dairy-sales operations). Thus, there are predominant operations in undertakings A, B, and C, and the predominant operations of the three undertakings are in the same line of business. Accordingly, undertakings A, B, and C are similar.
(iv) Undertakings D and E both derive more than 50 percent of their gross income from operations in the food-manufacturing line of business (the dairy-processing operations). Thus, there are predominant operations in undertakings D and E, and the predominant operations of the two undertakings are in the same line of business. Accordingly, undertakings D and E are similar. The predominant operations of undertakings D and E are not in the same line of business as those of undertakings A, B, and C. Accordingly, undertakings D and E are not similar to undertakings A, B, and C.
(v) Paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section provides rules under which certain undertakings whose operations are not in the same line of business nevertheless are similar to one another if one of the undertakings (the “supplier undertaking”) provides property or services to the other undertaking (the “recipient undertaking”), and the undertakings are controlled by the same interests. These rules apply, however, only if the supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property and services to the recipient undertaking (see paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section), or the supplier undertaking is the predominant provider of property and services to the recipient undertaking (see paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section). In this case, undertakings D and E are supplier undertakings, and undertakings A, B, and C are recipient undertakings. Undertakings D and E, however, sell less than ten percent of their dairy products to undertakings A, B, and C and thus do not predominantly involve the provision of property and services to recipient undertakings. Similarly, undertakings D and E are not the predominant providers of property and services to undertakings A, B, and C. Thus, the rules for vertically-integrated undertakings in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section do not apply in this case.

# Example 10.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 9, except that undertaking D sells 75 percent of its dairy products to undertakings A, B, and C.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies if a supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property to a recipient undertaking that is controlled by the same interests. Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section provides that a supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property to a recipient undertaking if the supplier undertaking provides more than 50 percent of its property to such recipient undertaking. In addition, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section provides that if a supplier undertaking and two or more similar recipient undertakings are controlled by the same interests, the recipient undertakings are treated as a single undertaking for purposes of applying paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. Undertakings D and E both provide dairy products to undertakings A, B, and C. Thus, for purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, undertakings D and E are supplier undertakings and undertakings A, B, and C are recipient undertakings. Undertaking D predominantly involves the provision of property to undertakings A, B, and C. Moreover, undertakings A, B, and C are treated as a single undertaking under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section because undertakings A, B, and C are similar to one another under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, and undertakings A, B, C, and D are controlled by the same interests. Accordingly, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to undertakings A, B, C, and D.
(iii) If paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to supplier and recipient undertakings, the supplier undertaking is treated under paragraph (f)(4)(iii) (A) and (C)(
2
) of this section as an undertaking that is similar to the recipient undertakings and to undertakings to which the recipient undertakings are similar. Accordingly, undertaking D is similar, for purposes of this paragraph (f), to undertakings A, B, and C.
(iv) Undertaking E does not predominantly involve the provision of property to undertakings A, B, and C, or to any other related undertakings. Thus, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section does not apply to undertaking E, and undertaking E is not similar to undertakings A, B, and C. Moreover, undertakings D and E are not similar because, under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section, undertaking D is not similar to any undertaking that is not similar to undertakings A, B, and C.

# Example 11.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 10, except that 75 percent of undertaking D's dairy products are sold to undertakings A and B, and none are sold to undertaking C.
(ii) In this case, undertaking D is a supplier undertaking only with respect to undertakings A and B. Accordingly, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) applies only to undertakings A, B, and D. As in Example 10, undertaking D is similar to undertakings A and B, and is not similar to undertaking E. In addition, if paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to supplier and recipient undertakings, the supplier undertaking is treated under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section as an undertaking that is similar to the recipient undertakings and undertakings to which the recipient undertakings are similar. Accordingly, even though undertaking D does not provide any property or services to undertaking C, undertaking D is similar to undertaking C because undertaking C is similar to undertakings A and B.

# Example 12.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 9, except that undertakings A and B purchase 80 percent of their inventory from undertaking D.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section applies, except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C) of this section, if a supplier undertaking is the predominant provider of property to a recipient undertaking that is controlled by the same interests. Undertakings D and E both provide dairy products to undertakings A, B, and C. Thus, for purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, undertakings D and E are supplier undertakings, and undertakings A, B, and C are recipient undertakings. In addition, undertaking D is the predominant provider of property and services to undertakings A and B, and undertakings A, B and D are controlled by the same interests. Thus, except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C) of this section, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section applies to undertakings A, B, and D.
(iii) The coordination rules in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section provide that paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section does not apply in certain cases to which paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies. These coordination rules would apply if undertaking D or E (or any other undertaking that is controlled by the interests that control undertakings A, B, and C) predominantly involved the provision of property and services to undertakings A, B, and C. The coordination rules in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section would also apply if undertaking A, B, or D predominantly involved the provision of property or services to a recipient undertaking that is controlled by the same interests. Assume that these coordination rules do not apply in this case.
(iv) If paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section applies to supplier and recipient undertakings, the recipient undertakings are treated under paragraph (f)(4)(iii) (B) and (C)(
3
) of this section as undertakings that are similar to the supplier undertaking and to undertakings to which the supplier undertaking is similar. Accordingly, undertakings A and B are similar, for purposes of this paragraph (f), to undertaking D and, because undertakings D and E are similar, to undertaking E.
(v) The principal providers of property and services to undertaking C are unrelated undertakings. Thus, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section does not apply to undertaking C, and undertaking C is not similar to undertakings D and E. Moreover, undertaking C is not similar to undertakings A and B because, under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C)(
3
) of this section, undertakings A and B are not similar to any undertaking that is not similar to undertaking D.

# Example 13.
(i) Undertakings A through Z are trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section) and are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section). Undertaking A derives all of its gross income from the manufacture and sale of men's and women's clothing, undertaking B derives all of its gross income from sales of men's and women's clothing to retail stores, and undertakings C through Z derive all of their gross income from retail sales of men's and women's clothing. Undertaking A sells clothing exclusively to undertaking B. Undertaking B sells 75 percent of its clothing to undertakings C through Z, and sells the remainder to unrelated retail stores. Undertaking B purchases 80 percent of its inventory from undertaking A, and undertakings C through Z purchase 60 to 90 percent of their inventory from undertaking B.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies if a supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property to a recipient undertaking that is controlled by the same interests. In addition, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section provides that if a supplier undertaking and two or more similar recipient undertakings are controlled by the same interests, the recipient undertaking are treated as a single undertaking for this purpose. Undertaking B provides men's and women's clothing to undertaking C through Z. Thus, for purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, undertaking B is a supplier undertaking and undertakings C through Z are recipient undertakings. In addition, undertaking B predominantly involves the provision of property to undertakings C through Z, and undertakings C through Z are treated as a single undertaking for purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, paragraph
(f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to undertakings B and C through Z.
(iii) If paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to supplier and recipient undertakings, the supplier undertaking is treated under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section as an undertaking that is similar to the recipient undertakings. Accordingly, undertaking B is similar, for purposes of this paragraph (f), to undertakings C through Z.
(iv) Undertaking A provides men's and women's clothing to undertaking B. Thus, for purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, undertaking A is a supplier undertaking and undertaking B is a recipient undertaking. In addition, undertaking A predominantly involves the provision of property to undertaking B, and undertakings A and B are controlled by the same interests. Accordingly, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to undertakings A and B, and undertaking A is similar to undertaking B.
(v) If paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to supplier and recipient undertakings, the supplier undertaking is treated under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section as an undertaking that is similar to undertakings to which the recipient undertakings are similar. Accordingly, undertaking A is also similar, for purposes of this paragraph (f), to undertakings C through Z.
(vi) The coordination rule in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section provides that paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section does not apply if, as described above, the supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property to recipient undertakings and is treated under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section as an undertaking that is similar to such recipient undertakings. Accordingly, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section does not apply to undertakings B through Z, even though undertaking B is the predominant provider of property and services to undertakings C through Z, and undertakings B through Z are controlled by the same interests. For the same reason, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section does not apply to undertaking A and B. (Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section is also inapplicable to undertakings A and B because the coordination rule in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C)(
1

(g)
Integrated businesses
—(1)
Applicability
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (g) applies to a taxpayer's interests in trade or business activities (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section).
(ii)
Trade or business activity.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term “trade or business activity” means any activity (determined without regard to this paragraph (g)) that consists of interests in one or more trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section).
(2)
Treatment as a single activity.
A taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business activities shall be treated as a single activity if and only if—
(i) The operations of such trade or business activities constitute a single integrated business, activities constitute a single integrated business; and
(ii) Such activities are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section).
(3)
Facts and circumstances test.
In determining whether the operations of two or more trade or business activities constitute a single integrated business for purposes of this paragraph (g), all the facts and circumstances are taken into account, and the following factors are generally the most significant:
(i) Whether such operations are conducted at the same location;
(ii) The extent to which other persons conduct similar operations at one location;
(iii) Whether such operations are treated as a unit in the primary accounting records reflecting the results of such operations;
(iv) The extent to which other persons treat similar operations as a unit in the primary accounting records reflecting the results of such similar operations;
(v) Whether such operations are owned by the same person (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section);
(vi) The extent to which such operations involve products or services that are commonly provided together;
(vii) The extent to which such operations serve the same customers;
(viii) The extent to which the same personnel, facilities, or equipment are used to conduct such operations;
(ix) The extent to which such operations are conducted in coordination with or reliance upon each other;
(x) The extent to which the conduct of any such operations is incidental to the conduct of the remainder of such operations;
(xi) The extent to which such operations depend on each other for their economic success; and
(xii) Whether such operations are conducted under the same trade name.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (g). The facts, analysis, and conclusion in each example relate to a single taxable year, and the trade or business activities described in each example are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section).

# Example 1.
(i) The taxpayer owns a number of department stores and auto-supply stores. Some of the taxpayer's department stores include auto-supply departments. In other cases, the taxpayer operates a department store and an auto-supply store at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section), or at different locations from which the same group of customers can be served. In cases in which a department store and an auto-supply store are operated at the same location, the department-store operations are the predominant operations (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section), and the undertaking that includes the stores is treated as a department-store undertaking for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the department-store undertakings are all treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer (the “department-store activity”). Similarly, the auto-supply undertakings (
i.e.,
the auto-supply stores that are not operated at a department-store location) are all treated as part of the same activity (the “auto-supply activity”). (Assume that department-store undertakings and auto-supply undertakings are not similar and are not treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (f) of this section.)
(ii) The department stores and auto-supply stores use a common trade name and coordinate their marketing activities (
e.g.,
the stores advertise in the same catalog and the same newspaper supplements, honor the same credit cards (including credit cards issued by the department stores), and jointly conduct sales and other promotional activities). Although sales personnel generally work only in a particular store or in a particular department within a store, other employees (
e.g.,
cashiers, janitorial and maintenance workers, and clerical staff) may work in or perform services for various stores, including both department and auto-supply stores. In addition, the management of store operations is organized on a geographical basis, and managers above the level of the individual store generally supervise operations in both types of store. A central office provides payroll, financial, and other support services to all stores and establishes pricing and other business policies. Most inventory for both types of stores is acquired through a central purchasing department and inventory for all stores in an area is stored in a common warehouse.
(iii) Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, the operations of the department-store activity and the auto-supply activity constitute an integrated business. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section provides that the factors relevant to this determination include the conduct of department-store and auto-supply operations at the same location, the location of department and auto-supply stores at sites where the same group of customers can be served, the treatment of all such operations as a unit in the taxpayer's financial statements, the taxpayer's ownership and the common management of all such operations, the use of the same personnel, facilities, and equipment to conduct and support the operations, the use of a common trade name, and the coordination (as evidenced by the coordinated marketing activities) of department-store and auto-supply operations.
(iv) Paragraph (g)(2) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business activities (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section) are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer if the operations of such activities constitute an integrated business and the activities are controlled by the same interests. The department-store activity and the auto-supply activity consist of trade or business undertakings and, thus, are trade or business activities. In addition, the activities are controlled by the same interests (the taxpayer), and the operations of the activities constitute an integrated business. Accordingly, the department-store activity and the auto-supply activity are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer.

# Example 2.
(i) The taxpayer owns a number of stores that sell stereo equipment and a repair shop that services stereo equipment. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the stores are all treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer (the “store activity”). The repair shop does not sell stereo equipment, does not predominantly involve the provision of services to the taxpayer's stores, and is treated as a separate activity (the “repair-shop activity”). (Assume that stereo-sales undertakings and stereo-repair undertakings are not similar and are not treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (f) of this section.)
(ii) The stores sell stereo equipment produced by manufacturers for which the stores are an authorized distributor. The repair shop's operations principally involve the servicing of stereo equipment produced by the same manufacturers. These operations include repairs on equipment under warranty for which reimbursement is received from the manufacturer and reconditioning of equipment taken as trade-ins by the taxpayer's stores. The majority of the operations, however, involve repairs that are performed for customers and are not covered by a warranty. The taxpayer's distribution agreements with manufacturers generally require the taxpayer to repair and service equipment produced by the manufacturer both during and after the warranty period. In some cases, the distribution agreements require that the taxpayer's repair facility meet the manufacturer's standards and provide for periodic inspections to ensure that these standards are met.
(iii) The stores and the repair shop use a common trade name. Sales personnel generally work only in a particular store and stereo technicians work only in the repair shop. The stores and the repair shop are, however, managed from a central office, which supervises both store and repair-shop operations, provides payroll, financial, and other support services to the stores and the repair shop, and establishes pricing and other business policies. In addition, inventory for the stores and supplies for the repair shop are acquired through a central purchasing department and are stored in a single warehouse.
(iv) Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, the operations of the store activity and the repair-shop activity constitute an integrated business. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section provides that the factors relevant to this determination include the treatment of all such operations as a unit in the taxpayer's financial statements, the taxpayer's ownership and the common management of all such operations, the use of the same personnel and facilities to support the operations, the use of a common trade name, the extent to which the same customers patronize both the stores and the repair shop, the similarity of the products (
i.e.
, stereo equipment) involved in both store and repair-shop operations, and the extent to which the provision of repair services contributes to the taxpayer's ability to obtain the stereo equipment sold in store operations.
(v) Paragraph (g)(2) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business activities (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section) are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer if the operations of such activities constitute an integrated business and the activities are controlled by the same interests. The store activity and repair-shop activity consist of trade or business undertakings and thus are trade or business activities. In addition, the activities are controlled by the same interests (the taxpayer), and the operations of the activities constitute an integrated business. Accordingly, the store activity and the repair-shop activity are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer.

# Example 3.
(i) The taxpayer owns interests in three partnerships. One partnership owns a television station, the second owns a professional sports franchise, and the third owns a motion-picture production company. The operations of the partnerships are treated as three separate undertakings. Although other persons own interests in the partnerships, all three undertakings are controlled (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section) by the taxpayer. The operations of the partnerships are treated as three separate activities (the “television activity,” the “sports activity,” and the “motion-picture activity”). (Assume that the undertakings are not similar and are not treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (f) of this section.)
(ii) Each partnership prepares financial statements that reflect only the results of that partnership's operations, and each of the activities is conducted under its own trade name. The taxpayer participates extensively in the management of each partnership and makes the major business decisions for all three partnerships. Each partnership, however, employs separate management and other personnel who conduct its operations on a day-to-day basis. The taxpayer generally arranges the partnerships' financing and often obtains loans for two, or all three, partnerships from the same source. Although the assets of one partnership are not used as security for loans to another partnership, the taxpayer's interest in a partnership may secure loans to the other partnerships. The television station broadcasts the sports franchise's games, and the motion-picture production company occasionally prepares programming for the television station. In addition, support staff of one partnership may, during periods of peak activity or in the case of emergency, be made available to another partnership on a temporary basis. There are no other significant transactions between the partnerships. Moreover, all transactions between the partnerships involve essentially the same terms as would be provided in transactions between unrelated persons.
(iii) Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, the television activity, the sports activity, and the motion-picture activity constitute three separate businesses. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section provides that the factors relevant to this determination include the treatment of the activities as separate units in the partnerships' financial statements, the use of a different trade name
for each activity, the separate day-to-day management of the activities, and the limited extent to which the activities contribute to or depend on each other (as evidenced by the small number of significant transactions between the partnerships and the arm's length nature of those transactions). The taxpayer's participation in management and financing are taken into account in this determination, as are the transactions between the partnerships, but these factors do not of themselves support a determination that the activities constitute an integrated business.
(iv) Paragraph (g)(2) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business activities (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section) are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer only if the operations of such activities constitute an integrated business and the activities are controlled by the same interests. In this case, the taxpayer's activities do not constitute an integrated business, and the aggregation rule in paragraph (g)(2) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, the television activity, the sports activity, and the motion-picture activity are treated as three separate activities of the taxpayer.
(h)
Certain professional service undertakings treated as a single activity
—(1)
Applicability
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (h) applies to a taxpayer's interests in professional service undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section).
(ii)
Professional service undertaking.
For purposes of this paragraph (h), an undertaking is treated as a professional service undertaking for any taxable year in which the undertaking derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from the provision of services that are treated, for purposes of section 448 (d)(2)(A) and the regulations thereunder, as services performed in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting.
(2)
Treatment as a single activity
—(i)
Undertakings controlled by the same interest.
A taxpayer's interests in two or more professional service undertakings that are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section) shall be treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer.
(ii)
Undertakings involving significant similar or significant related services.
A taxpayer's interests in two or more professional service undertakings that involve the provision of significant similar services or significant related services shall be treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer.
(iii)
Coordination rule.
(A) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, a taxpayer's interests in two or more undertakings (the “original undertakings”) that are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer under the provisions of paragraph (h)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section shall be treated as interests in a single professional service undertaking (the “aggregated undertaking”) for purposes of reapplying such provisions.
(B) If any original undertaking included in an aggregated undertaking and any other undertaking that is not included in such aggregated undertaking involve the provision of significant similar or related services, the aggregated undertaking and such other undertaking shall be treated as undertakings that involve the provision of significant similar or related services for purposes of reapplying the provisions of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Significant similar or significant related services.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)—
(i) Services (other than consulting services) in any field described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section are similar to all other services in the same field;
(ii) All the facts and circumstances are taken into account in determining whether consulting services are similar;
(iii) Two professional service undertakings involve the provision of significant similar services if and only if—
(A) Each such undertaking provides significant professional services; and
(B) Significant professional services provided by one such undertaking are similar to significant professional services provided by the other such undertaking;
(iv) Services are significant professional services if and only if such services are in a field described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section and more than 20 percent of the undertaking's gross income is attributable to services
in such field (or, in the case of consulting services, to similar services in such field); and
(v) Two professional service undertakings involve the provision of significant related services if and only if more than 20 percent of the gross income of one such undertaking is derived from customers that are also customers of the other such undertaking.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h). In each example that does not state otherwise, the taxpayer is an individual, and the facts, analysis, and conclusions relate to a single taxable year.

# Example 1.
(i) The taxpayer is a partner in a law partnership that has offices in various cities. Some of the partnership's offices provide a full range of legal services. Other offices, however, specialize in a particular area or areas of the law (
e.g.,
litigation, tax law, corporate law, etc.). In either case, substantially all of the office's gross income is derived from the provision of legal services. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each of the law partnership's offices is treated as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (a “law-office undertaking”).
(ii) Each law-office undertaking derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from the provision of services in the field law. Thus, each such undertaking is treated as a professional service undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section).
(iii) Each law-office undertaking derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from services in the field of law. Thus, each such undertaking involves significant professional services (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section) in the field of law. In addition, all services in the field of law are treated as similar services under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section. Thus, the law-office undertakings involve the provision of significant similar services (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section).
(iv) Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interest in professional service undertakings that involve the provision of significant similar services are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in the law-office undertakings are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section even if the undertakings are not controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section).

# Example 2.
(i) The taxpayer is a partner in medical partnerships A and B. Both partnerships derive all of their gross income from the provision of medical services, but partnership A specializes in internal medicine and partnership B operates a radiology laboratory. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the medical-service business of each partnership is treated as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (a “medical-service undertaking”). Partnerships A and B are not controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section).
(ii) Each partnership's medical-service undertaking derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from the provision of services in the field of health. Thus, each partnership's medical-service undertaking is treated as a professional service undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section).
(iii) Each partnership's medical-service undertaking derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from services in the field of health. Thus, each such undertaking involves significant professional services (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section) in the field of health. In addition, all services in the field of health are treated as similar services under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section. Thus, the medical-services undertakings of partnerships A and B involve the provision of significant similar services (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section).
(iv) Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in professional service undertakings that involve the provision of significant similar services are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in the medical-service undertakings of partnerships A and B are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section even though the undertakings are not controlled by the same interests.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that the taxpayer withdraws from partnership A in 1989 and becomes a partner in partnership B in 1990. In addition, the taxpayer was a full-time participant in the operations of partnership A from 1970 through 1989, but does not participate in the operations of partnership B.
(ii) Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in professional service undertakings that involve the provision of significant similar services are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer. This rule is not limited to cases in which the taxpayer holds such interests simultaneously. Thus, as in Example 2, the taxpayer's interests in the medical-service undertakings of partnerships A and B are
treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer.
(iii) The activity that includes the taxpayer's interests in the medical-service undertakings of partnerships A and B is a personal service activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(d)) because it involves the performance of personal services in the field of health. In addition, the taxpayer materially participated in the activity for three or more taxable years preceding 1990 (see § 1.469-5T(j)(1)). Thus, even if the taxpayer does not work in the activity after 1989, the taxpayer is treated, under § 1.469-5T(a)(6), as materially participating in the activity for 1990 and subsequent taxable years.

# Example 4.
(i) The taxpayer is a partner in an accounting partnership that has offices in various cities (partnership A) and in a management-consulting partnership that has a single office (partnership B). Each of partnership A's offices derives substantially all of its gross income from services in the field of accounting, and partnership B derives substantially all of its gross income from services in the field of consulting. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, partnership B's consulting business is treated as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (the “consulting undertaking”) and each of partnership A's offices is similarly treated (the “accounting undertakings”). The accounting undertakings are controlled by the same interests, but partnerships A and B are not controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section). Partnership B's consulting business derives 50 percent of its gross income from customers of partnership A's accounting undertakings, but does not derive more than 20 percent of its gross income from the customers of any single accounting undertaking.
(ii) Each accounting undertaking derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from the provision of services in the field of accounting, and the consulting undertaking derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from the provision of services in the field of consulting. Thus, each accounting undertaking is treated as a professional service undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section), and the consulting undertaking is also treated as a professional service undertaking.
(iii) Each accounting undertaking derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from services in the field of accounting. Thus, each such undertaking involves significant professional services (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section) in the field of accounting. In addition, all services in the field of accounting are treated as similar services under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section. Thus, the accounting undertakings involve the provision of significant similar services (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section).
(iv) Paragraph (h)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in professional service undertakings that are controlled by the same interests or that involve the provision of significant similar services are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer. The accounting undertakings are controlled by the same interests (see (i) above) and involve the provision of significant similar services (see (iii) above). Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in the accounting undertakings are treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (h)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(v) The consulting undertaking derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from services in the field of consulting. If, based on all the facts and circumstances, these services are determined to be similar consulting services under paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section, the consulting undertaking involves significant professional services (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section). In this case, however, the consulting undertaking and the accounting undertakings do not involve the provision of significant similar services (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section) because consulting services and accounting services are not treated as similar services under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section.
(vi) The consulting undertaking does not derive more than 20 percent of its gross income from the customers of any single accounting undertaking of partnership A. If, however, partnership A's accounting undertakings are aggregated, the consulting undertaking derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from customers of the aggregated undertakings. Paragraph (h)(3)(v) of this section provides that two professional service undertakings involve the provision of significant related services if more than 20 percent of the gross income of one undertaking is derived from customers of the other undertaking. For purposes of applying this rule, partnership A's accounting undertakings are treated as a single undertaking under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section because the accounting undertakings are treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. Thus, the consulting undertaking and the accounting undertakings involve the provision of significant related services.
(vii) Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in professional service undertakings that involve the provision of significant related services are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in the consulting undertaking and the accounting undertakings are treated as
part of the same activity of the taxpayer under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that partnership B's consulting business derives only 15 percent of its gross income from customers of partnership A's accounting undertakings.
(ii) As in Example 4, the taxpayer's interests in the accounting undertakings are treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section and are treated under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section as a single undertaking for purposes of reapplying those provisions. In this case, however, the consulting undertaking does not derive more than 20 percent of its gross income from the customers of partnership A's accounting undertakings. Thus, the consulting undertaking and the accounting undertakings do not involve the provision of significant related services. Accordingly, the accounting undertakings and the consulting undertaking are not treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (h)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section because they are not controlled by the same interests and do not involve the provision of significant similar or related services.

# Example 6.
(i) The taxpayer is a partner in partnerships A, B, and C. Partnership A derives substantially all of its gross income from the provision of engineering services, partnership B derives substantially all of its gross income from the provision of architectural services, and partnership C derives 40 percent of its gross income from the provision of engineering services and the remainder from the provision of architectural services. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each partnership's service business is treated as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings. Partnerships A, B, and C are not controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section).
(ii) Each partnership's undertaking derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from the provision of services in the fields of architecture and engineering. Thus, each such undertaking is treated as a professional service undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section).
(iii) Partnership A's undertaking (“undertaking A”) derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from services in the field of engineering, partnership B's undertaking (“undertaking B”) derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from services in the field of architecture, and partnership C's undertaking (“undertaking C”) derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from services in the field of engineering and more than 20 percent of its gross income from services in the field of architecture. Thus, undertaking A involves significant services in the field of engineering, undertaking B involves significant services in the field of architecture, and undertaking C involves significant services in both fields. Under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, all services within each field are treated as similar services, but engineering services and architectural services are not treated as similar services. Thus, undertakings A and C, and undertakings B and C, involve the provision of significant similar services (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section).
(iv) Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in professional service undertakings that involve the provision of significant similar services are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in undertakings A and C are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer.
(v) Under paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, undertakings A and C are also treated as a single undertaking for purposes of determining whether undertaking B involves the provision of significant similar services. Paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section in effect provides that treating undertakings A and C as a single undertaking does not affect the conclusion that the architectural services provided by undertakings B and C are significant similar services. Thus, undertaking B and the single undertaking in which undertakings A and C are included under paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section involve the provision of significant similar services, and the taxpayer's interests in undertakings A, B, and C are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Control by the same interests and ownership percentage
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, all the facts and circumstances are taken into account in determining, for purposes of this section, whether undertakings are controlled by the same interests. For this purpose, control includes any kind of control, direct or indirect, whether legally enforceable, and however exercisable or exercised. It is the reality of control that is determinative, and not its form or mode of exercise.
(2)
Presumption
—(i)
In general.
Undertakings are rebuttably presumed to be controlled by the same interests if such undertakings are part of the same common-ownership group.
(ii)
Common-ownership group.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, two or more undertakings of a taxpayer are part of the same common-ownership group for purposes of this paragraph (j)(2) if and only if the
sum of the common-ownership percentages of any five or fewer persons (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(1), but not including passthrough entities) with respect to such undertakings exceeds 50 percent. For this purpose, the common-ownership percentage of a person with respect to such undertakings is the person's smallest ownership percentage (determined in accordance with paragraph (j)(3) of this section) in any such undertaking.
(iii)
Special aggregation rule.
If, without regard to this paragraph (j)(2)(iii), an undertaking of a taxpayer is part of two or more common-ownership groups, any undertakings of the taxpayer that are part of any such common-ownership group shall be treated for purposes of this paragraph (j)(2) as part of a single common-ownership group in determining the activities of such taxpayer.
(3)
Ownership percentage
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a person's ownership percentage in an undertaking or in a passthrough entity shall include any interest in such undertaking or passthrough entity that the person holds directly and the person's share of any interest in such undertaking or passthrough entity that is held through one or more passthrough entities.
(ii)
Passthrough entities.
The following rules apply for purposes of applying paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section:
(A) A partner's interest in a partnership and share of any interest in a passthrough entity or undertaking held through a partnership shall be determined on the basis of the greater of such partner's percentage interest in the capital (by value) of such partnership or such partner's largest distributive share of any item of income or gain (disregarding guaranteed payments under section 707(c)) of such partnership.
(B) A shareholder's interest in an S corporation and share of any interest in a passthrough entity or undertaking held through an S corporation shall be determined on the basis of such shareholder's stock ownership.
(C) A beneficiary's interest in a trust or estate and share of any interest in a passthrough entity or undertaking held through a trust or estate shall not be taken into account.
(iii)
Attribution rules
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, a person's ownership percentage in a passthrough entity or in an undertaking shall be determined by treating such person as the owner of any interest that a person related to such person owns (determined without regard to this paragraph (j)(3)(iii)) in such passthrough entity or in such undertaking.
(B)
Determination of common-ownership percentage.
The common-ownership percentage of five or fewer persons with respect to two or more undertakings shall be determined, in any case in which, after the application of paragraph (j)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, two or more such persons own the same interest in any such undertaking (the “related-party owners”) by treating as the only owner of such interest (or portion thereof) the related-party owner whose ownership of such interest (or a portion thereof) would result in the highest common-ownership percentage.
(C)
Related person.
A person is related to another person for purposes of this paragraph (j)(3)(iii) if the relationship of such persons is described in section 267(b) or 707(b)(1).
(4)
Special rule for trade or business activities.
In determining whether two or more trade or business activities are controlled by the same interests for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, each such activity shall be treated as a separate undertaking in applying this paragraph (j).
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (j):

# Example 1.
(i) Partnership X is the sole owner of an undertaking (undertaking X), and partnership Y is the sole owner of another undertaking (undertaking Y). Individuals A, B, C, D, and E are the only partners in partnerships X and Y, and the partnership agreements of both X and Y provide that no action may be taken or decision made on behalf of the partnership without the unanimous consent of the partners. Moreover, each partner actually participates in, and agrees to, all major decisions that affect the operations of either partnership. The ownership percentages (within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3) of this section) of A, B, C, D,
and E in each partnership (and in the undertaking owned by the partnership) are as follows:
Partner
Partnership/Undertaking
X (percent)
Y (percent)
A
15
5
B
10
60
C
10
20
D
77
12
E
8
20
120
117
The sum of the ownership percentages exceeds 100 percent for both X and Y because, under paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, each partner's ownership percentage is determined on the basis of the greater of the partner's percentage interest in the capital of the partnership or the partner's largest distributive share of any item of income or gain of the partnership.
(ii) Paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a person's common-ownership percentage with respect to any two or more undertakings is the person's smallest ownership percentage in any such undertaking. Thus, the common-ownership percentages of A, B, C, D, and E with respect to undertakings X and Y are as follows:
Partner
Common-ownership percentage
A
5
B
10
C
10
D
12
E
8
45
(iii) Paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section provides that undertakings are rebuttably presumed to be controlled by the same interests if the undertakings are part of the same common-ownership group. In general, undertakings are part of a common-ownership group only if the sum of the common-ownership percentages of any five or fewer persons with respect to such undertakings exceeds 50 percent. In this case, the sum of the partners' common-ownership percentages with respect to undertakings X and Y is only 45 percent. Thus, undertakings X and Y are not part of the same common-ownership group.
(iv) If the presumption in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section does not apply, all the facts and circumstances are taken into account in determining whether undertakings are controlled by the same interests (see paragraph (j)(1) of this section). In this case, all actions and decisions in both undertakings require the unanimous consent of the same persons and each of those persons actually participates in, and agrees to, all major decisions. Accordingly, undertakings X and Y are controlled by the same interests (
i.e.,
A, B, C, D, and E).

# Example 2.
(i) Partnerships W, X, Y, and Z are each the sole owner of an undertaking (undertakings W, X, Y, and Z). Individuals A, B, and C are partners in each of the four partnerships, and the remaining interests in each partnership are owned by a number of unrelated individuals, none of whom owns more than a one-percent interest in any of the partnerships. The ownership percentages (within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3) of this section) of A, B, and C in each partnership (and in the undertaking owned by the partnership) are as follows:
Partnership/Undertaking
Partner
A
B
C
W
23%
21%
40%
X
19%
30%
22%
Y
25%
25%
20%
Z
8%
4%
2%
(ii) Paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a person's common-ownership percentage with respect to any two or more undertakings is the person's smallest ownership percentage in any such undertaking. Thus, the common-ownership percentages of A, B, and C in undertakings W, X, Y, and Z are as follows:
Partner
Common-ownership percentage
A
8
B
4
C
2
14
(iii) The sum of the common-ownership percentages of A, B, and C with respect to undertakings W, X, Y, and Z is 14 percent, and no other person owns more than a one-percent interest in any of the undertakings. Thus, the sum of the common-ownership percentages of any five or fewer persons with respect to all four undertakings cannot exceed 50 percent. Accordingly, undertakings W, X, Y, and Z are not part of the same common-ownership group (see paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section) and are not rebuttably presumed to be controlled by the same interests (see paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section).
(iv) The common-ownership percentages of A, B, and C in undertakings W, X, and Y are as follows:
Partner
Common ownership percentage
A
19
B
21
C
20
60
(v) The sum of the common-ownership percentages of A, B, and C, taking into account only undertakings W, X, and Y, is 60 percent. Because the sum of the common-ownership percentages exceeds 50 percent, undertakings W, X, and Y are part of the same common-ownership group (see paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section and are rebuttably presumed to be controlled by the same interests (see paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section).

# Example 3.
(i) Corporation X, an S corporation, is the sole owner of an undertaking (undertaking X), and corporation Y, another S corporation, is the sole owner of another undertaking (undertaking Y). Individuals A, B, and C are shareholders in corporations X and Y. Both A and B are related (within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3)(iii)(C) of this section) to C, but not to each other. A, B, and C are not related to any other person that owns an interest in either corporation X or corporation Y. The ownership percentages (determined without regard to the attribution rules of paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section) of A, B, and C in each corporation (and in the undertaking owned by the corporation) are as follows:
Corporation/Undertaking
Shareholder
X (percent)
Y (percent)
A
20
B
20
C
5
5
(ii) In general, a person's ownership percentage is determined by treating the person as the owner of interests that are actually owned by related persons (see paragraph (j)(3)(iii)(A) of this section). If A, B, and C are treated as owning interests that are actually owned by related persons, their ownership percentages are as follows:
Corporation/Undertaking
Shareholder
X (percent)
Y (percent)
A
25
5
B
5
25
C
25
25
(iii) Paragraph (j)(3)(iii)(B) of this section provides that, in determining the sum of the common-ownership percentages of any five or fewer persons with respect to any undertakings, each interest in such undertakings is counted only once. If two or more persons are treated as owners of the same interest under paragraph (j)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the person whose ownership would result in the highest sum is treated as the only owner of the interest. In this case, C's common-ownership percentage with respect to undertakings X and Y, determined by treating C as the owner of the interests actually owned by A and B, is 25 percent. If, however, A and B are treated as the owners of the interests actually owned by C, each has a common-ownership percentage of only five percent. Thus, in determining the sum of common-ownership percentages with respect to undertakings X and Y, C is treated as the owner of the interests actually owned by A and B because this treatment results in the highest sum of common-ownership percentages with respect to such undertakings.

# Example 4.
(i) The ownership percentages of individuals A, B, and C in undertakings X, Y, and Z are as follows:
Undertaking
Individual
X
Y
Z
A
30%
30%
30%
B
30%
30%
30%
C
30%
30%
No other person owns an interest in more than one of the undertakings.
(ii) Paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a person's common ownership percentage with respect to any two or more undertakings is the person's smallest ownership percentage in any such undertaking. Thus, A's common-ownership percentage with respect to undertakings X, Y, and Z is 30 percent, and the common-ownership percentages of B and C (and all other persons owning interests in such undertakings) with respect to such undertakings is zero. Accordingly, the sum of the common ownership percentages with respect to undertakings X, Y, and Z is only 30 percent, and undertakings X, Y, and Z are not treated as part of the same common-ownership group under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iii) B's common-ownership percentage with respect to undertakings X and Y is 30 percent, and the sum of A's and B's common-ownership percentages with respect to such undertakings is 60 percent. Thus, undertakings X and Y are treated as part of the same common-ownership group under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section. Similarly, C's common-ownership percentage with respect to undertakings Y and Z is 30 percent, and the sum of A's and C's common-ownership percentages with respect to such undertakings is 60 percent. Thus, undertakings Y and Z are also treated as part of the same common-ownership group under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iv) Paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section requires the aggregation of common-ownership groups that include the same undertaking. In this case, undertaking Y is treated as part of the common-ownership group XY and as part of the common-ownership group YZ. Accordingly, undertakings X, Y, and Z are treated as part of a single common-ownership group and are rebuttably presumed to be controlled by the same interests (see
paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section) even though B does not own an interest in undertaking Z and C does not own an interest in undertaking X. The fact that B and C are not common owners with respect to undertakings X and Z is taken into account, however, in determining whether this presumption is rebutted.
(k)
Identification of rental real estate activities
—(1)
Applicability
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k)(6) of this section, this paragraph (k) applies to a taxpayer's interests in rental real estate undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section).
(ii)
Rental real estate undertaking.
For purposes of this paragraph (k), a rental real estate undertaking is a rental undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section) in which at least 85 percent of the unadjusted basis (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(f)(3)) of the property made available for use by customers is real property. For this purpose the term “real property” means any tangible property other than tangible personal property (within the meaning of § 1.48-1(c)).
(2)
Identification of activities
—(i)
Multiple undertakings treated as a single activity or multiple activities by taxpayer.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (k), a taxpayer may treat two or more rental real estate undertakings (determined after the application of paragraph (k)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section) as a single activity or may treat such undertakings as separate activities.
(ii)
Multiple undertakings treated as a single activity by passthrough entity.
A taxpayer must treat two or more rental real estate undertakings as a single rental real estate undertaking for a taxable year if any passthrough entity through which the taxpayer holds such undertakings treats such undertakings as a single activity on the applicable return of the passthrough entity for the taxable year of the taxpayer.
(iii)
Single undertaking treated as multiple undertakings.
Notwithstanding that a taxpayer's interest in leased property would, but for the application of this paragraph (k)(2)(iii), be treated as used in a single rental real estate undertaking, the taxpayer may, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, treat a portion of the leased property (including a ratable portion of any common areas or facilities) as a rental real estate undertaking that is separate from the undertaking or undertakings in which the remaining portion of the property is treated as used. This paragraph (k)(2)(iii) shall apply for a taxable year if and only if—
(A) Such portion of the leased property can be separately conveyed under applicable State and local law (taking into account the limitations, if any, imposed by any special rules or procedures, such as condominium conversion laws, restricting the separate conveyance of parts of the same structure); and
(B) The taxpayer holds such leased property directly or through one or more passthrough entities, each of which treats such portion of the leased property as a separate activity on the applicable return of the passthrough entity for the taxable year of the taxpayer.
(3)
Treatment in succeeding taxable years.
All rental real estate undertakings or portions of such undertakings that are treated, under this paragraph (k), as part of the same activity for a taxable year ending after August 9, 1989 must be treated as part of the same activity in each succeeding taxable year.
(4)
Applicable return of passthrough entity.
For purposes of this paragraph (k), the applicable return of a passthrough entity for a taxable year of a taxpayer is the return reporting the passthrough entity's income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits taken into account by the taxpayer for such taxable year.
(5)
Evidence of treatment required.
For purposes of this paragraph (k), a person (including a passthrough entity) does not treat a rental real estate undertaking as multiple undertakings for a taxable year or, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k) (2)(ii) or (3) of this section, treat multiple rental real estate undertakings as a single undertaking for a taxable year unless such treatment is reflected on a schedule attached to the person's return for the taxable year.
(6)
Coordination rule for rental of nondepreciable property.
This paragraph (k) shall not apply to a rental real estate
undertaking if less than 30 percent of the unadjusted basis (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(f)(3)) of property used or held for use by customers in such undertaking during the taxable year is subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167.
(7)
Coordination rule for rental of dwelling unit.
For any taxable year in which section 280A(c)(5) applies to a taxpayer's use of a dwelling unit—
(i) Paragraph (k) (2) and (3) of this section shall not apply to the taxpayer's interest in such dwelling unit; and
(ii) The taxpayer's interest in such dwelling unit shall be treated as a separate activity of the taxpayer.
(8)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (k). In each example, the taxpayer is an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year.

# Example 1.
(i) In 1989, the taxpayer directly owns five condominium units (units A, B, C, D, and E) in three different buildings. Units A, B, and C are in one of the buildings and constitute a single rental real estate undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section). Units D and E are in the other two buildings, and each of these units constitutes a separate rental real estate undertaking. Each of the units can be separately conveyed under applicable State and local law.
(ii) Paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section permits a taxpayer to treat a portion of the property included in a rental real estate undertaking as a separate rental real estate undertaking if the property can be separately conveyed under applicable State and local law and the taxpayer owns the property directly. Thus, the taxpayer can treat units A, B, and C as three separate undertakings. Alternatively, the taxpayer could treat two of those units (
e.g.,
units A and C) as an undertaking and the remaining unit as a separate undertaking, or could treat units A, B, and C as a single undertaking.
(iii) Paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section permits a taxpayer to treat two or more rental real estate undertakings as a single activity, or to treat such undertakings as separate activities. Thus, the taxpayer, by combining undertakings, can treat all five units as a single activity. Alternatively, the taxpayer could treat each undertaking as a separate activity, or could combine some, but not all, undertakings. Thus, for example, the taxpayer could treat units A, B, C, and D as an activity and unit E as a separate activity.
(iv) For purposes of paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, a taxpayer's rental real estate undertakings are determined after the application of paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section. Thus, the taxpayer, by treating units as separate undertakings under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section and combining them with other units under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, can treat any combination of units as a single activity. For example, the taxpayer could treat units A and B as a separate rental real estate undertaking, and then treat units A, B, and D as a single activity. In that case, the taxpayer could treat units C and E either as a single activity or as two separate activities.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, the taxpayer treats all five units as a single activity for 1989 and sells unit E in 1990. (See paragraph (k)(5) of this section for a rule providing that the units are treated as a single activity only if such treatment is reflected on a schedule attached to the taxpayer's return.)
(ii) Under paragraph (k)(3) of this section, rental real estate undertakings that are treated as part of the same activity for a taxable year must be treated as part of the same activity in each succeeding year. In this case, all five units were treated as part of the same activity for 1989 and must therefore be treated as part of the same activity for 1990. Accordingly, the taxpayer's sale of unit E in 1990 cannot be treated as a disposition of the taxpayer's entire interest in an activity for purposes of section 469(g) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-6T (relating to the treatment of losses upon certain dispositions of passive and former passive activities).

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership that is the direct owner of the five condominium units. In its return for its taxable year ending on November 30, 1989, the partnership treats the five units as a single activity. (See paragraph (k)(5) of this section for a rule providing that the units are treated as a single activity only if such treatment is reflected on a schedule attached to the partnership's return.) The partnership sells unit E on November 1, 1990.
(ii) Paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a taxpayer who holds rental real estate undertakings through a passthrough entity must treat those undertakings as a single rental real estate undertaking if they are treated as a single activity on the applicable return of the passthrough entity. Under paragraph (k)(4) of this section, the applicable return of the partnership for the taxpayer's 1989 taxable year is the partnership's return for its taxable year ending on November 30, 1989. Accordingly, the taxpayer must treat the five condominium units as a single rental real estate undertaking (and thus as part of the same activity) for 1989 because they are treated as a single activity on
the partnership's return for its taxable year ending in 1989.
(iii) Under paragraph (k)(3) of this section, the taxpayer must continue treating the condominium units as part of the same activity for taxable years after 1989. Accordingly, as in Example 2, the five condominium units are treated as part of the same activity for 1990, and the sale of unit E in 1990 cannot be treated as a disposition of the taxpayer's interest in an activity for purposes of section 469(g) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-6T.

# Example 4.
(i) The taxpayer owns a shopping center and a vacant lot that are separate rental real estate undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section). The taxpayer rents space in the shopping center to various tenants and rents the vacant lot to a parking lot operator. Most of the unadjusted basis of the property used in the shopping-center undertaking (taking into account the land on which the shopping center is built) is subject to the allowance for depreciation, but no depreciable property is used in the parking-lot undertaking.
(ii) This paragraph (k) provides rules for identifying rental real estate activities (including the rule in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section that permits a taxpayer to treat two or more rental real estate undertakings as a single activity). Paragraph (k)(6) of this section provides, however, that these rules do not apply to a rental real estate undertaking if less than 30 percent of the unadjusted basis of the property used in the undertaking is subject to the allowance for depreciation. Thus, the taxpayer may not combine the parking-lot undertaking, which includes no depreciable property, with the shopping-center undertaking or any other rental real estate undertaking under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the parking lot undertaking is treated as a separate activity under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the shopping center and the vacant lot are at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are part of the same rental real estate undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section). Taking into account the property used in the shopping center operations (including the land on which the shopping center is built) and the vacant lot, 50 percent of the unadjusted basis of the property used in the undertaking is subject to the allowance for depreciation.
(ii) In this case, the vacant lot is used in a rental real estate undertaking in which depreciable property is also used. Moreover, the exception in paragraph (k)(6) of this section does not apply to the undertaking consisting of the shopping center and the parking lot because at least 30 percent of unadjusted basis of the property used in the undertaking is subject to the allowance for depreciation. Accordingly, the taxpayer may combine the undertaking with other rental real estate undertakings and treat the combined undertakings as a single activity under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section.
(l) [Reserved]
(m)
Consolidated groups
—(1)
In general.
The activities of a consolidated group (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(h)(2)(ii)) and of each member of such group shall be determined under this section as if the consolidated group were one taxpayer.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (m). In each example, the facts, analysis, and conclusions relate to a single taxable year.

# Example 1.
(i) Corporations M, N, and O are the members of a consolidated group (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(h)(2)(ii)). Under § 1.469-1T(h)(4)(i)(A) and (ii), the consolidated group and its members are treated as closely held corporations (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii)). Each member of the consolidated group owns a two-percent interest in partnership X and a two-percent interest in partnership Y, and owns interests in a number of trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section) through the partnerships. Each of these undertakings is directly owned by partnership X or Y, and all the undertakings of partnerships X and Y are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section) and are similar (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section). The employees of the consolidated group and the shareholders of its common parent do not participate in the undertakings that the member corporations own through the partnerships.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section provides that trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer if the taxpayer owns interests in the undertakings through the same passthrough entity. In this case, the member corporations own interests in similar, commonly-controlled undertakings through both partnerships, and such interests are treated under this paragraph (m) as interests owned by one taxpayer (the consolidated group). Accordingly, the member corporations' interests in the undertakings owned through partnership X are treated as part of the same activity of the consolidated group, and their interests in the undertakings owned through partnership Y are treated similarly.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that each member of the consolidated group owns a five-percent interest in partnership X and a five-percent interest in partnership Y.
(ii) Paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section provides that trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer if the taxpayer owns a direct or substantial indirect interest in each such undertaking. In this case, the member corporations own, in the aggregate, a 15-percent interest in partnership X and a 15-percent interest in partnership Y, and such interests are treated under this paragraph (m) as interests owned by one taxpayer (the consolidated group). Thus, the consolidated group owns a substantial indirect interest in the similar, commonly-controlled undertakings owned by partnerships X and Y (see paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section). Accordingly, the member corporations' interests in the undertakings owned through partnerships X and Y are treated as part of the same activity of the consolidated group.
(n)
Publicly traded partnerships.
The rules of this section shall apply to a taxpayer's interest in business and rental operations held through a publicly traded partnership (within the meaning of section 469(k)(2)) as if the taxpayer had no interest in any other business and rental operations. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (n):

# Example.
(i) The taxpayer, an individual, owns a 20-percent interest in partnership X and a 15-percent interest in partnership Y. Partnership X directly owns a hotel (“hotel 1”) and a commercial office building (“building 1”). Partnership Y directly owns two hotels (“hotels 2 and 3”) and two commercial office buildings (“buildings 2 and 3”). Each of the three hotels is a separate trade or business undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section), and each of the three office buildings is a separate rental real estate undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section). The three hotel undertakings are similar (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section) and are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section). Partnership X is not a publicly traded partnership (within the meaning of section 469(k)(2)). Partnership Y, however, is a publicly traded partnership and is not treated as a corporation under section 7704.
(ii) This paragraph (n) provides that the rules of this section apply to a taxpayer's interest in business and rental operations held through a publicly traded partnership as if the taxpayer had no interest in any other business and rental operations. Thus, undertakings owned through partnership Y may be treated as part of the same activity under the rules of this section, but an undertaking owned through partnership Y and an undertaking that is not owned through partnership Y may not be treated as part of the same activity.
(iii) Paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity if the taxpayer owns interests in each undertaking through the same passthrough entity. Partnership Y's hotel undertakings (
i.e.,
hotels 2 and 3) are similar and are controlled by the same interests. In addition, the taxpayer owns interests in both undertakings through the same partnership. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in partnership Y's hotel undertakings are treated as part of the same activity.
(iv) The hotel undertaking owned through partnership X (
i.e.,
hotel 1) and the hotel undertakings owned through partnership Y are similar and controlled by the same interests, and the taxpayer owns a substantial indirect interest in each of the undertakings (see paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section). Thus, the three undertakings would ordinarily be treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. Under this paragraph (n), however, undertakings that are owned through a publicly traded partnership cannot be treated as part of the same activity as any undertaking not owned through that partnership. Accordingly, the hotel undertaking that the taxpayer owns through partnership X and the hotel undertakings that the taxpayer owns through partnership Y are treated as two separate activities.
(v) Paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section provides that, with certain exceptions, a taxpayer may treat two or more rental real estate undertakings as a single activity or as separate activities. Thus, the taxpayer's interests in the rental real estate undertakings owned through partnership Y (
i.e.,
buildings 2 and 3) may be treated as a single activity or as separate activities. Under this paragraph (n), however, undertakings that are owned through a publicly traded partnership cannot be treated as part of the same activity as any undertaking not owned through that partnership. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interest in the rental real estate undertaking owned through partnership X (building 1) cannot be treated as part of an activity that includes any rental real estate undertaking owned through partnership Y.
(o)
Elective treatment of undertakings as separate activities
—(1)
Applicability.
This paragraph applies to a taxpayer's interest in any undertaking (other than a rental real estate undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section)) that would otherwise be treated under this section as part of an activity that includes the taxpayer's interest in any other undertaking.
(2)
Undertakings treated as separate activities.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (o), a person (including a passthrough entity) shall treat an undertaking to which this paragraph (o) applies as an activity separate from the remainder of the activity in which such undertaking would otherwise be included for a taxable year if and only if, for such taxable year or any preceding taxable year, such person made an election with respect to such undertaking under this paragraph (o).
(3)
Multiple undertakings treated as a single activity by passthrough entity.
A person (including a passthrough entity) must treat interests in two or more undertakings as part of the same activity for a taxable year if any passthrough entity through which the person holds such undertakings treats such undertakings as part of the same activity on the applicable return of the passthrough entity for the taxable year of such person.
(4)
Multiple undertakings treated as a single activity for a preceding taxable year.
If a person (including a passthrough entity) treats undertakings as part of the same activity on such person's return for a taxable year ending after August 9, 1989, such person may not treat such undertakings as part of different activities under this paragraph (o) for any subsequent taxable year.
(5)
Applicable return of passthrough entity.
For purposes of this paragraph (o), the applicable return of a passthrough entity for a taxable year of a taxpayer is the return reporting the passthrough entity's income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits taken into account by the taxpayer for such taxable year.
(6)
Participation.
The following rules apply to multiple activities (the “separate activities”) that would be treated as a single activity (the “original activity”) if the taxpayer's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (o):
(i) The taxpayer shall be treated as materially participating (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) for the taxable year in the separate activities if and only if the taxpayer would, but for the application of this paragraph (o), be treated as materially participating for the taxable year in the original activity.
(ii) The taxpayer shall be treated as significantly participating (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(c)(2)) for the taxable year in the separate activities if and only if the taxpayer would, but for the application of this paragraph (o), be treated as significantly participating for the taxable year in the original activity.
(7)
Election
—(i)
In general.
A person makes an election with respect to an undertaking under this paragraph (o) by attaching the written statement described in paragraph (o)(7)(ii) of this section to such person's return for the taxable year for which the election is made (see paragraph (o)(2) of this section).
(ii)
Written statement.
The written statement required by paragraph (o)(7)(i) of this section must—
(A) State the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person making the election;
(B) Contain a declaration that an election is being made under § 1.469-4T(o);
(C) Identify the undertaking with respect to which such election is being made; and
(D) Identify the remainder of the activity in which such undertaking would otherwise be included.
(8)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (o):

# Example 1.
(i) During 1989, the taxpayer, an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year, acquires and is the direct owner of ten grocery stores. The operations of each grocery store are treated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (a “grocery-store undertaking”), and the taxpayer's interests in the grocery-store undertakings would be treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(ii) Paragraph (o)(2) of this section provides that, with certain exceptions, undertakings that would be treated as part of the same activity under other rules in this section may, at the election of the taxpayer, be treated as separate activities. Thus, the taxpayer may elect to treat each grocery-store undertaking as a separate activity for 1989. Alternatively, the taxpayer may combine grocery-store undertakings in any manner and treat each combination of undertakings (and each uncombined undertaking) as a separate activity for 1989. In either case, the election must be made by attaching the written statement described in paragraph (o)(7)(ii) of this section to the taxpayer's 1989 return.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, the taxpayer, in 1989, elects to treat each grocery-store undertaking as a separate activity and participates for 15 hours in each of the grocery-store undertakings.
(ii) The taxpayer's interest in each grocery-store undertaking is treated, under paragraph (o)(2) of this section, as a separate activity of the taxpayer for 1989 (a “grocery-store activity”). In 1989, however, the taxpayer participates for more than 100 hours in the activity in which the undertakings would be included (but for the election to treat the grocery-store undertakings as separate activities) and would be treated under § 1.469-5T(c)(2) as significantly participating in such activity. Accordingly, the taxpayer is treated under paragraph (o)(6)(ii) of this section as significantly participating in each of the grocery-store activities for 1989.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, the taxpayer, in 1989, elects to treat each grocery-store undertaking as a separate activity. The taxpayer does not participate in any of the grocery-store undertakings in 1989 or 1990, and sells one of the grocery stores in 1990.
(ii) As in Example 2, the taxpayer's interests in each grocery-store undertaking is treated, under paragraph (o)(2) of this section, as a separate activity of the taxpayer for 1989. Because the taxpayer elected to treat the undertakings as separate activities for a preceding taxable year (1989), each grocery-store undertaking is also treated, under paragraph (o)(2) of this section, as a separate activity of the taxpayer for 1990. In addition, each of the taxpayer's grocery-store activities is a passive activity for 1989 and 1990 because the taxpayer does not participate in any of the grocery store undertakings for 1989 and 1990. Accordingly, the taxpayer's sale of the grocery store will generally be treated as a disposition of the taxpayer's entire interest in a passive activity for purposes of section 469(g) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-6T (relating to the treatment of losses upon certain dispositions of passive and former passive activities).

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the taxpayer elects to treat the grocery-store undertakings as two separate activities. One of the activities includes three grocery-store undertakings, and the store sold in 1990 is part of this activity. The other activity includes the seven remaining grocery-store undertakings.
(ii) Paragraph (o)(4) of this section provides that a person who treats undertakings as part of the same activity for a taxable year ending after August 9, 1989, may not elect to treat those undertakings as separate activities for a subsequent taxable year. The grocery store sold in 1990 was treated for 1989 as part of an activity that includes two other grocery stores. Thus, those three stores must be treated as part of the same activity for 1990. Accordingly, the taxpayer's sale of the grocery store cannot be treated as a disposition of the taxpayer's entire interest in a passive activity for purposes of section 469(g) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-6T.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership that acquires and is the direct owner of the ten grocery stores. The taxable year of the partnership ends on November 30, and the partnership acquires the grocery stores in its taxable year ending on November 30, 1989. In its return for that taxable year, the partnership treats the grocery-store undertakings as a single activity.
(ii) Paragraph (o)(3) of this section provides that a person who holds undertakings through a passthrough entity may not elect to treat those undertakings as separate activities if they are treated as part of the same activity on the applicable return of the passthrough entity. Under paragraph (o)(5) of this section, the applicable return of the partnership for the taxpayer's 1989 taxable year is the partnership's return for its taxable year ending on November 30, 1989. Accordingly, the taxpayer must treat the grocery-store undertakings as a single activity for 1989 because those undertakings are treated as a single activity on the partnership's return for its taxable year ending in 1989.
(iii) Under paragraph (o)(4) of this section, the taxpayer must continue treating the grocery-store undertakings as part of the same activity for taxable years after 1989. This rule applies even if the partnership subsequently distributes its interest in the grocery stores to the taxpayer, and the taxpayer becomes the direct owner of the grocery-store undertakings.
(p) Special rule for taxable years ending before August 10, 1989—(1)
In general.
For purposes of applying section 469 and the regulations thereunder for a taxable year ending before August 10, 1989, a taxpayer's business and rental
operations may be organized into activities under the rules or paragraphs (b) through (n) of this section or under any other reasonable method. For example, for such taxable years a taxpayer may treat each of the taxpayer's undertakings as a separate activity, or a taxpayer may treat undertakings that involve the provision of similar goods or services as a single activity.
(2)
Unreasonable methods.
A method of organizing business and rental operations into activities is not reasonable if such method—
(i) Treats rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section) that are not ancillary to a trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(2)) as part of a trade or business activity;
(ii) Treats operations that are not rental operations and are not ancillary to a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)) as part of a rental activity;
(iii) Includes in a passive activity of a taxpayer any oil or gas well that would be treated, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, as a separate undertaking in determining the taxpayer's activities;
(iv) Includes in a passive activity of a taxpayer any interest in a dwelling unit that would be treated, under paragraph (K)(7) of this section, as a separate activity of the taxpayer; or
(v) Is inconsistent with the taxpayer's method of organizing business and rental operations into activities for the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986.
(3)
Allocation of dissallowed deductions in succeeding taxable year.
If any of the taxpayer's passive activity deductions or the taxpayer's credits from passive activities are disallowed under § 1.469-1T for the last taxable year of the taxpayer ending before August 10, 1989, such disallowed deductions or credits shall be allocated among the taxpayer's activities for the first taxable year of the taxpayer ending after August 9, 1989, using any reasonable method. See § 1.469-1T(f)(4).

In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f), any work done by an individual (without regard to the capacity in which the individual does the work) in connection with an activity in which the individual owns an interest at the time the work is done shall be treated for purposes of this section as participation of the individual in the activity.

(h)(3)
Coordination with rules governing the treatment of passthrough entities.
If a taxpayer takes into account for a taxable year of the taxpayer any item of gross income or deduction from a partnership or S corporation that is characterized as an item of gross income or deduction from an activity in which the taxpayer materially participated under § 1.469-2T(e)(1), the taxpayer is treated as materially participating in the activity for the taxable year for purposes of applying § 1.469-5T(a)(5) and (6) to any succeeding taxable year of the taxpayer.

(j)
Material participation for preceding taxable years
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of § 1.469-5T(a)(5) and (6), a taxpayer has materially participated in an activity for a preceding taxable year if the activity includes significant section 469 activities that are substantially the same as significant section 469 activities that were included in an activity in which the taxpayer materially participated (determined without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5)) for the preceding taxable year.
(2)
Material participation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987.
In any case in which it is necessary to determine whether an individual materially participated in any activity for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987 (other than a taxable year of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust ending after December 31, 1986), the determination shall be made without regard to paragraphs (a)(2) through (7) of this section.

Examples.
Example 1—Example 4 [Reserved]

# Example 5.
In 1993, D, an individual, acquires stock in an S corporation engaged in a trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1(e)(2)). For every taxable year from 1993 through 1997, D is treated as
materially participating (without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5)) in the activity. D retires from the activity at the beginning of 1998, and would not be treated as materially participating in the activity for 1998 and subsequent taxable years if material participation of those years were determined without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5). Under § 1.469-5T(a)(5) of this section, however, D is treated as materially participating in the activity for taxable years 1998 through 2003 because D materially participated in the activity (determined without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5) for five taxable years during the ten taxable years that immediately precede each of those years. D is not treated under § 1.469-5T(a)(5) as materially participating in the activity for taxable years beginning after 2003 because for those years D has not materially participated in the activity (determined without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5) for five of the last ten immediately preceding taxable years.

(k)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
A, a calendar year individual, owns all of the stock of X, a C corporation. X is the general partner, and A is the limited partner, in P, a calendar year partnership. P has a single activity, a restaurant, which is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(2)). During the taxable year, A works for an average of 30 hours per week in connection with P's restaurant activity. Under paragraphs (a)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, A is treated as materially participating in the activity for the taxable year because A participates in the restaurant activity during such year for more than 500 hours. In addition, under § 1.469-1T(g)(3)(i), A's participation will cause X to be treated as materially participating in the restaurant activity.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the partnership agreement provides that P's restaurant activity is
to be managed by X, and A's work in the activity is performed pursuant to an employment contract between A and X. Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, work done by A in connection with the activity in any capacity is treated as participation in the activity by A. Accordingly, the conclusion is the same as in Example 1. The conclusion would be the same if A owned no stock in X at any time, although in that case A's participation would not be taken into account in determining whether X materially participates in the restaurant activity.

# Example 3.
B, an individual, is employed fulltime as a carpenter. B also owns an interest in a partnership which is engaged in a van conversion activity, which is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(2)). B and C, the other partner, are the only participants in the activity for the taxable year. The activity is conducted entirely on Saturdays. Each Saturday throughout the taxable year, B and C work for eight hours in the activity. Although B does not participate in the activity for more than 500 hours during the taxable year, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, B is treated for such year as materially participating in the activity because B participates in the activity for more than 100 hours during the taxable year, and B's participation in the activity for such year is not less than the participation of any other person in the activity for such year.

# Example 4.
C, an individual, is employed full-time as an accountant. C also owns interests in a restaurant and a shoe store. The restaurant and shoe store are trade or business activities (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(2)) that are treated as separate activities under the rules to be contained in § 1.469-4T. Each activity has several full-time employees. During the taxable year, C works in the restaurant activity for 400 hours and in the shoe store activity for 150 hours. Under paragraph (c) of this section, both the restaurant and shoe store activities are significant participation activities of C for the taxable year. Accordingly, since C's aggregate participation in the restaurant and shoe store activities during the taxable year exceeds 500 hours, C is treated under paragraph (a)(4) of this section as materially participating in both activities.

# Example 5.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-5(k)
Example 5
for this example.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that D does not acquire any stock in the S corporation until 1994. Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, D is not treated as participating in the activity for any taxable year prior to 1994 because D does not own as interest in the activity for any such taxable year. Accordingly, D materially participates in the activity for only one taxable year prior to 1995, and D is not treated under paragraph (a)(5) of this section as materially participating in the activity for 1995 or subsequent taxable years.

# Example 7.
(i) E, a married individual filing a separate return for the taxable year, is employed full-time as an attorney. E also owns an interest in a professional football team that is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(2)). E does no work in connection with this activity. E anticipates that, for the taxable year, E's deductions from the activity will exceed E's gross income from the activity and that, if E does not materially participate in the activity for the taxable year, part or all of F's passive activity loss for the taxable year will be disallowed under § 1.469-1T(a)(1)(i). Accordingly, E pays E's spouse to work as an office receptionist in connection with the activity for an average of 15 hours per week during the taxable year.
(ii) Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section any participation in the activity by E's spouse is treated as participation in the activity by E. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the work done by E's spouse is not treated as participation in the activity because work as an office receptionist is not work of a type customarily done by an owner of a football team, and one of E's principal purposes for paying E's spouse to do this work is to avoid the disallowance under § 1.469-1T(a)(1)(i) of E's passive activity loss. Accordingly, E is not treated as participating in the activity for the taxable year.

# Example 8.
(i) F, an individual, owns an interest in a partnership that feeds and sells cattle. The general partner of the partnership periodically mails F a letter setting forth certain proposed actions and decisions with respect to the cattle-feeding operation. Such actions and decisions include, for example, what kind of feed to purchase, how much to purchase, and when to purchase it, how often to feed cattle, and when to sell cattle. The letters explain the proposed actions and decisions, emphasize that taking or not taking a particular action or decision is solely within the discretion of F and other partners, and ask F to indicate a decision with respect to each proposed action by answering certain questions. The general partner receives a fee that constitutes earned income (within the meaning of section 911 (d)(2)(A)) for managing the cattle-feeding operation. F is not treated as materially participating in the cattle-feeding operation under paragraph (a) (1) through (6) of this section.
(ii) F's only participation in the cattle-feeding operation is to make certain managerial decisions. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, such management services are not taken into account in determining
whether the taxpayer is treated as materially participating in the activity for a taxable year under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, if any other person performs services in connection with the management of the activity and receives compensation described in section 911(d)(2)(A) for such services. Therefore, F is not treated as materially participating for the taxable year in the cattle-feeding operation.

Applicability and effect of rules.
This section sets forth rules that apply, for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, in the case of a lending transaction (including guaranteed payments for the use of capital under section 707(c)) between a taxpayer and a passthrough entity in which the taxpayer owns a direct or indirect interest, or between certain passthrough entities. The rules apply only to items of interest income and interest expense that are recognized in the same taxable year. The rules—
(i) Treat certain interest income resulting from these lending transactions as passive activity gross income;
(ii) Treat certain deductions for interest expense that is properly allocable to the interest income as passive activity deductions; and
(iii) Allocate the passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions resulting from this treatment among the taxpayer's activities.
(2)
Priority of rules in this section.
The character of amounts treated under the rules of this section as passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions and the activities to which these amounts are allocated are determined under the rules of this section and not under the rules of §§ 1.163-8T, 1.469-2(c) and (d), and 1.469-2T(c) and (d).

(2)
General rule.
If any of the borrowing entity's self-charged interest deductions are allocable to an activity for a taxable year in which this paragraph (c) applies, the passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions from that activity are determined under the following rules—
(i) The applicable percentage of each item of the taxpayer's income for the taxable year from interest charged to the borrowing entity is treated as passive activity gross income from the activity; and
(ii) The applicable percentage of each deduction for the taxable year for interest expense that is properly allocable (within the meaning of paragraph (f) of this section) to the taxpayer's income from the interest charged to the borrowing entity is treated as a passive activity deduction from the activity.
(3)
Applicable percentage.
In applying this paragraph (c) with respect to a taxpayer's interest in a borrowing entity, the applicable percentage is separately determined for each of the taxpayer's activities. The percentage applicable to an activity for a taxable year is obtained by dividing—
(i) The taxpayer's share for the taxable year of the borrowing entity's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the activity by
(ii) The greater of—
(A) The taxpayer's share for the taxable year of the borrowing entity's aggregate self-charged interest deductions for all activities (regardless of whether these deductions are treated as passive activity deductions); or
(B) The taxpayer's aggregate income for the taxable year from interest charged to the borrowing entity for all activities of the borrowing entity.
(d)
Passthrough entity loans to taxpayer
—(1)
Applicability.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, this paragraph (d) applies with respect to a taxpayer's interest in a passthrough entity (lending entity) for a taxable year if—
(i) The lending entity has gross income for the entity taxable year from interest charged by the lending entity to persons that own direct or indirect interests in the lending entity at any time during the entity taxable year (the lending entity's self-charged interest income);
(ii) The taxpayer owns a direct or an indirect interest in the lending entity at any time during the entity taxable year and has deductions for the taxable year for interest charged by the lending entity to the taxpayer or a passthrough entity through which the taxpayer holds an interest in the lending entity (the taxpayer's deductions for interest charged by the lending entity); and
(iii) The taxpayer's deductions for interest charged by the lending entity include passive activity deductions.
(2)
General rule.
If any of the taxpayer's deductions for interest charged by the lending entity are allocable to an activity for a taxable year in which this paragraph (d) applies, the passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions from that activity are determined under the following rules—
(i) The applicable percentage of the taxpayer's share for the taxable year of each item of the lending entity's self-charged interest income is treated as passive activity gross income from the activity.
(ii) The applicable percentage of the taxpayer's share for the taxable year of each deduction for interest expense that is properly allocable (within the meaning of paragraph (f) of this section) to the lending entity's self-charged interest income is treated as a passive activity deduction from the activity.
(3)
Applicable percentage.
In applying this paragraph (d) with respect to a taxpayer's interest in a lending entity, the applicable percentage is separately determined for each of the taxpayer's activities. The percentage applicable to an activity for a taxable year is obtained by dividing—
(i) The taxpayer's deductions for the taxable year for interest charged by the lending entity, to the extent treated as passive activity deductions from the activity; by
(ii) The greater of—
(A) The taxpayer's aggregate deductions for all activities for the taxable year for interest charged by the lending entity (regardless of whether these deductions are treated as passive activity deductions); or
(B) The taxpayer's aggregate share for the taxable year of the lending entity's self-charged interest income for all activities of the lending entity.
(e)
Identically-owned passthrough entities
—(1)
Applicability.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, this paragraph (e) applies with respect to lending transactions between passthrough entities if each owner of the borrowing entity has the same proportionate ownership interest in the lending entity.
(2)
General rule.
To the extent an owner shares in interest income from a loan between passthrough entities described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner is treated as having made the loan to the borrowing passthrough entity and paragraph (c) of this section applies to determine the applicable percentage of portfolio income of properly allocable interest expense that is recharacterized as passive.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e):

# Example.
(i) A and B, both calendar year taxpayers, each own a 50-percent interest in the capital and profits of partnerships RS and XY, both calendar year partnerships. Under the partnership agreements of RS and XY, A and B are each entitled to a 50-percent distributive share of each partnership's income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit. RS makes a $20,000 loan to XY and XY pays RS $2,000 of interest for the taxable year. A's distributive share of interest income attributable to this loan is $1,000 (50 percent × $2,000). XY uses all of the proceeds received from RS is a passive activity. A's distributive share of interest expense attributable to the loan is $1,000 (50 percent × $2,000).
(ii) This paragraph (e) applies in determining A's passive activity gross income because RS and XY are identically-owned passthrough entities as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the RS-to-XY loan is treated as if A made the loan to XY. Therefore, A must apply paragraph (c) of this section to determine the applicable percentage of portfolio income that is recharacterized as passive income.
(iii) Paragraph (c) of this section applies in determining A's passive activity gross income because: XY has deductions for interest charged to XY by RS for the taxable year (XY's self-charged interest deductions); A owns an interest in XY during XY's taxable year and has gross income for the taxable year from interest charged to XY by RS; and A's share of XY's self-charged interest deductions includes passive activity deductions. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the applicable percentage of A's interest income is recharacterized as passive activity gross income from the activity. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides that the applicable percentage is obtained by dividing A's share for the taxable year of XY's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the activity ($1,000) by the greater of A's share for the taxable year of XY's self-charged interest deductions ($1,000), or A's income for the year from interest charged to XY ($1,000). Thus, A's applicable percentage is 100 percent ($1,000/$1,000), and $1,000 (100 percent × $1,000) of A's income from interest charged to XY is treated as passive activity gross income from the passive activity.
(f)
Identification of properly allocable deductions.
For purposes of this section, interest expense is properly allocable to an item of interest income if the interest expense is allocated under § 1.163-8T to an expenditure that—
(1) Is properly chargeable to capital account with respect to the investment producing the item of interest income; or
(2) May reasonably be taken into account as a cost of producing the item of interest income.
(g)
Election to avoid application of the rules of this section
—(1)
In general.
Paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this section shall not apply with respect to any taxpayer's interest in a passthrough entity for a taxable year if the passthrough entity has made, under this paragraph (g), an election that applies to the entity's taxable year.
(2)
Form of election.
A passthrough entity makes an election under this paragraph (g) by attaching to its return (or amended return) a written statement that includes the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the passthrough entity and a declaration that an election is being made under this paragraph (g).
(3)
Period for which election applies.
An election under this paragraph (g) made
with a return (or amended return) for a taxable year applies to that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years that end before the date on which the election is revoked.
(4)
Revocation.
An election under this paragraph (g) may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this section. The examples assume for purposes of simplifying the presentation, that the lending transactions described do not result in foregone interest (within the meaning of section 7872(e)(2)), original issue discount (within the meaning of section 1273), or total unstated interest (within the meaning of section 483(b)).

# Example 1.
(i) A and B, two calendar year individuals, each own 50-percent interests in the capital, profits and losses of AB, a calendar year partnership. AB is engaged in a single rental activity within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3). AB borrows $50,000 from A and uses the loan proceeds in the rental activity. AB pays $5,000 of interest to A for the taxable year. A and B each incur $2,500 of interest expense as their distributive share of AB's interest expense.
(ii) AB has self-charged interest deductions for the taxable year (
i.e.,
the deductions for interest charged to AB by A); A owns a direct interest in AB during AB's taxable year and has income for A's taxable year from interest charged to AB; and A's share of AB's self-charged interest deductions includes passive activity deductions. Accordingly, paragraph (c) of this section applies in determining A's passive activity gross income. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the applicable percentage of A's interest income is recharacterized as passive activity gross income from AB's rental activity. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides that the applicable percentage is obtained by dividing A's share for the taxable year of AB's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the activity ($2,500) by the greater of A's share for the taxable year of AB's self-charged interest deductions ($2,500), or A's income for the taxable year from interest charged to AB ($5,000). Thus, A's applicable percentage is 50 percent ($2,500/$5,000), and $2,500 (50 percent × $5,000) of A's income from interest charged to AB is treated as passive activity gross income from the passive activity A conducts through AB.
(iv) Because B does not have any gross income for the year from interest charged to AB, this section does not apply to B. See paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) C and D, two calendar year taxpayers, each own 50-percent interests in the capital and profits of CD, a calendar year partnership. CD is engaged in a single rental activity, within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3). C obtains a $10,000 loan from a third-party lender, and pays the lender $900 in interest for the taxable year. C lends the $10,000 to CD, and receives $1,000 of interest income from CD for the taxable year. D lends $20,000 to CD and receives $2,000 of interest income from CD for the taxable year. CD uses all of the proceeds in the rental activity. C and D are each allocated $1,500 (50 percent × $3,000) of interest expense as their distributive share of CD's interest expense for the taxable year.
(ii) CD has self-charged interest deductions for the taxable year (i.e., deductions for interest charged to CD by C and D); C and D each own direct interests in CD during CD's taxable year and have gross income for the taxable year from interest charged to CD; and both C's and D's shares of CD's self-charged interest deductions include passive activity deductions. Accordingly, paragraph (c) of this section applies in determining C's and D's passive activity gross income. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the applicable percentage of each partner's interest income is recharacterized as passive activity gross income from CD's rental activity. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides that C's applicable percentage is obtained by dividing C's share for the taxable year of CD's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the activity ($1,500) by the greater of C's share for the taxable year of CD's self-charged interest deductions ($1,500), or C's income for the taxable year from interest charged to CD ($1,000). Thus, C's applicable percentage is 100 percent ($1,500/$1,500), and all of C's income from interest charged to CD ($1,000) is treated as passive activity gross income from the passive activity C conducts through CD. Similarly, D's applicable percentage is obtained by dividing D's share for the taxable year of CD's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the activity ($1,500) by the greater of D's share for the taxable year of CD's self-charged interest deductions ($1,500), or D's income for the taxable year from interest charged to CD ($2,000). Thus, D's applicable percentage is 75 percent ($1,500/$2,000), and $1,500 (75 percent × $2,000) of D's income from interest charged to CD is treated as passive activity gross income from the rental activity.
(iv) The $900 of interest expense that C pays to the third-party lender is allocated under § 1.163-8T(c)(1) to an expenditure that is properly chargeable to capital account
with respect to the loan to CD. Thus, the expense is properly allocable to the interest income C receives from CD (see paragraph (f) of this section). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the applicable percentage of C's deductions for the taxable year for interest expense that is properly allocable to C's income from interest charged to CD is recharacterized as a passive activity deduction from CD's rental activity. Accordingly, all of C's $900 interest deduction is treated as a passive activity deduction from the rental activity.

# Example 3.
(i) E and F, calendar year taxpayers, each own 50 percent of the stock of X, a calendar year S corporation. E borrows $30,000 from X, and pays X $3,000 of interest for the taxable year. E uses $15,000 of the loan proceeds to make a personal expenditure (as defined in § 1.163-8T(b)(5)), and uses $15,000 of loan proceeds to purchase a trade or business activity in which E does not materially participate (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) for the taxable year. E and F each receive $1,500 as their pro rata share of X's interest income from the loan for the taxable year.
(ii) X has gross income for X's taxable year from interest charged to E (X's self-charged interest income); E owns a direct interest in X during X's taxable year and has deductions for the taxable year for interest charged by X; and E's deductions for interest charged by X include passive activity deductions. Accordingly, paragraph (d) of this section applies in determining E's passive activity gross income. See paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(iii) Under the rules in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the applicable percentage of E's share of X's self-charged interest income is recharacterized as passive activity gross income from the activity. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section provides that the applicable percentage is obtained by dividing E's deductions for the taxable year for interest charged by X, to the extent treated as passive activity deductions from the activity ($1,500), by the greater of E's deductions for the taxable year for interest charged by X, regardless of whether those deductions are treated as passive activity deductions ($3,000), or E's share for the taxable year of X's self-charged interest income ($1,500). Thus, E's applicable percentage is 50 percent ($1,500/$3,000), and $750 (50 percent × $1,500) of E's share of X's self-charged interest income is treated as passive activity gross income.
(iv) Because F does not have any deductions for the taxable year for interest charged by X, this section does not apply to F. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.

# Example 4.
(i) This
Example 4
illustrates the application of this section to a partner that has a different taxable year from the partnership. The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except as follows: Partnership AB has properly adopted a fiscal year ending June 30 for federal tax purposes; AB borrows the $50,000 from A on October 1, 1990; and under the terms of the loan, AB must pay A $5,000 in interest annually, in quarterly installments, for a term of 2 years.
(ii) For A's taxable years from 1990 through 1993 and AB's corresponding entity taxable years (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) A's interest income and AB's interest deductions from the loan are as follows:
A's interest income
AB's interest deductions
1990
$1,250
0
1991
5,000
$3,750
1992
3,750
5,000
1993
0
1,250
(iii) For A's taxable year ending December 31, 1990, the corresponding entity taxable year is AB's taxable year ending June 30, 1990. Because AB does not have any deductions for the entity taxable year for interest charged to AB by A, paragraph (c) of this section does not apply in determining A's passive activity gross income for 1990 (see paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section). Accordingly, A reports $1,250 of portfolio income on A's 1990 income tax return.
(iv) For A's taxable year ending December 31, 1991, the corresponding entity taxable year ends on June 30, 1991. AB has $3,750 of deductions for the entity taxable year for interest charged to AB by A (AB's self-charged interest deductions); A owns a direct interest in AB during the entity taxable year and has $5,000 of interest income for A's taxable year from interest charged to AB; and A's share of AB's self-charged interest deductions includes passive activity deductions. Accordingly, paragraph (c) of this section applies in determining A's passive activity gross income.
(v) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the applicable percentage of A's 1991 interest income is recharacterized as passive activity gross income from the activity. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides that the applicable percentage is obtained by dividing A's share for A's 1991 taxable year of AB's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the activity (50 percent × $3,750 = $1,875) by the greater of A's share for A's taxable year of AB's self-charged interest deductions ($1,875), or A's income for A's taxable year from interest charged to AB ($5,000). Thus, A's applicable percentage is 37.5 percent ($1,875/$5,000), and $1,875 (37.5 percent × $5,000) of A's income from interest charged to AB is treated as passive activity gross income from the passive activity A conducts through AB.
(vi) For A's taxable year ending December 31, 1992, the corresponding entity taxable year ends on June 30, 1992. AB has $5,000 of
deductions for the entity taxable year for interest charged to AB by A (AB's self-charged interest deductions); A owns a direct interest in AB during the entity taxable year and has $3,750 of gross income for A's taxable year from interest charged to AB; and A's share of AB's self-charged interest deductions includes passive activity deductions. Accordingly, paragraph (c) of this section applies in determining A's passive activity gross income.
(vii) The applicable percentage for 1992 is obtained by dividing A's share for A's 1992 taxable year of AB's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the activity ($2,500) by the greater of A's share for A's taxable year of AB's self-charged interest deductions ($2,500), or A's income for A's taxable year from interest charged to AB ($3,750). Thus, A's applicable percentage is 66
2/3
percent ($2,500/$3,750), and $2,500 (66
2/3
percent × $3,750) of A's income from interest charged to AB is treated as passive activity gross income from the passive activity A conducts through AB.
(viii) Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply in determining A's passive activity gross income for the taxable year ending December 31, 1993, because A has no gross income for the taxable year from interest charged to AB (see paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section). A's share of AB's self-charged interest deductions for the entity taxable year ending June 30, 1993 ($625) is taken into account as a passive activity deduction on A's 1993 income tax return.
(ix) Because B does not have any gross income from interest charged to AB for any of the taxable years, this section does not apply to B. See paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

# Example 5.
(i) This
Example 5
illustrates the application of the rules of this section in the case of a taxpayer who has an indirect interest in a partnership. G, a calendar year taxpayer, is an 80-percent partner in partnership UTP. UTP owns a 25-percent interest in the capital and profits of partnership LTP. UTP and LTP are both calendar year partnerships. The partners of LTP conduct a single passive activity through LTP. UTP obtains a $10,000 loan from a bank, and pays the bank $1,000 of interest per year. G's distributive share of the interest paid to the bank is $800 (80 percent × $1,000). UTP uses the $10,000 debt proceeds and another $10,000 of cash to make a loan to LTP, and LTP pays UTP $2,000 of interest for the taxable year. G's distributive share of interest income attributable to the UTP-to-LTP loan is $1,600 (80 percent × $2,000). LTP uses all of the proceeds received from UTP in the passive activity. UTP's distributive share of interest expense attributable to the UTP-to-LTP loan is $500 (25 percent × $2,000). G's distributive share of interest expense attributable to the UTP-to-LTP loan is $400 (80 percent × $500).
(ii) LTP has deductions for interest charged to LTP by UTP for the taxable year (LTP's self-charged interest deductions); G owns an indirect interest in LTP during LTP's taxable year and has gross income for the taxable year from interest charged to LTP by a passthrough entity (UTP) through which G owns an interest in LTP; and G's share of LTP's self-charged interest deductions includes passive activity deductions. Accordingly, paragraph (c) of this section applies in determining G's passive activity gross income. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the applicable percentage of G's interest income is recharacterized as passive activity gross income from the activity. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides that the applicable percentage is obtained by dividing G's share for the taxable year of LTP's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the activity ($400) by the greater of G's share for the taxable year of LTP's self-charged interest deductions ($400), or G's income for the year from interest charged to LTP ($1,600). Thus, G's applicable percentage is 25 percent ($400/$1,600), and $400 (25 percent × $1,600) of G's income from interest charged to LTP is treated as passive activity gross income from the passive activity that G conducts through UTP and LTP.
(iv) G's $800 distributive share of the interest expense that UTP pays to the third-party lender is allocated under § 1.163-8T(c)(1) to an expenditure that is properly chargeable to capital account with respect to the loan to LTP. Thus, the expense is a deduction properly allocable to the interest income that G receives as a result of the UTP-to-LTP loan (see paragraph (f) of this section). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the applicable percentage of G's deductions for the taxable year for interest expense that is properly allocable to G's income from interest charged by UTP to LTP is recharacterized as a passive activity deduction from LTP's passive activity. Accordingly, $200 (25 percent × $800) of G's interest deduction is treated as a passive activity deduction from LTP's activity.

# Example 6.
(i) This
Example 6
illustrates the application of the rules of this section in the case of a taxpayer who conducts two passive activities through a passthrough entity. J, a calendar year taxpayer, is the 100-percent shareholder of Y, a calendar year S corporation. J conducts two passive activities through Y: a rental activity and a trade or business activity in which J does not materially participate. Y borrows $80,000 from J, and uses $60,000 of the loan proceeds in the
rental activity and $20,000 of the loan proceeds in the passive trade or business activity. Y pays $8,000 of interest to J for the taxable year, and J incurs $8,000 of interest expense as J's distributive share of Y's interest expense.
(ii) Y has self-charged interest deductions for the taxable year (i.e., the deductions for interest charged to Y by J); J owns a direct interest in Y during Y's taxable year and has gross income for J's taxable year from interest charged to Y; and J's share of Y's self-charged interest deductions includes passive activity deductions. Accordingly, paragraph (c) of this section applies in determining J's passive activity gross income. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the applicable percentage of J's interest income is recharacterized as passive activity gross income attributable to the rental activity. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides that the applicable percentage is obtained by dividing J's share for the taxable year of Y's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the rental activity ($6,000) by the greater of J's share for the taxable year of Y's self-charged interest deductions ($8,000), or J's income for the taxable year from interest charged to Y ($8,000). Thus, J's applicable percentage is 75 percent ($6,000/$8,000), and $6,000 (75 percent × $8,000) of J's income from interest charged to Y is treated as passive activity gross income from the rental activity J conducts through Y.
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the applicable percentage of J's interest income is recharacterized as passive activity gross income attributable to the passive trade or business activity. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides that the applicable percentage is obtained by dividing J's share for the taxable year of Y's self-charged interest deductions that are treated as passive activity deductions from the passive trade or business activity ($2,000) by the greater of J's share for the taxable year of Y's self-charged interest deductions ($8,000), or J's income for the taxable year from interest charged to Y ($8,000). Thus, J's applicable percentage is 25 percent ($2,000/$8,000), and $2,000 of J's income from interest charged to Y is treated as passive activity gross income from the passive trade or business activity J conducts through Y.
[T.D. 9013, 67 FR 54089, Aug. 21, 2002]
§ 1.469-8
Application of section 469 to trust, estates, and their beneficiaries. [Reserved]
§ 1.469-9
Rules for certain rental real estate activities.
(a)
Scope and purpose.
This section provides guidance to taxpayers engaged in certain real property trades or businesses on applying section 469(c)(7) to their rental real estate activities.
(b)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:
(1)
Trade or business.
A
trade or business
is any trade or business determined by treating the types of activities in § 1.469-4(b)(1) as if they involved the conduct of a trade or business, and any interest in rental real estate, including any interest in rental real estate that gives rise to deductions under section 212.
(2)
Real property trade or business.
The following terms have the following meanings in determining whether a trade or business is a real property trade or business for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section.
(i)
Real property
—(A)
In general.
The term
real property
includes land, buildings, and other inherently permanent structures that are permanently affixed to land. Any interest in real property, including fee ownership, co-ownership, a leasehold, an option, or a similar interest is real property under this section. Tenant improvements to land, buildings, or other structures that are inherently permanent or otherwise classified as real property under this section are real property for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C). However, property manufactured or produced for sale that is not real property in the hands of the manufacturer or producer, but that may be incorporated into real property through installation or any similar process or technique by any person after the manufacture or production of such property (for example, bricks, nails, paint, and windowpanes), is not treated as real property in the hands of any person (including any person involved in the manufacture, production, sale, incorporation or installation of such property) prior to the completed incorporation or installation of such property into the real property for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section.
(B)
Land.
The term
land
includes water and air space superjacent to land and natural products and deposits that are unsevered from the land. Natural products and deposits, such as plants, crops, trees, water, ores, and minerals, cease to be real property when they are
harvested, severed, extracted, or removed from the land. Accordingly, any trade or business that involves the cultivation and harvesting of plants, crops, or certain types of trees in a farming operation as defined in section 464(e), or severing, extracting, or removing natural products or deposits from land is not a real property trade or business for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section. The storage or maintenance of severed or extracted natural products or deposits, such as plants, crops, trees, water, ores, and minerals, in or upon real property does not cause the stored property to be recharacterized as real property, and any trade or business relating to or involving such storage or maintenance of severed or extracted natural products or deposits is not a real property trade or business, even though such storage or maintenance otherwise may occur upon or within real property.
(C)
Inherently permanent structure.
The term
inherently permanent structure
means any permanently affixed building or other permanently affixed structure. If the affixation is reasonably expected to last indefinitely, based on all the facts and circumstances, the affixation is considered permanent. However, an asset that serves an active function, such as an item of machinery or equipment (for example, HVAC system, elevator or escalator), is not a building or other inherently permanent structure, and therefore is not real property for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section, even if such item of machinery or equipment is permanently affixed to or becomes incorporated within a building or other inherently permanent structure. Accordingly, a trade or business that involves the manufacture, installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of any asset that serves an active function will not be a real property trade or business, or a unit or component of another real property trade or business, for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section.
(D)
Building
—(
1
)
In general.
A
building
encloses a space within its walls and is generally covered by a roof or other external upper covering that protects the walls and inner space from the elements.
(

)
Types of buildings.
Buildings include the following assets if permanently affixed to land: Houses; townhouses; apartments; condominiums; hotels; motels; stadiums; arenas; shopping malls; factory and office buildings; warehouses; barns; enclosed garages; enclosed transportation stations and terminals; and stores.
(E)
Other inherently permanent structures
—(

)
In general.
Other inherently permanent structures include the following assets if permanently affixed to land: Parking facilities; bridges; tunnels; roadbeds; railroad tracks; pipelines; storage structures such as silos and oil and gas storage tanks; and stationary wharves and docks.
(

)
Facts and circumstances determination.
The determination of whether an asset is an inherently permanent structure is based on all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account:
(
i
) The manner in which the asset is affixed to land and whether such manner of affixation allows the asset to be easily removed from the land;
(
ii
) Whether the asset is designed to be removed or to remain in place indefinitely on the land;
(
iii
) The damage that removal of the asset would cause to the asset itself or to the land to which it is affixed;
(
iv
) Any circumstances that suggest the expected period of affixation is not indefinite (for example, a lease that requires or permits removal of the asset from the land upon the expiration of the lease); and
(
v
) The time and expense required to move the asset from the land.

Other definitions
(A)
Real property development.
The term
real property development
means the maintenance and improvement of raw land to make the land suitable for subdivision, further development, or construction of residential or commercial buildings, or to establish, cultivate, maintain or improve timberlands (that is, land covered by timber-producing forest). Improvement of land may include any clearing (such as through the mechanical separation and removal of boulders, rocks, brush,
brushwood, and underbrush from the land); excavation and gradation work; diversion or redirection of creeks, streams, rivers, or other sources or bodies of water; and the installation of roads (including highways, streets, roads, public sidewalks, and bridges), utility lines, sewer and drainage systems, and any other infrastructure that may be necessary for subdivision, further development, or construction of residential or commercial buildings, or for the establishment, cultivation, maintenance or improvement of timberlands.
(B)
Real property redevelopment.
The term
real property redevelopment
means the demolition, deconstruction, separation, and removal of existing buildings, landscaping, and infrastructure on a parcel of land to return the land to a raw condition or otherwise prepare the land for new development or construction, or for the establishment and cultivation of new timberlands.
(C) through (G) [Reserved]
(H)
Real property operation.
The term
real property operation
means handling, by a direct or indirect owner of the real property, the day-to-day operations of a trade or business, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, relating to the maintenance and occupancy of the real property that affect the availability and functionality of that real property used, or held out for use, by customers where payments received from customers are principally for the customers' use of the real property. The principal purpose of such business operations must be the provision of the use of the real property, or physical space accorded by or within the real property, to one or more customers, and not the provision of other significant or extraordinary personal services, under § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iv) and (v), to customers in conjunction with the customers' incidental use of the real property or physical space. If the real property or physical space is provided to a customer to be used to carry on the customer's trade or business, the principal purpose of the business operations must be to provide the customer with exclusive use of the real property or physical space in furtherance of the customer's trade or business, and not to provide other significant or extraordinary personal services to the customer in addition to or in conjunction with the use of the real property or physical space, regardless of whether the customer pays for the services separately. However, for purposes of and with respect to the preceding sentence, other incidental personal services may be provided to the customer in conjunction with the use of real property or physical space, as long as such services are insubstantial in relation to the customer's use of the real property or physical space.
(I)
Real property management.
The term
real property management
means handling, by a professional manager, the day-to-day operations of a trade or business, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, relating to the maintenance and occupancy of real property that affect the availability and functionality of that property used, or held out for use, by customers where payments received from customers are principally for the customers' use of the real property. The principal purpose of such business operations must be the provision of the use of the real property, or physical space accorded by or within the real property, to one or more customers, and not the provision of other significant or extraordinary personal services, under § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iv) and (v), to customers in conjunction with the customers' incidental use of the real property or physical space. If the real property or physical space is provided to a customer to be used to carry on the customer's trade or business, the principal purpose of the business operations must be to provide the customer with exclusive use of the real property or physical space in furtherance of the customer's trade or business, and not to provide other significant or extraordinary personal services to the customer in addition to or in conjunction with the use of the real property or physical space, regardless of whether the customer pays for the services separately. However, for purposes of and with respect to the preceding sentence, other incidental personal services may be provided to the customer in conjunction with the use of real property or physical space, as long as such services are insubstantial in relation to the customer's use of the
real property or physical space. A professional manager is a person responsible, on a full-time basis, for the overall management and oversight of the real property or properties and who is not a direct or indirect owner of the real property or properties.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of this paragraph (b)(2):
(A)
Example 1.
A owns farmland and uses the land in A's farming business to grow and harvest crops of various kinds. As part of this farming business, A utilizes a greenhouse that is an inherently permanent structure to grow certain crops during the winter months. Under the rules of this section, any trade or business that involves the cultivation and harvesting of plants, crops, or trees is not a real property trade or business for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section, even though the cultivation and harvesting of crops occurs upon or within real property. Accordingly, under these facts, A is not engaged in a real property trade or business for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section.
(B)
Example 2.
B is a retired farmer and owns farmland that B rents exclusively to C to operate a farm. The arrangement between B and C is a trade or business (under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) where payments by C are principally for C's use of B's real property. B also provides certain farm equipment for C's use. However, C is solely responsible for the maintenance and repair of the farm equipment along with any costs associated with operating the equipment. B also occasionally provides oral advice to C regarding various aspects of the farm operation, based on B's prior experience as a farmer. Other than the provision of this occasional advice, B does not provide any significant or extraordinary personal services to C in connection with the rental of the farmland to C. Under these facts, B is engaged in a real property trade or business (which does not include the use or deemed rental of any farm equipment) for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section, and B's oral advice is an incidental personal service that B provides in conjunction with C's use of the real property. Nevertheless, under these facts, C is not engaged in a real property trade or business for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section because C is engaged in the business of farming.
(C)
Example 3.
D owns a building in which D operates a restaurant and bar. Even though D provides customers with use of the physical space inside the building, D is not engaged in a trade or business where payments by customers are principally for the use of real property or physical space. Instead, the payments by D's customers are principally for the receipt of significant or extraordinary personal services (under § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iv) and (v)), mainly food and beverage preparation and presentation services, and the use of the physical space by customers is incidental to the receipt of these personal services. Under the rules of this section, any trade or business that involves the provision of significant or extraordinary personal services to customers in conjunction with the customers' incidental use of real property or physical space is not a real property trade or business, even though the business operations occur upon or within real property. Accordingly, under these facts, D is not engaged in a real property trade or business for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section.
(D)
Example 4.
E owns a majority interest in an S corporation, X, that is engaged in the trade or business of manufacturing industrial cooling systems for installation in commercial buildings and for other uses. E also owns a majority interest in an S corporation, Y, that purchases the industrial cooling systems from X and that installs, maintains, and repairs those systems in both existing commercial buildings and commercial buildings under construction. Under the rules of this section, any trade or business that involves the manufacture, installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of any machinery or equipment that serves an active function will not be a real property trade or business (or a unit or component of another real property trade or business) for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section, even though the machinery or equipment will be permanently affixed to real property once it is installed. In
this case, the industrial cooling systems are machinery or equipment that serves an active function. Accordingly, under these facts, E, X and Y will not be treated as engaged in one or more real property trades or businesses for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section.
(E)
Example 5.
(
1
) F owns an interest in P, a limited partnership. P owns and operates a luxury hotel. In addition to providing rooms and suites for use by customers, the hotel offers many additional amenities such as in-room food and beverage service, maid and linen service, parking valet service, concierge service, front desk and bellhop service, dry cleaning and laundry service, and in-room barber and hairdresser service. P contracted with M to provide maid and janitorial services to P's hotel. M is an S corporation principally engaged in the trade or business of providing maid and janitorial services to various types of businesses, including hotels. G is a professional manager employed by M who handles the day-to-day business operations relating to M's provision of maid and janitorial services to M's various customers, including P.
(
2
) Even though the personal services that P provides to the customers of its hotel are significant personal services under § 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iv), the principal purpose of P's hotel business operations is the provision of use of the hotel's rooms and suites to customers, and not the provision of the significant personal services to P's customers in conjunction with the customers' incidental use of those rooms or suites. The provision of these significant personal services by P to P's customers is incidental to the customers' use of the hotel's real property. Accordingly, under these facts, F is treated as owning an interest in a real property trade or business conducted by or through P and P is treated as engaged in a real property trade or business for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section.
(
3
) With respect to the maid and janitorial services provided by M, M's operations affect the availability and functionality of real property used, or held out for use, by customers in a trade or business where payments by customers are principally for the use of real property (in this case, P's hotel). However, M does not operate or manage real property. Instead, M is engaged in a trade or business of providing maid and janitorial services to customers, such as P, that are engaged in real property trades or businesses. Thus, M's business operations are merely ancillary to real property trades or businesses. Therefore, M is not engaged in real property operations or management as defined in this section. Accordingly, under these facts, M is not engaged in a real property trade or business under section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section.
(
4
) With respect to the day-to-day business operations that G handles as a professional manager of M, the business operations that G manages is not the provision of use of P's hotel rooms and suites to customers. G does not operate or manage real property. Instead, G manages the provision of maid and janitorial services to customers, including P's hotel. Therefore, G is not engaged in real property management as defined in this section. Accordingly, under these facts, G is not engaged in a real property trade or business under section 469(c)(7)(C) and this section.
(3)
Rental real estate. Rental real estate
is any real property used by customers or held for use by customers in a rental activity within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3). However, any rental real estate that the taxpayer grouped with a trade or business activity under § 1.469-4(d)(1)(i)(A) or (C) is not an interest in rental real estate for purposes of this section.
(4)
Personal services. Personal services
means any work performed by an individual in connection with a trade or business. However, personal services do not include any work performed by an individual in the individual's capacity as an investor as described in § 1.469-5T(f)(2)(ii).
(5)
Material participation. Material participation
has the same meaning as under § 1.469-5T. Paragraph (f) of this section contains rules applicable to limited partnership interests in rental real estate that a qualifying taxpayer elects to aggregate with other interests in rental real estate of that taxpayer.
(6)
Qualifying taxpayer.
A
qualifying taxpayer
is a taxpayer that owns at
least one interest in rental real estate and meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Requirements for qualifying taxpayers
—(1)
In general.
A qualifying taxpayer must meet the requirements of section 469(c)(7)(B).
(2)
Closely held C corporations.
A closely held C corporation meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section by satisfying the requirements of section 469(c)(7)(D)(i). For purposes of section 469(c)(7)(D)(i), gross receipts do not include items of portfolio income within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3).
(3)
Requirement of material participation in the real property trades or businesses.
A taxpayer must materially participate in a real property trade or business in order for the personal services provided by the taxpayer in that real property trade or business to count towards meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(4)
Treatment of spouses.
Spouses filing a joint return are qualifying taxpayers only if one spouse separately satisfies both requirements of section 469(c)(7)(B). In determining the real property trades or businesses in which a married taxpayer materially participates (but not for any other purpose under this paragraph (c)), work performed by the taxpayer's spouse in a trade or business is treated as work performed by the taxpayer under § 1.469-5T(f)(3), regardless of whether the spouses file a joint return for the year.
(5)
Employees in real property trades or businesses.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, personal services performed during a taxable year as an employee generally will be treated as performed in a trade or business but will not be treated as performed in a real property trade or business, unless the taxpayer is a five-percent owner (within the meaning of section 416(i)(1)(B)) in the employer. If an employee is not a five-percent owner in the employer at all times during the taxable year, only the personal services performed by the employee during the period the employee is a five-percent owner in the employer will be treated as performed in a real property trade or business.
(d)
General rule for determining real property trades or businesses
—(1)
Facts and circumstances.
The determination of a taxpayer's real property trades or businesses for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. A taxpayer may use any reasonable method of applying the facts and circumstances in determining the real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer provides personal services. Depending on the facts and circumstances, a real property trade or business consists either of one or more than one trade or business specifically described in section 469(c)(7)(C). A taxpayer's grouping of activities under § 1.469-4 does not control the determination of the taxpayer's real property trades or businesses under this paragraph (d).
(2)
Consistency requirement.
Once a taxpayer determines the real property trades or businesses in which personal services are provided for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the taxpayer may not redetermine those real property trades or businesses in subsequent taxable years unless the original determination was clearly inappropriate or there has been a material change in the facts and circumstances that makes the original determination clearly inappropriate.
(e)
Treatment of rental real estate activities of a qualifying taxpayer
—(1)
In general.
Section 469(c)(2) does not apply to any rental real estate activity of a taxpayer for a taxable year in which the taxpayer is a qualifying taxpayer under paragraph (c) of this section. Instead, a rental real estate activity of a qualifying taxpayer is a passive activity under section 469 for the taxable year unless the taxpayer materially participates in the activity. Each interest in rental real estate of a qualifying taxpayer will be treated as a separate rental real estate activity, unless the taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (g) of this section to treat all interests in rental real estate as a single rental real estate activity. Each separate rental real estate activity, or the single combined rental real estate
activity if the taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (g), will be an activity of the taxpayer for all purposes of section 469, including the former passive activity rules under section 469(f) and the disposition rules under section 469(g). However, section 469 will continue to be applied separately with respect to each publicly traded partnership, as required under section 469(k), notwithstanding the rules of this section.
(2)
Treatment as a former passive activity.
For any taxable year in which a qualifying taxpayer materially participates in a rental real estate activity, that rental real estate activity will be treated as a former passive activity under section 469(f) if disallowed deductions or credits are allocated to the activity under § 1.469-1(f)(4).
(3)
Grouping rental real estate activities with other activities
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a qualifying taxpayer may not group a rental real estate activity with any other activity of the taxpayer. For example, if a qualifying taxpayer develops real property, constructs buildings, and owns an interest in rental real estate, the taxpayer's interest in rental real estate may not be grouped with the taxpayer's development activity or construction activity. Thus, only the participation of the taxpayer with respect to the rental real estate may be used to determine if the taxpayer materially participates in the rental real estate activity under § 1.469-5T.
(ii)
Special rule for certain management activities.
A qualifying taxpayer may participate in a rental real estate activity through participation, within the meaning of §§ 1.469-5(f) and 5T(f), in an activity involving the management of rental real estate (even if this management activity is conducted through a separate entity). In determining whether the taxpayer materially participates in the rental real estate activity, however, work the taxpayer performs in the management activity is taken into account only to the extent it is performed in managing the taxpayer's own rental real estate interests.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e).

# Example.
(i) Taxpayer
B
owns interests in three rental buildings,
U, V
and
W.
In 1995,
B
has $30,000 of disallowed passive losses allocable to Building
U
and $10,000 of disallowed passive losses allocable to Building
V
under § 1.469-1(f)(4). In 1996,
B
has $5,000 of net income from Building
U,
$5,000 of net losses from Building
V,
and $10,000 of net income from Building
W.
Also in 1996,
B
is a qualifying taxpayer within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. Each building is treated as a separate activity of
B
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, unless
B
makes the election under paragraph (g) to treat the three buildings as a single rental real estate activity. If the buildings are treated as separate activities, material participation is determined separately with respect to each building. If
B
makes the election under paragraph (g) to treat the buildings as a single activity, all participation relating to the buildings is aggregated in determining whether
B
materially participates in the combined activity.
(ii) Effective beginning in 1996,
B
makes the election under paragraph (g) to treat the three buildings as a single rental real estate activity.
B
works full-time managing the three buildings and thus materially participates in the combined activity in 1996 (even if
B
conducts this management function through a separate entity, including a closely held C corporation). Accordingly, the combined activity is not a passive activity of
B
in 1996. Moreover, as a result of the election under paragraph (g), disallowed passive losses of $40,000 ($30,000
+
$10,000) are allocated to the combined activity. B's net income from the activity for 1996 is $10,000 ($5,000−$5,000
+
$10,000). This net income is nonpassive income for purposes of section 469. However, under section 469(f), the net income from a former passive activity may be offset with the disallowed passive losses from the same activity. Because Buildings
U, V
and
W
are treated as one activity for all purposes of section 469 due to the election under paragraph (g), and this activity is a former passive activity under section 469(f),
B
may offset the $10,000 of net income from the buildings with an equal amount of disallowed passive losses allocable to the buildings, regardless of which buildings produced the income or losses. As a result,
B
has $30,000 ($40,000−$10,000) of disallowed passive losses remaining from the buildings after 1996.
(f)
Limited partnership interests in rental real estate activities
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer elects under paragraph (g) of this section to treat all interests in rental real estate as a single rental real estate activity, and at least one interest in rental real estate is held by the taxpayer as a limited partnership interest (within the meaning of § 1.469-
5T(e)(3)), the combined rental real estate activity will be treated as a limited partnership interest of the taxpayer for purposes of determining material participation. Accordingly, the taxpayer will not be treated under this section as materially participating in the combined rental real estate activity unless the taxpayer materially participates in the activity under the tests listed in § 1.469-5T(e)(2) (dealing with the tests for determining the material participation of a limited partner).
(2)
De minimis exception.
If a qualifying taxpayer elects under paragraph (g) of this section to treat all interests in rental real estate as a single rental real estate activity, and the taxpayer's share of gross rental income from all of the taxpayer's limited partnership interests in rental real estate is less than ten percent of the taxpayer's share of gross rental income from all of the taxpayer's interests in rental real estate for the taxable year, paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply. Thus the taxpayer may determine material participation under any of the tests listed in § 1.469-5T(a) that apply to rental real estate activities.
(g)
Election to treat all interests in rental real estate as a single rental real estate activity
—(1)
In general.
A qualifying taxpayer may make an election to treat all of the taxpayer's interests in rental real estate as a single rental real estate activity. This election is binding for the taxable year in which it is made and for all future years in which the taxpayer is a qualifying taxpayer under paragraph (c) of this section, even if there are intervening years in which the taxpayer is not a qualifying taxpayer. The election may be made in any year in which the taxpayer is a qualifying taxpayer, and the failure to make the election in one year does not preclude the taxpayer from making the election in a subsequent year. In years in which the taxpayer is not a qualifying taxpayer, the election will not have effect and the taxpayer's activities will be those determined under § 1.469-4. If there is a material change in the taxpayer's facts and circumstances, the taxpayer may revoke the election using the procedure described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(2)
Certain changes not material.
The fact that an election is less advantageous to the taxpayer in a particular taxable year is not, of itself, a material change in the taxpayer's facts and circumstances. Similarly, a break in the taxpayer's status as a qualifying taxpayer is not, of itself, a material change in the taxpayer's facts and circumstances.
(3)
Filing a statement to make or revoke the election.
A qualifying taxpayer makes the election to treat all interests in rental real estate as a single rental real estate activity by filing a statement with the taxpayer's original income tax return for the taxable year. This statement must contain a declaration that the taxpayer is a qualifying taxpayer for the taxable year and is making the election pursuant to section 469(c)(7)(A). The taxpayer may make this election for any taxable year in which section 469(c)(7) is applicable. A taxpayer may revoke the election only in the taxable year in which a material change in the taxpayer's facts and circumstances occurs or in a subsequent year in which the facts and circumstances remain materially changed from those in the taxable year for which the election was made. To revoke the election, the taxpayer must file a statement with the taxpayer's original income tax return for the year of revocation. This statement must contain a declaration that the taxpayer is revoking the election under section 469(c)(7)(A) and an explanation of the nature of the material change.
(h)
Interests in rental real estate held by certain passthrough entities
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, a qualifying taxpayer's interest in rental real estate held by a partnership or an S corporation (passthrough entity) is treated as a single interest in rental real estate if the passthrough entity grouped its rental real estate as one rental activity under § 1.469-4(d)(5). If the passthrough entity grouped its rental real estate into separate rental activities under § 1.469-4(d)(5), each rental real estate activity of the passthrough entity will be treated as a separate interest in rental real estate of the qualifying taxpayer. However, the qualifying taxpayer may elect under paragraph (g) of
this section to treat all interests in rental real estate, including the rental real estate interests held through passthrough entities, as a single rental real estate activity.
(2)
Special rule if a qualifying taxpayer holds a fifty-percent or greater interest in a passthrough entity.
If a qualifying taxpayer owns, directly or indirectly, a fifty-percent or greater interest in the capital, profits, or losses of a passthrough entity for a taxable year, each interest in rental real estate held by the passthrough entity will be treated as a separate interest in rental real estate of the qualifying taxpayer, regardless of the passthrough entity's grouping of activities under § 1.469-4(d)(5). However, the qualifying taxpayer may elect under paragraph (g) of this section to treat all interests in rental real estate, including the rental real estate interests held through passthrough entities, as a single rental real estate activity.
(3)
Special rule for interests held in tiered passthrough entities.
If a passthrough entity owns a fifty-percent or greater interest in the capital, profits, or losses of another passthrough entity for a taxable year, each interest in rental real estate held by the lower-tier entity will be treated as a separate interest in rental real estate of the upper-tier entity, regardless of the lower-tier entity's grouping of activities under § 1.469-4(d)(5).
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
$25,000 offset for rental real estate activities of qualifying taxpayers
—(1)
In general.
A qualifying taxpayer's passive losses and credits from rental real estate activities (including prior-year disallowed passive activity losses and credits from rental real estate activities in which the taxpayer materially participates) are allowed to the extent permitted under section 469(i). The amount of losses or credits allowable under section 469(i) is determined after the rules of this section are applied. However, losses allowable by reason of this section are not taken into account in determining adjusted gross income for purposes of section 469(i)(3).
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (j).

# Example.
(i) Taxpayer
A
owns building
X
and building
Y,
both interests in rental real estate. In 1995,
A
is a qualifying taxpayer within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section.
A
does not elect to treat
X
and
Y
as one activity under section 469(c)(7)(A) and paragraph (g) of this section. As a result,
X
and
Y
are treated as separate activities pursuant to section 469(c)(7)(A)(ii).
A
materially participates in
X
which has $100,000 of passive losses disallowed from prior years and produces $20,000 of losses in 1995.
A
does not materially participate in
Y
which produces $40,000 of income in 1995.
A
also has $50,000 of income from other nonpassive sources in 1995.
A
otherwise meets the requirements of section 469(i).
(ii) Because
X
is not a passive activity in 1995, the $20,000 of losses produced by
X
in 1995 are nonpassive losses that may be used by
A
to offset part of the $50,000 of nonpassive income. Accordingly,
A
is left with $30,000 ($50,000-$20,000) of nonpassive income. In addition, A may use the prior year disallowed passive losses of
X
to offset any income from
X
and passive income from other sources. Therefore,
A
may offset the $40,000 of passive income from
Y
with $40,000 of passive losses from
X.
(iii) Because
A
has $60,000 ($100,000-$40,000) of passive losses remaining from
X
and meets all of the requirements of section 469(i),
A
may offset up to $25,000 of nonpassive income with passive losses from
X
pursuant to section 469(i). As a result,
A
has $5,000 ($30,000-$25,000) of nonpassive income remaining and disallowed passive losses from
X
of $35,000 ($60,000-$25,000) in 1995.

Additional effective dates
—(1)
Application of 1992 amendments for taxable years beginning before October 4, 1994.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for taxable years that end after May 10, 1992, and begin before October 4, 1994, a taxpayer may determine tax liability in accordance with Project PS-1-89 published at 1992-1 C.B. 1219 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).
(2)
Additional transition rule for 1992 amendments.
If a taxpayer's first taxable year ending after May 10, 1992, begins on or before that date, the taxpayer may treat the taxable year, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, as a taxable year ending on or before May 10, 1992.
(3)
Fresh starts under consistency rules
—(i)
Regrouping when tax liability is first determined under Project PS-1-89.
For the first taxable year in which a taxpayer determines its tax liability under Project PS-1-89, the taxpayer may regroup its activities without regard to the manner in which the activities were grouped in the preceding taxable year and must regroup its activities if the grouping in the preceding taxable year is inconsistent with the rules of Project PS-1-89.
(ii)
Regrouping when tax liability is first determined under § 1.469-4.
For the first taxable year in which a taxpayer determines its tax liability under § 1.469-4, rather than under the rules of Project PS-1-89, the taxpayer may regroup its activities without regard to the manner in which the activities were grouped in the preceding taxable year and must regroup its activities if the grouping in the preceding taxable year is inconsistent with the rules of § 1.469-4.
(iii)
Regrouping when taxpayer is first subject to section 469(c)(7).
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1993, a taxpayer may regroup its activities to the extent necessary or appropriate to avail itself of the provisions of section 469(c)(7) and without regard to the manner in which the activities were grouped in the preceding taxable year.
(iv)
Regrouping for taxpayers subject to section 1411
—(A)
In general.
If an individual, estate, or trust meets the Eligibility Criteria, as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, such individual, estate, or trust, in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013, in which section 1411 would apply to such taxpayer, may regroup its activities without regard to the manner in which the activities were grouped in the preceding taxable year. For this purpose, the determination of whether a taxpayer meets the Eligibility Criteria is made without regard to the effect of regrouping. The regrouping must be made in the manner prescribed by forms, instructions, or in other guidance on an original return for the taxable year for which the regrouping is done. A taxpayer that is an individual, estate, or trust may regroup its activities for any taxable year that begins during 2013, if the individual, estate, or trust meets the Eligibility Criteria for such year. A taxpayer may regroup activities only once pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3)(iv), and a regrouping made pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3)(iv) will apply to the taxable year for which the regrouping is done and all subsequent years.
(B)
Eligibility criteria.
The term
Eligibility Criteria
means that an individual, estate, or trust has net investment income (as defined in § 1.1411-4) and such individual's (as defined in § 1.1411-2(a)) modified adjusted gross income (as defined in § 1.1411-2(c)) exceeds the applicable threshold in § 1.1411-2(d) or such estate's or trust's (as defined in § 1.1411-3(a)(1)(i)) adjusted gross income exceeds the amount described in § 1.1411-3(a)(1)(ii)(B)(
2
).
(C)
Consequences of amended returns and examination adjustments
—(
1
)
Taxpayers first subject to section 1411.
An individual, estate, or trust also may regroup activities, in the manner described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, on an amended return only if the changes reported on such amended return cause the taxpayer to meet the Eligibility Criteria for the first time beginning in the taxable year for which the amended return is applicable and that the taxable year is not closed by the period of limitations on assessments under section 6501. If the amended return is for a tax year that precedes a tax year for which a taxpayer had regrouped its activities pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, the regrouping on such amended return must be consistent with the taxpayer's subsequent year's regrouping. If a regrouping on an amended return is inconsistent with a subsequent year's grouping, the subsequent year's grouping is invalid under § 1.469-4(e)(1) unless a material change in facts and circumstances occurred in the subsequent year such that the subsequent year's grouping constitutes a permissible regrouping under § 1.469-4(e)(2). Similar rules also apply for any taxable year that begins during 2013.
(
2
)
Taxpayers ceasing to be subject to section 1411.
In the event a taxpayer regroups activities pursuant to paragraphs (b)(3)(iv)(A) or (C) of this section and it is subsequently determined that such taxpayer does not meet the Eligibility Criteria for the year of such regrouping, such regrouping will have no effect for that year and all future years. Appropriate adjustments should be made to reflect the voiding of the ineffective regrouping. However, notwithstanding the previous sentence, if an individual, estate, or trust meets the Eligibility Criteria in a subsequent year, such taxpayer is deemed to treat such regrouping as being made in such
subsequent year unless the taxpayer either regroups in a different manner (so long as such alternative regrouping is permissible under § 1.469-4) or properly reflects the ineffective regrouping in the previous year. The subsequent year's regrouping may be made on an original or on an amended return for that year. This paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)(
2
) shall not apply if a taxpayer does not meet the Eligibility Criteria for the year of such regrouping as a result of the carryback of a net operating loss pursuant to section 172. Similar rules also apply for any taxable year that begins during 2013.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section. In each example, unless otherwise indicated, the taxpayer uses a calendar taxable year, the taxpayer is a United States citizen, and Year 1 is a taxable year in which section 1411 is in effect:

# Example 1.
In Year 1, X, a single individual, reports modified adjusted gross income (as defined in § 1.1411-2(c)) of $198,000 (including $12,000 of net investment income (as defined in § 1.1411-4)); thus is not subject to 1411. After X filed his original return, X receives a corrected Form 1099-DIV, which increases his modified adjusted gross income (as defined in § 1.1411-2(c)) and his net investment income by $2,500. X files an amended return for Year 1 in Year 2 reporting modified adjusted gross income of $200,500 and net investment income of $14,500. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section, X may regroup his passive activities on an amended return, because X now has MAGI above the applicable threshold amount and net investment income.

# Example 2.
Same facts as
Example 1,
except that the $2,500 increase to modified adjusted gross income and net investment income was a result of an examination of X's Year 1 return. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section, X may regroup his passive activities on an amended return.

# Example 3.
In Year 1, Y, a single individual reported modified adjusted gross income (as defined in § 1.1411-2(c)) of $205,000 and net investment income (as defined in § 1.1411-4) of $500. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, Y regrouped his four passive activities, A, B, C, and D, into a single activity group. Prior to the Year 1 regrouping, Y had grouped A and B into one group, and treated each of C and D as separate activities. Y did not meet the Eligibly Criteria in any year prior to Year 1 or Year 2. In Year 3, Y's employer issued Y a corrected Year 1 Form W-2, which reduced Y's taxable wages by $6,000. As a result, Y no longer meets the Eligibility Criteria in Year 1 because Y's modified adjusted gross income is now $199,000. Therefore, Y's Year 1 regrouping is no longer effective and the prior groupings are in effect (that is, Activity A and B are one group and Activity C and Activity D separately). Appropriate adjustments should be made to reflect the ineffective regrouping. However, if Y had a material change in facts and circumstances such that Y could regroup in Year 1 or a subsequent year, as applicable, by reason of § 1.469-4(e)(2), then the regrouping will be deemed to occur. Y could designate a different regrouping for the year of the material change in facts and circumstances.

# Example 4.
Same facts as
Example 3,
except that Y met the Eligibly Criteria in Year 2. In this case, Y's Year 1 regrouping is no longer effective and Y must report his income consistent with the pre-Year 1 groupings. In Year 2, Y has three options. First, without any action by Y, Y's activities are regrouped as originally reported in Year 1. In this case, the regrouping from the Year 1 return is deemed to occur on the Year 2 return. This option is the default option. Second, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)(
2
) of this section, Y may file an amended return to report his income consistent with groupings in effect prior to Year 1. Third, Y may file an original or an amended return to regroup in a manner different from groupings in effect prior to Year 1 and different from the Year 1 groupings (for example, Y could choose to group Activity C and D into a single activity, thus causing Y to have two groups; Group A-B and Group C-D).
(D)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013. However, taxpayers may apply this section to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012.
(4)
Certain investment credit property.
(i) The rules contained in § 1.469-3(f) apply with respect to property placed in service after December 31, 1990 (other than property described in section 11813 (c)(2) of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508)).
(ii) The rules contained in 26 CFR 1.469-3T(f) (as contained in the CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1992) apply with respect to property placed in service on or before December 31, 1990, and property described in section 11813(c)(2) of the Omnibus Reconcilation Act of 1990.
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Application of certain income recharacterization rules and
self-charged rules
—(i)
Certain recharacterization rules inapplicable in 1987.
No amount of gross income shall be treated under § 1.469-2T(f)(3) through (7) as income that is not from a passive activity for any taxable year of the taxpayer beginning before January 1, 1988.
(ii)
Property rented to a nonpassive activity.
In applying § 1.469-2(f)(6) or § 1.469-2T(f)(6) to a taxpayer's rental of an item of property, the taxpayer's net rental activity income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2(f)(9)(iv) or § 1.469-2T(f)(9)(iv)) from the property for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1987, does not include the portion of the income (if any) that is attributable to the rental of that item of property pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before February 19, 1988.
(iii)
Self-charged rules.
For taxable years beginning before June 4, 1991—
(
1
) A taxpayer is not required to apply the rules in § 1.469-7 in computing the taxpayer's passive activity loss and passive activity credit; and
(
2
) A taxpayer that owns an interest in a passthrough entity may use any reasonable method of offsetting items of interest income and interest expense from lending transactions between the passthrough entity and its owners or between identically-owned passthrough entities (as defined in § 1.469-7(e)) to compute the taxpayer's passive activity loss and passive activity credit. Items from nonlending transactions cannot be offset under the self-charged rules.
(2)
Qualified low-income housing projects.
For a transitional rule concerning the application of section 469 to losses from qualified low-income housing projects, see section 502 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
(3)
Effect of events occurring in years prior to 1987.
The treatment for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, of any item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit as an item of passive activity gross income, passive activity deduction, or credit from a passive activity, is determined as if section 469 and the regulations thereunder had been in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, but without regard to any passive activity loss or passive activity credit that would have been disallowed for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, if section 469 and the regulations thereunder had been in effect for that year. For example, in determining whether a taxpayer materially participates in an activity under § 1.469-5T(a)(5) (relating to taxpayers who have materially participated in an activity for five of the ten immediately preceding taxable years) for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, the taxpayer's participation in the activity for all prior taxable years (including taxable years beginning before 1987) is taken into account. See § 1.469-5(j) (relating to the determination of material participation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987).
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c) of this section:

# Example 1.
A, a calendar year individual, is a partner in a partnership with a taxable year ending on January 31. During its taxable year ending January 31, 1987, the partnership was engaged in a single activity involving the conduct of a trade or business. In applying section 469 and the regulations thereunder to A for calendar year 1987, A's distributive share of partnership items for the partnership's taxable year ending January 31, 1987, is taken into account. Therefore, under § 1.469-2T(e)(1) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section, A's participation in the activity throughout the partnership's taxable year beginning February 1, 1986, and ending January 31, 1987, is taken into account for purposes of determining the character under section 469 of the items of gross income, deduction, and credit allocated to A for the partnership's taxable year ending January 31, 1987.

# Example 2.
B, a calendar year individual, is a beneficiary of a trust described in section 651 that has a taxable year ending January 31. The trust conducts a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)). Because the trust's taxable year ending January 31, 1987, began before January 1, 1987, section 469 and the regulations thereunder do not applying to the trust for that year. Section 469 and the regulations thereunder do apply, however, to B for B's calendar year 1987. Therefore, income of the trust from the rental activity for the trust's taxable year ending January 31, 1987, that is included in
B's gross income for 1987 is taken into account in apply section 469 to B for 1987.
[T.D. 8417, 57 FR 20759, May 15, 1992, as amended by T.D. 8417, 59 FR 45623, Sept. 2, 1994; T.D. 8565, 59 FR 50489, Oct. 4, 1994; T.D. 8645, 60 FR 66501, Dec. 22, 1995; T.D. 9013, 67 FR 54093, Aug. 21, 2002; T.D. 9644, 78 FR 72421, Dec. 2, 2013; 79 FR 18159, Apr. 1, 2014; T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56842, Sept. 14, 2020; T.D. 9943, 86 FR 5540, Jan. 19, 2021]

# inventories
§ 1.471-1
Need for inventories.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, in order to reflect taxable income correctly, inventories at the beginning and end of each taxable year are necessary in every case in which the production, purchase, or sale of merchandise is an income-producing factor. The inventory should include all finished or partly finished goods and, in the case of raw materials and supplies, only those which have been acquired for sale or which will physically become a part of merchandise intended for sale, in which class fall containers, such as kegs, bottles, and cases, whether returnable or not, if title thereto will pass to the purchaser of the product to be sold therein. Merchandise should be included in the inventory only if title thereto is vested in the taxpayer. Accordingly, the seller should include in his inventory goods under contract for sale but not yet segregated and applied to the contract and goods out upon consignment, but should exclude from inventory goods sold (including containers), title to which has passed to the purchaser. A purchaser should include in inventory merchandise purchased (including containers), title to which has passed to him, although such merchandise is in transit or for other reasons has not been reduced to physical possession, but should not include goods ordered for future delivery, transfer of title to which has not yet been effected. (But see § 1.472-1.)
(b)
Exemption for certain small business taxpayers
—(1)
In general.
Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to a taxpayer, other than a tax shelter prohibited from using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting (cash method) under section 448(a)(3), in any taxable year if the taxpayer meets the gross receipts test described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and uses as a method of accounting for its inventory a method that is described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(2)
Gross receipts test
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer, other than a tax shelter prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3), meets the gross receipts test of this paragraph (b)(2) if it meets the gross receipts test of section 448(c) and § 1.448-2(c). This gross receipts test applies even if the taxpayer is not otherwise subject to section 448(a).
(ii)
Application of the gross receipts test
—(A)
In general.
In the case of any taxpayer that is not a corporation or partnership, and except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, the gross receipts test of section 448(c) and the accompanying regulations are applied in the same manner as each trade or business of the taxpayer were a corporation or partnership.
(B)
Gross receipts of individuals, etc.
Except when the aggregation rules of section 448(c)(2) apply, the gross receipts of a taxpayer other than a corporation or partnership are the amount derived from all trades or businesses of such taxpayer. Amounts not related to a trade or businesses are excluded from the gross receipts of the taxpayer. For example, an individual taxpayer's gross receipts do not include inherently personal amounts, such as: personal injury awards or settlements with respect to an injury of the individual taxpayer, disability benefits, Social Security benefits received by the taxpayer during the taxable year, and wages received as an employee that are reported on Form W-2.
(C)
Partners and S corporation shareholders
—(
1
)
In general.
Except when the aggregation rules of section 448(c)(2) apply, each partner in a partnership includes a share of the partnership's gross receipts in proportion to such partner's distributive share (as determined under section 704) of items of gross income that were taken into account by the partnership under section 703. Similarly, a shareholder includes the
pro rata
share of S corporation gross receipts taken into account by the S corporation under section 1363(b).
(
2
) [Reserved]
(D)
Examples.
The operation of this paragraph (b)(2) is illustrated by the following examples:
(
1
)
Example 1.
Taxpayer A, a calendar year S corporation, is a reseller and maintains inventories. In 2017, 2018, and 2019, A's gross receipts were $10 million, $11 million, and $13 million respectively. A is not prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3). For 2020, A meets the gross receipts test of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(
2
)
Example 2.
Taxpayer B operates two separate and distinct trades or businesses that are reported on Schedule C,
Profit or Loss from Business,
of B's Federal income tax return. For 2020, one trade or business has annual average gross receipts of $5 million, and the other trade or business has average annual gross receipts of $35 million. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, for 2020, neither of B's trades or businesses meets the gross receipts test of paragraph (b)(2) of this section ($5 million + $35 million = $40 million, which is greater than the inflation-adjusted gross receipts test amount for 2020, which is $26 million).
(
3
)
Example 3.
Taxpayer C is an individual who operates three separate and distinct trades or business that are reported on Schedule C of C's Federal income tax return. For 2020, Business X is a retail store with average annual gross receipts of $15 million, Business Y is a dance studio with average annual gross receipts of $6 million, and Business Z is a car repair shop with average annual gross receipts of $12 million. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, C's gross receipts are the combined amount derived from all three of C's trades or businesses. Therefore, for 2020, X, Y and Z do not meet the gross receipts test of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section ($15 million + $6 million + $12 million = $33 million, which is greater than the inflation-adjusted gross receipts test amount for 2020, which is $26 million).
(3)
Methods of accounting under the small business taxpayer exemption.
A taxpayer eligible to use, and that chooses to use, the exemption described in paragraph (b) of this section may account for its inventory by either:
(i) Using a method that treats its inventory as non-incidental materials and supplies (section 471(c) NIMS inventory method), as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; or
(ii) Using the method for each item that is reflected in the taxpayer's applicable financial statement (AFS) (AFS section 471(c) inventory method); or, if the taxpayer does not have an AFS for the taxable year, the books and records of the taxpayer prepared in accordance with the taxpayer's accounting procedures, as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section (non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method).
(4)
Inventory treated as non-incidental materials and supplies
—(i)
In general.
The costs of inventory treated as non-incidental materials and supplies are recovered through cost of goods sold only in the taxable year in which the inventory is used or consumed in the taxpayer's business, or in the taxable year in which the taxpayer pays for or incurs the cost of the inventory, whichever is later. Inventory treated as non-incidental materials and supplies is used or consumed in the taxpayer's business in the taxable year in which the taxpayer provides the inventory to its customer. The costs of inventory are treated as non-incidental materials and supplies under this paragraph (b)(4) are not eligible for the
de minimis
safe harbor election under § 1.263(a)-1(f)(2).
(ii)
Identification and valuation of inventory treated as non-incidental materials and supplies.
A taxpayer may determine the amount of the costs of its inventory treated as non-incidental materials and supplies that are recoverable through costs of goods sold by using either a specific identification method, a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or an average cost method, provided that method is used consistently. See § 1.471-2(d). A taxpayer that uses the section 471(c) NIMS inventory method may not use any other method described in the regulations under section 471, or the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method described in section 472 and the accompanying regulations, to either identify inventory treated as non-incidental materials and supplies, or to value that inventory treated as non-incidental materials and supplies. The
inventory costs includible in the section 471(c) NIMS inventory method are the direct material costs of the property produced or the costs of property acquired for resale. However, an inventory cost does not include a cost for which a deduction would be disallowed, or that is not otherwise recoverable but for paragraph (b)(4) of this section, in whole or in part, under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code.
(iii)
Allocation methods.
A taxpayer treating its inventory as non-incidental materials and supplies under this paragraph (b)(4) may allocate the costs of such inventory by using specific identification or any other reasonable method.
(iv)
Example.
Taxpayer D is a baker that reports its baking trade or business on Schedule C,
Profit or Loss From Business,
of the Form 1040,
Individual Tax Return,
and D's baking business has average annual gross receipts for the 3-taxable years prior to 2019 of less than $100,000. D meets the gross receipts test of section 448(c) and is not prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3) in 2019. Therefore, D qualifies as a small business taxpayer under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. D uses the overall cash method, and the section 471(c) NIMS inventory method. D purchases $50 of peanut butter in November 2019. In December 2019, D uses all of the peanut butter to bake cookies available for immediate sale. D sells those peanut butter cookies to customers in January 2020. The peanut butter cookies are used or consumed under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section in January 2020 when the cookies are sold to customers, and D may recover the cost of the peanut butter in 2020.
(5)
AFS section 471(c) inventory method
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer that meets the gross receipts test described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and that has an AFS for such taxable year may use the AFS section 471(c) inventory method described in this paragraph to account for its inventory costs for the taxable year. For purposes of the AFS section 471(c) inventory method, an inventory cost is a cost of production or resale that a taxpayer capitalizes to inventory property produced or property acquired for resale in its AFS. For purposes of the AFS section 471(c) inventory method, costs that are generally required to be capitalized to inventory under section 471(a) but that the taxpayer does not capitalize to inventory on its AFS are not required to be capitalized to inventory. However, an inventory cost does not include a cost that is neither deductible nor otherwise recoverable but for paragraph (b)(5) of this section, in whole or in part, under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 162(c), (e), (f), (g), or 274). In lieu of the inventory method described in section 471(a), a taxpayer using the AFS section 471(c) inventory method recovers its inventory costs in accordance with the inventory method used in its AFS.
(ii)
Definition of Applicable Financial Statement (AFS).
The term applicable financial statement (AFS) is defined in section 451(b)(3) and the accompanying regulations. See § 1.451-3(a)(5). The rules relating to additional AFS issues provided in § 1.451-3(h) apply to the AFS section 471(c) inventory method. In the case of a taxpayer with a financial accounting year that differs from the taxpayer's taxable year, the taxpayer must consistently use the same method of accounting described in § 1.451-3(h)(4)(i)(A) through (C) that is used for section 451(b) purposes to also determine its inventory for the taxable year under this paragraph (b)(5)(ii). A taxpayer has an AFS for the taxable year if all of the taxpayer's taxable year is covered by an AFS.
(iii)
Timing of inventory costs.
Notwithstanding the timing rules used in the taxpayer's AFS, the amount of any inventoriable cost may not be capitalized or otherwise taken into account for Federal income tax purposes any earlier than the taxable year during which the amount is paid or incurred under the taxpayer's overall method of accounting, as described in § 1.446-1(c)(1). For example, in the case of an accrual method taxpayer, inventoriable costs must satisfy the all events test, including economic performance, of section 461. See § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii) and section 461 and the accompanying regulations.
(iv)
Example.
H is a calendar year C corporation that is engaged in the
trade or business of selling office supplies and providing copier repair services. H meets the gross receipts test of section 448(c) and is not prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3) for 2019 or 2020. For Federal income tax purposes, H chooses to account for purchases and sales of inventory using an accrual method of accounting and for all other items using the cash method. For AFS purposes, H uses an overall accrual method of accounting. H uses the AFS section 471(c) inventory method of accounting. In H's 2019 AFS, H incurred $2 million in purchases of office supplies held for resale and recovered the $2 million as cost of goods sold. On January 5, 2020, H makes payment on $1.5 million of these office supplies. For purposes of the AFS section 471(c) inventory method of accounting, H can recover the $2 million of office supplies in 2019 because the amount has been included in cost of goods sold in its AFS inventory method and section 461 has been satisfied.
(6)
Non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer that meets the gross receipts test described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a taxable year and that does not have an AFS, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, for such taxable year may use the non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method to account for its inventories for the taxable year in accordance with this paragraph (b)(6). The non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method is the method of accounting used for inventory in the taxpayer's books and records that properly reflect its business activities for non-tax purposes and are prepared in accordance with the taxpayer's accounting procedures. For purposes of the non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method, an inventory cost is a cost of production or resale that the taxpayer capitalizes to inventory property produced or property acquired for resale in its books and records, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section. Costs that are generally required to be capitalized to inventory under section 471(a), but that the taxpayer does not capitalize in its books and records are not required to be capitalized to inventory. However, an inventory cost does not include a cost that is neither deductible nor otherwise recoverable but for paragraph (b)(5) of this section, in whole or in part, under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 162(c), (e), (f), (g), or 274). In lieu of the inventory method described in section 471(a), a taxpayer using the non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method recovers its applicable costs through its book inventory method of accounting. A taxpayer that has an AFS for such taxable year may not use the non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method.
(ii)
Timing and amounts of costs.
Notwithstanding the timing of costs reflected in the taxpayer's books and records, a taxpayer may not recover any costs that have not been paid or incurred under the taxpayer's overall method of accounting, as described in § 1.446-1(c)(1). For example, in the case of an accrual method taxpayer or a taxpayer using an accrual method for purchases and sales, inventory costs must satisfy the all events test, including economic performance, under section 461(h). See § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii), and section 461 and the accompanying regulations.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(A)
Example 1.
Taxpayer E is a C corporation that is engaged in the retail trade or business of selling beer, wine, and liquor. In 2019, E has average annual gross receipts for the prior 3-taxable-years of $15 million and is not otherwise prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3). E does not have an AFS for the 2019 taxable year. E is eligible to use the non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method of accounting. E uses the overall cash method, and the non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method of accounting for Federal income tax purposes. In E's electronic bookkeeping software, E treats all costs paid during the taxable year as presently deductible. As part of its regular business practice, E's employees take a physical count of inventory on E's selling floor and its warehouse on December 31, 2019, and E uses this physical count as part of its books and records for purposes of capitalizing and allocating costs to inventory. E also makes representations to its creditor of the cost of inventory on hand for
specific categories of product it sells. E may not expense all of its costs paid during the 2019 taxable year because its books and records do not accurately reflect the inventory records used for non-tax purposes in its regular business activity. Instead, E must use the physical inventory count taken at the end of 2019 to determine how its capitalized costs are allocated and recovered.
(B)
Example 2.
Same facts as Example (1) in paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(A) of this section but E does not use the physical count to capitalize and allocate costs to inventory and does not make any representations about inventory on hand to any creditors. Although E pays or incurs costs that are generally required to be capitalized to inventory under section 471(a), because such costs are not capitalized to inventory in E's books and records, they are not required to be capitalized to inventory under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
(C)
Example 3.
Same facts as Example (1) in paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(A) of this section but E does not use the physical count to capitalize and allocate costs to inventory in its electronic bookkeeping software and does not make any representations about inventory on hand to any external parties. E does use the physical count to value inventory on hand for internal reports to its shareholders. The internal reports to its shareholders are part of E's books and records and must be taken into account for E's non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method. E recovers its inventory costs consistent with its non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method.
(D)
Example 4.
Taxpayer F is a C corporation that is engaged in the manufacture of baseball bats. In 2019, F has average annual gross receipts for the prior 3-taxable-years of less than $25 million and is not otherwise prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3). F does not have an AFS for the 2019 taxable year. For Federal income tax purposes, F uses the overall cash method of accounting, and the non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method of accounting. For its books and records, F uses an overall accrual method and maintains inventories. In December 2019, F's financial statements show $500,000 of direct and indirect material costs. F pays its supplier in January 2020. Under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, F recovers its direct and indirect material costs in 2020.
(E)
Example 5.
Taxpayer G is a baker that reports its baking trade or business on Schedule C, Profit or Loss From Business, of the Form 1040, Individual Tax Return. In 2020, G's baking business has average annual gross receipts for the prior 3-taxable years of less than $100,000 and is not otherwise prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3). G does not have an AFS for the 2020 taxable year. For Federal income tax purposes, G uses the overall cash method of accounting and the non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method. In G's books and records for 2020 that properly reflects its business activities for non-tax purposes, G capitalizes the cost of its cookie ingredients to inventory but immediately expenses the cost of labor for G's employee who bakes the cookies. Under paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, G treats as an inventory cost the cost of its cookie ingredients and recovers such costs in accordance with the accounting procedures used to prepare its books and records, or, if later, when paid. Additionally, although the cost of direct labor is generally required to be capitalized to inventory under section 471(a), because such cost is not capitalized to inventory in G's books and records, it is not required to be capitalized to inventory under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. Further, because such direct labor cost is generally deductible under section 162, and not otherwise required to be capitalized under section 263(a), G may deduct the cost of labor in the year G pays that expense.
(F)
Example 6.
Taxpayer H is a partnership engaged in the resale of beer, wine, and liquor. In 2020, H has average annual gross receipts for the prior 3-taxable-years of less than $25 million and is not otherwise prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3). H does not have an AFS for the 2020 taxable year. For Federal income tax purposes, H uses the overall cash method of accounting, and the
non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method of accounting. For its books and records, H uses the overall cash method. As part of its regular business practice, H's employees take regular physical counts of the inventory on the shop floor and in the storeroom, however H's method of accounting for inventory for its books and records does not allocate costs between ending inventory and cost of goods sold, and instead expenses the cost of the inventory in the year it was paid for. Prior to December 2020, H acquires and pays for $500,000 of beer, wine, and liquor. In addition, on December 1, 2020, H acquires $50,000 in beer and wine, and pays for this beer and wine on December 20, 2020. H may recover as deductions in 2020 the $550,000 of inventory costs.
(G)
Example 7.
Taxpayer J is a partnership engaged in the resale of beer, wine, and liquor. In 2020, J has average annual gross receipts for the prior 3-taxable-years of less than $25 million and is not otherwise prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3). J does not have an AFS for the 2020 taxable year. For Federal income tax purposes, J uses the overall cash method of accounting, and the non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method of accounting. For its books and records, J uses the overall cash method. J maintains a point-of-sale computer system that tracks acquisition costs and inventory levels of the beer, wine, and liquor. The ledger is periodically reconciled with physical counts performed by J's employees. J must use the physical inventory count and ledger to determine its ending inventory. J includes in cost of goods sold for 2020 those inventory costs that are not properly allocated to ending inventory.
(7)
Effect of section 471(c) on other provisions.
Nothing in section 471(c) shall have any effect on the application of any other provision of law that would otherwise apply, and no inference shall be drawn from section 471(c) with respect to the application of any such provision. For example, an accrual method taxpayer that includes inventory costs in its AFS is required to satisfy section 461 before such cost can be included in cost of goods sold for the taxable year. Similarly, nothing in section 471(c) affects the requirement under section 446(e) that a taxpayer secure the consent of the Commissioner before changing its method of accounting. If an item of income or expense is not treated consistently from year to year, that treatment may not clearly reflect income, notwithstanding the application of this section. Finally, nothing in section 471(c) permits the deduction or recovery of any cost that a taxpayer is otherwise precluded from deducting or recovering under any other provision in the Code or Regulations.
(8)
Method of accounting
—(i)
In general.
A change in the method of treating inventory under this paragraph (b) is a change in method of accounting under sections 446 and 481 and the accompanying regulations. A taxpayer changing its method of accounting under paragraph (b) of this section may do so only with the consent of the Commissioner as required under section 446(e) and § 1.446-1. For example, a taxpayer using the AFS section 471(c) inventory method or non-AFS section 471(c) inventory method that wants to change its method of accounting for inventory in its AFS, or its books and records, respectively, is required to secure the consent of the Commissioner before using this new method for Federal income tax purposes. However, a change from having an AFS to not having an AFS, or vice versa, without a change in the underlying method for inventory for financial reporting purposes that affects Federal income tax is not a change in method of accounting for such inventory under section 446(e). In the case of any taxpayer required by this section to change its method of accounting for any taxable year, the change shall be treated as a change initiated by the taxpayer. For rules relating to the clear reflection of income and the pattern of consistent treatment of an item, see section 446 and § 1.446-1. The amount of the net section 481(a) adjustment and the adjustment period necessary to implement a change in method of accounting required under this section are determined under § 1.446-1(e) and the applicable administrative procedures to obtain the Commissioner's consent to
change a method of accounting as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Revenue Procedure 2015-13 (2015-5 IRB 419) (or successor) (see also § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(ii)
Automatic consent for certain method changes.
Certain changes in method of accounting made under paragraph (b) of this section may be made under the procedures to obtain the automatic consent of the Commissioner to change a method of accounting. See Revenue Procedure 2015-13 (2015-5 IRB 419) (or successor) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter)). In certain situations, special terms and conditions may apply.
(c)
Applicability dates.
This section applies for taxable years beginning on or after January 5, 2021. However, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 5, 2021, a taxpayer may apply this section provided that the taxpayer follows all the applicable rules contained in this section for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11724, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 9942, 86 FR 275, Jan. 5, 2021]
§ 1.471-2
Valuation of inventories.
(a) Section 471 provides two tests to which each inventory must conform:
(1) It must conform as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and
(2) It must clearly reflect the income.
(b) It follows, therefore, that inventory rules cannot be uniform but must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any particular method of inventorying or basis of valuation so long as the method or basis used is in accord with §§ 1.471-1 through 1.471-11.
(c) The bases of valuation most commonly used by business concerns and which meet the requirements of section 471 are (1) cost and (2) cost or market, whichever is lower. (For inventories by dealers in securities, see § 1.471-5.) Any goods in an inventory which are unsalable at normal prices or unusable in the normal way because of damage, imperfections, shop wear, changes of style, odd or broken lots, or other similar causes, including second-hand goods taken in exchange, should be valued at bona fide selling prices less direct cost of disposition, whether subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph is used, or if such goods consist of raw materials or partly finished goods held for use or consumption, they shall be valued upon a reasonable basis, taking into consideration the usability and the condition of the goods, but in no case shall such value be less than the scrap value. Bona fide selling price means actual offering of goods during a period ending not later than 30 days after inventory date. The burden of proof will rest upon the taxpayer to show that such exceptional goods as are valued upon such selling basis come within the classifications indicated above, and he shall maintain such records of the disposition of the goods as will enable a verification of the inventory to be made.
(d) In respect of normal goods, whichever method is adopted must be applied with reasonable consistency to the entire inventory of the taxpayer's trade or business except as to those goods inventoried under the last-in, first-out method authorized by section 472 or to animals inventoried under the elective unit, livestock-price-method authorized by § 1.471-6. See paragraph (d) of § 1.446-1 for rules permitting the use of different methods of accounting if the taxpayer has more than one trade or business. Where the taxpayer is engaged in more than one trade or business the Commissioner may require that the method of valuing inventories with respect to goods in one trade or business also be used with respect to similar goods in other trades or businesses if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the use of such method with respect to such other goods is essential to a clear reflection of income. Taxpayers were given an option to adopt the basis of either (1) cost or (2) cost or market, whichever is lower, for their 1920 inventories. The basis properly adopted for that year or any subsequent year is controlling, and a change can now be made only after permission is secured from the Commissioner. Application for permission to change the
basis of valuing inventories shall be made in writing and filed with the Commissioner as provided in paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1. Goods taken in the inventory which have been so intermingled that they cannot be identified with specific invoices will be deemed to be the goods most recently purchased or produced, and the cost thereof will be the actual cost of the goods purchased or produced during the period in which the quantity of goods in the inventory has been acquired. But see section 472 as to last-in, first-out inventories. Where the taxpayer maintains book inventories in accordance with a sound accounting system in which the respective inventory accounts are charged with the actual cost of the goods purchased or produced and credited with the value of goods used, transferred, or sold, calculated upon the basis of the actual cost of the goods acquired during the taxable year (including the inventory at the beginning of the year), the net value as shown by such inventory accounts will be deemed to be the cost of the goods on hand. The balances shown by such book inventories should be verified by physical inventories at reasonable intervals and adjusted to conform therewith.
(e) Inventories should be recorded in a legible manner, properly computed and summarized, and should be preserved as a part of the accounting records of the taxpayer. The inventories of taxpayers on whatever basis taken will be subject to investigation by the district director, and the taxpayer must satisfy the district director of the correctness of the prices adopted.
(f) The following methods, among others, are sometimes used in taking or valuing inventories, but are not in accord with the regulations in this part:
(1) Deducting from the inventory a reserve for price changes, or an estimated depreciation in the value thereof.
(2) Taking work in process, or other parts of the inventory, at a nominal price or at less than its proper value.
(3) Omitting portions of the stock on hand.
(4) Using a constant price or nominal value for so-called normal quantity of materials or goods in stock.
(5) Including stock in transit, shipped either to or from the taxpayer, the title to which is not vested in the taxpayer.
(6) Segregating indirect production costs into fixed and variable production cost classifications (as defined in § 1.471-11(b)(3)(ii)) and allocating only the variable costs to the cost of goods produced while treating fixed costs as period costs which are currently deductible. This method is commonly referred to as the “direct cost” method.
(7) Treating all or substantially all indirect production costs (whether classified as fixed or variable) as period costs which are currently deductible. This method is generally referred to as the “prime cost” method.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11724, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7285, 38 FR 26185, Sept. 19, 1973]
§ 1.471-3
Inventories at cost.
Cost means:
(a) In the case of merchandise on hand at the beginning of the taxable year, the inventory price of such goods.
(b) In the case of merchandise purchased since the beginning of the taxable year, the invoice price less trade or other discounts, except strictly cash discounts approximating a fair interest rate, which may be deducted or not at the option of the taxpayer, provided a consistent course is followed. To this net invoice price should be added transportation or other necessary charges incurred in acquiring possession of the goods. But see § 1.263A-1(d)(2)(iv)(C) for special rules for certain direct material costs that in certain cases are permitted to be capitalized as additional section 263A costs by taxpayers using a simplified method under § 1.263A-2(b) or (c) or § 1.263A-3(d). For taxpayers acquiring merchandise for resale that are subject to the provisions of section 263A, see §§ 1.263A-1 and 1.263A-3 for additional amounts that must be included in inventory costs.
(c) In the case of merchandise produced by the taxpayer since the beginning of the taxable year, (1) the cost of raw materials and supplies entering into or consumed in connection with
the product, (2) expenditures for direct labor, and (3) indirect production costs incident to and necessary for the production of the particular article, including in such indirect production costs an appropriate portion of management expenses, but not including any cost of selling or return on capital, whether by way of interest or profit. See §§ 1.263A-1 and 1.263A-2 for more specific rules regarding the treatment of production costs.
(d) In any industry in which the usual rules for computation of cost of production are inapplicable, costs may be approximated upon such basis as may be reasonable and in conformity with established trade practice in the particular industry. Among such cases are:
(1) Farmers and raisers of livestock (see § 1.471-6);
(2) Miners and manufacturers who by a single process or uniform series of processes derive a product of two or more kinds, sizes, or grades, the unit cost of which is substantially alike (see § 1.471-7); and
(3) Retail merchants who use what is known as the “retail method” in ascertaining approximate cost (see § 1.471-8).
(e)
Sales-based vendor allowances
—(1)
Treatment of sales-based vendor chargebacks
—(i)
In general.
A sales-based vendor chargeback is an allowance, discount, or price rebate that a taxpayer becomes unconditionally entitled to by selling a vendor's merchandise to specific customers identified by the vendor at a price determined by the vendor. A sales-based vendor chargeback decreases cost of goods sold and does not reduce the cost of goods on hand at the end of the taxable year.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (e)(1).

# Example.
(i) W is a wholesaler of pharmaceuticals. W purchases Drug X from the manufacturer, M, for $10x per unit. M has agreements with specific customers that allow those customers to acquire Drug X from M's wholesalers for $6x per unit. Under an agreement between W and M, W is required to sell Drug X to specific customers at the prices M has negotiated with such customers ($6x per unit) and, in exchange, M agrees to provide a price rebate to W equal to the difference between W's cost for Drug X and the price W is required to charge specific customers under the agreement (a difference of $4x per unit). W sells Drug X to specific customer Y for $6x. Under the agreement between W and M, the price rebate can be paid to W, credited against M's invoice to W for W's purchase of Drug X, or it can be credited to W's future purchases of drugs from M.
(ii) Under the terms of the agreement, W is unconditionally entitled to the price rebate of Drug X when it sells Drug X to specific customer Y, a specifically identified customer of M. The price rebate received by W for the sale of Drug X to Y is a sales-based vendor chargeback. Therefore, the amount of the sales-based vendor charge back, $4x per unit for Drug X, whether paid to W, credited against M's invoice to W for W's purchase of Drug X or credited against a future purchase, decreases cost of goods sold and does not reduce the cost of Drug X on hand at the end of the taxable year.
(2)
Treatment of other sales-based vendor allowances.
[Reserved]
(f) Notwithstanding the other rules of this section, cost shall not include an amount which is of a type for which a deduction would be disallowed under section 162 (c), (f), or (g) and the regulations thereunder in the case of a business expense.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (f) of this section applies to taxable years ending on or after January 13, 2014.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11725, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7285, 38 FR 26185, Sept. 19, 1973; T.D. 7345, 40 FR 7439, Feb. 20, 1975; T.D. 8131, 52 FR 10084, Mar. 30, 1987; T.D. 8482, 58 FR 42233, Aug. 9, 1993; T.D. 9652, 79 FR 2098, Jan. 13, 2014; T.D. 9843, 83 FR 58498, Nov. 20, 2018]
§ 1.471-4
Inventories at cost or market, whichever is lower.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Market definition.
Under ordinary circumstances and for normal goods in an inventory,
market
means the aggregate of the current bid prices prevailing at the date of the inventory of the basic elements of cost reflected in inventories of goods purchased and on hand, goods in process of manufacture, and finished manufactured goods on hand. The basic elements of cost include direct materials, direct labor, and indirect costs required to be included in inventories by the taxpayer (e.g., under section 263A and its underlying regulations for taxpayers subject to that section). For
taxpayers to which section 263A applies, for example, the basic elements of cost must reflect all direct costs and all indirect costs properly allocable to goods on hand at the inventory date at the current bid price of those costs, including but not limited to the cost of purchasing, handling, and storage activities conducted by the taxpayer, both prior to and subsequent to acquisition or production of the goods. The determination of the current bid price of the basic elements of costs reflected in goods on hand at the inventory date must be based on the usual volume of particular cost elements purchased (or incurred) by the taxpayer.
(2)
Fixed price contracts.
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to any goods on hand or in process of manufacture for delivery upon firm sales contracts (i.e., those not legally subject to cancellation by either party) at fixed prices entered into before the date of the inventory, under which the taxpayer is protected against actual loss. Any such goods must be inventoried at cost.

Examples.
The valuation principles in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Taxpayer A manufactures tractors. A values its inventory using cost or market, whichever is lower, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. At the end of 1994, the cost of one of A's tractors on hand is determined as follows:
Direct materials
$3,000
Direct labor
4,000
Indirect costs under section 263A
3,000
Total section 263A costs (cost)
$10,000
(ii) A determines that the aggregate of the current bid prices of the materials, labor, and overhead required to reproduce the tractor at the end of 1994 are as follows:
Direct materials
$3,100
Direct labor
4,100
Indirect costs under section 263A
3,100
Total section 263A costs (market)
$10,300
(iii) In determining the lower of cost or market value of the tractor, A compares the cost of the tractor, $10,000, with the market value of the tractor, $10,300, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Thus, under this section, A values the tractor at $10,000.

# Example 2.
(i) Taxpayer B purchases and resells several lines of shoes and is subject to section 263A. B values its inventory using cost or market, whichever is lower, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. At the end of 1994, the cost of one pair of shoes on hand is determined as follows:
Acquisition cost
$200
Indirect costs under section 263A
10
Total section 263A costs (cost)
$210
(ii) B determines the aggregate current bid prices prevailing at the end of 1994 for the elements of cost (both direct costs and indirect costs incurred prior and subsequent to acquisition of the shoes) based on the volume of the elements usually purchased (or incurred) by B as follows:
Acquisition cost
$178
Indirect costs under section 263A
12
Total § 263A costs (market)
$190
(iii) In determining the lower of cost or market value of the shoes, B compares the cost of the pair of shoes, $210, with the market value of the shoes, $190, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Thus, under this section, B values the shoes at $190.
(b)
Inactive markets.
Where no open market exists or where quotations are nominal, due to inactive market conditions, the taxpayer must use such evidence of a fair market price at the date or dates nearest the inventory as may be available, such as specific purchases or sales by the taxpayer or others in reasonable volume and made in good faith, or compensation paid for cancellation of contracts for purchase commitments. Where the taxpayer in the regular course of business has offered for sale such merchandise at prices lower than the current price as above defined, the inventory may be valued at such prices less direct cost of disposition, and the correctness of such prices will be determined by reference to the actual sales of the taxpayer for a reasonable period before and after the date of the inventory. Prices which vary materially from the actual prices so ascertained will not be accepted as reflecting the market.
(c)
Comparison of cost and market.
Where the inventory is valued upon the basis of cost or market, whichever is lower, the market value of each article on hand at the inventory date shall be compared with the cost of the article, and the lower of such values shall be taken as the inventory value of the article.
(d)
Effective date.
This section applies to inventory valuations for taxable years beginning after December 31,
1993. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1994, taxpayers must take reasonable positions on their federal income tax returns with respect to the application of section 263A, and must have otherwise complied with § 1.471-4 (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised April 1, 1993). For purposes of this paragraph (d), a reasonable position as to the application of section 263A is a position consistent with the temporary regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, notices, and announcements concerning section 263A applicable in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1994. (See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter.)

§ 1.471-5
Inventories by dealers in securities.
A dealer in securities who in his books of account regularly inventories unsold securities on hand either—
(a) At cost,
(b) At cost or market, whichever is lower, or
(c) At market value,
may make his return upon the basis upon which his accounts are kept, provided that a description of the method employed is included in or attached to the return, that all the securities are inventoried by the same method, and that such method is adhered to in subsequent years, unless another method is authorized by the Commissioner pursuant to a written application therefor filed as provided in paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1. A dealer in securities in whose books of account separate computations of the gain or loss from the sale of the various lots of securities sold are made on the basis of the cost of each lot shall be regarded, for the purposes of this section, as regularly inventorying his securities at cost. For the purposes of this section, a dealer in securities is a merchant of securities, whether an individual, partnership, or corporation, with an established place of business, regularly engaged in the purchase of securities and their resale to customers; that is, one who as a merchant buys securities and sells them to customers with a view to the gains and profits that may be derived therefrom. If such business is simply a branch of the activities carried on by such person, the securities inventoried as provided in this section may include only those held for purposes of resale and not for investment. Taxpayers who buy and sell or hold securities for investment or speculation, irrespective of whether such buying or selling constitutes the carrying on of a trade or business, and officers of corporations and members of partnerships who in their individual capacities buy and sell securities, are not dealers in securities within the meaning of this section. See §§ 1.263A-1 and 1.263A-3 for rules regarding the treatment of costs with respect to property acquired for resale.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11725, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8131, 52 FR 10084, Mar. 30, 1987; T.D. 8482, 58 FR 42234, Aug. 9, 1993]
§ 1.471-6
Inventories of livestock raisers and other farmers.
(a) A farmer may make his return upon an inventory method instead of the cash receipts and disbursements method. It is optional with the taxpayer which of these methods of accounting is used but, having elected one method, the option so exercised will be binding upon the taxpayer for the year for which the option is exercised and for subsequent years unless another method is authorized by the Commissioner as provided in paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1.
(b) In any change of accounting method from the cash receipts and disbursements method to an inventory method, adjustments shall be made as provided in section 481 (relating to adjustments required by change in method of accounting) and the regulations thereunder.
(c) Because of the difficulty of ascertaining actual cost of livestock and other farm products, farmers who render their returns upon an inventory method may value their inventories according to the “farm-price method”, and farmers raising livestock may value their inventories of animals according to either the “farm-price method” or the “unit-livestock-price method”. In addition, these inventory methods may be used to account for the costs of property produced in a farming business that are required to
be capitalized under section 263A regardless of whether the property being produced is otherwise treated as inventory by the taxpayer, and regardless of whether the taxpayer is otherwise using the cash or an accrual method of accounting.
(d) The “farm-price method” provides for the valuation of inventories at market price less direct cost of disposition. If this method of valuation is used, it generally must be applied to all property produced by the taxpayer in the trade or business of farming, except as to livestock accounted for, at the taxpayer's election, under the unit livestock method of accounting. However, see § 1.263A-4(c)(3) for an exception to this rule. If the use of the “farm-price method” of valuing inventories for any taxable year involves a change in method of valuing inventories from that employed in prior years, permission for such change shall first be secured from the Commissioner as provided in paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1.
(e) The “unit-livestock-price method” provides for the valuation of the different classes of animals in the inventory at a standard unit price for each animal within a class. A livestock raiser electing this method of valuing his animals must adopt a reasonable classification of the animals in his inventory with respect to the age and kind included so that the unit prices assigned to the several classes will reasonably account for the normal costs incurred in producing the animals within such classes. Thus, if a cattle raiser determines that it costs approximately $15 to produce a calf, and $7.50 each year to raise the calf to maturity, his classifications and unit prices would be as follows: Calves, $15; yearlings, $22.50; 2-year olds, $30; mature animals, $37.50. The classification selected by the livestock raiser, and the unit prices assigned to the several classes, are subject to approval by the district director upon examination of the taxpayer's return.
(f) A taxpayer that elects to use the “unit-livestock-price method” must apply it to all livestock raised, whether for sale or for draft, breeding, or dairy purposes. The inventoriable costs of animals raised for draft, breeding, or dairy purposes can, at the election of the livestock raiser, be included in inventory or treated as property used in a trade or business subject to depreciation after maturity.
See
§ 1.263A-4 for rules regarding the computation of inventoriable costs for purposes of the unit-livestock-price method. Once established, the methods of accounting used by the taxpayer to determine unit prices and to classify animals must be consistently applied in all subsequent taxable years. A taxpayer that uses the unit-livestock-price method must annually reevaluate its unit prices and adjust the prices either upward to reflect increases, or downward to reflect decreases, in the costs of raising livestock. The consent of the Commissioner is not required to make such upward or downward adjustments. No other changes in the classification of animals or unit prices may be made without the consent of the Commissioner.
See
§ 1.446-1(e) for procedures for obtaining the consent of the Commissioner. The provisions of this paragraph (f) apply to taxable years ending after October 28, 2002.
(g) A livestock raiser who uses the “unit-livestock-price method” must include in his inventory at cost any livestock purchased, except that animals purchased for draft, breeding, or dairy purposes can, at the election of the livestock raiser, be included in inventory or be treated as property used in a trade or business subject to depreciation after maturity. If the animals purchased are not mature at the time of purchase, the cost should be increased at the end of each taxable year in accordance with the established unit prices, except that no increase is to be made in the taxable year of purchase if the animal is acquired during the last six months of that year. If the records maintained permit identification of a purchased animal, the cost of such animal will be eliminated from the closing inventory in the event of its sale or loss. Otherwise, the first-in, first-out method of valuing inventories must be applied.
(h) If a taxpayer using the “farm-price method” desires to adopt the
“unit-livestock-price method” in valuing his inventories of livestock, permission for the change shall first be secured from the Commissioner as provided in paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1. However, a taxpayer who has filed returns on the basis of inventories at cost, or cost or market whichever is lower, may adopt the “unit-livestock-price method” for valuing his inventories of livestock without formal application for permission, but the classifications and unit prices selected are subject to approval by the district director upon examination of the taxpayer's return. A livestock raiser who has adopted a constant unit-price method of valuing livestock inventories and filed returns on that basis will be considered as having elected the “unit-livestock-price method”.
(i) If returns have been made in which the taxable income has been computed upon incomplete inventories, the abnormality should be corrected by submitting with the return for the current taxable year a statement for the preceding taxable year. In this statement such adjustments shall be made as are necessary to bring the closing inventory for the preceding taxable year into agreement with the opening complete inventory for the current taxable year. If necessary clearly to reflect income, similar adjustments may be made as at the beginning of the preceding year or years, and the tax, if any be due, shall be assessed and paid at the rate of tax in effect for such year or years.

§ 1.471-7
Inventories of miners and manufacturers.
A taxpayer engaged in mining or manufacturing who by a single process or uniform series of processes derives a product of two or more kinds, sizes, or grades, the unit cost of which is substantially alike, and who in conformity to a recognized trade practice allocates an amount of cost to each kind, size, or grade of product, which in the aggregate will absorb the total cost of production, may, with the consent of the Commissioner, use such allocated cost as a basis for pricing inventories, provided such allocation bears a reasonable relation to the respective selling values of the different kinds, sizes, or grades of product. See section 472 as to last-in, first-out inventories.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11726, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.471-8
Inventories of retail merchants.
(a)
In general.
A taxpayer that is a retail merchant may use the retail inventory method of accounting described in this section. The retail inventory method uses a formula to convert the retail selling price of ending inventory to an approximation of cost (retail cost method) or an approximation of lower of cost or market (retail LCM method). A taxpayer may use the retail inventory method instead of valuing inventory at cost under § 1.471-3 or lower of cost or market under § 1.471-4.
(b)
Computation
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer computes the value of ending inventory under the retail inventory method by multiplying a cost complement by the retail selling prices of the goods on hand at the end of the taxable year.
(2)
Cost complement
—(i)
In general.
The cost complement is a ratio computed as follows:
(A) The numerator is the value of beginning inventory plus the cost (as determined under § 1.471-3, except as otherwise provided in this section) of goods purchased during the taxable year.
(B) The denominator is the retail selling prices of beginning inventory plus the retail selling prices of goods purchased during the year (that is, the bona fide retail selling prices of the items at the time acquired), adjusted for all permanent markups and markdowns, including markup and markdown cancellations and corrections. The denominator is not adjusted for temporary markups or markdowns.
(ii)
Vendor allowances required to reduce only cost of goods sold.
A taxpayer may not reduce the numerator of the cost complement by the amount of an allowance, discount, or price rebate that is required under § 1.471-3(e) to reduce only cost of goods sold.
(3)
Additional rules for cost complement for retail LCM method
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Margin protection payments.
A taxpayer using the retail LCM method may not reduce the numerator of the cost complement by the amount of an allowance, discount, or price rebate that is related to or intended to compensate for a permanent reduction in the taxpayer's retail selling price of inventory (a margin protection payment).
(B)
Markdowns.
A taxpayer using the retail LCM method does not adjust the denominator of the cost complement for markdowns (and markdown cancellations or corrections). Markups must be reduced by the markdowns made to cancel or correct them.
(ii)
Alternative methods for computing cost complement
—(A)
In general.
In lieu of the method described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, a taxpayer using the retail LCM method may compute the cost complement using one of the alternative methods described in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii). A taxpayer using an alternative method under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) must use that method for all cost complements.
(B)
Adjust numerator and denominator.
A taxpayer using the retail LCM method may reduce the numerator of the cost complement by the amount of all margin protection payments if the taxpayer also reduces the denominator of the cost complement by the amount of the permanent reduction in retail selling price to which the margin protection payments relate (related markdowns).
(C)
Deemed adjustment to denominator.
A taxpayer using the retail LCM method that is able to determine the amount of all margin protection payments but cannot determine the amount of the related markdowns may reduce the numerator of the cost complement by the amount of all margin protection payments if the taxpayer also reduces the denominator by the amount that, in conjunction with the reduction of the numerator for the margin protection payments, maintains what would have been the cost complement percentage before taking into account the margin protection payment and the related markdown. A taxpayer that can determine the amount of a related markdown but not the associated margin protection payments may not use this method to compute an adjustment to the numerator.
(iii)
Statistical sampling.
A taxpayer using the retail LCM method may use statistical sampling in accordance with Rev. Proc. 2011-42 or any successor (see § 601.601(d) of this chapter), in conjunction with any method of computing the cost complement described in this paragraph (b)(3), to determine the amount of margin protection payments and related markdowns. A taxpayer using statistical sampling must use it for all margin protection payments and related markdowns associated with the inventory items valued by a particular cost complement, but is not required to use it for every cost complement.
(4)
Ending inventory retail selling prices.
A taxpayer must include all permanent markups and markdowns but may not include temporary markups or markdowns in determining the retail selling prices of goods on hand at the end of the taxable year. A taxpayer may not include a markdown that is not an actual reduction of retail selling price.
(c)
Special rules for LIFO taxpayers.
A taxpayer using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method with the retail inventory method uses the retail cost method. See § 1.472-1(k) for additional adjustments for a taxpayer using the LIFO inventory method with the retail cost method.
(d)
Scope of retail inventory method.
A taxpayer may use the retail inventory method to value ending inventory for a department, a class of goods, or a stock-keeping unit. A taxpayer maintaining more than one department or dealing in classes of goods with different percentages of gross profit must compute cost complements separately for each department or class of goods.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) R, a retail merchant who uses the retail LCM method and uses a calendar taxable year, has no beginning inventory in 2012. R purchases 40 tables during 2012 for $60 each for a total of $2,400. R offers the tables for sale at $100 each for an aggregate retail selling price of $4,000. R does not sell any tables at a price of $100, so R permanently marks down the retail selling price of
its tables to $90 each. As a result of the $10 markdown, R's supplier provides R a $6 per table margin protection payment. R sells 25 tables during 2012 and has 15 tables in ending inventory at the end of 2012.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the numerator of the cost complement is the aggregate cost of the tables, $2,400. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, R may not reduce the numerator of the cost complement by the amount of the margin protection payment. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the denominator of the cost complement is the aggregate of the bona fide retail selling prices of all the tables at the time acquired, $4,000. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, R does not adjust the denominator of the cost complement for the markdown. Therefore, R's cost complement is $2,400/$4,000, or 60%.
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, R includes the permanent markdown in determining year-end retail selling prices. Therefore, the aggregate retail selling price of R's ending table inventory is $1,350 (15 * $90). Approximating LCM under the retail method, the value of R's ending table inventory is $810 (60% * $1,350).

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that R permanently reduces the retail selling price of all 40 tables to $50 per unit and the 15 tables on hand at the end of the year are marked for sale at that price. The additional $40 markdown is unrelated to a margin protection payment or other allowance.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, R does not adjust the denominator of the cost complement for the markdown. Therefore, R's cost complement is $2,400/$4,000, or 60%.
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, R includes the permanent markdowns in determining year-end retail selling prices. Therefore, the aggregate retail selling price of R's ending inventory is $750 (15 * $50). Approximating LCM under the retail method, the value of R's ending inventory is $450 (60% * $750).

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that R computes the cost complement using the alternative method under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(ii) R reduces the numerator of the cost complement by the margin protection payments of $240 ($6 * 40) and reduces the denominator of the cost complement by the related markdowns of $400 ($10 * 40). Therefore, R's cost complement is $2,160/$3,600, or 60%.
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, R includes the permanent markdown in determining year-end retail selling prices. Therefore, the aggregate retail selling price of R's ending table inventory is $1,350 (15 * $90). Approximating LCM under the retail method, the value of R's ending table inventory is $810 (60% * $1,350).

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that R cannot determine the amount of its related markdowns and computes the cost complement using the alternative method under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.
(ii) R reduces the numerator of the cost complement by the margin protection payments of $240 ($6 * 40). R reduces the denominator of the cost complement by the amount that, in conjunction with the reduction in the numerator, maintains the cost complement percentage before taking into account the margin protection payments and the related markdowns. R's original cost complement was 60% ($2,400/$4,000). The numerator of R's new cost complement is $2,160 ($2,400−$240). Therefore, R reduces the denominator by $400, which maintains the cost complement of 60% ($2,160/$3,600).
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, R includes the permanent markdowns in determining year-end retail selling prices. Therefore, the aggregate retail selling price of R's ending table inventory is $1,350 (15 * $90). Approximating LCM under the retail method, the value of R's ending table inventory is $810 (60% * $1,350).

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that R uses the LIFO inventory method. R must value inventories at cost and, under paragraph (c) of this section, uses the retail cost method.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, R reduces the numerator of the cost complement by the amount of the margin protection payment. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, R includes the permanent markdown in the denominator of the cost complement. Therefore, R's cost complement is $2,160/$3,600, or 60%.
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, R includes the permanent markdown in determining year-end retail selling prices. Therefore, the aggregate retail selling price of R's ending inventory is $1,350 (15 * $90). Approximating cost under the retail method, the value of R's ending inventory is $810 (60% * $1,350).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2015, see § 1.471-8 as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2014.

§ 1.471-10
Applicability of long-term contract methods.
See § 1.460-2 for rules providing for the application of the long-term contract methods to certain manufacturing contracts.
[T.D. 8067, 51 FR 393, Jan. 6, 1986, as amended by T.D. 8929, 66 FR 2240, Jan. 11, 2001]
§ 1.471-11
Inventories of manufacturers.
(a)
Use of full absorption method of inventory costing.
In order to conform as nearly as may be possible to the best accounting practices and to clearly reflect income (as required by section 471 of the Code), both direct and indirect production costs must be taken into account in the computation of inventoriable costs in accordance with the “full absorption” method of inventory costing. Under the full absorption method of inventory costing production costs must be allocated to goods produced during the taxable year, whether sold during the taxable year or in inventory at the close of the taxable year determined in accordance with the taxpayer's method of identifying goods in inventory. Thus, the taxpayer must include as inventoriable costs all direct production costs and, to the extent provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, all indirect production costs. For purposes of this section, the term “financial reports” means financial reports (including consolidated financial statements) to shareholders, partners, beneficiaries or other proprietors and for credit purposes. See also § 1.263A-1T with respect to the treatment of production costs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1994. See also §§ 1.263A-1 and 1.263A-2 with respect to the treatment of production costs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993.
(b)
Production costs
—(1)
In general.
Costs are considered to be production costs to the extent that they are incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes. Production costs include direct production costs and fixed and variable indirect production costs.
(2)
Direct production costs.
(i) Costs classified as “direct production costs” are generally those costs which are incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes and are components of the cost of either direct material or direct labor. Direct material costs include the cost of those materials which become an integral part of the specific product and those materials which are consumed in the ordinary course of manufacturing and can be identified or associated with particular units or groups of units of that product. See § 1.471-3 for the elements of direct material costs. Direct labor costs include the cost of labor which can be identified or associated with particular units or groups of units of a specific product. The elements of direct labor costs include such items as basic compensation, overtime pay, vacation and holiday pay, sick leave pay (other than payments pursuant to a wage continuation plan under section 105(d)), shift differential, payroll taxes and payments to a supplemental unemployment benefit plan paid or incurred on behalf of employees engaged in direct labor. For the treatment of rework labor, scrap, spoilage costs, and any other costs not specifically described as direct production costs see § 1.471-11(c)(2).
(ii) Under the full absorption method, a taxpayer must take into account all items of direct production cost in his inventoriable costs. Nevertheless, a taxpayer will not be treated as using an incorrect method of inventory costing if he treats any direct production costs as indirect production costs, provided such costs are allocated to the taxpayer's ending inventory to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, for example, a taxpayer may treat direct labor costs as part of indirect production costs (for example, by use of the conversion cost method), provided all such costs are allocated to ending inventory to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this section.
(3)
Indirect production costs
—(i)
In general.
The term “indirect production costs” includes all costs which are incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes
other than direct production costs (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph). Indirect production costs may be classified as to kind or type in accordance with acceptable accounting principles so as to enable convenient identification with various production or manufacturing activities or functions and to facilitate reasonable groupings of such costs for purposes of determining unit product costs.
(ii)
Fixed and variable classifications.
For purposes of this section, fixed indirect production costs are generally those costs which do not vary significantly with changes in the amount of goods produced at any given level of production capacity. These fixed costs may include, among other costs, rent and property taxes on buildings and machinery incident to and necessary for manufacturing operations or processes. On the other hand, variable indirect production costs are generally those costs which do vary significantly with changes in the amount of goods produced at any given level of production capacity. These variable costs may include, among other costs, indirect materials, factory janitorial supplies, and utilities. Where a particular cost contains both fixed and variable elements, these elements should be segregated into fixed and variable classifications to the extent necessary under the taxpayer's method of allocation, such as for the application of the practical capacity concept (as described in paragraph (d) (4) of this section).
(c)
Certain indirect and production costs
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and in paragraph (d)(6)(v) of § 1.451-3, in order to determine whether indirect production costs referred to in paragraph (b) of this section must be included in a taxpayer's computation of the amount of inventoriable costs, three categories of costs have been provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. Costs described in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph must be included in the taxpayer's computation of the amount of inventoriable costs, regardless of their treatment by the taxpayer in his financial reports. Costs described in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph need not enter into the taxpayer's computation of the amount of inventoriable costs, regardless of their treatment by the taxpayer in his financial reports. Costs described in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph must be included in or excluded from the taxpayer's computation of the amount inventoriable costs in accordance with the treatment of such costs by the taxpayer in his financial reports and generally accepted accounting principles. For the treatment of indirect production costs described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph in the case of a taxpayer who is not using comparable methods of accounting for such costs for tax and financial reporting see paragraph (c)(3) of this section. For contracts entered into after December 31, 1982, notwithstanding this section, taxpayers who use an inventory method of accounting for extended period long-term contracts (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.451-3) for tax purposes may be required to use the cost allocation rules provided in paragraph (d)(6) of § 1.451-3 rather than the cost allocation rules provided in this section. See paragraph (d)(6)(v) of § 1.451-3. After a taxpayer has determined which costs must be treated as indirect production costs includible in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs, such costs must be allocated to a taxpayer's ending inventory in a manner prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Includibility of certain indirect production costs
—(i)
Indirect production
costs included in inventoriable costs. Indirect production costs which must enter into the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs (regardless of their treatment by a taxpayer in his financial reports) include:
(
a
) Repair expenses,
(
b
) Maintenance,
(
c
) Utilities, such as heat, power and light,
(
d
) Rent,
(
e
) Indirect labor and production supervisory wages, including basic compensation, overtime pay, vacation and holiday pay, sick leave pay (other than payments pursuant to a wage continuation plan under section 105(d), shift differential, payroll taxes and contributions to a supplemental unemployment benefit plan,
(
f
) Indirect materials and supplies,
(
g
) Tools and equipment not capitalized, and
(
h
) Costs of quality control and inspection,
to the extent, and only to the extent, such costs are incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes.
(ii)
Costs not included in inventoriable costs.
Costs which are not required to be included for tax purposes in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs (regardless of their treatment by a taxpayer in his financial reports) include:
(
a
) Marketing expenses,
(
b
) Advertising expenses,
(
c
) Selling expenses,
(
d
) Other distribution expenses,
(
e
) Interest,
(
f
) Research and experimental expenses including engineering and product development expenses,
(
g
) Losses under section 165 and the regulations thereunder,
(
h
) Percentage depletion in excess of cost depletion,
(
i
) Depreciation and amortization reported for Federal income tax purposes in excess of depreciation reported by the taxpayer in his financial reports,
(
j
) Income taxes attributable to income received on the sale of inventory,
(
k
) Pension contributions to the extent that they represent past services cost,
(
l
) General and administrative expenses incident to and necessary for the taxpayer's activities as a whole rather than to production or manufacturing operations or processes, and
(
m
) Salaries paid to officers attributable to the performance of services which are incident to and necessary for the taxpayer's activities taken as a whole rather than to production or manufacturing operations or processes.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a taxpayer consistently includes in his computation of the amount of inventoriable costs any of the costs described in the preceding sentence, a change in such method of inclusion shall be considered a change in method of accounting within the meaning of sections 446, 481, and paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(iii)
Indirect production costs includible in inventoriable costs depending upon treatment in taxpayer's financial reports.
In the case of costs listed in this subdivision, the inclusion or exclusion of such costs from the amount of inventoriable costs for purposes of a taxpayer's financial reports shall determine whether such costs must be included in or excluded from the computation of inventoriable costs for tax purposes, but only if such treatment is not inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles. In the case of costs which are not included in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph, nor listed in this subdivision, whether such costs must be included in or excluded from the computation of inventoriable costs for tax purposes depends upon the extent to which such costs are similar to costs included in subdivision (i) or (ii), and if such costs are dissimilar to costs in subdivision (i) or (ii), such costs shall be treated as included in or excludable from the amount of inventoriable costs in accordance with this subdivision. The costs listed in this subdivision are:
(
a) Taxes.
Taxes otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 164 (other than State and local and foreign income taxes) attributable to assets incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes. Thus, for example, the cost of State and local property taxes imposed on a factory or other production facility and any State and local taxes imposed on inventory must be included in or excluded from the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs for tax purposes depending upon their treatment by a taxpayer in his financial reports.
(
b) Depreciation and depletion.
Depreciation reported in financial reports and cost depletion on assets incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes. In computing cost depletion under this section, the adjusted basis of such assets shall be reduced by cost depletion and not by percentage depletion taken thereon.
(
c) Employee benefits.
Pension and profit-sharing contributions representing current service costs otherwise allowable as a deduction under
section 404, and other employee benefits incurred on behalf of labor incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes. These other benefits include workmen's compensation expenses, payments under a wage continuation plan described in section 105(d), amounts of a type which would be includible in the gross income of employees under non-qualified pension, profit-sharing and stock bonus plans, premiums on life and health insurance and miscellaneous benefits provided for employees such as safety, medical treatment, cafeteria, recreational facilities, membership dues, etc., which are otherwise allowable as deductions under chapter 1 of the Code.
(
d) Costs attributable to strikes, rework labor, scrap and spoilage.
Costs attributable to rework labor, scrap and spoilage which are incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes and costs attributable to strikes incident to production or manufacturing operation or processes.
(
e) Factory administrative expenses.
Administrative costs of production (but not including any cost of selling or any return on capital) incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes.
(
f) Officers' salaries.
Salaries paid to officers attributable to services performed incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes.
(
g) Insurance costs.
Insurance costs incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes such as insurance on production machinery and equipment. A change in the taxpayer's treatment in his financial reports of costs described in this subdivision which results in a change in treatment of such costs for tax purposes shall constitute a change in method of accounting within the meaning of sections 446 and 481 to which paragraph (e) applies.
(3)
Exception.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of § 1.451-3, in the case of a taxpayer whose method of accounting for production costs in his financial reports is not comparable to his method of accounting for such costs for tax purposes (such as a taxpayer using the prime cost method for purposes of financial reports), the following rules apply:
(i)
Indirect production costs included in inventoriable costs.
Indirect production costs which must enter into the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs (to the extent, and only to the extent, such costs are incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes) include:
(
a
) Repair expenses,
(
b
) Maintenance,
(
c
) Utilities, such as heat, power and light,
(
d
) Rent,
(
e
) Indirect labor and production supervisory wages, including basic compensation, overtime pay, vacation and holiday pay, sick leave pay (other than payments pursuant to a wage continuation plan under section 105(d)), shift differential, payroll taxes and contributions to a supplemental unemployment benefit plan,
(
f
) Indirect materials and supplies,
(
g
) Tools and equipment not capitalized,
(
h
) Costs of quality control and inspection,
(
i
) Taxes otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 164 (other than State and local and foreign income taxes),
(
j
) Depreciation and amortization reported for financial purposes and cost depletion,
(
k
) Administrative costs of production (but not including any cost of selling or any return on capital) incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes,
(
l
) Salaries paid to officers attributable to services performed incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes, and
(
m
) Insurance costs incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes such as insurance on production machinery and equipment.
(ii)
Costs not included in inventoriable costs.
Costs which are not required to be included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs include:
(
a
) Marketing expenses,
(
b
) Advertising expenses,
(
c
) Selling expenses,
(
d
) Other distribution expenses,
(
e
) Interest,
(
f
) Research and experimental expenses including engineering and product development expenses,
(
g
) Losses under section 165 and the regulations thereunder,
(
h
) Percentage depletion in excess of cost depletion,
(
i
) Depreciation reported for Federal income tax purposes in excess of depreciation reported by the taxpayer in his financial reports,
(
j
) Income taxes attributable to income received on the sale of inventory,
(
k
) Pension and profit-sharing contributions representing either past service costs or representing current service costs otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 404, and other employee benefits incurred on behalf of labor. These other benefits include workmen's compensation expenses, payments under a wage continuation plan described in section 105(d), amounts of a type which would be includible in the gross income of employees under nonqualified pension, profit-sharing and stock bonus plans, premiums on life and health insurance and miscellaneous benefits provided for employees such as safety, medical treatment, cafeteria, recreational facilities, membership dues, etc., which are otherwise allowable as deductions under chapter 1 of the Code,
(
l
) Cost attributable to strikes, rework labor, scrap and spoilage,
(
m
) General and administrative expenses incident to and necessary for the taxpayer's activities as a whole rather than to production or manufacturing operations or processes, and
(
n
) Salaries paid to officers attributable to the performance of services which are incident to and necessary for the taxpayer's activities as a whole rather than to production or manufacturing operations or processes.
(d)
Allocation methods
—(1)
In general.
Indirect production costs required to be included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph must be allocated to goods in a taxpayer's ending inventory (determined in accordance with the taxpayer's method of identification) by the use of a method of allocation which fairly apportions such costs among the various items produced. Acceptable methods for allocating indirect production costs to the cost of goods in the ending inventory include the manufacturing burden rate method and the standard cost method. In addition, the practical capacity concept can be used in conjunction with either the manufacturing burden rate or standard cost method.
(2)
Manufacturing burden rate method
—(i)
In general.
Manufacturing burden rates may be developed in accordance with acceptable accounting principles and applied in a reasonable manner. In developing a manufacturing burden rate, the factors described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section may be taken into account. Furthermore, if the taxpayer chooses, he may allocate different indirect production costs on the basis of different manufacturing burden rates. Thus, for example, the taxpayer may use one burden rate for allocating rent and another burden rate for allocating utilities. The method used by the taxpayer in allocating such costs in his financial reports shall be given great weight in determining whether the taxpayer's method employed for tax purposes fairly allocates indirect production costs to the ending inventory. Any change in a manufacturing burden rate which is merely a periodic adjustment to reflect current operating conditions, such as increases in automation or changes in operation, does not constitute a change in method of accounting under section 446. However, a change in the concept upon which such rates are developed does constitute a change in method of accounting requiring the consent of the Commissioner. The taxpayer shall maintain adequate records and working papers to support all manufacturing burden rate calculations.
(ii)
Development of manufacturing burden rate.
The following factors, among others, may be taken into account in developing manufacturing burden rates:
(
a
) The selection of an appropriate level of activity and period of time upon which to base the calculation of
rates which will reflect operating conditions for purposes of the unit costs being determined;
(
b
) The selection of an appropriate statistical base such as direct labor hours, direct labor dollars, or machine hours, or a combination thereof, upon which to apply the overhead rate to determine production costs; and
(
c
) The appropriate budgeting, classification and analysis of expenses (for example, the analysis of fixed and variable costs).
(iii)
Operation of the manufacturing burden rate method.
(
a
) The purpose of the manufacturing burden rate method used in conjunction with the full absorption method of inventory costing is to allocate an appropriate amount of indirect production costs to a taxpayer's goods in ending inventory by the use of predetermined rates intended to approximate the actual amount of indirect production costs incurred. Accordingly, the proper use of the manufacturing burden rate method under this section requires that any net negative or net positive difference between the total predetermined amount of indirect production costs allocated to the goods in ending inventory and the total amount of indirect production costs actually incurred and required to be allocated to such goods (i.e., the under or over-applied burden) must be treated as an adjustment to the taxpayer's ending inventory in the taxable year in which such difference arises. However, if such adjustment is not significant in amount in relation to the taxpayer's total actual indirect production costs for the year then such adjustment need not be allocated to the taxpayer's goods in ending inventory unless such allocation is made in the taxpayer's financial reports. The taxpayer must treat both positive and negative adjustments consistently.
(
b
) Notwithstanding subdivision (
a
), the practical capacity concept may be used to determine the total amount of fixed indirect production costs which must be allocated to goods in ending inventory. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(3)
Standard cost method
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer may use the so-called “standard cost” method of allocating inventoriable costs to the goods in ending inventory, provided he treats variances in accordance with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. The method used by the taxpayer in allocating such costs in his financial reports shall be given great weight in determining whether the taxpayer's method employed for tax purposes fairly allocates indirect production costs to the ending inventory. For purposes of this subparagraph, a “net positive overhead variance” shall mean the excess of total standard (or estimated) indirect production costs over total actual indirect production costs and a “net negative overhead variance” shall mean the excess of total actual indirect production costs over total standard (or estimated) indirect production costs.
(ii)
Treatment of variances.
(
a
) The proper use of the standard cost method pursuant to this subparagraph requires that a taxpayer must reallocate to the goods in ending inventory a pro rata portion of any net negative or net positive overhead variances and any net negative or net positive direct production cost variances. The taxpayer must apportion such variances among his various items in ending inventory. However, if such variances are not significant in amount in relation to the taxpayer's total actual indirect production costs for the year then such variances need not be allocated to the taxpayer's goods in ending inventory unless such allocation is made in the taxpayer's financial reports. The taxpayer must treat both positive and negative variances consistently.
(
b
) Notwithstanding subdivision (
a),
the practical capacity concept may be used to determine the total amount of fixed indirect production costs which must be allocated to goods in ending inventory. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(4)
Practical capacity concept
—(i)
In general.
Under the practical capacity concept, the percentage of practical capacity represented by actual production (not greater than 100 percent), as calculated under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, is used to determine the total amount of fixed indirect production costs which must be included in the taxpayer's computation of the
amount of inventoriable costs. The portion of such costs to be included in the taxpayer's computation of the amount of inventoriable costs is then combined with variable indirect production costs and both are allocated to the goods in ending inventory in accordance with this paragraph. See the example in subdivision (ii)(
d
) of this subparagraph. The difference (if any) between the amount of all fixed indirect production costs and the fixed indirect production costs which are included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs under the practical capacity concept is allowable as a deduction for the taxable year in which such difference occurs.
(ii)
Calculation of practical capacity
—(
a
)
In general.
Practical capacity and theoretical capacity (as described in (
c
) of this subdivision) may be computed in terms of tons, pounds, yards, labor hours, machine hours, or any other unit of production appropriate to the cost accounting system used by a particular taxpayer. The determination of practical capacity and theoretical capacity should be modified from time to time to reflect a change in underlying facts and conditions such as increased output due to automation or other changes in plant operation. Such a change does not constitute a change in method of accounting under sections 446 and 481.
(
b
)
Based upon taxpayer's experience.
In selecting an appropriate level of production activity upon which to base the calculation of practical capacity, the taxpayer shall establish the production operating conditions expected during the period for which the costs are being determined, assuming that the utilization of production facilities during operations will be approximately at capacity. This level of production activity is frequently described as practical capacity for the period and is ordinarily based upon the historical experience of the taxpayer. For example, a taxpayer operating on a 5-day, 8-hour basis may have a “normal” production of 100,000 units a year based upon three years of experience.
(
c
)
Based upon theoretical capacity.
Practical capacity may also be established by the use of “theoretical” capacity, adjusted for allowances for estimated inability to achieve maximum production, such as machine breakdown, idle time, and other normal work stoppages. Theoretical capacity is the level of production the manufacturer could reach if all machines and departments were operated continously at peak efficiency.
(
d
)
Example.
The provisions of (
c
) of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:
Corporation X operates a stamping plant with a theoretical capacity of 50 units per hour. The plant actually operates 1960 hours per year based on an 8-hour day, 5 day week basis and 15 shutdown days for vacations and holidays. A reasonable allowance for down time (the time allowed for ordinary and necessary repairs and maintenance) is 5 percent of practical capacity before reduction for down time. Assuming no loss of production during starting up, closing down, or employee work breaks, under these facts and circumstances X may properly make a practical capacity computation as follows:
Practical capacity without allowance for down time based on theoretical capacity per hour is (1960 × 50)
98,000
Reduction for down time (98,000 × 5 percent)
4,900
Practical capacity
93,100
The 93,100 unit level of activity (
i.e.,
practical capacity) would, therefore, constitute an appropriate base for calculating the amount of fixed indirect production costs to be included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs for the period under review. On this basis if only 76,000 units were produced for the period, the effect would be that approximately 81.6 percent (76,000, the actual number of units produced, divided by 93,100, the maximum number of units producible at practical capacity) of the fixed indirect production costs would be included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs during the year. The portion of the fixed indirect production costs not so included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs would be deductible in the year in which paid or incurred. Assume further that 7,600 units were on hand at the end of the taxable year and the 7,600 units were in the same proportion to the total units produced. Thus, 10 percent (7,600 units in inventory at the end of the taxable year, divided by 76,000, the actual number of units produced) of the fixed indirect production costs included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs (the above-mentioned 81.6 percent) and 10 percent of the variable indirect production costs would be included in the cost of the goods in the ending inventory, in accordance with a method of allocation provided by this paragraph.
(e)
Transition to full absorption method of inventory costing
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Mandatory requirement.
A taxpayer not using the full absorption method of inventory costing, as prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section, must change to that method. Any change to the full absorption method must be made by the taxpayer with respect to all trades or businesses of the taxpayer to which this section applies. A taxpayer not using the full absorption method of inventory costing, as prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section, who makes the special election provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph during the transition period described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph need not change to the full absorption method of inventory costing for taxable years prior to the year for which such election is made. In determining whether the taxpayer is changing to a more or less inclusive method of inventory costing, all positive and negative adjustments for all items and all trades or businesses of the taxpayer shall be aggregated. If the net adjustment is positive, paragraph (e)(3) shall apply, and if the net adjustment is negative, paragraph (e)(4) shall apply to the change. The rules otherwise prescribed in sections 446 and 481 and the regulations thereunder shall apply to any taxpayer who fails to make the special election in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. The transition rules of this paragraph are available only to those taxpayers who change their method of inventory costing.
(ii)
Special election during two-year-transition period.
If a taxpayer elects to change to the full absorption method of inventory costing during the transition period provided herein, he may elect on Form 3115 to change to such full absorption method of inventory costing and, in so doing, employ the transition procedures and adopt any of the transition methods prescribed in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Such election shall be made during the first 180 days of any taxable year beginning on or after September 19, 1973 and before September 19, 1975 (i.e., the “transition period”) and the change in inventory costing method shall be made for the taxable year in which the election is made. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if the taxpayer's prior returns have been examined by the Service prior to Sept. 19, 1973, and there is a pending issue involving the taxpayer's method of inventory costing, the taxpayer may request the application of this regulation by agreeing and filing a letter to that effect with the district director, within 90 days after September 19, 1973 to change to the full absorption method for the first taxable year of the taxpayer beginning after Sept. 19, 1973 and subsequently filing Form 3115 within the first 180 days of such taxable year of change.
(iii)
Change initiated by the Commissioner.
A taxpayer who properly makes an election under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be considered to have made a change in method of accounting not initiated by the taxpayer, notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.481-1(c)(5). Thus, any of the taxpayer's “pre-1954 inventory balances” with respect to such inventory shall not be taken into account as an adjustment under section 481. For purposes of this paragraph, a “pre-1954 inventory balance” is the net amount of the adjustments which would have been required if the taxpayer had made such change in his method of accounting with respect to his inventory in his first taxable year which began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954. See section 481(a)(2) and § 1.481-3.
(2)
Procedural rules for change.
If a taxpayer makes an election pursuant to subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the Commissioner's consent will be evidenced by a letter of consent to the taxpayer, setting forth the values of inventory, as provided by the taxpayer, determined under the full absorption method of inventory costing, except to the extent that no determination of such values is necessary under subparagraph (3)(ii)(B) of this paragraph (the cut off method), the amount of the adjustments (if any) required to be taken into account by section 481, and the treatment to be accorded to any such adjustments. Such full absorption values shall be subject to verification on examination by the district director. The taxpayer shall
preserve at his principal place of business all records, data, and other evidence relating to the full absorption values of inventory.
(3)
Transition methods.
In the case of a taxpayer who properly makes an election under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph during the transition period—
(i)
10-year adjustment period.
Such taxpayer may elect to take any adjustment required by section 481 with respect to any inventory being revalued under the full absorption method into account ratably over a period designated by the taxpayer at the time of such election, not to exceed the lesser of 10 taxable years commencing with the year of transition or the number of years the taxpayer has been on the inventory method from which he is changing. If the taxpayer dies or ceases to exist in a transaction other than one to which section 381(a) of the Code applies or if the taxpayer's inventory (determined under the full absorption method) on the last day of any taxable year is reduced (by other than a strike or involuntary conversion) by more than an amount equal to 33
1/3
percent of the taxpayer's inventory (determined under the full absorption method) as of the beginning of the year of change, the entire amount of the section 481 adjustment not previously taken into account in computing income shall be taken into account in computing income for the taxable year in which such taxpayer so ceases to exist or such taxpayer's inventory is so reduced.
(ii)
Additional rules for LIFO taxpayers.
A taxpayer who uses the LIFO method of inventory identification may either—
(
a
) Employ the special transition rules described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Accordingly, all LIFO layers must be revalued under the full absorption method and the section 481 adjustment must be computed for all items in all layers in inventory, but no pre-1954 inventory balances shall be taken into account as adjustments under section 481; or
(
b
)(
1
) Employ a cut-off method whereby the full absorption method is only applied in costing layers of inventory acquired during all taxable years beginning with the year for which an election is made under subparagraph (e)(1)(ii).
(
2
) In the case of a taxpayer using dollar value LIFO, employ a cut-off method whereby the taxpayer must use, for the year of change, the full absorption method in computing the base year cost and current cost of a dollar value inventory pool for the beginning of such year. The taxpayer shall not be required to recompute his LIFO inventories based on the full absorption method for a taxable year beginning prior to the year of change to the full absorption method. The base cost and layers of increment previously computed shall be retained and treated as if such base cost and layers of increment had been computed under the method authorized by this section. The taxpayer shall use the year of change as the base year in applying the double extension method or other method approved by the Commissioner, instead of the earliest year for which he adopted the LIFO method for any items in the pool.
(4)
Transition to full absorption method of inventory costing from a method more
inclusive of indirect production costs—(i)
Taxpayer has not previously changed to his present method pursuant to subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph.
If a taxpayer wishes to change to the full absorption method of inventory costing (as prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section) from a method of inventory costing which is more inclusive of indirect production costs and he has not previously changed to his present method by use of the special transition rules provided by subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph, he may elect on Form 3115 to change to the full absorption method of inventory costing and, in so doing, take into account any resulting section 481 adjustment generally over 10 taxable years commencing with the year of transition. The Commissioner's consent to such election will be evidenced by a letter of consent to the taxpayer setting forth the values of inventory, as provided by the taxpayer determined under the full absorption method of inventory costing, except to the extent that no determination of such values is necessary under subparagraph (3)(ii)(
b
)
of this paragraph, the amount of the adjustments (if any) required to be taken into account by section 481, and the treatment to be accorded such adjustments, subject to terms and conditions specified by the Commissioner to prevent distortions of income. Such election must be made within the transition period described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. A change pursuant to this subparagraph shall be a change initiated by the taxpayer as provided by § 1.481-1(c)(5). Thus, any of the taxpayers “pre-1954 inventory balances” will be taken into account as an adjustment under section 481.
(ii)
Taxpayer has previously changed to his present method pursuant to subparagraph (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph or would satisfy all the requirements of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph but fails to elect within the transition period.
If a taxpayer wishes to change to the full absorption method of inventory costing (as prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section) from a method of inventory costing which is more inclusive of indirect production costs and he has previously changed to his present method pursuant to subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph or he would satisfy the requirements of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph but he fails to elect within the transition period, he must secure the consent of the Commissioner prior to making such change.
[T.D. 7285, 38 FR 26185, Sept. 19, 1973, as amended by T.D. 8067, 51 FR 393, Jan. 6, 1986; T.D. 8131, 52 FR 10084, Mar. 30, 1987; T.D. 8482, 58 FR 42234, Aug. 9, 1993]
§ 1.472-1
Last-in, first-out inventories.
(a) Any taxpayer permitted or required to take inventories pursuant to the provisions of section 471, and pursuant to the provisions of §§ 1.471-1 to 1.471-9, inclusive, may elect with respect to those goods specified in his application and properly subject to inventory to compute his opening and closing inventories in accordance with the method provided by section 472, this section, and § 1.472-2. Under this last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method, the taxpayer is permitted to treat those goods remaining on hand at the close of the taxable year as being:
(1) Those included in the opening inventory of the taxable year, in the order of acquisition and to the extent thereof, and
(2) Those acquired during the taxable year.
The LIFO inventory method is not dependent upon the character of the business in which the taxpayer is engaged, or upon the identity or want of identity through commingling of any of the goods on hand, and may be adopted by the taxpayer as of the close of any taxable year.
(b) If the LIFO inventory method is used by a taxpayer who regularly and consistently, in a manner similar to hedging on a futures market, matches purchases with sales, then firm purchases and sales contracts (i.e., those not legally subject to cancellation by either party) entered into at fixed prices on or before the date of the inventory may be included in purchases or sales, as the case may be, for the purpose of determining the cost of goods sold and the resulting profit or loss, provided that this practice is regularly and consistently adhered to by the taxpayer and provided that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, income is clearly reflected thereby.
(c) A manufacturer or processor who has adopted the LIFO inventory method as to a class of goods may elect to have such method apply to the raw materials only (including those included in goods in process and in finished goods) expressed in terms of appropriate units. If such method is adopted, the adjustments are confined to costs of the raw material in the inventory and the cost of the raw material in goods in process and in finished goods produced by such manufacturer or processor and reflected in the inventory. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Assume that the opening inventory had 10 units of raw material, 10 units of goods in process, and 10 units of finished goods, and that the raw material cost was 6 cents a unit, the processing cost 2 cents a unit, and overhead cost 1 cent a unit. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that the entire amount of goods in process was 50 percent processed.

This excess is subject to determination of price under section 472(b)(1) and § 1.472-2. If the excess falls in goods in process, the same adjustment is applicable.
The only adjustment to the closing inventory is the cost of the raw material; the processing costs and overhead cost are not changed.
Example 2. Assume that the opening inventory had 5 units of raw material, 10 units of goods in process, and 20 units of finished goods, with the same prices as in Example 1, and that the closing inventory had 20 units of raw material, 20 units of goods in process, and 10 units of finished goods, with raw material costs as in the closing inventory in Example 1. The adjusted closing inventory would be as follows in so far as the raw material is concerned:

This excess is subject to determination of price under section 472(b)(1) and § 1.472-2.
The 20 units of raw material in the raw state plus 15 units of raw material in goods in process make up the 35 units of raw material that were contained in the opening inventory.
(d) For the purposes of this section, raw material in the opening inventory must be compared with similar raw material in the closing inventory. There may be several types of raw materials, depending upon the character, quality, or price, and each type of raw material in the opening inventory must be compared with a similar type in the closing inventory.
(e) In the cotton textile industry there may be different raw materials depending upon marked differences in length of staple, in color or grade of the cotton. But where different staple lengths or grades of cotton are being used at different times in the same mill to produce the same class of goods, such differences would not necessarily require the classification into different raw materials.
(f) As to the pork packing industry a live hog is considered as being composed of various raw materials, different cuts of a hog varying markedly in price and use. Generally a hog is processed into approximately 10 primal cuts and several miscellaneous articles. However, due to similarity in price and use, these may be grouped into fewer classifications, each group being classed as one raw material.
(g) When the finished product contains two or more different raw materials as in the case of cotton and rayon mixtures, each raw material is treated separately and adjustments made accordingly.
(h) Upon written notice addressed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention T:R, Washington, D.C. 20224 by the taxpayer, a taxpayer who has heretofore adopted the LIFO inventory method in respect of any goods may adopt the method authorized in this section and limit the election to the raw material including raw materials entering into goods in process and in finished goods. If this method is adopted as to any specific goods, it must be used exclusively for such goods for any
prior taxable year (not closed by agreement) to which the prior election applies and for all subsequent taxable years, unless permission to change is granted by the Commissioner.
(i) The election may also be limited to that phase in the manufacturing process where a product is produced that is recognized generally as a salable product as, for example, in the textile industry where one phase of the process is the production of yarn. Since yarn is generally recognized as a salable product, the election may be limited to that portion of the process when yarn is produced. In the case of copper and brass processors, the election may be limited to the production of bars, plates, sheets, etc., although these may be further processed into other products.
(j) The election may also apply to any one raw material, when two or more raw materials enter into the composition of the finished product; for example, in the case of cotton and rayon yarn, the taxpayer may elect to inventory the cotton only. However, a taxpayer who has previously made an election to use the LIFO inventory method may not later elect to exclude any raw materials that were covered by such previous election.
(k) If a taxpayer using the retail method of pricing inventories, authorized by § 1.471-8, elects to use in connection therewith the LIFO inventory method authorized by section 472 and this section, the apparent cost of the goods on hand at the end of the year, determined pursuant to § 1.471-8, shall be adjusted to the extent of price changes therein taking place after the close of the preceding taxable year. The amount of any apparent inventory increase or decrease to be eliminated in this adjustment shall be determined by reference to acceptable price indexes established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. Price indexes prepared by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics which are applicable to the goods in question will be considered acceptable to the Commissioner. Price indexes which are based upon inadequate records, or which are not subject to complete and detailed audit within the Internal Revenue Service, will not be approved.
(l) If a taxpayer uses consistently the so-called “dollar-value” method of pricing inventories, or any other method of computation established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner as reasonably adaptable to the purpose and intent of section 472 and this section, and if such taxpayer elects under section 472 to use the LIFO inventory method authorized by such section, the taxpayer's opening and closing inventories shall be determined under section 472 by the use of the appropriate adaptation. See § 1.472-8 for rules relating to the use of the dollar-value method.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11727, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6539, 26 FR 518, Jan. 20, 1961]
§ 1.472-2
Requirements incident to adoption and use of LIFO inventory method.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.472-1 with respect to raw material computations, with respect to retail inventory computations, and with respect to other methods of computation established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner as reasonably adapted to the purpose and intent of section 472, and in § 1.472-8 with respect to the “dollar-value” method, the adoption and use of the LIFO inventory method is subject to the following requirements:
(a) The taxpayer shall file an application to use such method specifying with particularity the goods to which it is to be applied.
(b) The inventory shall be taken at cost regardless of market value.
(c) Goods of the specified type included in the opening inventory of the taxable year for which the method is first used shall be considered as having been acquired at the same time and at a unit cost equal to the actual cost of the aggregate divided by the number of units on hand. The actual cost of the aggregate shall be determined pursuant to the inventory method employed by the taxpayer under the regulations applicable to the prior taxable year with the exception that restoration shall be made with respect to any writedown to market values resulting from the pricing of former inventories.
(d) Goods of the specified type on hand as of the close of the taxable year
in excess of what were on hand as of the beginning of the taxable year shall be included in the closing inventory, regardless of identification with specific invoices and regardless of specific cost accounting records, at costs determined pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph, dependent upon the character of the transactions in which the taxpayer is engaged:
(1)(i) In the case of a taxpayer engaged in the purchase and sale of merchandise, such as a retail grocer or druggist, or engaged in the initial production of merchandise and its sale without processing, such as a miner selling his ore output without smelting or refining, such costs shall be determined—
(
a
) By reference to the actual cost of the goods most recently purchased or produced;
(
b
) By reference to the actual cost of the goods purchased or produced during the taxable year in the order of acquisition;
(
c
) By application of an average unit cost equal to the aggregate cost of all of the goods purchased or produced throughout the taxable year divided by the total number of units so purchased or produced, the goods reflected in such inventory increase being considered for the purposes of section 472 as having been acquired all at the same time; or
(
d
) Pursuant to any other proper method which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, clearly reflects income.
(ii) Whichever of the several methods of valuing the inventory increase is adopted by the taxpayer and approved by the Commissioner shall be consistently adhered to in all subsequent taxable years so long as the LIFO inventory method is used by the taxpayer.
(iii) The application of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Suppose that the taxpayer adopts the LIFO inventory method for the taxable year 1957 with an opening inventory of 10 units at 10 cents per unit, that it makes 1957 purchases of 10 units as follows:

# Example 2.
Suppose that the taxpayer's closing inventory for 1958, the year following that involved in Example 1 of this subdivision, reflects an inventory decrease for the year, and not an increase; suppose that there is, accordingly, a 1958 closing inventory of 13 units. Inasmuch as the decreased closing inventory will be determined wholly by reference to the 15 units reflected in the opening inventory for the year, and will be taken “in the order of acquisition” pursuant to section 472 (b) (1), and inasmuch as the character of the taxpayer's opening inventory for 1958 will be dependent upon its method of valuing its 5-unit inventory increase for 1957, the closing inventory for 1958 will be computed as follows:

(2) In the case of a taxpayer engaged in manufacturing, fabricating, processing, or otherwise producing merchandise, such costs shall be determined:
(i) In the case of raw materials purchased or initially produced by the taxpayer, in the manner elected by the taxpayer under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to the same extent as if the taxpayer were engaged in purchase and sale transactions; and
(ii) In the case of goods in process, regardless of the stage to which the manufacture, fabricating, or processing may have advanced, and in the case of finished goods, pursuant to any proper method which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, clearly reflects income.
(e)
LIFO conformity requirement
—(1)
In general.
The taxpayer must establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the taxpayer, in ascertaining the income, profit, or loss for the taxable year for which the LIFO inventory method is first used, or for any subsequent taxable year, for credit purposes or for purposes of reports to shareholders, partners, or other proprietors, or to beneficiaries, has not used any inventory method other than that referred to in § 1.472-1 or at variance with the requirement referred to in § 1.472-2(c). See paragraph (e)(2) of this section for rules relating to the meaning of the term “taxable year” as used in this paragraph. The following are not considered at variance with the requirement of this paragraph:
(i) The taxpayer's use of an inventory method other than LIFO for purposes of ascertaining information reported as a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of the taxpayer's income, profit, or loss for a taxable year in credit statements or financial reports (including preliminary and unaudited financial reports). See paragraph (e)(3) of this section for rules relating to the reporting of supplemental and explanatory information ascertained by the use of an inventory method other than LIFO.
(ii) The taxpayer's use of an inventory method other than LIFO to ascertain the value of the taxpayer's inventory of goods on hand for purposes of reporting the value of such inventories as assets. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section for rules relating to such disclosures.
(iii) The taxpayer's use of an inventory method other than LIFO for purposes of ascertaining information reported in internal management reports. See paragraph (e)(5) of this section for rules relating to such reports.
(iv) The taxpayer's use of an inventory method other than LIFO for purposes of issuing reports or credit statements covering a period of operations that is less than the whole of a taxable year for which the LIFO method is used for Federal income tax purposes. See paragraph (e)(6) of this section for rules relating to series of interim reports.
(v) The taxpayer's use of the lower of LIFO cost or market method to value LIFO inventories for purposes of financial reports and credit statements. However, except as provided in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, a taxpayer may not use market value in lieu of cost to value inventories for purposes of financial reports or credit statements.
(vi) The taxpayer's use of a costing method or accounting method to ascertain income, profit, or loss for credit purposes or for purposes of financial reports if such costing method or accounting method is neither inconsistent with the inventory method referred to in § 1.472-1 nor at variance with the requirement referred to in § 1.472-2(c), regardless of whether such costing method or accounting method is used by the taxpayer for Federal income tax purposes. See paragraph (e)(8) of this section for examples of such costing methods and accounting methods.
(vii) For credit purposes or for purposes of financial reports, the taxpayer's treatment of inventories, after such inventories have been acquired in a transaction to which section 351 applies from a transferor that used the LIFO method with respect to such inventories, as if such inventories had the same acquisition dates and costs as in the hands of the transferor.
(viii) For credit purposes or for purposes of financial reports relating to a taxable year, the taxpayer's determination of income, profit, or loss for the taxable year by valuing inventories in
accordance with the procedures described in section 472(b) (1) and (3), notwithstanding that such valuation differs from the valuation of inventories for Federal income tax purposes because the taxpayer either—
(A) Adopted such procedures for credit or financial reporting purposes beginning with an accounting period other than the taxable year for which the LIFO method was first used by the taxpayer for Federal income tax purposes, or
(B) With respect to such inventories treated a business combination for credit or financial reporting purposes in a manner different from the treatment of the business combination for Federal income tax purposes.
(2)
One-year periods other than a taxable year.
The rules of this paragraph relating to the determination of income, profit, or loss for a taxable year and credit statements or financial reports that cover a taxable year also apply to the determination of income, profit, or loss for a one-year period other than a taxable year and credit statements or financial reports that cover a one-year period other than a taxable year, but only if the one-year period both begins and ends in a taxable year or years for which the taxpayer uses the LIFO method for Federal income tax purposes. For example, the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section apply to a taxpayer's determination of income for purposes of a credit statement that covers a 52-week fiscal year beginning and ending in a taxable year for which the taxpayer uses the LIFO method for Federal income tax purposes. Similarly, in the case of a calendar year taxpayer, the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section apply to the taxpayer's determination of income for purposes of a credit statement that covers the period October 1, 1981, through September 30, 1982, if the taxpayer uses the LIFO method for Federal income tax purposes in taxable years 1981 and 1982. However, the Commissioner will waive any violation of the requirements of this paragraph in the case of a credit statement or financial report that covers a one-year period other than a taxable year if the report was issued before January 22, 1981.
(3)
Supplemental and explanatory information
—(i)
Face of the income statement.
Information reported on the face of a taxpayer's financial income statement for a taxable year is not considered a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of the taxpayer's income, profit, or loss for the taxable year in credit statements or financial reports. For purposes of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the face of an income statement does not include notes to the income statement presented on the same page as the income statement, but only if all notes to the financial income statement are presented together.
(ii)
Notes to the income statement.
Information reported in notes to a taxpayer's financial income statement is considered a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss for the period covered by the income statement if all notes to the financial income statement are presented together and if they accompany the income statement in a single report. If notes to an income statement are issued in a report that does not include the income statement, the question of whether the information reported therein is supplemental or explanatory is determined under the rules in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section.
(iii)
Appendices and supplements to the income statement.
Information reported in an appendix or supplement to a taxpayer's financial income statement is considered a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss for the period covered by the income statement if the appendix or supplement accompanies the income statement in a single report and the information reported in the appendix or supplement is clearly identified as a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss as reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement. If an appendix or supplement to an income statement is issued in a report that does not include the income statement, the question of whether the information reported therein is supplemental or explanatory is determined under the
rules in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, an appendix or supplement to an income statement includes written statements, schedules, and reports that are labelled supplements or appendices to the income statement. However, sections of an annual report such as those labelled “President's Letter”, “Management's Analysis”, “Statement of Changes in Financial Position”, “Summary of Key Figures”, and similar sections are reports described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section and are not considered “supplements or appendices to an income statement” within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, regardless of whether such sections are also labelled as supplements or appendices. For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, information is considered to be clearly identified as a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss as reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement if the information either—
(A) Is reported in an appendix or supplement that contains a general statement identifying all such supplemental or explanatory information;
(B) Is identified specifically as supplemental or explanatory by a statement immediately preceding or following the disclosure of the information;
(C) Is disclosed in the context of making a comparison to corresponding information disclosed both on the face of the taxpayer's income statement and in the supplement or appendix; or
(D) Is a disclosure of the effect on an item reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement of having used the LIFO method.
For example, a restatement of cost of goods sold based on an inventory method other than LIFO is considered to be clearly identified as supplemental or explanatory information if the supplement or appendix containing the restatement contains a general statement that all information based on such inventory method is reported in the appendix or supplement as a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss as reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement.
(iv)
Other reports; in general.
The rules of paragraph (e)(3) (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section apply to the following types of reports: news releases; letters to shareholders, partners, or other proprietors or beneficiaries; oral statements at press conferences, shareholders' meetings or securities analysts' meetings; sections of an annual report such as those labelled “President's Letter”, “Management's Analysis”, “Statement of Changes in Financial Position”, “Summary of Key Figures”, and similar sections; and reports other than a taxpayer's income statement or accompanying notes, appendices, or supplements. Information disclosed in such a report is considered a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss for the period covered by an income statement if the supplemental or explanatory information is clearly identified as a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss as reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement and the specific item of information being explained or supplemented, such as the cost of goods sold, net income, or earnings per share ascertained using the LIFO method, is also reported in the other report.
(v)
Other reports; disclosure of non-LIFO income.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, supplemental or explanatory information is considered to have been clearly identified as such if it would be considered to have been clearly identified as such under the rules of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, relating to information reported in supplements or appendices to an income statement. For example, if at a securities analysts' meeting the following question is asked, “What would the reported earnings per share for the year have been if the FIFO method had been used to value inventories?”, it would be permissible to respond “Reported earnings per share for the year were $6.00. If the company had used the FIFO method to value inventories this year and had computed earnings based upon the following assumptions, earnings per share would
have been $8.20. FIFO earnings are based on the following assumptions:
“(A) The use of the same effective tax rate as used in computing LIFO earnings, and
“(B) All other conditions and assumptions remain the same, including—
“(
1
) The use of the LIFO method for Federal income tax purposes and
“(
2
) The investment of the tax savings resulting from such use of the LIFO method, the income from which is included in both LIFO and FIFO “earnings.” ”
(vi)
Other reports; disclosure of effect on income.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, if the only supplement to or explanation of a specific item is the effect on the item of having used LIFO instead of a method other than LIFO to value inventories, it is not necessary to also report the specific item. For example, if at a shareholders' meeting the question is asked, “What was the effect on reported earnings per share of not having used FIFO to value inventories?”, it would be permissible to respond “If earnings would have been computed on the basis of the following assumptions, the use of LIFO instead of FIFO to value inventories would have decreased reported earnings per share by $2.20. FIFO earnings are based on the following assumptions:
“(A) The use of the same effective tax rate as used in computing LIFO earnings, and
“(B) All other conditions and assumptions remain the same, including—
“(
1
) The use of the LIFO method for Federal income tax purposes and
“(
2
) The investment of the tax savings resulting from such use of the LIFO method, the income from which is included in both LIFO and FIFO earnings.”
(4)
Inventory asset value disclosures.
Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the use of an inventory method other than LIFO to ascertain the value of the taxpayer's inventories for purposes of reporting the value of the inventories as assets is not considered the ascertainment of income, profit, or loss and therefore is not considered at variance with the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Therefore, a taxpayer may disclose the value of inventories on a balance sheet using a method other than LIFO to identify the inventories, and such a disclosure will not be considered at variance with the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. However, the disclosure of income, profit, or loss for a taxable year on a balance sheet issued to creditors, shareholders, partners, other proprietors, or beneficiaries is considered at variance with the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) of this section if such income information is ascertained using an inventory method other than LIFO and such income information is for a taxable year for which the LIFO method is used for Federal income tax purposes. Therefore, a balance sheet that discloses the net worth of a taxpayer, determined as if income had been ascertained using an inventory method other than LIFO, may be at variance with the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) of this section if the disclosure of net worth is made in a manner that also discloses income, profit, or loss for a taxable year.
However, a disclosure of income, profit, or loss using an inventory method other than LIFO is not considered at variance with the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) of this section if the disclosure is made in the form of either a footnote to the balance sheet or a parenthetical disclosure on the face of the balance sheet. In addition, an income disclosure is not considered at variance with the requirement of paragraph (e)(1) of this section if the disclosure is made on the face of a supplemental balance sheet labelled as a supplement to the taxpayer's primary presentation of financial position, but only if, consistent with the rules of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, such a disclosure is clearly identified as a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of financial income as reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement.
(5)
Internal management reports.
[Reserved]
(6)
Series of interim reports.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, a series of credit statements or financial reports is considered a single statement or report covering a period
of operations if the statements or reports in the series are prepared using a single inventory method and can be combined to disclose the income, profit, or loss for the period. However, the Commissioner will waive any violation of the requirement of this paragraph in the case of a series of interim reports issued before February 6, 1978, that cover a taxable year, or a series of interim reports issued before January 22, 1981 that cover a one-year period other than a taxable year.
(7)
Market value.
The Commissioner will waive any violation of the requirement of this paragraph in the case of a taxpayer's use of market value in lieu of cost for a credit statement or financial report issued before January 22, 1981. However, the special rule of this (7) applies only to a taxpayer's use of market value in lieu of cost and does not apply to the use of a method of valuation such as market value in lieu of cost but not more than FIFO cost.
(8)
Use of different methods.
The following are examples of costing methods and accounting methods that are neither inconsistent with the inventory method referred to in § 1.472-1 nor at variance with the requirement of § 1.472-2(c) and which, under paragraph (e)(1)(vi) of this section, may be used to ascertain income, profit, or loss for credit purposes or for purposes of financial reports regardless of whether such method is also used by the taxpayer for Federal income tax purposes:
(i) Any method relating to the determination of which costs are includible in the computation of the cost of inventory under the full absorption inventory method.
(ii) Any method of establishing pools for inventory under the dollar-value LIFO inventory method.
(iii) Any method of determining the LIFO value of a dollar-value inventory pool, such as the double-extension method, the index method, and the link chain method.
(iv) Any method of determining or selecting a price index to be used with the index or link chain method of valuing inventory pools under the dollar-value LIFO inventory method.
(v) Any method permitted under § 1.472-8 for determining the current-year cost of closing inventory for purposes of using the dollar-value LIFO inventory method.
(vi) Any method permitted under § 1.472-2(d) for determining the cost of goods in excess of goods on hand at the beginning of the year for purposes of using a LIFO method other than the dollar-value LIFO method.
(vii) Any method relating to the classification of an item as inventory or a capital asset.
(viii) The use of an accounting period other than the period used for Federal income tax purposes.
(ix) The use of cost estimates.
(x) The use of actual cost of cut timber or the cost determined under section 631(a).
(xi) The use of inventory costs unreduced by any adjustment required by the application of section 108 and section 1017, relating to discharge of indebtedness.
(xii) The determination of the time when sales or purchases are accrued.
(xiii) The use of a method to allocate basis in the case of a business combination other than the method used for Federal income tax purposes.
(xiv) The treatment of transfers of inventory between affiliated corporations in a manner different from that required by § 1.1502-13.
(9)
Reconciliation of LIFO inventory values.
A taxpayer may be required to reconcile differences between the value of inventories maintained for credit or financial reporting purposes and for Federal income tax purposes in order to show that the taxpayer has satisfied the requirements of this paragraph.
(f) Goods of the specified type on hand as of the close of the taxable year preceding the taxable year for which this inventory method is first used shall be included in the taxpayer's closing inventory for such preceding taxable year at cost determined in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
(g) The LIFO inventory method, once adopted by the taxpayer with the approval of the Commissioner, shall be adhered to in all subsequent taxable years unless—
(1) A change to a different method is approved by the Commissioner; or
(2) The Commissioner determines that the taxpayer, in ascertaining income, profit, or loss for the whole of any taxable year subsequent to his adoption of the LIFO inventory method, for credit purposes or for the purpose of reports to shareholders, partners, or other proprietors, or to beneficiaries, has used any inventory method at variance with that referred to in § 1.472-1 and requires of the taxpayer a change to a different method for such subsequent taxable year or any taxable year thereafter.
(h) The records and accounts employed by the taxpayer in keeping his books shall be maintained in conformity with the inventory method referred to in § 1.472-1; and such supplemental and detailed inventory records shall be maintained as will enable the district director readily to verify the taxpayer's inventory computations as well as his compliance with the requirements of section 472 and §§ 1.472-1 through 1.472-7.
(i) Where the taxpayer is engaged in more than one trade or business, the Commissioner may require that if the LIFO method of valuing inventories is used with respect to goods in one trade or business the same method shall also be used with respect to similar goods in the other trades or businesses if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the use of such method with respect to such other goods is essential to a clear reflection of income.

§ 1.472-3
Time and manner of making election.
(a) The LIFO inventory method may be adopted and used only if the taxpayer files with his income tax return for the taxable year as of the close of which the method is first to be used a statement of his election to use such inventory method. The statement shall be made on Form 970 pursuant to the instructions printed with respect thereto and to the requirements of this section, or in such other manner as may be acceptable to the Commissioner. Such statement shall be accompanied by an analysis of all inventories of the taxpayer as of the beginning and as of the end of the taxable year for which the LIFO inventory method is proposed first to be used, and also as of the beginning of the prior taxable year. In the case of a manufacturer, this analysis shall show in detail the manner in which costs are computed with respect to raw materials, goods in process, and finished goods, segregating the products (whether in process or finished goods) into natural groups on the basis of either (1) similarity in factory processes through which they pass, or (2) similarity of raw materials used, or (3) similarity in style, shape, or use of finished products. Each group of products shall be clearly described.
(b) The taxpayer shall submit for the consideration of the Commissioner in connection with the taxpayer's adoption or use of the LIFO inventory method such other detailed information with respect to his business or accounting system as may be at any time requested by the Commissioner.
(c) As a condition to the taxpayer's use of the LIFO inventory method, the Commissioner may require that the method be used with respect to goods other than those specified in the taxpayer's statement of election if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the use of such method with respect to such other goods is essential to a clear reflection of income.
(d) Whether or not the taxpayer's application for the adoption and use of the LIFO inventory method should be approved, and whether or not such method, once adopted, may be continued, and the propriety of all computations incidental to the use of such method, will be determined by the Commissioner in connection with the examination of the taxpayer's income tax returns.

§ 1.472-4
Adjustments to be made by taxpayer.
A taxpayer may not change to the LIFO method of taking inventories unless, at the time he files his application for the adoption of such method, he agrees to such adjustments incident to the change to or from such method, or
incident to the use of such method, in the inventories of prior taxable years or otherwise, as the district director upon the examination of the taxpayer's returns may deem necessary in order that the true income of the taxpayer will be clearly reflected for the years involved.

§ 1.472-5
Revocation of election.
An election made to adopt and use the LIFO inventory method is irrevocable, and the method once adopted shall be used in all subsequent taxable years, unless the use of another method is required by the Commissioner, or authorized by him pursuant to a written application therefor filed as provided in paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11730, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.472-6
Change from LIFO inventory method.
If the taxpayer is granted permission by the Commissioner to discontinue the use of LIFO method of taking inventories, and thereafter to use some other method, or if the taxpayer is required by the Commissioner to discontinue the use of the LIFO method by reason of the taxpayer's failure to conform to the requirements detailed in § 1.472-2, the inventory of the specified goods for the first taxable year affected by the change and for each taxable year thereafter shall be taken—
(a) In conformity with the method used by the taxpayer under section 471 in inventorying goods not included in his LIFO inventory computations; or
(b) If the LIFO inventory method was used by the taxpayer with respect to all of his goods subject to inventory, then in conformity with the inventory method used by the taxpayer prior to his adoption of the LIFO inventory method; or
(c) If the taxpayer had not used inventories prior to his adoption of the LIFO inventory method and had no goods currently subject to inventory by a method other than the LIFO inventory method, then in conformity with such inventory method as may be selected by the taxpayer and approved by the Commissioner as resulting in a clear reflection of income; or
(d) In any event, in conformity with any inventory method to which the taxpayer may change pursuant to application approved by the Commissioner.

§ 1.472-8
Dollar-value method of pricing LIFO inventories.
(a)
Election to use dollar-value method.
Any taxpayer may elect to determine the cost of his LIFO inventories under the so-called “dollar-value” LIFO method, provided such method is used consistently and clearly reflects the income of the taxpayer in accordance with the rules of this section. The dollar-value method of valuing LIFO inventories is a method of determining cost by using “base-year” cost expressed in terms of total dollars rather than the quantity and price of specific goods as the unit of measurement. Under such method the goods contained in the inventory are grouped into a pool or pools as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The term “base-year cost” is the aggregate of the cost (determined as of the beginning of the taxable year for which the LIFO method is first adopted, i.e., the base date) of all items in a pool. The taxable year for which the LIFO method is first adopted with respect to any item in the pool is the “base year” for that pool, except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Liquidations and increments of items contained in the pool shall be reflected only in terms of a net liquidation or increment for the pool as a whole. Fluctuations may occur in quantities of various items within the pool, new items which properly fall within the pool may be added, and old items may disappear from the pool, all without necessarily effecting a change in the dollar value of the pool as a whole. An increment in the LIFO inventory occurs when the end of the
year inventory for any pool expressed in terms of base-year cost is in excess of the beginning of the year inventory for that pool expressed in terms of base-year cost. In determining the inventory value for a pool, the increment, if any, is adjusted for changing unit costs or values by reference to a percentage, relative to base-year-cost, determined for the pool as a whole. See paragraph (e) of this section. See also paragraph (f) of this section for rules relating to the change to the dollar-value LIFO method from another LIFO method.
(b)
Principles for establishing pools of manufacturers and processors
—(1)
Natural business unit pools.
A pool shall consist of all items entering into the entire inventory investment for a natural business unit of a business enterprise, unless the taxpayer elects to use the multiple pooling method provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Thus, if a business enterprise is composed of only one natural business unit, one pool shall be used for all of its inventories, including raw materials, goods in process, and finished goods. If, however, a business enterprise is actually composed of more than one natural business unit, more than one pool is required. Where similar types of goods are inventoried in two or more natural business units of the taxpayer, the Commissioner may apportion or allocate such goods among the various natural business units, if he determines that such apportionment or allocation is necessary in order to clearly reflect the income of such taxpayer. Where a manufacturer or processor is also engaged in the wholesaling or retailing of goods purchased from others, any pooling of the LIFO inventory of such purchased goods for the wholesaling or retailing operations shall be determined in accordance with the rules of paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Definition of natural business unit.
(i) Whether an enterprise is composed of more than one natural business unit is a matter of fact to be determined from all the circumstances. The natural business divisions adopted by the taxpayer for internal management purposes, the existence of separate and distinct production facilities and processes, and the maintenance of separate profit and loss records with respect to separate operations are important considerations in determining what is a business unit, unless such divisions, facilities, or accounting records are set up merely because of differences in geographical location. In the case of a manufacturer or processor, a natural business unit ordinarily consists of the entire productive activity of the enterprise within one product line or within two or more related product lines including (to the extent engaged in by the enterprise) the obtaining of materials, the processing of materials, and the selling of manufactured or processed goods. Thus, in the case of a manufacturer or processor, the maintenance and operation of a raw material warehouse does not generally constitute, of itself, a natural business unit. If the taxpayer maintains and operates a supplier unit the production of which is both sold to others and transferred to a different unit of the taxpayer to be used as a component part of another product, the supplier unit will ordinarily constitute a separate and distinct natural business unit. Ordinarily, a processing plant would not in itself be considered a natural business unit if the production of the plant, although saleable at this stage, is not sold to others, but is transferred to another plant of the enterprise, not operated as a separate division, for further processing or incorporation into another product. On the other hand, if the production of a manufacturing or processing plant is transferred to a separate and distinct division of the taxpayer, which constitutes a natural business unit, the supplier unit itself will ordinarily be considered a natural business unit. However, the mere fact that a portion of the production of a manufacturing or processing plant may be sold to others at a certain stage of processing with the remainder of the production being further processed or incorporated into another product will not of itself be determinative that the activities devoted to the production of the portion sold constitute a separate business unit. Where a manufacturer or processor is also engaged in the wholesaling or retailing of goods purchased
from others, the wholesaling or retailing operations with respect to such purchased goods shall not be considered a part of any manufacturing or processing unit.
(ii) The rules of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A corporation manufactures, in one division, automatic clothes washers and driers of both commercial and domestic grade as well as electric ranges, mangles, and dishwashers. The corporation manufactures, in another division, radios and television sets. The manufacturing facilities and processes used in manufacturing the radios and television sets are distinct from those used in manufacturing the automatic clothes washers, etc. Under these circumstances, the enterprise would consist of two business units and two pools would be appropriate, one consisting of all of the LIFO inventories entering into the manufacture of clothes washers and driers, electric ranges, mangles, and dishwashers and the other consisting of all of the LIFO inventories entering into the production of radio and television sets.

# Example 2.
A taxpayer produces plastics in one of its plants. Substantial amounts of the production are sold as plastics. The remainder of the production is shipped to a second plant of the taxpayer for the production of plastic toys which are sold to customers. The taxpayer operates his plastics plant and toy plant as separate divisions. Because of the different product lines and the separate divisions the taxpayer has two natural business units.

# Example 3.
A taxpayer is engaged in the manufacture of paper. At one stage of processing, uncoated paper is produced. Substantial amounts of uncoated paper are sold at this stage of processing. The remainder of the uncoated paper is transferred to the taxpayer's finishing mill where coated paper is produced and sold. This taxpayer has only one natural business unit since coated and uncoated paper are within the same product line.
(3)
Multiple pools
—(i)
Principles for establishing multiple pools.
(
a
) A taxpayer may elect to establish multiple pools for inventory items which are not within a natural business unit as to which the taxpayer has adopted the natural business unit method of pooling as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Each such pool shall ordinarily consist of a group of inventory items which are substantially similar. In determining whether such similarity exists, consideration shall be given to all the facts and circumstances. The formulation of detailed rules for selection of pools applicable to all taxpayers is not feasible. Important considerations to be taken into account include, for example, whether there is substantial similarity in the types of raw materials used or in the processing operations applied; whether the raw materials used are readily interchangeable; whether there is similarity in the use of the products; whether the groupings are consistently followed for purposes of internal accounting and management; and whether the groupings follow customary business practice in the taxpayer's industry. The selection of pools in each case must also take into consideration such factors as the nature of the inventory items subject to the dollar-value LIFO method and the significance of such items to the taxpayer's business operations. Where similar types of goods are inventoried in natural business units and multiple pools of the taxpayer, the Commissioner may apportion or allocate such goods among the natural business units and the multiple pools, if he determines that such apportionment or allocation is necessary in order to clearly reflect the income of the taxpayer.
(
b
) Raw materials which are substantially similar shall be pooled together in accordance with the principles of this subparagraph. However, inventories of raw or unprocessed materials of an unlike nature may not be placed into one pool, even though such materials become part of otherwise identical finished products.
(
c
) Finished goods and goods-in-process in the inventory shall be placed into pools classified by major classes or types of goods. The same class or type of finished goods and goods-in-process shall ordinarily be included in the same pool. Where the material content of a class of finished goods and goods-in-process included in a pool has been changed, for example, to conform with current trends in an industry, a separate pool of finished goods and goods-in-process will not ordinarily be required unless the change in material content results in a substantial change in the finished goods.
(
d
) The requirement that pools be established by major types of materials
or major classes of goods is not to be construed so as to preclude the establishment of a miscellaneous pool. Since a taxpayer may elect the dollar-value LIFO method with respect to all or any designated goods in his inventory, there may be a number of such inventory items covered in the election. A miscellaneous pool shall consist only of items which are relatively insignificant in dollar value by comparison with other inventory items in the particular trade or business and which are not properly includible as part of another pool.
(ii)
Raw materials content pools.
The dollar-value method of pricing LIFO inventories may be used in conjunction with the raw materials content method authorized in § 1.472-1. Raw materials (including the raw material content of finished goods and goods-in-process) which are substantially similar shall be pooled together in accordance with the principles of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. However, inventories of materials of an unlike nature may not be placed into one pool, even though such materials become part of otherwise identical finished products.
(4)
IPIC method pools.
A manufacturer or processor that elects to use the inventory price index computation method described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section (IPIC method) for a trade or business may elect to establish dollar-value pools for those items accounted for using the IPIC method based on the 2-digit commodity codes (i.e., major commodity groups) in Table 6 (Producer price indexes and percent changes for commodity groupings and individual items, not seasonally adjusted) of the “PPI Detailed Report” published monthly by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (available from New Orders, Superintendent of Documents, PO Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954). A taxpayer electing to establish dollar-value pools under this paragraph (b)(4) may combine IPIC pools that comprise less than 5 percent of the total current-year cost of all dollar-value pools to form a single miscellaneous IPIC pool. A taxpayer electing to establish dollar-value pools under this paragraph (b)(4) may combine a miscellaneous IPIC pool that comprises less than 5 percent of the total current-year cost of all dollar-value pools with the largest IPIC pool. Each of these 5 percent rules is a method of accounting. A taxpayer may not change to, or cease using, either 5 percent rule without obtaining the Commissioner's prior consent. Whether a specific IPIC pool or the miscellaneous IPIC pool satisfies the applicable 5 percent rule must be determined in the year of adoption or year of change (whichever is applicable) and redetermined every third taxable year. Any change in pooling required or permitted as a result of a 5 percent rule is a change in method of accounting. A taxpayer must secure the consent of the Commissioner pursuant to § 1.446-1(e) before combining or separating pools and must combine or separate its IPIC pools in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(c)
Principles for establishing pools for wholesalers, retailers, etc
—(1)
In general.
Items of inventory in the hands of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, and distributors shall be placed into pools by major lines, types, or classes of goods. In determining such groupings, customary business classifications of the particular trade in which the taxpayer is engaged is an important consideration. An example of such customary business classification is the department in the department store. In such case, practices are relatively uniform throughout the trade, and departmental grouping is peculiarly adapted to the customs and needs of the business. However, in appropriate cases, the principles set forth in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, relating to pooling by natural business units, may be used, with permission of the Commissioner, by wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, or distributors. Where a wholesaler or retailer is also engaged in the manufacturing or processing of goods, the pooling of the LIFO inventory for the manufacturing or processing operations shall be determined in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
IPIC method pools.
A retailer that elects to use the inventory price index computation method described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section (IPIC method) for a trade or business may elect to establish dollar-value pools for those
items accounted for using the IPIC method based on either the general expenditure categories (i.e., major groups) in Table 3 (Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. city average, detailed expenditure categories) of the “CPI Detailed Report” or the 2-digit commodity codes (i.e., major commodity groups) in Table 6 (Producer price indexes and percent changes for commodity groupings and individual items, not seasonally adjusted) of the “PPI Detailed Report.” A wholesaler, jobber, or distributor that elects to use the IPIC method for a trade or business may elect to establish dollar-value pools for any group of goods accounted for using the IPIC method and included within one of the 2-digit commodity codes (i.e., major commodity groups) in Table 6 (Producer price indexes and percent changes for commodity groupings and individual items, not seasonally adjusted) of the “PPI Detailed Report.” The “CPI Detailed Report” and the “PPI Detailed Report” are published monthly by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (available from New Orders, Superintendent of Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954). A taxpayer electing to establish dollar-value pools under this paragraph (c)(2) may combine IPIC pools that comprise less than 5 percent of the total current-year cost of all dollar-value pools to form a single miscellaneous IPIC pool. A taxpayer electing to establish pools under this paragraph (c)(2) may combine a miscellaneous IPIC pool that comprises less than 5 percent of the total current-year cost of all dollar-value pools with the largest IPIC pool. Each of these 5 percent rules is a method of accounting. Thus, a taxpayer may not change to, or cease using, either 5 percent rule without obtaining the Commissioner's prior consent. Whether a specific IPIC pool or the miscellaneous IPIC pool satisfies the applicable 5 percent rule must be determined in the year of adoption or year of change (whichever is applicable) and redetermined every third taxable year. Any change in pooling required or permitted under a 5 percent rule is a change in method of accounting. A taxpayer must secure the consent of the Commissioner pursuant to section 1.446-1(e) before combining or separating pools and must combine or separate its IPIC pools in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(d)
Determination of appropriateness of pools.
Whether the number and the composition of the pools used by the taxpayer is appropriate, as well as the propriety of all computations incidental to the use of such pools, will be determined in connection with the examination of the taxpayer's income tax returns. Adequate records must be maintained to support the base-year unit cost as well as the current-year unit cost for all items priced on the dollar-value LIFO inventory method, regardless of the method authorized by paragraph (e) of this section which is used in computing the LIFO value of the dollar-value pool. The pool or pools selected must be used for the year of adoption and for all subsequent taxable years unless a change is required by the Commissioner in order to clearly reflect income, or unless permission to change is granted by the Commissioner as provided in paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1. However, see paragraph (h) of this section for authorization to change the method of pooling in certain specified cases.
(e)
Methods of computation of the LIFO value of a dollar-value pool
—(1)
Methods authorized.
A taxpayer may ordinarily use only the so-called “double-extension” method for computing the base-year and current-year cost of a dollar-value inventory pool. Where the use of the double-extension method is impractical, because of technological changes, the extensive variety of items, or extreme fluctuations in the variety of the items, in a dollar-value pool, the taxpayer may use an index method for computing all or part of the LIFO value of the pool. An index may be computed by double-extending a representative portion of the inventory in a pool or by the use of other sound and consistent statistical methods. The index used must be appropriate to the inventory pool to which it is to be applied. The appropriateness of the method of computing the index and the accuracy, reliability, and suitability of
the use of such index must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the district director in connection with the examination of the taxpayer's income tax returns. The use of any so-called “link-chain” method will be approved for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1960, only in those cases where the taxpayer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the district director that the use of either an index method or the double-extension method would be impractical or unsuitable in view of the nature of the pool. A taxpayer using either an index or link-chain method shall attach to his income tax return for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1960, for which the index or link-chain method is used, a statement describing the particular link-chain method or the method used in computing the index. The statement shall be in sufficient detail to facilitate the determination as to whether the method used meets the standards set forth in this subparagraph. In addition, a copy of the statement shall be filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: T:R, Washington, D.C. 20224. The taxpayer shall submit such other information as may be requested with respect to such index or link-chain method. Adequate records must be maintained by the taxpayer to support the appropriateness, accuracy, and reliability of an index or link-chain method. A taxpayer may request the Commissioner to approve the appropriateness of an index or link-chain method for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1960, for which it is used. Such request must be submitted within 90 days after the beginning of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1960, in which the taxpayer desires to use the index or link-chain method, or on or before May 1, 1961, whichever is later. A taxpayer entitled to use the retail method of pricing LIFO inventories authorized by paragraph (k) of § 1.472-1 may use retail price indexes prepared by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Any method of computing the LIFO value of a dollar-value pool must be used for the year of adoption and all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer obtains the consent of the Commissioner in accordance with paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1 to use a different method.
(2)
Double-extension method.
(i) Under the double-extension method the quantity of each item in the inventory pool at the close of the taxable year is extended at both base-year unit cost and current-year unit cost. The respective extensions at the two costs are then each totaled. The first total gives the amount of the current inventory in terms of base-year cost and the second total gives the amount of such inventory in terms of current-year cost.
(ii) The total current-year cost of items making up a pool may be determined—
(
a
) By reference to the actual cost of the goods most recently purchased or produced;
(
b
) By reference to the actual cost of the goods purchased or produced during the taxable year in the order of acquisition;
(
c
) By application of an average unit cost equal to the aggregate cost of all of the goods purchased or produced throughout the taxable year divided by the total number of units so purchased or produced; or
(
d
) Pursuant to any other proper method which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, clearly reflects income.
(iii) Under the double-extension method a base-year unit cost must be ascertained for each item entering a pool for the first time subsequent to the beginning of the base year. In such a case, the base-year unit cost of the entering item shall be the current-year cost of that item unless the taxpayer is able to reconstruct or otherwise establish a different cost. If the entering item is a product or raw material not in existence on the base date, its cost may be reconstructed, that is, the taxpayer using reasonable means may determine what the cost of the item would have been had it been in existence in the base year. If the item was in existence on the base date but not stocked by the taxpayer, he may establish, by using available data or records, what the cost of the item would have been to the taxpayer had he stocked the item. If the base-year unit cost of the entering item is either reconstructed or otherwise established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner,
such cost may be used as the base-year unit cost in applying the double-extension method. If the taxpayer does not reconstruct or establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner a base-year unit cost, but does reconstruct or establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the cost of the item at some year subsequent to the base year, he may use the earliest cost which he does reconstruct or establish as the base-year unit cost.
(iv) To determine whether there is an increment or liquidation in a pool for a particular taxable year, the end of the year inventory of the pool expressed in terms of base-year cost is compared with the beginning of the year inventory of the pool expressed in terms of base-year cost. When the end of the year inventory of the pool is in excess of the beginning of the year inventory of the pool an increment occurs in the pool for that year. If there is an increment for the taxable year, the ratio of the total current-year cost of the pool to the total base-year cost of the pool must be computed. This ratio when multiplied by the amount of the increment measured in terms of base-year cost gives the LIFO value of such increment. The LIFO value of each such increment is hereinafter referred to in this section as the “layer of increment” and must be separately accounted for and a record thereof maintained as a separate layer of the pool, and may not be combined with a layer of increment occurring in a different year. On the other hand, when the end of the year inventory of the pool is less than the beginning of the year inventory of the pool, a liquidation occurs in the pool for that year. Such liquidation is to be reflected by reducing the most recent layer of increment by the excess of the beginning of the year inventory over the end of the year inventory of the pool. However, if the amount of the liquidation exceeds the amount of the most recent layer of increment, the preceding layers of increment in reverse chronological order are to be successively reduced by the amount of such excess until all the excess is absorbed. The base-year inventory is to be reduced by liquidation only to the extent that the aggregate of all liquidation exceeds the aggregate of all layers of increment.
(v) The following examples illustrate inventories under the double-extension the computation of the LIFO value of method.

# Example 1.
(a) A taxpayer elects, beginning with the calendar year 1961, to compute his inventories by use of the LIFO inventory method under section 472 and further elects to use the dollar-value method in pricing such inventories as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. He creates Pool No. 1 for items A, B, and C. The composition of the inventory for Pool No. 1 at the base date, January 1, 1961, is as follows:
Items
Units
Unit cost
Total cost
A
1,000
$5
$5,000
B
2,000
4
8,000
C
500
2
1,000
Total base-year cost at Jan. 1, 1961
14,000
(b) The closing inventory of Pool No. 1 at December 31, 1961, contains 3,000 units of A, 1,000 units of B, and 500 units of C. The taxpayer computes the current-year cost of the items making up the pool by reference to the actual cost of goods most recently purchased. The most recent purchases of items A, B, and C are as follows:
Item
Purchase date
Quantity purchased
Unit cost
A
Dec. 15, 1961
3,500
$6.00
B
Dec. 10, 1961
2,000
5.00
C
Nov. 1, 1961
500
2.50
(c) The inventory of Pool No. 1 at December 31, 1961, shown at base-year and current-year cost is as follows:
Item
Quantity
Dec. 31, 1961, inventory at Jan. 1, 1961, base-year cost
Unit cost
Amount
Dec. 31, 1961, inventory at current-year cost

Total
20,000
24,250
(d) If the amount of the December 31, 1961, inventory at base-year cost were equal to, or less than, the base-year cost of $14,000 at January 1, 1961, such amount would be the closing LIFO inventory at December 31, 1961. However, since the base-year cost of the closing LIFO inventory at December 31, 1961, amounts to $20,000, and is in excess of the
$14,000 base-year cost of the opening inventory for that year, there is a $6,000 increment in Pool No. 1 during the year. This increment must be valued at current-year cost, i.e., the ratio of 24,250/20,000, or 121.25 percent. The LIFO value of the inventory at December 31, 1961, is $21,275, computed as follows:

# Example 2.
(a) Assume the taxpayer in Example 1 during the year 1962 completely disposes of item C and purchases item D. Assume further that item D is properly includible in Pool No. 1 under the provisions of this section. The closing inventory on December 31, 1962, consists of quantities at current-year unit cost, as follows:
Items

D

(b) The taxpayer establishes that the cost of item D, had he acquired it on January 1, 1961, would have been $2.00 per unit. Such cost shall be used as the base-year unit cost for item D, and the LIFO computations at December 31, 1962, are made as follows:

(c) Since the closing inventory at base-year cost, $18,000, is less than the 1962 opening inventory at base-year cost, $20,000, a liquidation of $2,000 has occurred during 1962. This liquidation is to be reflected by reducing the most recent layer of increment. The LIFO value of the inventory at December 31, 1962, is $18,850, and is summarized as follows:

Inventory price index computation (IPIC) method
—(i)
In general.
The inventory price index computation method provided by this paragraph (e)(3) (IPIC method) is an elective method of determining the LIFO value of a dollar-value pool using consumer or producer price indexes published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). A taxpayer using the IPIC method must compute a separate inventory price index (IPI) for each dollar-value pool. This IPI is used to convert the total current-year cost of the items in a dollar-value pool to base-year cost in order to determine whether there is an increment or liquidation in terms of base-year cost and, if there is an increment, to determine the LIFO inventory value of the current year's layer of increment (layer). Using one IPI to compute the base-year cost of a dollar-value pool for the current taxable year and using a different IPI to compute the LIFO inventory value of the current taxable year's layer is not permitted under the IPIC method. The IPIC method will be accepted by the Commissioner as an appropriate method of computing an index, and the use of that index to compute the LIFO value of a dollar-value pool will be accepted as accurate, reliable, and suitable. The appropriateness of a taxpayer's computation of an IPI, which includes all the steps described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, will be determined in connection with an examination of the taxpayer's federal income tax return. A taxpayer using the IPIC method may elect to establish dollar-value pools according to the special rules in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(2) of this section or the general rules in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Taxpayers eligible to use the IPIC
method are described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. The manner in which an IPI is computed is described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section. Rules relating to the adoption of, or change to, the IPIC method are in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section.
(ii)
Eligibility.
Any taxpayer electing to use the dollar-value LIFO method may elect to use the IPIC method. Except as provided in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or in other published guidance, a taxpayer that elects to use the IPIC method for a specific trade or business must use that method to account for all items of dollar-value LIFO inventory. A taxpayer that uses the retail price indexes computed by the BLS and published in “Department Store Inventory Price Indexes” (available from the BLS by calling (202) 606-6325 and entering document code 2415) may elect to use the IPIC method for items that do not fall within any of the major groups listed in “Department Store Inventory Price Indexes.”
(iii)
Computation of an inventory price index
—(A)
In general.
The computation of an IPI for a dollar-value pool requires the following four steps, which are described in more detail in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii): First, selection of a BLS table and an appropriate month; second, assignment of items in a dollar-value pool to BLS categories (selected BLS categories); third, computation of category inflation indexes for selected BLS categories; and fourth, computation of the IPI. A taxpayer may compute the IPI for each dollar-value pool using either the double-extension method (double-extension IPIC method) or the link-chain method (link-chain IPIC method), without regard to whether the use of a double-extension method is impractical or unsuitable. The use of either the double-extension IPIC method or the link-chain IPIC method is a method of accounting, and the adopted method must be applied consistently to all dollar-value pools within a trade or business accounted for under the IPIC method. A taxpayer that wants to change from the double-extension IPIC method to the link-chain IPIC method, or vice versa, must secure the consent of the Commissioner under § 1.446-1(e). This change must be made with a new base year as described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(1).
(B)
Selection of BLS table and appropriate month
—(
1
)
In general.
Under the IPIC method, an IPI is computed using the consumer or producer price indexes for certain categories (BLS price indexes and BLS categories, respectively) listed in the selected BLS table of the “CPI Detailed Report” or the “PPI Detailed Report” for the appropriate month.
(
2) BLS table selection.
Manufacturers, processors, wholesalers, jobbers, and distributors must select BLS price indexes from Table 6 (Producer price indexes and percent changes for commodity groupings and individual items, not seasonally adjusted) of the “PPI Detailed Report”, unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that selecting BLS price indexes from another table of the “PPI Detailed Report” is more appropriate. Retailers may select BLS price indexes from either Table 3 (Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. city average, detailed expenditure categories) of the “CPI Detailed Report” or from Table 6 (or another more appropriate table) of the “PPI Detailed Report.” The selection of a BLS table is a method of accounting and must be used for the taxable year of adoption and all subsequent years, unless the taxpayer obtains the Commissioner's consent under § 1.446-1(e) to change its table selection. A taxpayer that changes its BLS table must establish a new base year in the year of change as described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section.
(
3) Appropriate month.
In the case of a retailer using the retail method, the appropriate month is the last month of the retailer's taxable year. In the case of all other taxpayers, the appropriate month is the month most consistent with the method used to determine the current-year cost of the dollar-value pool under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section and the taxpayer's history of inventory production or purchases during the taxable year. A taxpayer not using the retail method may annually select an appropriate month for each dollar-value pool or make an election on Form 970, “Application to Use LIFO
Inventory Method,” to use a representative appropriate month (representative month). An election to use a representative month is a method of accounting and the month elected must be used for the taxable year of the election and all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer obtains the Commissioner's consent under § 1.446-1(e) to change or revoke its election.
(

)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
):

# Example 1. Determining an appropriate month.
A wholesaler of seasonal goods timely files a Form 970, “Application to Use LIFO Inventory Method,” for the taxable year ending December 31, 2001. The taxpayer indicates elections to use the dollar-value LIFO method, to determine the current-year cost using the earliest acquisitions method in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this section, and to use the IPIC method under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Although the taxpayer purchases inventory items regularly throughout the year, the items purchased vary according to the seasons. The seasonal items on hand at December 31, 2001, are purchased between October and December. Thus, based on the taxpayer's use of the earliest acquisitions method of determining current-year cost and its experience with inventory purchases, the appropriate month for the items represented in the ending inventory at December 31, 2001, is October.

# Example 2. Electing a representative month.
A retailer not using the retail method timely files a Form 970, “Application to Use LIFO Inventory Method,” for the taxable year ending December 31, 2001. The taxpayer indicates elections to use the dollar-value LIFO method, the most recent purchases method of determining current-year cost under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(
a
) of this section, the IPIC method under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, and December as its representative month under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section. The items in the taxpayer's ending inventory are purchased fairly uniformly throughout the year, with the first purchases normally occurring in January and the last purchases normally occurring in December. The taxpayer's election to use December as its representative month is permissible because the taxpayer elected to use the most recent purchases method and the taxpayer's last purchases of the taxable year normally occur during December, the last month of the taxpayer's taxable year.

# Example 3. Changing representative month.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except the taxpayer files a Form 3115, “Application for Change in Accounting Method,” requesting permission to change to the earliest acquisitions method of determining current-year cost in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this section and to change its representative month from December to January beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2003. If the Commissioner consents to the taxpayer's request to change to the earliest acquisitions method, December will no longer be a permissible representative month for this taxpayer because of the absence of a nexus between the earliest acquisitions method, the month of December (the last month of the taxpayer's taxable year), and the taxpayer's experience with inventory purchases during the year. Thus, the Commissioner will permit the taxpayer to change its representative month to January, the first month of the taxpayer's taxable year.

# Example 4. Changing representative month.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2.
In 2002, the taxpayer changes its annual accounting period to a taxable year ending June 30, which requires the taxpayer to file a return for the short taxable year beginning January 1, 2002, and ending June 30, 2002. As a result, December is no longer a permissible representative month because of the absence of a nexus between the most recent purchases method, the month of December, and the taxpayer's experience with inventory purchases during the year. The taxpayer should file a Form 3115 requesting permission to change its representative month from December to June beginning with the short taxable year ending June 30, 2002. Because the taxpayer's last purchases of the taxable year now will occur in June, the Commissioner will consent to the taxpayer's request to change its representative month to June.

# Example 5. Changing representative month.
The facts are the same as
in Example 2,
except that the taxpayer elects to use January as its representative month. The taxpayer timely files a Form 3115 requesting permission to change its representative month from January to December beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2003. January is not a permissible representative month because of the absence of a nexus between the most recent purchases method, the taxpayer's history of inventory purchases, and the month of January, the first month in the taxpayer's taxable year. Because December is a permissible representative month, the Commissioner will permit the taxpayer to change its representative month to December.
(C)
Assignment of inventory items to BLS categories
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section, a taxpayer must assign each item in a dollar-value pool to the most-detailed BLS category of the selected BLS table that contains that
item. For example, in Table 6 of the “PPI Detailed Report” for a given month, the commodity codes for the various BLS categories run from 2 to 8 digits, with the least-detailed BLS categories having a 2-digit code and the most-detailed BLS categories usually (but not always) having an 8-digit code. For purposes of assigning items to the most-detailed BLS category, manufacturers and processors must assign each raw material item to the most-detailed PPI category that includes that raw material and must assign each finished good item to the most-detailed PPI category that includes that finished good. In addition, manufacturers and processors must assign each work-in-process (WIP) item to the most-detailed PPI category that includes the finished good into which the item will be manufactured or processed. For this purpose,
finished good
means a salable item that the taxpayer regularly sells. For example, a gasoline-engine manufacturer that also manufactures the pistons used in those engines and regularly sells some of the pistons (e.g., to retailers of replacement parts) must assign both finished pistons that have not been affixed to an engine block and piston WIP items to the most-detailed PPI category that includes pistons. Finished pistons that have been affixed to an engine block must be assigned to the most-detailed PPI category that includes gasoline engines. In contrast, if sales of these pistons occur infrequently, the taxpayer must assign both finished pistons and piston WIP items to the most-detailed PPI category that includes gasoline engines.
(
2
)
10 percent method.
Instead of assigning each item in a dollar-value pool to the most-detailed BLS categories, as described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section, a taxpayer may elect to use the 10 percent method described in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
). Under the 10 percent method, items are assigned to BLS categories using a three-step procedure. First, when the current-year cost of a specific item is 10 percent or more of the total current-year cost of the dollar-value pool, the taxpayer must assign that item to the most-detailed BLS category that includes that item (10 percent BLS category). Any other item that is includible in that 10 percent BLS category (other than an item that qualifies for its own 10 percent BLS category under the preceding sentence) must be assigned to that 10 percent BLS category. Second, if one or more items have not been assigned to BLS categories in the first step, the taxpayer must investigate successively less-detailed BLS categories and assign the unassigned item(s) to the first BLS category that contains unassigned items whose current-year cost, in the aggregate, is 10 percent or more of the total current-year cost of the dollar-value pool (also, 10 percent BLS categories). This step must be repeated until all the items in the dollar-value pool have been included in an appropriate 10 percent BLS category, the current-year cost of the unassigned items, in the aggregate, is less than 10 percent of the total current-year cost of the dollar-value pool, or the taxpayer determines that a single BLS category is not appropriate for the aggregate of the unassigned items. Third, if items in a dollar-value pool have not been assigned to a 10 percent BLS category because the current-year cost of those items, in the aggregate, is less than 10 percent of the total current-year cost of the dollar-value pool, the taxpayer must assign those items to the most-detailed BLS category that includes all those items (also, a 10 percent category). On the other hand, if items in a dollar-value pool have not been assigned to a 10 percent BLS category because the taxpayer determines that a single BLS category is not appropriate for the aggregate of those items, the taxpayer must assign each of those items to a single miscellaneous BLS category created by the taxpayer (also, a 10 percent category). In no event may a taxpayer assign items in a dollar-value pool to a BLS category that is less detailed than either the major groups of consumer goods described in Table 3 of the monthly “CPI Detailed Report” or the major commodity groups of producer goods described in Table 6 of the monthly “PPI Detailed Report.” Principles similar to those described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) apply for purposes of assigning raw material, work-in-process,
and finished good items to the most-detailed BLS category under the 10 percent method.
(
3
)
Change in method of accounting.
The 10 percent method of assigning items in a dollar-value pool to BLS categories is a method of accounting. In addition, a taxpayer's selection of a BLS category for a specific item is a method of accounting. However, the assignment of items to different BLS categories solely as a result of the application of the 10 percent method is a change in underlying facts and not a change in method of accounting. Likewise, the selection of a new BLS category for a specific item as a result of a revision to a BLS table is a change in underlying facts and not a change in method of accounting. A taxpayer that wants to change its method of selecting BLS categories (i.e., to or from the 10-percent method) or of selecting a BLS category for a specific item must secure the Commissioner's consent in accordance with § 1.446-1(e). A taxpayer that voluntarily changes its method of selecting BLS categories or of selecting a BLS category for a specific item must establish a new base year in the year of change as described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section.
(D)
Computation of a category inflation index
—(
1
)
In general.
As described in more detail in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D), a category inflation index reflects the inflation that occurs in the BLS price indexes for a selected BLS category (or, if applicable, 10 percent BLS category) during the relevant measurement period.
(
2
)
BLS price indexes.
The BLS price indexes are the cumulative indexes published in the selected BLS table for the appropriate month. A taxpayer may elect to use either preliminary or final BLS price indexes for the appropriate month, provided that the selected BLS price indexes are used consistently. However, a taxpayer that elects to use final BLS price indexes for the appropriate month must use preliminary BLS price indexes for any taxable year for which the taxpayer files its original federal income tax return before the BLS publishes final BLS price indexes for the appropriate month. If a BLS price index for a most-detailed or 10 percent BLS category is not otherwise available for the appropriate or representative month (but not because the BLS categories in the BLS table have been revised), the taxpayer must use the BLS price index for the next most-detailed BLS category that includes the specific item(s) in the most-detailed or 10 percent BLS category. If a BLS price index is not otherwise available for the appropriate or representative month because the BLS categories in the BLS table have been revised, the rules of paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
4
) of this section apply.
(

)
Category inflation index
—(
i
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
4
) of this section (concerning compound category inflation indexes) or (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
5
) of this section (concerning category inflation indexes for certain 10 percent BLS categories), a category inflation index for a selected BLS category (or, if applicable, 10 percent BLS category) is computed under the rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
3
).
(
ii
)
Double-extension IPIC method.
In the case of a taxpayer using the double-extension IPIC method, the category inflation index for a BLS category is the quotient of the BLS price index for the appropriate or representative month of the current year divided by the BLS price index for the appropriate month of the taxable year preceding the base year (base month). However, if the taxpayer did not have an opening inventory in the year that its election to use the dollar-value LIFO method and double-extension IPIC method became effective, the category inflation index for a BLS category is the quotient of the BLS price index for the appropriate or representative month of the current year divided by the BLS price index for the month immediately preceding the month of the taxpayer's first inventory production or purchase.
(
iii
)
Link-chain IPIC method.
In the case of a taxpayer using the link-chain IPIC method, the category inflation index for a BLS category is the quotient of the BLS price index for the appropriate or representative month of the current year divided by the BLS price index for the appropriate month used for the immediately preceding taxable year. However, if the taxpayer
did not have an opening inventory in the year that its election to use the dollar-value LIFO method and link-chain IPIC method became effective, the category inflation index for a BLS category for the year of election is the quotient of the BLS price index for the appropriate or representative month of the current year divided by the BLS price index for the month immediately preceding the month of the taxpayer's first inventory production or purchase.
(
iv
)
Special rules concerning representative months.
A taxpayer electing to use a representative month under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section must use an appropriate month, rather than the representative month, to determine category inflation indexes in the circumstances described in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
3
)(
iv
) and in other similar circumstances. For example, in the case of a short taxable year, the category inflation index should reflect the inflation that occurs from the base month (in the case of the double-extension IPIC method), or the appropriate or representative month used for the preceding taxable year (in the case of the link-chain IPIC method), and the appropriate month for the short taxable year. Similarly, if a taxpayer using the link-chain IPIC method is granted consent to change both its method of determining the current-year cost of a dollar-value pool and its representative month, the category inflation index for the year of change should reflect the inflation that occurs between the old representative month used for the preceding taxable year and the new representative month used for the year of change.
(
4
)
Compound category inflation index for revised BLS categories or price indexes
—(
i
)
In general.
Periodically, the BLS revises a BLS table to add one or more new BLS categories, eliminate one or more previously reported BLS categories, or reset the base-year BLS price index of one or more BLS categories. If the BLS has revised the applicable BLS table for a taxable year, a taxpayer must compute the category inflation index for each BLS category for which the taxpayer cannot compute a category inflation index in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
3
) of this section (affected BLS category) using a reasonable method, provided the method is used consistently for all affected BLS categories within a particular taxable year. For example, if the BLS revised the CPI by adding new BLS categories as of January 2001 and eliminating some previously reported BLS categories as of December 2000, January 2002 would be the first month for which it would be possible to compute a category inflation index for a 12-month period using the BLS price indexes for any affected category. The compound category inflation index described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
4
)(
ii
) of this section is a reasonable method of computing the category inflation index for an affected BLS category.
(
ii
)
Computation of compound category inflation index.
When the applicable BLS table is revised as described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
4
)(
i
) of this section, a taxpayer may use the procedure described in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
4
)(
ii
) to compute a compound category inflation index for each affected BLS category represented in the taxpayer's ending inventory. For this purpose, a compound category inflation index is the product of the category inflation index for the “first portion” multiplied by the corresponding category inflation index for the “second portion.” The category inflation index for the first portion must reflect the inflation that occurs between the end of the base month (in the case of the double-extension IPIC method), or the preceding year's appropriate or representative month (in the case of the link-chain IPIC method), and the end of the last month covered by the unrevised BLS table based on the old BLS category. The corresponding category inflation index for the second portion must reflect the inflation that occurs between the beginning of the first month covered by the revised BLS table based on the new BLS category and the end of the current year's appropriate or representative month. First, using the revised BLS table for the current-year's appropriate or representative month, the taxpayer assigns items in the dollar-value pool using its method of assigning items to BLS categories as described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C) of this section. Second, for each affected BLS category
represented in the ending inventory, the taxpayer computes the category inflation index for the second portion using this formula: [A/B], where A equals the BLS price index for the current year's appropriate or representative month and B equals the BLS price index for the last month covered by the unrevised BLS table (as published for the first month of the revised BLS table). Third, using the unrevised BLS table for the base month (in the case of the double extension IPIC method) or the preceding year's appropriate or representative month (in the case of the link-chain IPIC method), the taxpayer assigns each of the items in the dollar-value pool using its method of assigning items to BLS categories. Fourth, for each affected BLS category represented in the ending inventory, the taxpayer computes the category inflation index for the first portion using this formula: [C/D], where C equals the BLS price index for the last month covered by the unrevised BLS table (as published for the last month of the unrevised BLS table) and D equals the BLS price index for the base month (in the case of the double-extension IPIC method) or the preceding year's appropriate or representative month (in the case of the link-chain IPIC method). Fifth, for each affected BLS category represented in the ending inventory, the taxpayer computes the compound category inflation index using this formula: [X*Y], where X equals the category inflation index for the second portion, and Y equals the corresponding category inflation index for the first portion. For the purpose of computing the compound category inflation index for each affected BLS category, the corresponding category inflation index for the first portion is the category inflation index for the unrevised BLS category that includes the specific inventory item(s) included in the revised BLS category. If items included in a single revised BLS category had been included in separate BLS categories before the revision of the BLS table, the corresponding category inflation index for the first portion is the weighted harmonic mean of the category inflation indexes for these unrevised BLS categories. See paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(E)(
1
) of this section for a formula of the weighted harmonic mean. When computing this weighted-average category inflation index, a taxpayer must use the current-year costs (or in the case of a retailer using the retail method, the retail selling prices) in ending inventory as the weights.
(
iii) New base year.
A taxpayer may establish a new base year in the year following the taxable year for which the taxpayer computed a compound category inflation index under this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
4
) for one or more affected BLS categories in a dollar-value pool. See paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section for the procedures and computations incident to establishing a new base year.
(
iv) Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
4
):

# Example 1. BLS categories eliminated.
(i) A retailer, whose taxable year ends January 31, elected to account for its inventories using the dollar-value LIFO method and double-extension IPIC method (based on the CPI), beginning with the taxable year ending January 31, 1997. The taxpayer does not use the retail method, but elected to use January as its representative month. On January 31, 1999, the taxpayer's only dollar-value pool contains only two items—lemons and peaches. The total current-year cost of these items is as follows: lemons, $40, and peaches, $30.
(ii) The CPI was revised in October of 1998 to eliminate the “Citrus fruits” subcategory of “Other fresh fruits.” In addition, the base-year BLS price index for “Other fresh fruits” was reset to 100.00 as of October 1, 1998. In relevant part, the January 1999 CPI permits the assignment of both lemons and peaches to “Other fresh fruits.” The January 1999 BLS price indexes for “Citrus fruits” and “Other fresh fruits” are 96.6 and 105.6, respectively. In relevant part, the September 1998 CPI permits the assignment of lemons to “Citrus fruits” and peaches to “Other fresh fruits.” The September 1998 BLS price indexes for “Citrus fruits” and “Other fresh fruits” are 194.9 and 294.9, respectively, and the January 1997 BLS price indexes for “Citrus fruits” and “Other fresh fruits” are 190.2 and 290.2, respectively.
(iii) Because the BLS eliminated the category, “Citrus fruits,” as of October 1998, it did not publish a BLS price index for that category in the January 1999 CPI. Thus, the
taxpayer cannot compute a category inflation index for “Citrus fruits” under the normal procedures, but may compute a compound category inflation index for that affected BLS category using the procedures described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
4
)(
ii
) of this section.
(iv) The taxpayer computes a compound category inflation index for the two BLS categories that formerly included lemons and peaches. The taxpayer first assigns lemons and peaches to “Other fresh fruits,” the most-detailed index in the January 1999 CPI, and then computes the category inflation index for the second portion as follows:
Item
1999 category
Jan. 1999 index/Sept. 1998 index (as published in Oct. 1998)
Category inflation index
Lemons and Peaches
Other fresh fruits
105.6/100.0
1.0560
(v) The taxpayer assigns the lemons and peaches to the most-detailed BLS categories in the January 1998 CPI as follows: lemons to “Citrus fruits” and peaches to “Other fresh fruits.” Then, the taxpayer computes the category inflation index for the first portion as follows:
Item
1998 category
Sept. 1998 index (as published in Sept. 1998)/Jan. 1997
Category inflation index
Lemons
Citrus fruits
194.9/190.2
1.0247
Peaches
Other fresh Fruits
294.9/290.2
1.0162
(vi) Because lemons and peaches, which are included together in the revised “Other fresh fruits” category, had been included in separate BLS categories before the BLS table was revised, the taxpayer must compute a single corresponding category inflation index for the affected BLS categories for the first portion. This corresponding category inflation index is the weighted harmonic mean of the separate corresponding category inflation indexes for the first portion using the cost of the items in ending inventory as the weights. The taxpayer computes the corresponding category inflation index for “Other fresh fruits” for the first portion as follows:

(viii) The taxpayer may establish a new base year for the taxable year ending January 31, 2000.

# Example 2. BLS categories separated.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except prior to October 1998, both lemons and peaches were assigned to “Other fresh fruits” and in the October 1998 CPI, the BLS created a new category, “Citrus fruits,” for citrus fruits, such as lemons. Moreover, the BLS reset the base-year BLS price index for “Other fresh fruits” to 100.0 as of October 1, 1998. As a result of these changes, the taxpayer may no longer assign lemons to “Other fresh fruits.”
(ii) Because “Citrus fruits” is new as of October 1998, the BLS did not publish a BLS price index for this BLS category in the January 1999 CPI. Thus, because the taxpayer cannot compute a category inflation index for “Citrus fruits” under the normal procedures, the taxpayer may compute a compound category inflation index for the affected BLS category using the procedures described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
4
)(
ii
) of this section.
(iii) Based on the January 1999 CPI, the taxpayer assigns lemons to “Citrus fruits” and peaches to “Other fresh fruits.” Then, the taxpayer computes a compound category inflation index for each of the two BLS categories. The computation of the category inflation index for the second portion is as follows:
Item
1999 category
Jan. 1999 index/Sept. 1998 index (as published in Oct. 1998)
Category inflation index
Lemons
Citrus fruits
96.6/100
0.9660
Peaches
Other fresh fruits
105.6/100
1.0560
(iv) Then, the taxpayer computes the category inflation index for the first portion as follows:
Item
1998 category
Sept. 1998 index (as published in Sept. 1998)/Jan. 1997
Category inflation index
Lemons
Peaches
Other fresh fruits
294.9/290.2
1.0162
(v) Finally, the taxpayer computes the compound category inflation index for “Citrus fruits” and “Other fresh fruits”:
Item
(I)
Category inflation index (second portion)
(II)
Category inflation index (first portion)
(III)
Compound category inflation index: (I)*(II)
Citrus fruits
0.9660
1.0162
0.9816
Other fresh fruits
1.0560
1.0162
1.0731
(vi) The taxpayer may establish a new base year for the taxable year ending January 31, 2000.
(5)
10 percent method. (i) Applicability.
A taxpayer that elects to use the 10 percent method described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section must compute a category inflation index for a less-detailed 10 percent BLS category as provided in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
5
). A less-detailed 10 percent category is a BLS category that—
(
A
) subsumes two or more BLS categories;
(
B
) Does not have a single assigned item whose current-year cost is 10 percent or more of the current-year cost of all the items in the dollar-value pool;
(
C
) Has at least one item in at least one of the subsumed BLS categories; and
(
D
) Has at least one subsumed BLS category that either does not have any assigned items or is a separate 10 percent BLS category.
(
ii) Determination of category inflation index.
If the rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D)(
5
) apply, the category inflation index for the less-detailed 10 percent BLS category is equal to the
weighted arithmetic mean of the category inflation index (or, compound category inflation index, if applicable) for each of the subsumed BLS categories that have been assigned at least one item from the taxpayer's dollar-value pool (excluding any item that is properly assigned to a separate 10 percent BLS category). [Weighted Arithmetic Mean = Sum of (Weight × Category Inflation Index)]/Sum of Weights]. The appropriate weight for each of the most-detailed BLS categories referenced in the preceding sentence is the corresponding BLS weight. Currently, in January of each year, the BLS publishes the BLS weights determined for December of the preceding year. In the case of a taxpayer using the double-extension IPIC method, the BLS weights for December of the taxable year preceding the base year are to be used for all taxable years. In the case of a taxpayer using the link-chain IPIC method, the BLS weights for December of a given calendar year are to be used for taxable years that end during the 12-month period that begins on July 1 of the following calendar year. However, if the BLS weights are not published for all of the most-detailed BLS categories referenced above, the taxpayer may use the current-year cost (or in the case of a retailer using the retail method, the retail selling prices) of all items assigned to a specific most-detailed BLS category as the appropriate weight for that category, but must compute a weighted harmonic mean. See paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(E)(
1
) of this section for a formula of the weighted harmonic mean.
(E)
Computation of Inventory Price Index (IPI)—(1) Double-extension IPIC method.
Under the double-extension IPIC method, the IPI for a dollar-value pool is the weighted harmonic mean of the category inflation indexes (or, if applicable, compound category inflation indexes) determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D) of this section for each selected BLS category (or, if applicable 10 percent BLS category) represented in the taxpayer's dollar-value pool at the end of the taxable year. The formula for computing the weighted harmonic mean of the category inflation indexes is: [Sum of Weights/Sum of (Weight/Category Inflation Index)]. The weights to be used when computing this weighted harmonic mean are the current-year costs (or, in the case of a retailer using the retail method, the retail selling prices) in each selected BLS category represented in the dollar-value pool at the end of the taxable year.
(
2) Link-chain IPIC method.
Under the link-chain IPIC method, the IPI for a dollar-value pool is the product of the weighted harmonic mean of the category inflation indexes (or, if applicable, the compound category inflation indexes) determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(D) of this section for each selected BLS category (or, if applicable, 10 percent BLS category) represented in the taxpayer's dollar-value pool at the end of the taxable year multiplied by the IPI for the immediately preceding taxable year. The formula for computing the weighted harmonic mean of the category inflation indexes is: [Sum of Weights/Sum of (Weight/Category Inflation Index)]. The weights to be used when computing this weighted harmonic mean are the current-year costs (or, in the case of a retailer using the retail method, the retail selling prices) in each selected BLS category represented in the dollar-value pool at the end of the taxable year.
(
3) Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(E):

# Example 1. Double-extension method.
(i)
Introduction.
R is a retail furniture merchant that does not use the retail method. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, R used the first-in, first-out method of identifying inventory and valued its inventory at cost. The total cost of R's inventory on December 31, 2000, was $850,000. R elected to use the dollar-value LIFO and double-extension IPIC methods for its taxable year ending December 31, 2001. R does not elect to use the 10 percent method described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section. R determines the current-year cost of the items using the actual cost of the most recently purchased goods. R elected to pool its inventory based on the major groups in Table 6 of the monthly “PPI Detailed Report” in accordance with the special IPIC pooling rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. All items in R's inventory fall within the 2-digit commodity code
in Table 6 of the monthly “PPI Detailed Report” for “furniture and household durables.” Therefore, R will maintain a single dollar-value pool.
(ii)
Select a BLS table and appropriate month for 2001.
R determines that the appropriate month for 2001 is October. R also determines that the appropriate month for 2000 would have been December if R had used the IPIC method for that year.
(iii)
Assign inventory items to BLS categories for 2001.
For 2001, R assigns all items in the dollar-value pool to the most-detailed BLS categories listed in Table 6 of the October 2001 “PPI Detailed Report” that contain those items. The BLS categories and the current-year cost of the items assigned to them are summarized as follows:

ii
) of this section (BLS price indexes for October 2001 divided by BLS price indexes for December 2000). R computes the category inflation indexes for 2001 as follows:

(vi)
Determine the LIFO value of the dollar-value pool for 2001.
For 2001, R determines the total base-year cost of its ending inventory by dividing the total current-year cost of the items in the dollar-value pool by the IPI for 2001. The total base-year cost of R's ending inventory is $908,355.80 ($921,380/1.01433821). Comparing the base-year cost of the ending inventory to the base-year cost of the beginning inventory, R determines that the base-
year cost of the 2001 increment is $58,355.80 ($908,355.80 - $850,000.00). R multiplies the base-year cost of the 2001 increment by the IPI for 2001 and determines that the LIFO value of the 2001 layer is $59,192.52 ($58,355.80 * 1.01433821). Thus, the LIFO value of R's total inventory at the end of 2001 is $909,192.52 ($850,000.00 (opening inventory) + $59,192.52 (2001 layer)).
(vii)
Select a BLS table and appropriate month for 2002.
For 2002, R must compute a new IPI under the double-extension IPIC method to determine the LIFO value of its dollar-value pool. R determines that the appropriate month for 2002 is November.
(viii)
Assign inventory items to BLS categories for 2002.
For 2002, R assigns all items in the dollar-value pool to the most-detailed BLS categories listed in Table 6 of the November 2002 “PPI Detailed Report” that contain those items. The BLS categories and the current-year cost of the items assigned to them are summarized as follows:

Determine the LIFO value of the pool for 2002.
For 2002, R determines the total base-year cost of its ending inventory by dividing the total current-year cost of the items in the dollar-value pool by the IPI for 2002. The total base-year cost of the ending inventory is $916,441.28 ($951,743.00/1.03852044). Comparing the base-year cost of the ending inventory to the base-year cost of the beginning inventory, R determines that the base-
year cost of the 2002 increment is $8,085.48 ($916,441.28−$908,355.80). R multiplies the base-year cost of the 2002 increment by the IPI for 2002 and determines that the LIFO value of the 2002 layer is $8,396.94 ($8,085.48 * 1.03852044). Thus, the LIFO value of R's total inventory at the end of 2002 is $917,589.46 ($850,000.00 (opening inventory) + $59,192.52 (2001 layer) + $8,396.94 (2002 layer)).

# Example 2. Link-chain method.
(i)
Introduction.
The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that R uses the link-chain IPIC method. The double-extension IPIC method and the link-chain IPIC method yield the same results for the first taxable year in which the dollar-value LIFO and IPIC methods are used. Therefore, this example illustrates only how R will compute the IPI for, and determine the LIFO value of, its dollar-value pool for 2002.
(ii)
Select a BLS table and appropriate month for 2002.
R determines that the appropriate month for 2002 is November.
(iii)
Assign inventory items to BLS categories for 2002.
For 2002, R assigns all items in the dollar-value pool to the most-detailed BLS categories listed in Table 6 of the November 2002 “PPI Detailed Report” that contain those items. The BLS categories and the current-year cost of the items assigned to them are summarized as follows:

Determine the LIFO value of the pool for 2002.
R determines the total base-year cost of its ending inventory by dividing the total current-year cost of the items in the dollar-value pool by the IPI for 2002. The total base-year cost of the ending inventory is $915,313.91 ($951,743.00 / 1.03979956). Comparing the base-year cost of the ending inventory to the base-year cost of the beginning inventory, R determines that the base-year cost of the 2002 layer is $6,958.11 ($915,313.91-$908,355.80). R multiplies the base-year cost of the 2002 layer by the IPI for 2002 and determines that the LIFO value of the 2002 layer is $7,235.04 ($6,958.11 * 1.03979956). Thus, the LIFO value of R's total inventory at the end of 2002 is $916,427.56 ($850,000.00 (opening inventory) + $59,192.52 (2001 layer) + $7,235.04 (2002 layer)).
(iv)
Adoption or change of method
—(A)
Adoption or change to IPIC method.
The use of an inventory price index computed under the IPIC method is a method of accounting. A taxpayer permitted to adopt the dollar-value LIFO method without first securing the Commissioner's consent also may adopt the IPIC method without first securing the Commissioner's consent. The IPIC method may be adopted and used, however, only if the taxpayer provides the following information on a Form 970, “Application to Use LIFO Inventory Method,” or in another manner as may be acceptable to the Commissioner: A complete list of dollar-value pools (including a description of the items in each dollar-value pool); the BLS table (i.e., CPI or PPI) selected for each dollar-value pool; the representative month, if applicable, elected for each dollar-value pool; the BLS categories to which the items in each dollar-value pool will be assigned; the method of assigning items to BLS categories (e.g., the 10 percent method) for each dollar-value pool; and the method of computing the IPI (i.e., double-extension IPIC method or link-chain IPIC method) for each dollar-value pool. In the case of a taxpayer permitted to adopt the IPIC method without requesting the Commissioner's consent, the Form 970 must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year of adoption. In all other cases, a taxpayer may change to the IPIC method only after securing the Commissioner's consent as provided in § 1.446-1(e). In these latter cases, the Form 970 containing the information described in this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) must be attached to a Form 3115, “Application for Change in Accounting Method,” filed as required by § 1.446-1(e). A taxpayer that simultaneously changes to the dollar-value LIFO and IPIC methods from another LIFO method must apply the rules of paragraph (f)(2) of this section before applying the rules of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section. To satisfy the requirements of § 1.472-2(h), taxpayers must maintain adequate books and records, including those concerning the use of the IPIC method and necessary computations. Notwithstanding the rules in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a taxpayer that adopts, or changes to, the link-chain IPIC method is not required to demonstrate that the use of any other method of determining the LIFO value of a dollar-value pool is impractical.
(B)
New base year
—(
1
)
Voluntary change
—(
i
)
In general.
In the case of a taxpayer using a non-IPIC method to determine the LIFO value of inventory, the layers previously determined under that method, if any, and the LIFO values of those layers are retained if the taxpayer voluntarily changes to the IPIC method. Instead of using the earliest taxable year for which the taxpayer adopted the LIFO method for any items in the dollar-value pool, the year of change is used as the new base year for the purpose of determining the amount of increments and liquidations, if any, for the year of change and subsequent taxable years. The base-year cost of the layers in a dollar-value pool at the beginning of the year of change must be restated in terms of new base-year cost using the year of change as the new base year and, if applicable, the indexes for the previously determined layers must be recomputed accordingly. The recomputed indexes will be used to determine the LIFO value of subsequent liquidations. For purposes of computing an IPI under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(E) of this section, the IPI for the immediately preceding year is 1.00. The new total base-year cost of the items in a dollar-value pool for the purpose of determining future increments and liquidations is equal to the total current-year cost of the items in the dollar-value pool (determined using the
taxpayer's method of determining the total current-year cost of the items in the dollar-value pool under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section). A taxpayer must allocate this new total base-year cost to each layer based on the ratio of the old base-year cost of the layer to the old total base-year cost of the dollar-value pool.

# Example.
(i) In 1990, X elected to use a dollar-value LIFO method (other than the IPIC method) for its single dollar-value pool. X is granted permission to change to the link-chain IPIC method, beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2001. X will continue using a single dollar-value pool.

(ii) Under X's method of determining the current-year cost of items in a dollar-value pool, the current-year cost of the beginning inventory is $391,000. Thus, X's new base-year cost as of January 1, 2001, is $391,000. X allocates this new base-year cost to each layer based on the ratio of old base-year cost of the layer to the total old base-year cost of the dollar-value pool. To recompute the inflation indexes for each of its layers, X divides the LIFO value of each layer by the new base-year cost attributable to the layer. The new base-year cost, recomputed inflation indexes, and LIFO value of X's layers as of January 1, 2001, are as follows:

(iii) In 2001, the current-year cost of X's ending inventory is $430,139. The weighted harmonic mean of the category inflation indexes applicable to X's ending inventory is 1.075347, and in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section, the inflation index for the immediately preceding taxable year is 1.00. Thus, X's IPI for 2001 is 1.075347 (1.00 * 1.075347). The total base-year cost of X's ending inventory is $400,000 ($430,139/1.075347). The base-year cost, IPI, and LIFO value of X's layers as of December 31, 2001, are as follows:

(iv) In 2002, the current-year cost of X's ending inventory is $418,000. The weighted harmonic mean of the category inflation indexes applicable to X's ending inventory is 1.02292562, and the IPI for the immediately preceding year is 1.075347. Thus, X's IPI for 2001 is 1.10 (1.075347 * 1.02292562). The total base-year cost of X's ending inventory is $380,000 ($418,000/1.10), which results in a liquidation of $20,000 ($400,000−$380,000) in terms of base-year cost. This liquidation eliminates the 2001 layer ($9,000 base-year cost), the 1997 layer ($3,400 base-year cost), and part of the 1995 layer ($7,600 base-year cost). The base-year cost, indexes, and LIFO value of X's layers as of December 31, 2002, are as follows:

Involuntary change—(i) In general.
If a taxpayer uses a non-IPIC method to compute the LIFO value of a dollar-value pool, and if the Commissioner determines that the taxpayer's method does not clearly reflect income, the Commissioner may require the taxpayer to change to the IPIC method. If the Commissioner requires a taxpayer to change to the IPIC method, and the taxpayer does not provide sufficient information from its books and records to compute an adjustment under section 481, the Commissioner may implement the change using the simplified transition method described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section.
(
ii
)
Simplified Transition Method.
Under the simplified transition method, the Commissioner will recompute the LIFO value of each dollar-value pool as of the beginning of the year of change using the double-extension IPIC method or the link-chain IPIC method. The adjustment under section 481 is equal to the difference between the recomputed LIFO value and the LIFO value of the pool determined under the taxpayer's former method. The Commissioner will compute an IPI using the double-extension IPIC method or link-chain IPIC method for each taxable year in which the LIFO method was used by the taxpayer based on the assumptions that the ending inventory of the pool in each taxable year was comprised of items that fall into the same BLS categories as the items in the ending inventory of the year of change and that the relative weights of those BLS categories in all prior years were the same as the relative weights of those BLS categories in the ending inventory of the year of change. The base-year cost of the items in a dollar-value pool at the end of a taxable year will be determined by dividing the IPI computed for the taxable year into the current-year cost of the items in that pool determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. If the comparison of the base-year cost of the beginning and ending inventory produces a current-year increment, the base-year cost of that increment will be multiplied by the IPI computed for that taxable year to determine the LIFO value of that layer.

# Example.
(i) Z began using a dollar-value LIFO method other than the IPIC method in the taxable year ending December 31, 1998, and maintains a single dollar-value pool. Z's beginning inventory as of January 1, 2000, computed using its method of accounting, was as follows:

(ii) Upon examining Z's federal income tax return for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, the examining agent determines that Z's dollar-value LIFO method does not clearly reflect income. The examining agent chooses to change Z to the double-extension IPIC method for 2000 and implements the change using the simplified transition method as follows. First, the inventory in Z's dollar-value pool at the end of 2000 is assigned to the most-detailed categories in the CPI or PPI, whichever is appropriate. Assume that 80 percent of the current-year cost of Z's inventory as of December 31, 2000, is assigned to Category 1, 10 percent is assigned to Category 2, and 10 percent is assigned to Category 3. Assume further that the current-year cost of the inventory in Z's dollar-value pool at the end of 1998 and 1999 was $133,000 and $145,000, respectively.
(iii) The category inflation indexes for 1998 computed under the double-extension IPIC method are 1.17 for Category 1, 1.26 for Category 2, and 1.19 for Category 3. The weights to be used in computing the IPI for 1998 are $106,400 ($133,000 * 80 percent) for Category 1, $13,300 ($133,000 * 10 percent) for Category 2, and $13,300 ($133,000 * 10 percent) for Category 3. The IPI for 1998 is computed as follows:

(iv) The base-year cost of the inventory in Z's pool at the end of 1998 is $112,672 ($133,000/1.180417), and the base-year cost of the 1998 increment is $7,672 ($112,672−$105,000). The LIFO value of the 1998 layer is $9,056 ($7,672 × 1.180417).
(v) The category inflation indexes for 1999 computed under the double-extension IPIC method were 1.21 for Category 1, 1.29 for Category 2 and 1.23 for Category 3. The weights to be used in computing the IPI for 1999 are $116,000 ($145,000 × 80 percent) for Category 1, $14,500 ($145,000 × 10 percent) for Category 2, and $14,500 ($145,000 × 10 percent) for Category 3.

(ix) Finally, the examining agent will recompute Z's taxable income for 2000 and succeeding taxable years using the double-extension IPIC method.

Effective date
—(A)
In general.
The rules of this paragraph (e)(3) and paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(2) of this section are applicable for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2001.
(B)
Change in method of accounting.
Any change in a taxpayer's method of accounting necessary to comply with this paragraph (e)(3) or with paragraphs (b)(4) or (c)(2) of this section is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of section 446 and the regulations thereunder apply. For the first or second taxable year ending on or after December 31, 2001, a taxpayer is granted the consent of the Commissioner to change its method of accounting to a method required or permitted by this paragraph (e)(3) and paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(2) of this section. A taxpayer that wants to change its method of accounting under this paragraph (e)(3)(v) must follow the automatic consent procedures in Rev. Proc. 2002-9 (2002-3 I.R.B. xxx) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). However, the scope limitations in section 4.02 of Rev. Proc. 2002-9 do not apply, and the five-year limitation on the readoption of the LIFO method under section 10.01(2) of the appendix is waived. In addition, if the taxpayer's method of accounting for its LIFO inventories is an issue under consideration at the time the application is filed with the national office, the audit protection of section 7 of Rev. Proc. 2002-9 does not apply. If a taxpayer changing its method of accounting under this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) is under examination, before an appeals office, or before a federal court with respect to any income tax issue, the taxpayer must provide a copy of the application to the examining agent(s), appeals officer or counsel for the government, as appropriate, at the same time it files the application with the national office. Any change under this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) must be made using a cut-off method and new base year. See paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section for an example of this computation. Because a change under this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) is made using a cut-off method, a section 481(a) adjustment is not permitted. However, a taxpayer changing its method of accounting under this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) must comply with the requirements of section 10.06(3) of the APPENDIX of Rev. Proc. 2002-9 (concerning bargain purchases).
(f)
Change to dollar-value method from another method of pricing LIFO inventories
—(1)
Consent required.
Except as provided in § 1.472-3 in the case of a taxpayer electing to use a LIFO inventory method for the first time, or in the case of a taxpayer changing to the dollar-value method and continuing to use the same pools as were used under another LIFO method, a taxpayer using another LIFO method of pricing inventories may not change to the dollar-value method of pricing such inventories unless he first secures the consent of the Commissioner in accordance with paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1.
(2)
Method of converting inventory.
Where the taxpayer changes from one method of pricing LIFO inventories to the dollar-value method, the ending
LIFO inventory for the taxable year immediately preceding the year of change shall be converted to the dollar-value LIFO method. This is done to establish the base-year cost for subsequent calculations. Thus, if the taxpayer was previously valuing LIFO inventories on the specific goods method, these separate values shall be combined into appropriate pools. For this purpose, the base year for the pool shall be the earliest taxable year for which the LIFO inventory method had been adopted for any item in that pool. No change will be made in the overall LIFO value of the opening inventory for the year of change as a result of the conversion, and that inventory will merely be restated in the manner used under the dollar-value method. All layers of increment for such inventory must be retained, except that all layers of increment which occurred in the same taxable year must be combined. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this subparagraph:

# Example 1.
(i) Assume that the taxpayer has used another LIFO method for finished goods since 1954 and has complied with all the requirements prerequisite for a change to the dollar-value method. Items A, B, and C, which have previously been inventoried under the specific goods LIFO method, may properly be included in a single dollar-value LIFO pool. The LIFO inventory value of items A, B, and C at December 31, 1960, is $12,200, computed as follows:

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 and assume further that the base-year cost of Pool No. 1 at December 31, 1961, is $8,350. Since the closing inventory for the taxable year 1961 at base-year cost is less than the opening inventory for that year at base-year cost, a liquidation has occurred during 1961. This liquidation absorbs all of the 1960 layer of increment and part of the 1956 layer of increment. The December 31, 1961, inventory is $10,131, computed as follows:
Dec. 31, 1961, inventory at base-year cost

Transitional rules
—(1)
Change in method of pooling.
Any method of pooling authorized by this section and used by the taxpayer in computing his LIFO inventories under the dollar-value method shall be treated as a method of accounting. Any method of pooling which is authorized by this section shall be used for the year of adoption and for all subsequent taxable years unless a change is required by the Commissioner in order to clearly reflect income, or unless permission to change is granted by the Commissioner as provided in paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1. Where the taxpayer changes from one method of pooling to another method of pooling permitted by this section, the ending LIFO inventory for the taxable year preceding the year of change shall be restated under the new method of pooling.
(2)
Manner of combining or separating dollar-value pools.
(i) A taxpayer who has been using the dollar-value LIFO method and who is permitted or required to change his method of pooling, shall combine or separate the LIFO value of his inventory for the base year and each yearly layer of increment in order to conform to the new pool or pools. Each yearly layer of increment in the new pool or pools must be separately accounted for and a record thereof maintained, and any liquidation occurring in the new pool or pools subsequent to the formation thereof shall be treated in the same manner as if the new pool or pools had existed from the date the taxpayer first adopted the LIFO inventory method. The combination or separation of the LIFO value of his inventory for the base year and each yearly layer of increment shall be made in accordance with the appropriate method set forth in this subparagraph, unless the use of a different method is approved by the Commissioner.
(ii) Where the taxpayer is permitted or required to separate a pool into more than one pool, the separation shall be made in the following manner: First, each item in the former pool shall be placed in an appropriate new pool. Every item in each new pool is then extended at its base-year unit cost and the extensions are totaled. Each total is the amount of inventory for each new pool expressed in terms of base-year cost. Then a ratio of the total base-year cost of each new pool to the base-year cost of the former pool is computed. The resulting ratio is applied to the amount of inventory for the base year and each yearly layer of increment of the former pool to obtain an allocation to each new pool of the base-year inventory of the former pool and subsequent layers of increment thereof. The foregoing may be illustrated by the following example of a change for the taxable year 1961:

# Example.
(a) Assume that items A, B, C, and D are all grouped together in one pool prior to December 31, 1960. The LIFO inventory value at December 31, 1960, is computed as follows:
Pool ABCD
Dec. 31, 1960, inventory at Jan. 1, 1956, base-year cost

(c) Under the provisions of this section the taxpayer separates former Pool ABCD into two pools, Pool AB and Pool CD. The computation of the ratio of total base-year cost for each of the new pools to the base-year cost of the former pool is as follows:
Item

(d) The ratio of the base-year cost of new Pools AB and CD to the base-year cost of former Pool ABCD is 7,000/20,000 and 13,000/20,000, respectively. The allocation of the January 1, 1956 base cost and subsequent yearly layers of increment of former Pool ABCD to new Pools AB and CD is as follows:

(iii) Where the taxpayer is permitted or required to combine two or more pools having the same base year, they shall be combined into one pool in the following manner: The LIFO value of the base-year inventory of each of the former pools is combined to obtain a LIFO value of the base-year inventory for the new pool. Then, any layers of increment in the various pools which occurred in the same taxable year are combined into one total layer of increment for that taxable year. However, layers of increment which occurred in different taxable years may not be combined. In combining the layers of increment a new ratio of current-year cost to base-year cost is computed for each of the combined layers of increment. The foregoing may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(a) Assume the taxpayer has two pools at December 31, 1960. Under the provisions of this section the taxpayer combines
these pools into a single pool as of January 1, 1961. The LIFO inventory value of each pool at December 31, 1960, is shown as follows:
Dec. 31, 1960, inventory at Jan. 1, 1957, base-year cost

(iv) In combining pools having different base years, the principles set forth in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph are to be applied, except that all base years subsequent to the earliest base year shall be treated as increments, and the base-year costs for all pools having a base year subsequent to the earliest base year of any pool shall be redetermined in terms of the base cost for the earliest base year. The foregoing may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(a) Assume that the taxpayer has two pools at December 31, 1960. Under the provisions of this section the taxpayer combines these pools into a single pool as of January 1, 1961. The LIFO inventory value of each pool at December 31, 1960, is shown as follows:

(b) The next step is to redetermine the 1958 base-year cost for Pool No. 2 in terms of 1956 base-year cost. January 1, 1956 base-year unit cost must be reconstructed or established in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section for each item in Pool No. 2. Such costs are assumed to be $9.00 for item A, $20.00 for item B, and $1.80 for item C. A ratio of the 1958 total base-year cost to the 1956 total base-year cost for Pool No. 2 is computed as follows:
Item

Change in methods of computation at the LIFO value of a dollar-value pool.
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1960, the taxpayer must use a method authorized by paragraph (e)(1) of this section in computing the base-year cost and current-year cost of a dollar-value inventory pool for the end of such year. If the taxpayer had previously used any methods other than one authorized by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, he shall not be required to recompute his LIFO inventories for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 1960, under a method authorized by such paragraph. The base cost and layers of increment previously computed by such other method shall be retained and treated as if such base cost and layers of increment had been computed under a method authorized by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The taxpayer shall use the year of change as the base year in applying the double-extension method or
other method approved by the Commissioner, instead of the earliest year for which he adopted the LIFO method for any items in the pool.
(h)
LIFO inventories received in certain nonrecognition transactions
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, if inventory items accounted for under the LIFO method are received in a transaction described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, then, for the purpose of determining future increments and liquidations, the transferee must use the year of transfer as the base year and must use its current-year cost (computed under the transferee's method of accounting) of those items as their new base-year cost. If the transferee had opening inventories in the year of transfer, then, for the purpose of determining future increments and liquidations, the transferee must use its current-year cost (computed under the transferee's method of accounting) of those inventories as their new base-year cost. For this purpose, “opening inventory” refers to all items owned by the transferee before the transfer for which the transferee uses, or elects to use, the LIFO method. The total new base-year cost of the transferee's inventory as of the beginning of the year of transfer is equal to the new base-year cost of the inventory received from the transferor and the new base-year cost of the transferee's opening inventory. The index (or, the cumulative index in the case of the link-chain method) for the year immediately preceding the year of transfer is 1.00. The base-year cost of any layers in the dollar-value pool, as determined after the transfer, must be recomputed accordingly. See paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section for an example of this computation.
(2)
Transactions to which this paragraph (h) applies.
The rules in this paragraph (h) apply to a transaction in which—
(i) The transferee determines its basis in the inventories, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the inventories in the hands of the transferor;
(ii) The transferor used the dollar-value LIFO method to account for the transferred inventories;
(iii) The transferee uses the dollar-value LIFO method to account for the inventories in the year of the transfer; and
(iv) The transaction is not described in section 381(a).
(3)
Anti-avoidance rule.
The rules in this paragraph (h) do not apply to a transaction entered into with the principal purpose to avail the transferee of a method of accounting that would be unavailable to the transferor (or would be unavailable to the transferor without securing consent from the Commissioner). In determining the principal purpose of a transfer, consideration will be given to all of the facts and circumstances. However, a transfer is deemed made with the principal purpose to avail the transferee of a method of accounting that would be unavailable to the transferor without securing consent from the Commissioner if the transferor acquired inventory in a bargain purchase within the five taxable years preceding the year of the transfer and used a dollar-value LIFO method to account for that inventory that did not treat the bargain purchase inventory and physically identical inventory acquired at market prices as separate items. Inventory is deemed acquired in a bargain purchase if the actual cost of the inventory (or, if appropriate, the allocated cost of the inventory) was less than or equal to 50 percent of the replacement cost of physically identical inventory. Inventory is not considered acquired in a bargain purchase if the actual cost of the inventory (or, if appropriate, the allocated cost of the inventory) was greater than or equal to 75 percent of the replacement cost of physically identical inventory.
(4)
Effective date.
The rules of this paragraph (h) are applicable for transfers that occur during a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 2001.

§ 1.475(a)-4
Valuation safe harbor.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
Purpose.
This section sets forth a safe harbor that, under certain circumstances, permits taxpayers to elect to use the values of positions reported on certain financial statements as the fair market values of those positions for purposes of section 475. This safe harbor is based on the principle that, if a mark-to-market method used for financial reporting is sufficiently consistent with the requirements of section 475 and if the financial statement employing that
method has certain indicia of reliability, then the values used on that financial statement may be used for purposes of section 475. If other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations require adjustments to fair market value, use of the safe harbor does not eliminate the need for those adjustments. See paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Dealer business model.
The safe harbor is based on the business model for a derivatives dealer. Under this model, the dealer seeks to capture and profit from bid-ask spreads in the marketplace by entering into substantially offsetting positions with customers that will remain on the derivatives dealer's books over their terms. Because the positions in the aggregate tend to offset each other, the dealer has achieved a predictable net cash flow (for example, a synthetic annuity) that reflects the captured bid-ask spread. This net cash flow is generally impervious to market fluctuations in the values on which the component derivatives are based. Section 475 requires current recognition of the present value of the net cash flow attributable to the capture of these spreads.
(3)
Summary of paragraphs.
Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth the safe harbor. To determine who may use the safe harbor, paragraph (c) of this section defines the term “eligible taxpayer.” Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the basic requirements for determining whether the method used for financial reporting is sufficiently consistent with the requirements of section 475. Paragraph (e) of this section describes adjustments to the financial statement values that may be required for purposes of applying this safe harbor. Paragraph (f) of this section describes the procedure for making the safe harbor election and the conditions under which the election may be revoked. Paragraph (g) of this section provides that the Commissioner will issue a revenue procedure that lists the types of securities and commodities that are eligible positions for purposes of the safe harbor. Using rules for determining priorities among financial statements, paragraph (h) of this section defines the term “applicable financial statement” and so describes the financial statement, if any, whose values may be used in the safe harbor. In some cases, as required by paragraph (j) of this section, the safe harbor is available only if the taxpayer's operations make significant business use of financial statement values. Paragraph (k) of this section sets forth requirements for record retention and record production. Paragraph (m) of this section provides that the Commissioner may use fair market values that clearly reflect income, but which differ from values used on the applicable financial statement, if an electing taxpayer fails to comply with the recordkeeping and record production requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.
(b)
Safe harbor
—(1)
General rule.
Subject to any adjustment required by paragraph (e) of this section, if an eligible taxpayer uses an eligible method for the valuation of an eligible position on its applicable financial statement and the eligible taxpayer is subject to the election described in paragraph (f) of this section, the value that the eligible taxpayer assigns to that eligible position on its applicable financial statement is the fair market value of the eligible position for purposes of section 475 and must be used for purposes of section 475, even if that value is not the fair market value of the position for any other purpose of the internal revenue laws. Notwithstanding the rule set forth in this paragraph, the Commissioner may, in certain circumstances, use fair market values that clearly reflect income but differ from the values used on the applicable financial statement. See paragraph (m) of this section.
(2)
Example. Use of eligible and non-eligible methods.
X uses eligible methods on its applicable financial statement for some, but not all, securities and commodities that are eligible positions. When X elects into the safe harbor, the election applies to all eligible positions for which X has an eligible method. Therefore, once the election is in effect, the financial statement values for eligible positions for which X has an eligible method are the fair market values of those eligible positions for purposes of section 475. Since
X, however, does not have an eligible method for all eligible positions, those eligible positions for which X does not have an eligible method remain subject to the fair market value requirements of section 475 as set out in case law and otherwise.
(3)
Scope of the safe harbor.
The safe harbor may be used only to determine values for eligible positions that are properly marked to market under section 475. It does not determine whether any positions may or may not be subject to mark-to-market accounting under section 475.
(c)
Eligible taxpayer.
An eligible taxpayer is—
(1) A dealer in securities, as defined in section 475(c)(1); or
(2) A dealer in commodities, as defined in section 475(e), that is subject to an election under section 475(e).
(d)
Eligible method
—(1)
Sufficient consistency.
An eligible method is a mark-to-market method that is sufficiently consistent with the requirements of a mark-to-market method under section 475. To be sufficiently consistent with the requirements of a mark-to-market method under section 475, the eligible method must satisfy all of the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) and paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(2)
General requirements.
The method—
(i)
Frequency.
Must require a valuation of the eligible position no less frequently than annually, including a valuation as of the last business day of the taxable year;
(ii)
Recognition at the mark.
Must recognize into income on the income statement for each taxable year mark-to-market gain or loss based upon the valuation or valuations described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section;
(iii)
Recognition on disposition.
Must require, on disposition of the eligible position, recognition into income (on the income statement for the taxable year of disposition) as if a year-end mark occurred immediately before such disposition; and
(iv)
Fair value standard.
Must require use of a valuation standard that arrives at fair value in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP).
(3)
Limitations
—(i)
Bid-ask method
—(A)
General rule.
Except for eligible positions that are traded on a qualified board or exchange, as defined in section 1256(g)(7), or eligible positions that the Commissioner designates in a revenue procedure or other published guidance, the valuation standard used must not, other than on a
de minimis
portion of a taxpayer's positions, permit values at or near the bid or ask value. Consequently, the valuation method described in § 1.471-4(a)(1) fails to satisfy this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A).
(B)
Safe harbor.
The restriction in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section is satisfied if the method consistently produces values that are closer to the mid-market values than they are to the bid or ask values.
(ii)
Valuations based on present values of projected cash flows.
If the method of valuation consists of projecting cash flows from an eligible position or positions and determining the present value of those cash flows, the method must not take into account any cash flows attributable to a period or time on or before the valuation date. In addition, adjustment of the gain or loss recognized on the mark may be required with respect to payments that will be made after the valuation date to the extent that portions of the payments have been recognized for tax purposes before the valuation and appropriate adjustment has not been made for purposes of determining financial statement value.
(iii)
Accounting for costs and risks.
Valuations may account for appropriate costs and risks, but no cost or risk may be accounted for more than once, either directly or indirectly. Further, no valuation adjustment for any cost or risk may be made for purposes of this safe harbor if that valuation adjustment is not also permitted by, and taken for, U.S. GAAP purposes on the taxpayer's applicable financial statement. If appropriate, the costs and risks that may be accounted for include, but are not limited to, credit risk (appropriately adjusted for any credit enhancement), future administrative costs, and model risk. An adjustment for credit risk is implicit in computing the present value of cash flows using a discount rate greater
than a risk-free rate. Accordingly, a determination of whether any further downward adjustment to value for credit risk is warranted, or whether an upward adjustment is required, must take that implicit adjustment into consideration.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d):

# Example 1.
(i) X, a calendar year taxpayer, is a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1). X generally maintains a balanced portfolio of interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives, capturing bid-ask spreads and keeping its market exposure within desired limits (using, if necessary, additional derivatives for this purpose). X uses a mark-to-market method on a statement that it is required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and that satisfies paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to both the contracts with customers and the additional derivatives. When determining the amount of any gain or loss realized on a sale, exchange, or termination of a position, X makes a proper adjustment for amounts taken into account respecting payments or receipts. X and all of its counterparties on the derivatives have the same general credit quality as each other.
(ii) Under X's valuation method, as of each valuation date, X determines a mid-market probability distribution of future cash flows under the derivatives and computes the present values of these cash flows. In computing these present values, X uses an industry standard yield curve that is appropriate for obligations by persons with this same general credit quality. In addition, based on information that includes its own knowledge about the counterparties, X adjusts some of these present values either upward or downward to reflect X's reasonable judgment about the extent to which the true credit status of each counterparty's obligation, taking credit enhancements into account, differs from the general credit quality used in the yield curve to present value the derivatives.
(iii) X's methodology does not violate the requirement in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section that the same cost or risk not be taken into account, directly or indirectly, more than once.
(iv)
Applicability date.
This
Example 1
applies to valuations of securities on or after July 6, 2011.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that X uses a better credit quality in determining the yield curve to discount the payments to be received under the derivatives. Based on information that includes its own knowledge about the counterparties, X adjusts these present values to reflect X's reasonable judgment about the extent to which the true credit status of each counterparty's obligation, taking credit enhancements into account, differs from this better credit quality obligation.
(ii) X's methodology does not violate the requirement in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section that the same cost or risk not be taken into account, directly or indirectly, more than once.
(iii)
Applicability date.
This
Example 2
applies to valuations of securities on or after July 6, 2011.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that, after computing present values using the discount rates that are appropriate for obligors with the same general credit quality, and based on information that includes X's own knowledge about the counterparties, X adjusts some of these present values either upward or downward to reflect X's reasonable judgment about the extent to which the true credit status of each counterparty's obligation, taking credit enhancements into account, differs from a better credit quality.
(ii) X's methodology violates the requirement in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section that the same cost or risk not be taken into account, directly or indirectly, more than once. By using the same general credit quality discount rate, X's method takes into account the difference between risk-free obligations and obligations with that lower credit quality. By adjusting values for the difference between a higher credit quality and that lower credit quality, X takes into account risks that it had already accounted for through the discount rates that it used. The same result would occur if X judged some of its counterparties' obligations to be of a higher credit quality but X failed to adjust the values of those obligations to reflect the difference between a higher credit quality and the lower credit quality.
(iii)
Applicability date.
This
Example 3
applies to valuations of securities on or after July 6, 2011.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that X determines the mid-market value for each derivative and then subtracts the corresponding part of the bid-ask spread.
(ii) X's methodology violates the rule in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section that forbids valuing positions at or near the bid or ask value.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
and, in addition, X's adjustments for all risks and costs, including credit risk, future administrative costs and model risk, may occasionally cause the adjusted value of an eligible position to be at or near the bid value or ask value.
(ii) X's methodology does not violate the rule in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section
that forbids valuing eligible positions at or near the bid or ask value.
(e)
Compliance with other rules.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the fair market values for purposes of the safe harbor must be consistent with section 482, or rules that adopt section 482 principles, when applicable. For example, if a notional principal contract is subject to section 482 or section 482 principles, the values of future cash flows taken into account in determining the value of the contract for purposes of section 475 must be consistent with section 482.
(f)
Election
—(1)
Making the election.
Unless the Commissioner prescribes otherwise, an eligible taxpayer elects under this section by filing with the Commissioner a statement declaring that the taxpayer makes the safe harbor election in this section for all eligible positions for which it has an eligible method. In addition to any other information that the Commissioner may require, the statement must describe the taxpayer's applicable financial statement for the first taxable year for which the election is effective and must state that the taxpayer agrees to provide upon the request of the Commissioner all information, records, and schedules in the manner required by paragraph (k) of this section. The statement must be attached to a timely filed Federal income tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year for which the election is first effective.
(2)
Duration of the election.
Once made, the election continues in effect for all subsequent taxable years unless revoked.
(3)
Revocation
—(i)
By the taxpayer.
An eligible taxpayer that is subject to an election under this section may revoke the election only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(ii)
By the Commissioner.
The Commissioner, after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, may revoke an election under this section, effective beginning with the first open year for which the election is effective or with any subsequent year, if—
(A) The taxpayer fails to comply with paragraph (k) of this section (concerning record retention and production) and the taxpayer does not show reasonable cause for this failure;
(B) The taxpayer ceases to have an applicable financial statement or ceases to use an eligible method; or
(C) For any other reason, no more than a de minimis number of eligible positions, or no more than a de minimis fraction of the taxpayer's eligible positions, are covered by the safe harbor in paragraph (b) of this section.
(4)
Re-election.
If an election is revoked, either by the Commissioner or by the taxpayer, the taxpayer (or any successor in interest of the taxpayer) may not make the election without the consent of the Commissioner for any taxable year that begins before the date that is six years after the first day of the earliest taxable year affected by the revocation.
(g)
Eligible positions.
For any taxpayer, an eligible position is any security or commodity that the Commissioner in a revenue procedure or other published guidance designates as an eligible position with respect to that taxpayer for purposes of this safe harbor.
(h)
Applicable financial statement
—(1)
Definition.
An eligible taxpayer's applicable financial statement for a taxable year is the taxpayer's primary financial statement for that year if that primary financial statement is described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section (concerning statements required to be filed with the SEC) or if that primary financial statement both meets the requirements of paragraph (j) of this section (concerning significant business use) and is described in either paragraph (h)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section. Otherwise, or if the taxpayer does not have a primary financial statement for the taxable year, the taxpayer does not have an applicable financial statement for the taxable year.
(2)
Primary financial statement.
For any taxable year, an eligible taxpayer's primary financial statement is the financial statement, if any, described in one or more of paragraphs (h)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section. If more than one financial statement of the taxpayer for the year is so described, the primary financial statement is the one first described in paragraphs (h)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section. A taxpayer
has only one primary financial statement for any taxable year.
(i)
Statement required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
A financial statement that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that is required to be filed with the SEC, such as the 10--K or the Annual Statement to Shareholders.
(ii)
Statement filed with a Federal agency other than the Internal Revenue Service.
A financial statement that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that is required to be provided to the Federal government or any of its agencies other than the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
(iii) Certified audited financial statement. A certified audited financial statement that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP; that is given to creditors for purposes of making lending decisions, given to equity holders for purposes of evaluating their investment in the eligible taxpayer, or provided for other substantial non-tax purposes; and that the taxpayer reasonably anticipates will be directly relied on for the purposes for which it was given or provided.
(3)
Example. Primary financial statement.
X prepares financial statement FS1, which is required to be filed with a Federal government agency other than the SEC or the IRS. FS1 is thus described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section. X also prepares financial statement FS2, which is a certified audited financial statement that is given to creditors and that X reasonably anticipates will be relied on for purposes of making lending decisions. FS2 is thus described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section. Because FS1, which is described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, is described before FS2, which is described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, FS1 is X's primary financial statement.
(4)
Financial statements of equal priority.
If the rules of paragraph (h)(2) of this section cause two or more financial statements to be of equal priority, then the statement that results in the highest aggregate valuation of eligible positions being marked to market under section 475 is the primary financial statement.
(5)
Consolidated groups.
If the taxpayer is a member of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return, the primary financial statement of the taxpayer is the primary financial statement, if any, of the common parent (within the meaning of section 1504(a)(1)) of the consolidated group.
(6)
Supplement or amendment to a financial statement.
A financial statement includes any supplement or amendment to the financial statement.
(7)
Certified audited financial statement.
For purposes of this paragraph (h), a financial statement is a certified audited financial statement if it is certified by an independent certified public accountant from a Registered Public Accounting firm, as defined in section 2(a)(12) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Public Law 107-204, 116 Stat. 746 (July 30, 2002), 15 U.S.C. § 7201(a)(12), and rules promulgated under that Act, and is—
(i) Certified to be fairly presented (a “clean” opinion);
(ii) Certified to be fairly presented subject to a concern about a contingency, other than a contingency relating to the value of eligible positions (a qualified “subject to” opinion); or
(iii) Certified to be fairly presented except for a method of accounting with which the Certified Public Accountant disagrees and which is not a method used to determine the value of an eligible position held by the eligible taxpayer (a qualified “except for” opinion).
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Significant business use
—(1)
In general.
A financial statement is described in this paragraph (j) if—
(i) The financial statement contains values for eligible positions;
(ii) The eligible taxpayer makes significant use of financial statement values in most of the significant management functions of its business; and
(iii) That use is related to the management of all or substantially all of the eligible taxpayer's business.
(2)
Financial statement value.
For purposes of this paragraph (j), the term
financial statement value
means—
(i) A value that is taken from the financial statement; or
(ii) A value that is produced by a process that is in all respects identical
to the process that produces the values that appear on the financial statement but that is not taken from the statement because either—
(A) The value was determined as of a date for which the financial statement does not value eligible positions; or
(B) The value is used in the management of the business before the financial statement has been prepared.
(3)
Management functions of a business.
For purposes of this paragraph (j), the term
management functions of a business
refers to the financial and commercial oversight of the business. Oversight includes, but is not limited to, senior management review of business-unit profitability, market risk measurement or management, credit risk measurement or management, internal allocation of capital, and compensation of personnel. Management functions of a business do not include either tax accounting or reporting the results of operations to persons other than directors or employees.
(4)
Significant use.
If an eligible taxpayer uses financial statement values for some significant management functions and uses values that are not financial statement values for other significant management functions, then the determination of whether the taxpayer has made significant use of the financial statement values is made on the basis of all the facts and circumstances. This determination must particularly take into account whether the taxpayer's reliance on the financial statement values exposes the taxpayer to material adverse economic consequences if the values are incorrect.
(k)
Retention and production of records
—(1)
In general.
In addition to all records that section 6001 otherwise requires to be retained, an eligible taxpayer subject to the election provided by this section must keep, and timely provide to the Commissioner upon request, records and books of account that are sufficient to establish that the financial statement to which the income tax return conforms is the taxpayer's applicable financial statement, that the method used on that statement is an eligible method, and that the values used for eligible positions for purposes of section 475 are the values used in the applicable financial statement. This obligation extends to all records and books that are required to be maintained for any period for financial or regulatory reporting purposes, even if these records or books may not otherwise be specifically covered by section 6001. All records and books described in this paragraph (k) must be maintained for the period described in paragraph (k)(4) of this section, even if a lesser period of retention applies for financial statement or regulatory purposes.
(2)
Specific requirements
—(i)
Verification and reconciliation.
Unless the Commissioner otherwise provides—
(A)
In general.
An eligible taxpayer must provide books and records to verify the appropriate use of the safe harbor and reconciliation schedules between the applicable financial statement for the taxable year and the Federal income tax return for that year. The required verification materials and reconciliation schedules include all supporting schedules, exhibits, computer programs, and any other information used in producing the values and schedules, including the documentation of rules and procedures governing determination of the values. The required reconciliation schedules must also include a detailed explanation of any adjustments necessitated by the imperfect overlap between the eligible positions that the taxpayer marks to market under section 475 and the eligible positions for which the applicable financial statement uses an eligible method. In the time and manner provided by the Commissioner, a corporate taxpayer subject to this paragraph (k) must reconcile the net income amount reported on its applicable financial statement to the amount reported on the applicable forms and schedules on its Federal income tax return (such as the Schedule M-1, “Net Income(Loss) Reconciliation for Corporations With Total Assets of $10 Million or More”; Schedule M-3, “Net Income(Loss) Reconciliation for Corporations With Total Assets of $10 Million or More”; and Form 1120F, “U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation”). Eligible taxpayers that are not otherwise required to file a Schedule M-1 or Schedule M-3 must reconcile net income using substitute schedules
similar to Schedule M-1 and Schedule M-3, and these substitute schedules must be attached to the return.
(B)
Values on books and records with supporting schedules.
The books and records must state the value used for each eligible position separately from the value used for any other eligible position. However, an eligible taxpayer may make adjustments to values on a pooled basis, if the taxpayer demonstrates that it can compute gain or loss attributable to the sale or other disposition of an individual eligible position.
(C)
Consolidation schedules.
An eligible taxpayer must provide a schedule showing the consolidation and de-consolidation that is used in preparing the applicable financial statement, along with exhibits and subordinate schedules. This schedule must provide information that addresses the differences for consolidation and de-consolidation between the applicable financial statement and the Federal income tax return.
(ii)
Instructions provided by the Commissioner.
The Commissioner may provide an alternative time or manner in which an eligible taxpayer subject to this paragraph (k) must establish that the same values used for eligible positions on the applicable financial statement are also the values used for purposes of section 475 on the Federal income tax return.
(3)
Time for producing records.
All documents described in this paragraph (k) must be produced within 30 days of a request by the Commissioner, unless the Commissioner grants a written extension. Generally, the Commissioner will exercise his discretion to excuse a minor or inadvertent failure to provide requested documents if the taxpayer shows reasonable cause for the failure, has made a good faith effort to comply with the requirement to produce records, and promptly remedies the failure. For failures to maintain, or timely produce, records, see paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section (allowing the Commissioner to revoke the election), and see paragraph (m) of this section (allowing the Commissioner, but not the taxpayer, to use for eligible positions that otherwise might be subject to the safe harbor fair market values that clearly reflect income but that are different from the values used on the applicable financial statement).
(4)
Retention period for records.
All materials required by this paragraph (k) and section 6001 must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.
(5)
Agreements with the Commissioner.
The Commissioner and an eligible taxpayer may enter into a written agreement that establishes, for purposes of this paragraph (k), which records must be maintained, how they must be maintained, and for how long they must be maintained.
(l) [Reserved]
(m)
Use of different values.
If, with respect to the records that relate to certain eligible positions for a taxable year, the taxpayer fails to satisfy paragraph (k) of this section (concerning record retention and record production), then, for those eligible positions for that year, the Commissioner may use values that the Commissioner determines to be fair market values that are appropriate to clearly reflect income, even if the values so determined are different from the values reported for those positions on the applicable financial statement. See also paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section (concerning revocation of the election by the Commissioner when a taxpayer does not produce required records and fails to demonstrate reasonable cause for the failure).
[T.D. 9328, 72 FR 32177, June 12, 2007, as amended by T.D. 9533, 76 FR 39281, July 6, 2011; T.D. 9637, 78 FR 54760, Sept. 6, 2013]
§ 1.475(b)-1
Scope of exemptions from mark-to-market requirement.
(a)
Securities held for investment or not held for sale.
Except as otherwise provided by this section and subject to the identification requirements of section 475(b)(2), a security is held for investment (within the meaning of section 475(b)(1)(A)) or not held for sale (within the meaning of section 475(b)(1)(B)) if it is not held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
(b)
Securities deemed identified as held for investment
—(1)
In general.
The following items held by a dealer in securities are per se held for investment within the meaning of section 475(b)(1)(A) and are deemed to be properly identified as such for purposes of section 475(b)(2)—
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, stock in a corporation, or a partnership or beneficial ownership interest in a widely held or publicly traded partnership or trust, to which the taxpayer has a relationship specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or
(ii) A contract that is treated for federal income tax purposes as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract (see sections 72, 817, and 7702).
(2)
Relationships
—(i)
General rule.
The relationships specified in this paragraph (b)(2) are—
(A) Those described in section 267(b) (2), (3), (10), (11), or (12); or
(B) Those described in section 707(b)(1)(A) or (B).
(ii)
Attribution.
The relationships described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section are determined taking into account sections 267(c) and 707(b)(3), as appropriate.
(iii)
Trusts treated as partnerships.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the phrase partnership or trust is substituted for the word
partnership
in sections 707(b) (1) and (3), and a reference to beneficial ownership interest is added to each reference to capital interest or profits interest in those sections.
(3)
Securities traded on certain established financial markets.
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to a security if—
(i) The security is actively traded within the meaning of § 1.1092(d)-1(a) taking into account only established financial markets identified in § 1.1092(d)-1(b)(1) (i) or (ii) (describing national securities exchanges and interdealer quotation systems);
(ii) Less than 15 percent of all of the outstanding shares or interests in the same class are held by the taxpayer and all persons having a relationship to the taxpayer that is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and
(iii) If the security was acquired (e.g., on original issue) from a person having a relationship to the taxpayer that is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then, after the time the security was acquired—
(A) At least one full business day has passed; and
(B) There has been significant trading involving persons not having a relationship to the taxpayer that is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
Changes in status
—(i)
Onset of prohibition against marking.
(A) Once paragraph (b)(1) of this section begins to apply to the security and for so long as it continues to apply, section 475(a) does not apply to the security in the hands of the taxpayer.
(B) If a security has not been timely identified under section 475(b)(2) and, after the last day on which such an identification would have been timely, paragraph (b)(1) of this section begins to apply to the security, then the dealer must recognize gain or loss on the security as if it were sold for its fair market value as of the close of business of the last day before paragraph (b)(1) of this section begins to apply to the security, and gain or loss is taken into account at that time.
(ii)
Termination of prohibition against marking.
If a taxpayer did not timely identify a security under section 475(b)(2), and paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to the security on the last day on which such an identification would have been timely but thereafter ceases to apply—
(A) An identification of the security under section 475(b)(2) is timely if made on or before the close of the day paragraph (b)(1) of this section ceases to apply; and
(B) Unless the taxpayer timely identifies the security under section 475(b)(2) (taking into account the additional time for identification that is provided by paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section), section 475(a) applies to changes in value of the security after the cessation in the same manner as under section 475(b)(3).
(iii)
Examples.
These examples illustrate this paragraph (b)(4):

# Example 1. Onset of prohibition against marking.
(A)
Facts.
Corporation
H
owns 75 percent
of the stock of corporation
D,
a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1). On December 1, 1995,
D
acquired less than half of the stock in corporation
X. D
did not identify the stock for purposes of section 475(b)(2). On July 17, 1996,
H
acquired from other persons 70 percent of the stock of
X.
As a result,
D
and
X
became related within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. The stock of
X
is not described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section (concerning some securities traded on certain established financial markets).
(B)
Holding.
Under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section,
D
recognizes gain or loss on its
X
stock as if the stock were sold for its fair market value at the close of business on July 16, 1996, and the gain or loss is taken into account at that time. As with any application of section 475(a), proper adjustment is made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized. After July 16, 1996, section 475(a) does not apply to D's
X
stock while paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (concerning the relationship between
X
and
D
) continues to apply.

# Example 2. Termination of prohibition against marking; retained securities identified as held for investment.
(A)
Facts.
On July 1, 1996, corporation
H
owned 60 percent of the stock of corporation
Y
and all of the stock of corporation
D,
a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1). Thus,
D
and
Y
are related within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Also on July 1, 1996,
D
acquired, as an investment, 10 percent of the stock of
Y.
The stock of
Y
is not described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section (concerning some securities traded on certain established financial markets). When
D
acquired its shares of
Y
stock, it did not identify them for purposes of section 475(b)(2). On December 24, 1996,
D
identified its shares of
Y
stock as held for investment under section 475(b)(2). On December 30, 1996,
H
sold all of its shares of stock in
Y
to an unrelated party. As a result,
D
and
Y
ceased to be related within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(B)
Holding.
Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, identification of the
Y
shares is timely if done on or before the close of December 30, 1996. Because
D
timely identified its
Y
shares under section 475(b)(2), it continues after December 30, 1996, to refrain from marking to market its
Y
stock.

# Example 3. Termination of prohibition against marking; retained securities not identified as held for investment.
(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
above, except that
D
did not identify its stock in
Y
for purposes of section 475(b)(2) on or before December 30, 1996. Thus,
D
did not timely identify these securities under section 475(b)(2) (taking into account the additional time for identification provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section).
(B)
Holding.
Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, section 475(a) applies to changes in value of
D
's
Y
stock after December 30, 1996, in the same manner as under section 475(b)(3).
Thus, any appreciation or depreciation that occurred while the securities were prohibited from being marked to market is suspended. Further, section 475(a) applies only to those changes occurring after December 30, 1996.

# Example 4. Acquisition of actively traded stock from related party.
(A)
Facts.
Corporation
P
is the parent of a consolidated group whose taxable year is the calendar year, and corporation
M,
a member of that group, is a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1). Corporation
M
regularly acts as a market maker with respect to common and preferred stock of corporation
P.
Corporation
P
has outstanding 2,000,000 shares of series
X
preferred stock, which are traded on a national securities exchange. During the business day on December 29, 1997, corporation
P
sold 100,000 shares of series
X
preferred stock to corporation
M
for $100 per share. Subsequently, also on December 29, 1997, persons not related to corporation
M
engaged in significant trading of the series
X
preferred stock. At the close of business on December 30, 1997, the fair market value of series
X
stock was $99 per share. At the close of business on December 31, 1997, the fair market value of series
X
stock was $98.50 per share. Corporation
M
sold the series
X
stock on the exchange on January 2, 1998. At all relevant times, corporation
M
and all persons related to
M
owned less than 15% of the outstanding series
X
preferred stock.
(B)
Holding.
The 100,000 shares of series
X
preferred stock held by corporation
M
are not subject to mark-to-market treatment under section 475(a) on December 29, 1997, because at that time the stock was held for less than one full business day and is therefore treated as properly identified as held for investment. At the close of business on December 30, 1997, that prohibition on marking ceases to apply, and section 475(b)(3) begins to apply. The built-in loss is suspended, and subsequent appreciation and depreciation are subject to section 475(a). Accordingly, when corporation
M
marks the series
X
stock to market at the close of business on December 31, 1997, under section 475(a) it recognizes and takes into account a loss of $.50 per share. Under section 475(b)(3), when corporation
M
sells the series
X
stock on January 2, 1998, it takes into account the suspended loss, that is, the difference between the $100 per share it paid corporation
P
for that stock and the $99-per-share fair market value when section 475(b)(1) ceased to be applied to the stock. No deduction, however, is allowed for that loss. (See § 1.1502-13(f)(6), under which no deduction is allowed to a
member of a consolidated group for a loss with respect to a share of stock of the parent of that consolidated group, if the member does not take the gain or loss into account pursuant to section 475(a).)
(c)
Securities deemed not held for investment; dealers in notional principal contracts and derivatives.
(1) Except as otherwise determined by the Commissioner in a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, or letter ruling, section 475(b)(1)(A) (exempting from mark-to-market accounting certain securities that are held for investment) does not apply to a security if—
(i) The security is described in section 475(c)(2) (D) or (E) (describing certain notional principal contracts and derivative securities); and
(ii) The taxpayer is a dealer in such securities.
(2) See § 1.475(d)-1(b) for a rule concerning the character of gain or loss on securities described in this paragraph (c).
(d)
Special rule for hedges of another member's risk.
A taxpayer may identify under section 475(b)(1)(C) (exempting certain hedges from mark-to-market accounting) a security that hedges a position of another member of the taxpayer's consolidated group if the security meets the following requirements—
(1) The security is a hedging transaction within the meaning of § 1.1221-2(b);
(2) The security is timely identified as a hedging transaction under § 1.1221-2(f) (including identification of the hedged item); and
(3) The security hedges a position that is not marked to market under section 475(a).
(e)
Transitional rules
—(1)
Stock, partnership, and beneficial ownership interests in certain controlled corporations, partnerships, and trusts before January 23, 1997
—(i)
In general.
The following items held by a dealer in securities are per se held for investment within the meaning of section 475(b)(1)(A) and are deemed to be properly identified as such for purposes of section 475(b)(2)—
(A) Stock in a corporation that the taxpayer controls (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section); or
(B) A partnership or beneficial ownership interest in a widely held or publicly traded partnership or trust that the taxpayer controls (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section).
(ii)
Control defined.
Control means the ownership, directly or indirectly through persons described in section 267(b) (taking into account section 267(c)), of—
(A) 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote; or
(B) 50 percent or more of the capital interest, the profits interest, or the beneficial ownership interest in the widely held or publicly traded partnership or trust.
(iii)
Applicability.
The rules of this paragraph (e)(1) apply only before January 23, 1997.
(2)
Dealers in notional principal contracts and derivatives acquired before January 23, 1997
—(i)
General rule.
Section 475(b)(1)(A) (exempting certain securities from mark-to-market accounting) does not apply to a security if—
(A) The security is described in section 475(c)(2) (D) or (E) (describing certain notional principal contracts and derivative securities); and
(B) The taxpayer is a dealer in such securities.
(ii)
Exception for securities not acquired in dealer capacity.
This paragraph (e)(2) does not apply if the taxpayer establishes unambiguously that the security was not acquired in the taxpayer's capacity as a dealer in such securities.
(iii)
Applicability.
The rules of paragraph (e)(2) apply only to securities acquired before January 23, 1997.
[T.D. 8700, 61 FR 67720, Dec. 24, 1996, as amended by T.D. 8985, 67 FR 12865, Mar. 20, 2002]
§ 1.475(b)-2
Exemptions—identification requirements.
(a)
Identification of the basis for exemption.
An identification of a security as exempt from mark to market does not satisfy section 475(b)(2) if it fails to state whether the security is described in—
(1) Either of the first two subparagraphs of section 475(b)(1) (identifying a security as held for investment or not held for sale); or
(2) The third subparagraph thereof (identifying a security as a hedge).
(b)
Time for identifying a security with a substituted basis.
For purposes of determining the timeliness of an identification under section 475(b)(2), the date that a dealer acquires a security is not affected by whether the dealer's basis in the security is determined, in whole or in part, either by reference to the basis of the security in the hands of the person from whom the security was acquired or by reference to other property held at any time by the dealer. See § 1.475(a)-3 for rules governing how the dealer accounts for such a security if this identification is not made.
(c)
Integrated transactions under § 1.1275-6
—(1)
Definitions.
The following terms are used in this paragraph (c) with the meanings that are given to them by § 1.1275-6: integrated transaction, legging into, legging out, qualifying debt instrument, § 1.1275-6 hedge, and synthetic debt instrument.
(2)
Synthetic debt held by a taxpayer as a result of legging in.
If a taxpayer is treated as the holder of a synthetic debt instrument as the result of legging into an integrated transaction, then, for purposes of the timeliness of an identification under section 475(b)(2), the synthetic debt instrument is treated as having the same acquisition date as the qualifying debt instrument. A pre-leg-in identification of the qualifying debt instrument under section 475(b)(2) applies to the integrated transaction as well.
(3)
Securities held after legging out.
If a taxpayer legs out of an integrated transaction, then, for purposes of the timeliness of an identification under section 475(b)(2), the qualifying debt instrument, or the § 1.1275-6 hedge, that remains in the taxpayer's hands is generally treated as having been acquired, originated, or entered into, as the case may be, immediately after the leg-out. If any loss or deduction determined under § 1.1275-6(d)(2)(ii)(B) is disallowed by § 1.1275-6(d)(2)(ii)(D) (which disallows deductions when a taxpayer legs out of an integrated transaction within 30 days of legging in), then, for purposes of this section and section 475(b)(2), the qualifying debt instrument that remains in the taxpayer's hands is treated as having been acquired on the same date that the synthetic debt instrument was treated as having been acquired.

§ 1.475(b)-3
[Reserved]
§ 1.475(c)-1
Definitions—dealer in securities.
(a)
Dealer-customer relationship.
Whether a taxpayer is transacting business with customers is determined on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances.
(1) [Reserved]
(2)
Transactions described in section 475(c)(1)(B)
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 475(c)(1)(B), the term
dealer in securities
includes, but is not limited to, a taxpayer that, in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business, regularly holds itself out as being willing and able to enter into either side of a transaction enumerated in section 475(c)(1)(B).
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a)(2). In the following examples, B is a bank and is not a member of a consolidated group:

# Example 1.
B regularly offers to enter into interest rate swaps with other persons in the ordinary course of its trade or business. B is willing to enter into interest rate swaps under which it either pays a fixed interest rate and receives a floating rate or pays a floating rate and receives a fixed rate. B is a dealer in securities under section 475(c)(1)(B), and the counterparties are its customers.

# Example 2.
B, in the ordinary course of its trade or business, regularly holds itself out as being willing and able to enter into either side of positions in a foreign currency with other banks in the interbank market. B's activities in the foreign currency make it a dealer in securities under section 475(c)(1)(B), and the other banks in the interbank market are its customers.

# Example 3.
B engages in frequent transactions in a foreign currency in the interbank market. Unlike the facts in
Example 2,
however, B does not regularly hold itself out as being willing and able to enter into either side of positions in the foreign currency, and all of B's transactions are driven by its internal need to adjust its position in the currency. No other circumstances are present to suggest that B is a dealer in securities for purposes of section 475(c)(1)(B). B's activity in the foreign currency does not qualify it as a dealer in securities for purposes of section
475(c)(1)(B), and its transactions in the interbank market are not transactions with customers.
(3)
Related parties
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section (concerning transactions between members of a consolidated group, as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)), a taxpayer's transactions with related persons may be transactions with customers for purposes of section 475. For example, if a taxpayer, in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business, regularly holds itself out to its foreign subsidiaries or other related persons as being willing and able to enter into either side of transactions enumerated in section 475(c)(1)(B), the taxpayer is a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1), even if it engages in no other transactions with customers.
(ii)
Special rule for members of a consolidated group.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of section 475 (concerning the definition of dealer in securities) and except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, a taxpayer's transactions with other members of its consolidated group are not with customers. Accordingly, notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the fact that a taxpayer regularly holds itself out to other members of its consolidated group as being willing and able to enter into either side of a transaction enumerated in section 475(c)(1)(B) does not cause the taxpayer to be a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1)(B).
(iii)
The intragroup-customer election
—(A)
Effect of election.
If a consolidated group makes the intragroup-customer election, paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section (special rule for members of a consolidated group) does not apply to the members of the group. Thus, a member of a group that has made this election may be a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1) even if its only customer transactions are with other members of its consolidated group.
(B)
Making and revoking the election.
Unless the Commissioner otherwise prescribes, the intragroup-customer election is made by filing a statement that says, “[Insert name and employer identification number of common parent] hereby makes the Intragroup-Customer Election (as described in § 1.475(c)-1(a)(3)(iii) of the income tax regulations) for the taxable year ending [describe the last day of the year] and for subsequent taxable years.” The statement must be signed by the common parent and attached to the timely filed federal income tax return for the consolidated group for that taxable year. The election applies for that year and continues in effect for subsequent years until revoked. The election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (a)(3):

# General Facts.
HC, a hedging center, provides interest rate hedges to all of the members of its affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)(1)). Because of the efficiencies created by having a centralized risk manager, group policy prohibits members other than
HC
from entering into derivative interest rate positions with outside parties.
HC
regularly holds itself out as being willing and able to, and in fact does, enter into either side of interest rate swaps with its fellow members.
HC
periodically computes its aggregate position and hedges the net risk with an unrelated party.
HC
does not otherwise enter into interest rate positions with persons that are not members of the affiliated group.
HC
attempts to operate at cost, and the terms of its swaps do not factor in any risk of default by the affiliate. Thus,
HC
's affiliates receive somewhat more favorable terms then they would receive from an unrelated swaps dealer (a fact that may subject
HC
and its fellow members to reallocation of income under section 482). No other circumstances are present to suggest that
HC
is a dealer in securities for purposes of section 475(c)(1)(B).

# Example 1. General rule for related persons.
In addition to the
General Facts
stated above, assume that
HC
's affiliated group has not elected under section 1501 to file a consolidated return. Under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section,
HC
's transactions with its affiliates can be transactions with customers for purposes of section 475(c)(1). Thus, under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section,
HC
is a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1)(B), and the members of the group with which it does business are its customers.

# Example 2. Special rule for members of a consolidated group.
In addition to the
General Facts
stated above, assume that
HC
's affiliated group has elected to file consolidated returns and has not made the intragroup-customer election. Under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)
of this section,
HC
's interest rate swap transactions with the members of its consolidated group are not transactions with customers for purposes of determining whether
HC
is a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1). Further, the fact that
HC
regularly holds itself out to members of its consolidated group as being willing and able to enter into either side of a transaction enumerated in section 475(c)(1)(B) does not cause
HC
to be a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1)(B). Because no other circumstances are present to suggest that
HC
is a dealer in securities for purposes of section 475(c)(1)(B),
HC
is not a dealer in securities.

# Example 3. Intragroup-customer election.
In addition to the
General Facts
stated above, assume that
HC
's affiliated group has elected to file a consolidated return but has also made the intragroup-customer election under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section. Thus, the analysis and result are the same as in
Example 1.
(b)
Sellers of nonfinancial goods and services
—(1)
Purchases and sales of customer paper.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if a taxpayer would not be a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1) but for its purchases and sales of debt instruments that, at the time of purchase or sale, are customer paper with respect to either the taxpayer or a corporation that is a member of the same consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)) as the taxpayer, then for purposes of section 475 the taxpayer is not a dealer in securities.
(2)
Definition of customer paper.
A debt instrument is customer paper with respect to a person at a point in time if—
(i) The person's principal activity is selling nonfinancial goods or providing nonfinancial services;
(ii) The debt instrument was issued by a purchaser of the goods or services at the time of the purchase of those goods or services in order to finance the purchase; and
(iii) At all times since the debt instrument was issued, it has been held either by the person selling those goods or services or by a corporation that is a member of the same consolidated group as that person.
(3)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply if—
(i) For purposes of section 471, the taxpayer accounts for any security (as defined in section 475(c)(2)) as inventory;
(ii) The taxpayer is subject to an election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section; or
(iii) The taxpayer is not described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and one or more debt instruments that are customer paper with respect to a corporation that is a member of the same consolidated group as the taxpayer are accounted for by the taxpayer, or by a corporation that is a member of the same consolidated group as the taxpayer, in a manner that allows recognition of unrealized gains or losses or deductions for additions to a reserve for bad debts.
(4)
Election not to be governed by the exception for sellers of nonfinancial goods or services
—(i)
Method of making the election.
Unless the Commissioner otherwise prescribes, an election under this paragraph (b)(4) must be made in the manner, and at the time, prescribed in this paragraph (b)(4)(i). The taxpayer must file with the Internal Revenue Service a statement that says, “[Insert name and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer] hereby elects not to be governed by § 1.475(c)-1(b)(1) of the income tax regulations for the taxable year ending [describe the last day of the year] and for subsequent taxable years.”
(A)
Taxable years ending after December 24, 1996.
If the first taxable year subject to an election under this paragraph (b)(4) ends after December 24, 1996, the statement must be attached to a timely filed federal income tax return for that taxable year.
(B)
Taxable years ending on or before December 24, 1996.
If the first taxable year subject to an election under this paragraph (b)(4) ends on or before December 24, 1996 and the election changes the taxpayer's taxable income for any taxable year the federal income tax return for which was filed before February 24, 1997, the statement must be attached to an amended return for the earliest such year that is so affected, and that amended return (and an amended return for any other such year that is so affected) must be filed not later than June 23, 1997. If the first taxable year subject to an election under this paragraph (b)(4) ends on or
before December 24, 1996 but the taxpayer is not described in the preceding sentence, the statement must be attached to the first federal income tax return that is for a taxable year subject to the election and that is filed on or after February 24, 1997.
(ii)
Continued applicability of an election.
An election under this paragraph (b)(4) continues in effect for subsequent taxable years until revoked. The election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(c)
Taxpayers that purchase securities from customers but engage in no more than negligible sales of the securities
—(1)
Exemption from dealer status
—(i)
General rule.
A taxpayer that regularly purchases securities from customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (including regularly making loans to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business of making loans) but engages in no more than negligible sales of the securities so acquired is not a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1) unless the taxpayer elects to be so treated or, for purposes of section 471, the taxpayer accounts for any security (as defined in section 475(c)(2)) as inventory.
(ii)
Election to be treated as a dealer.
A taxpayer described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section elects to be treated as a dealer in securities by filing a federal income tax return reflecting the application of section 475(a) in computing its taxable income.
(2)
Negligible sales.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a taxpayer engages in negligible sales of debt instruments that it regularly purchases from customers in the ordinary course of its business if, and only if, during the taxable year, either—
(i) The taxpayer sells all or part of fewer than 60 debt instruments, regardless how acquired; or
(ii) The total adjusted basis of the debt instruments (or parts of debt instruments), regardless how acquired, that the taxpayer sells is less than 5 percent of the total basis, immediately after acquisition, of the debt instruments that it acquires in that year.
(3)
Special rules for members of a consolidated group
—(i)
Intragroup-customer election in effect.
If a taxpayer is a member of a consolidated group that has made the intragroup-customer election (described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section), the negligible sales test in paragraph (c)(2) of this section takes into account all of the taxpayer's sales of debt instruments to other group members.
(ii)
Intragroup-customer election not in effect.
If a taxpayer is a member of a consolidated group that has not made the intragroup-customer election (described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section), the taxpayer satisfies the negligible sales test in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if either—
(A) The test is satisfied by the taxpayer, taking into account sales of debt instruments to other group members (as in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section); or
(B) The test is satisfied by the group, treating the members of the group as if they were divisions of a single corporation.
(4)
Special rules.
Whether sales of securities are negligible is determined without regard to—
(i) Sales of securities that are necessitated by exceptional circumstances and that are not undertaken as recurring business activities;
(ii) Sales of debt instruments that decline in quality while in the taxpayer's hands and that are sold pursuant to an established policy of the taxpayer to dispose of debt instruments below a certain quality; or
(iii) Acquisitions and sales of debt instruments that are qualitatively different from all debt instruments that the taxpayer purchases from customers in the ordinary course of its business.
(5)
Example.
The following example illustrates paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section:

# Example.
I, an insurance company, regularly makes policy loans to its customers but does not sell them.
I,
however, actively trades Treasury securities. No other circumstances are present to suggest that
I
is a dealer in securities for purposes of section 475(c)(1). Since the Treasuries are qualitatively different from the policy loans that
I
originates, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section,
I
disregards the purchases and sales of Treasuries in applying the negligible sales test in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(d)
Issuance of life insurance products.
A life insurance company that is not otherwise a dealer in securities within
the meaning of section 475(c)(1) does not become a dealer in securities solely because it regularly issues life insurance products to its customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term
life insurance product
means a contract that is treated for federal income tax purposes as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract. See sections 72, 817, and 7702.
[T.D. 8700, 61 FR 67723, Dec. 24, 1996]
§ 1.475(c)-2
Definitions—security.
(a)
Items that are not securities.
The following items are not securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(2) with respect to a taxpayer and, therefore, are not subject to section 475—
(1) A security (determined without regard to this paragraph (a)) if section 1032 prevents the taxpayer from recognizing gain or loss with respect to that security;
(2) A debt instrument issued by the taxpayer (including a synthetic debt instrument, within the meaning of § 1.1275-6(b)(4), that § 1.1275-6(b) treats the taxpayer as having issued); or
(3) A REMIC residual interest, or an interest or arrangement that is determined by the Commissioner to have substantially the same economic effect, if the residual interest or the interest or arrangement is acquired on or after January 4, 1995.
(b)
Synthetic debt that § 1.1275-6(b) treats the taxpayer as holding.
If § 1.1275-6 treats a taxpayer as the holder of a synthetic debt instrument (within the meaning of § 1.1275-6(b)(4)), the synthetic debt instrument is a security held by the taxpayer within the meaning of section 475(c)(2)(C).
(c)
Negative value REMIC residuals acquired before January 4, 1995.
A REMIC residual interest that is described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or an interest or arrangement that is determined by the Commissioner to have substantially the same economic effect is not a security within the meaning of section 475(c)(2).
(1)
Description.
A residual interest in a REMIC is described in this paragraph (c)(1) if, on the date the taxpayer acquires the residual interest, the present value of the anticipated tax liabilities associated with holding the interest exceeds the sum of—
(i) The present value of the expected future distributions on the interest; and
(ii) The present value of the anticipated tax savings associated with holding the interest as the REMIC generates losses.
(2)
Special rules applicable to negative value REMIC residuals acquired before January 4, 1995.
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)—
(i) If a transferee taxpayer acquires a residual interest with a basis determined by reference to the transferor's basis, then the transferee is deemed to acquire the interest on the date the transferor acquired it (or is deemed to acquire it under this paragraph (c)(2)(i)).
(ii) Anticipated tax liabilities, expected future distributions, and anticipated tax savings are determined under the rules in § 1.860E-2(a)(3) and without regard to the operation of section 475.
(iii) Present values are determined under the rules in § 1.860E-2(a)(4).
[T.D. 8700, 61 FR 67725, Dec. 24, 1996]
§ 1.475(d)-1
Character of gain or loss.
(a)
Securities never held in connection with the taxpayer's activities as a dealer in securities.
If a security is never held in connection with the taxpayer's activities as a dealer in securities, section 475(d)(3)(A) does not affect the character of gain or loss from the security, even if the taxpayer fails to identify the security under section 475(b)(2).
(b)
Ordinary treatment for notional principal contracts and derivatives held by dealers in notional principal contracts and derivatives.
Section 475(d)(3)(B)(ii) (concerning the character of gain or loss with respect to a security held by a person other than in connection with its activities as a dealer in securities) does not apply to a security if § 1.475(b)-1(c) and the absence of a determination by the Commissioner prevent section 475(b)(1)(A) from applying to the security.
[T.D. 8700, 61 FR 67725, Dec. 24, 1996]
§ 1.475(g)-1
Effective dates.
(a)-(b) [Reserved]
(c) Section 1.475(a)-3 (concerning acquisition by a dealer of a security with a substituted basis) applies to securities acquired, originated, or entered into on or after January 4, 1995.
(d) Section 1.475(a)-4 (concerning a safe harbor to use applicable financial statement values for purposes of section 475) applies to taxable years ending on or after June 12, 2007.
(e) Except as provided elsewhere in this paragraph (d), § 1.475(b)-1 (concerning the scope of exemptions from the mark-to-market requirement) applies to taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1993.
(1) Section 1.475(b)-1(b) applies as follows:
(i) Section 1.475(b)-1(b)(1)(i) (concerning equity interests issued by a related person) applies beginning June 19, 1996. If, on June 18, 1996, a security is subject to mark-to-market accounting and, on June 19, 1996, § 1.475(b)-1(b)(1) begins to apply to the security solely because of the effective dates in this paragraph (d) (rather than because of a change in facts), then the rules of § 1.475(b)-1(b)(4)(i)(A) (concerning the prohibition against marking) apply, but § 1.475(b)-1(b)(4)(i)(B) (imposing a mark-to-market on the day before the onset of the prohibition) does not apply.
(ii) Section 1.475(b)-1(b)(2) (concerning relevant relationships for purposes of determining whether equity interests in related persons are prohibited from being marked to market) applies beginning June 19, 1996.
(iii) Section 1.475(b)-1(b)(3) (concerning certain actively traded securities) applies beginning June 19, 1996, to securities held on or after that date, except for securities described in § 1.475(b)-1(e)(1)(i) (concerning equity interests issued by controlled entities). If a security is described in § 1.475(b)-1(e)(1)(i), § 1.475(b)-1(b)(3) applies only on or after January 23, 1997 if the security is held on or after that date. If § 1.475(b)-1(b)(1) ceases to apply to a security by virtue of the operation of this paragraph (d)(1)(iii), the rules of § 1.475(b)-1(b)(4)(ii) apply to the cessation.

# Adjustments
§ 1.481-1
Adjustments in general.
(a)(1) Section 481 prescribes the rules to be followed in computing taxable income in cases where the taxable income of the taxpayer is computed under a method of accounting different from that under which the taxable income was previously computed. A change in method of accounting to which section 481 applies includes a change in the over-all method of accounting for gross income or deductions, or a change in the treatment of a material item. For rules relating to changes in methods of accounting, see section 446(e) and paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1. In computing taxable income for the taxable year of the change, there shall be taken into account those adjustments which are determined to be necessary solely by reason of such change in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. The “year of the change” is the taxable year for which the taxable income of the taxpayer is computed under a method of accounting different from that used for the preceding taxable year.
(2) Unless the adjustments are attributable to a change in method of accounting initiated by the taxpayer, no part of the adjustments required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be based on amounts which were taken into account in computing income (or which should have been taken into account had the new method of accounting been used) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1954, or ending before August 17, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as pre-1954 years).
(b) The adjustments specified in section 481(a) and this section shall take into account inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and any other item determined to be necessary in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted.
(c)(1) The term “adjustments”, as used in section 481, has reference to the net amount of the adjustments required by section 481(a) and paragraph (b) of this section. In the case of a change in the over-all method of accounting, such as from the cash receipts and disbursements method to an accrual method, the term “net amount of the adjustments” means the consolidation of adjustments (whether the amounts thereof represent increases or decreases in items of income or deductions) arising with respect to balances in various accounts, such as inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, at the beginning of the taxable year of the change in method of accounting. With respect to the portion of the adjustments attributable to pre-
1954 years, it is immaterial that the same items or class of items with respect to which adjustments would have to be made (for the first taxable year to which section 481 applies) do not exist at the time the actual change in method of accounting occurs. For purposes of section 481, only the net dollar balance is to be taken into account. In the case of a change in the treatment of a single material item, the amount of the adjustment shall be determined with reference only to the net dollar balances in that particular account.
(2) If a change in method of accounting is voluntary (i.e., initiated by the taxpayer), the entire amount of the adjustments required by section 481(a) is generally taken into account in computing taxable income in the taxable year of the change, regardless of whether the adjustments increase or decrease taxable income. See, however, §§ 1.446-1(e)(3) and 1.481-4 which provide that the Commissioner may prescribe the taxable year or years in which the adjustments are taken into account.
(3) If the change in method of accounting is involuntary (i.e., not initiated by the taxpayer), then only the amount of the adjustments required by section 481(a) that is attributable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, (hereinafter referred to as post-1953 years) is taken into account. This amount is generally taken into account in computing taxable income in the taxable year of the change, regardless of whether the adjustments increase or decrease taxable income. See, however, §§ 1.446-1(e)(3) and 1.481-4 which provide that the Commissioner may prescribe the taxable year or years in which the adjustments are taken into account. See also § 1.481-3 for rules relating to adjustments attributable to pre-1954 years.
(4) For any adjustments attributable to post-1953 years that are taken into account entirely in the year of change and that increase taxable income by more than $3,000, the limitations on tax provided in section 481(b) (1) or (2) apply. See § 1.481-2 for rules relating to the limitations on tax provided by sections 481(b) (1) and (2).
(5) A change in the method of accounting initiated by the taxpayer includes not only a change which he originates by securing the consent of the Commissioner, but also a change from one method of accounting to another made without the advance approval of the Commissioner. A change in the taxpayer's method of accounting required as a result of an examination of the taxpayer's income tax return will not be considered as initiated by the taxpayer. On the other hand, a taxpayer who, on his own initiative, changes his method of accounting in order to conform to the requirements of any Federal income tax regulation or ruling shall not, merely because of such fact, be considered to have made an involuntary change.
(d) Any adjustments required under section 481(a) that are taken into account during a taxable year must be properly taken into account for purposes of computing gross income, adjusted gross income, or taxable income in determining the amount of any item of gain, loss, deduction, or credit that depends on gross income, adjusted gross income, or taxable income.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11731, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8608, 60 FR 40078, Aug. 7, 1995]
§ 1.481-2
Limitation on tax.
(a)
Three-year allocation.
Section 481(b)(1) provides a limitation on the tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for the taxable year of change that is attributable to the adjustments required under section 481(a) and § 1.481-1 if the entire amount of the adjustments is taken into account in the year of change. If such adjustments increase the taxpayer's taxable income for the taxable year of the change by more than $3,000, then the tax for such taxable year that is attributable to the adjustments shall not exceed the lesser of the tax attributable to taking such adjustments into account in computing taxable income for the taxable year of the change under section 481(a) and § 1.481-1, or the aggregate of the increases in tax that would result if the adjustments were included ratably in the taxable year of the change and the two preceding taxable years. For the purpose of computing the limitation on tax under section 481(b)(1), the adjustments shall be allocated ratably to the
taxable year of the change and the two preceding taxable years, whether or not the adjustments are in fact attributable in whole or in part to such years. The limitation on the tax provided in this paragraph shall be applicable only if the taxpayer used the method of accounting from which the change was made in computing taxable income for the two taxable years preceding the taxable year of the change.
(b)
Allocation under new method of accounting.
Section 481(b)(2) provides a second alternative limitation on the tax for the taxable year of change under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code that is attributable to the adjustments required under section 481(a) and § 1.481-1 where such adjustments increase taxable income for the taxable year of change by more than $3,000. If the taxpayer establishes from his books of account and other records what his taxable income would have been under the new method of accounting for one or more consecutive taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change, and if the taxpayer in computing taxable income for such years used the method of accounting from which the change was made, then the tax attributable to the adjustments shall not exceed the smallest of the following amounts:
(1) The tax attributable to taking the adjustments into account in computing taxable income for the taxable year of the change under section 481(a) and § 1.481-1;
(2) The tax attributable to such adjustments computed under the 3-year allocation provided in section 481(b)(1), if applicable; or
(3) The net increase in the taxes under chapter 1 (or under corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws) which would result from allocating that portion of the adjustments to the one or more consecutive preceding taxable years to which properly allocable under the new method of accounting and from allocating the balance thereof to the taxable year of the change.
(c)
Rules for computation of tax.
(1) The first step in determining whether either of the limitations described in section 481(b) (1) or (2) applies is to compute the increase in tax for the taxable year of the change that is attributable to the increase in taxable income for such year resulting solely from the adjustments required under section 481(a) and § 1.481-1. This increase in tax is the excess of the tax for the taxable year computed by taking into account such adjustments under section 481(a) over the tax computed for such year without taking the adjustments into account.
(2) The next step is to compute under section 481(b)(1) the tax attributable to the adjustments referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the taxable year of the change and the two preceding taxable years as if an amount equal to one-third of the net amount of such adjustments had been received or accrued in each of such taxable years. The increase in tax attributable to the adjustments for each such taxable year is the excess of the tax for such year computed with the allocation of one-third of the net adjustments to such taxable year over the tax computed without the allocation of any part of the adjustments to such year. For the purpose of computing the aggregate increase in taxes for such taxable years, there shall be taken into account the increase or decrease in tax for any taxable year preceding the taxable year of the change to which no adjustment is allocated under section 481(b)(1) but which is affected by a net operating loss under section 172 or by a capital loss carryback or carryover under section 1212, determined with reference to taxable years with respect to which adjustments under section 481(b)(1) are allocated.
(3) In the event that the taxpayer satisfies the conditions set forth in section 481(b)(2), the next step is to determine the amount of the net increase in tax attributable to the adjustments referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for:
(i) The taxable year of the change,
(ii) The consecutive taxable year or years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change for which the taxpayer can establish his taxable income under the new method of accounting, and
(iii) Any taxable year preceding the taxable year of the change to which no adjustment is allocated under section
481(b)(2), but which is affected by a net operating loss or by a capital loss carryback or carryover determined with reference to taxable years with respect to which such adjustments are allocated.
The net increase in tax for the taxable years specified in subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph shall be computed as if the amount of the adjustments for the prior taxable years to which properly allocable in accordance with section 481(b)(2) had been received or accrued, or paid or incurred, as the case may be, in such prior years and the balance of the adjustments in the taxable year of the change. The amount of tax attributable to such adjustments for the taxable years specified in subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph is the aggregate of the differences (increases and decreases) between the tax for each such year computed by taking into account the allocable portion of the adjustments in computing taxable income and the tax computed without taking into account any portion of the adjustments in computing taxable income. Generally, where there is an increase in taxable income for a preceding consecutive taxable year established under the new method of accounting, computed without regard to adjustments attributable to any preceding taxable year, the amount of the adjustments to be allocated to each such year shall be an amount equal to such increase. However, where the amount of the adjustments to be allocated to a prior taxable year is less than the increase in taxable income for such year established under the new method of accounting, the amount of the increase in such taxable income for purposes of determining the increase in tax under section 481(b)(2) for such year shall be considered to be the amount so allocated. For example, if the amount of the adjustments required by section 481(a) for 1958 (the taxable year of the change) is $60,000, and the increase in taxable income is determined by the taxpayer to be $40,000, $5,000, and $35,000, computed under the new method of accounting, for the taxable years 1957, 1956, and 1955, respectively, then the amount of the adjustments to be allocated to 1955 will be the balance of the adjustments, or $15,000.
(4) The tax for the taxable year of the change shall be the tax for such year, computed without taking any of the adjustments referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section into account, increased by the smallest of the following amounts—
(i) The amount of tax for the taxable year of the change attributable solely to taking into account the entire amount of the adjustments required by section 481(a) and § 1.481-1;
(ii) The sum of the increases in tax liability for the taxable year of the change and the two immediately preceding taxable years that would have resulted solely from taking into account one-third of the amount of such adjustments required for each of such years as though such amounts had been properly attributable to such years (computed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section); or
(iii) The net increase in tax attributable to allocating such adjustments under the new method of accounting (computed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
(5)(i) In the case of a change in method of accounting by a partnership, the adjustments required by section 481 shall be made with respect to the taxable income of the partnership but the limitations on tax under section 481(b) shall apply to the individual partners. Each partner shall take into account his distributive share of the partnership items, as so adjusted, for the taxable year of the change. Section 481(b) applies to a partner whose taxable income is so increased by more than $3,000 as a result of such adjustments to the partnership taxable income. It is not necessary for the partner to have been a member of the partnership for the two taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change of the partnership's accounting method in order to have the limitation provided by section 481(b)(1) apply. Further, a partner may apply section 481(b)(2) even though he was not a member of the partnership for all the taxable years affected by the computation thereunder.
(ii) In the case of a change in method of accounting by an electing small
business corporation under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, the adjustments required by section 481 shall be made with respect to the taxable income of such electing corporation in the year of the change, but the limitations on tax under section 481(b) shall apply to the individual shareholders. Section 481(b) applies to a shareholder of an electing small business corporation whose taxable income is so increased by more than $3,000 as a result of such adjustments to such corporation's taxable income. It is not necessary for the shareholder to have been a member of the electing small business corporation, or for such corporation to have been an electing small business corporation, for the two taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change of the corporation's accounting method in order to have the limitation provided by section 481(b)(1) apply. Further, a shareholder may apply section 481(b)(2), even though he was not a shareholder, or the corporation was not an electing small business corporation, for all the taxable years affected by the computation thereunder.
(6) For the purpose of the successive computations of the limitations on tax under section 481(b) (1) or (2), if the treatment of any item under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (or corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws) depends upon the amount of gross income, adjusted gross income, or taxable income (for example, medical expenses, charitable contributions, or credits against the tax), such item shall be determined for the purpose of each such computation by taking into account the proper portion of the amount of any adjustments required to be taken into account under section 481 in each such computation.
(7) The increase or decrease in the tax for any taxable year for which an assessment of any deficiency, or a credit or refund of any overpayment, is prevented by any law or rule of law, shall be determined by reference to the tax previously determined (within the meaning section 1314(a) for such year.
(8) In applying section 7807(b)(1), the provisions of chapter 1 (other than subchapter E, relating to tax on self-employment income) and chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be treated as the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
(d)
Examples.
The application of section 481(b) (1) and (2) may be illustrated by the following examples. Although the examples in this paragraph are based upon adjustments required in the case of a change in the over-all method of accounting, the principles illustrated would be equally applicable to adjustments required in the case of a change in method of accounting for a particular material item, provided the treatment of such adjustments is not specifically subject to some other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

# Example 1.
An unmarried individual taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting for the calendar year is required by the Commissioner to change to an accrual method effective with the year 1958. As of January 1, 1958, he had an opening inventory of $11,000. On December 31, 1958, he had a closing inventory of $12,500. Merchandise purchases during the year amounted to $22,500, and net sales were $32,000. Total deductible business expenses were $5,000. There were no receivables or payables at January 1, 1958. The computation of taxable income for 1958, assuming no other adjustments, using the new method of accounting follows:
Net sales
$32,000
Opening inventory
$11,000
Purchases
22,500
Total
33,500
Less closing inventory
12,500
Cost of goods sold
21,000
Gross profit
11,000
Business expenses
5,000
Business income
6,000
Personal exemption and itemized deductions
1,600
Taxable income
4,400
Under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, only $9,000 of the $11,000 opening inventory had been included in the cost of goods sold and claimed as a deduction for the taxable years 1954 through 1957; the remaining $2,000 had been so accounted for in pre-1954 years. In order to prevent the same item from reducing taxable income twice, an adjustment of $9,000 must be made to the taxable income of 1958 under the provisions of section 481(a) and § 1.481-1. Since the change in method of accounting was not initiated by the taxpayer, the $2,000
of opening inventory which had been included in cost of goods sold in pre-1954 years is not taken into account. Taxable income for 1958 is accordingly increased by $9,000 under section 481(a) to $13,400. Assuming that the tax on $13,400 is $4,002 and that the tax on $4,400 (income without the adjustment) is $944, the increase in tax attributable to the adjustment, if taken into account for the taxable year of the change, would be the difference between the two, or $3,058. Since the adjustment required by section 481(a) and § 1.481-1 ($9,000) increases taxable income by more than $3,000, the increase in tax for the taxable year 1958 attributable to the adjustment of $9,000 (i.e., $3,058) may be limited under the provisions of section 481(b) (1) or (2). See examples (2) and (3).

# Example 2.
Assume that the taxpayer in Example 1 used the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting in computing taxable income for the years 1956 and 1957 and that the taxable income for these years determined under such method was $4,000 and $6,000, respectively. The section 481(b)(1) limitation on tax with a pro rata three-year allocation of the $9,000 adjustment is computed as follows:
Taxable year
Taxable income before adjustment
Taxable income with adjustment
Assume total tax
Assumed tax before adjustment
Increase in tax attributable to adjustment
1956
$4,000
$7,000
$1,660
$840
$820
1957
6,000
9,000
2,300
1,360
940
1958
4,400
7,400
1,780
944
836
Total
2,596
Since this increase in tax of $2,596 is less than the increase in tax attributable to the inclusion of the entire adjustment in the income for the taxable year of the change ($3,058), the limitation provided by section 481(b)(1) applies, and the total tax for 1958, the taxable year of the change, if section 481(b)(2) does not apply, is determined as follows:
Tax without any portion of adjustment
$944
Increase in tax attributable to adjustment computed under section 481(b)(1)
2,596
Total tax for taxable year of the change
3,540

# Example 3.
(i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1 and, in addition, assume that the taxpayer used the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting in computing taxable income for the years 1953 through 1957; that he established his taxable income under the new method for the taxable years 1953, 1954, and 1957, but did not have sufficient records to establish his taxable income under such method for the taxable years 1955 and 1956. The original taxable income and taxable income as redetermined are as follows:
Taxable year
Taxable income
Determined under cash receipts and disbursements method
Established under new method
Increase or (decrease) in taxable income
1953
$5,000

Undetermined.
As in examples (1) and (2), the total adjustment under section 481(a) is $9,000. Of the $9,000 adjustment, $4,000 may be allocated to 1957, which is the only year consecutively preceding the taxable year of the change for which the taxpayer was able to establish his income under the new method. Since the income cannot be established under the new method for 1956 and 1955, no allocation may be made to 1954 or 1953, even though the taxpayer has established his income for those years under the new method of accounting. The balance of $5,000 ($9,000 minus $4,000) must be allocated to 1958.
(ii) The limitation provided by section 481(b)(2) is computed as follows: The tax for 1957, based on taxable income of $6,000, is assumed to be $1,360. Under the new method, based on taxable income of $10,000, the tax for 1957 is assumed to be $2,640, the increase attributable to $4,000 of the $9,000 section 481(a) adjustment being $1,280, ($2,640 minus $1,360). The tax for 1958, computed on the basis of taxable income of $4,400 (determined under the new method), is assumed to be $944. The tax computed for 1958 on taxable income of $9,400 ($4,400 plus the $5,000 adjustment allocated to 1958) is assumed to be $2,436, leaving a difference of $1,492 ($2,436
minus $944) attributable to the inclusion in 1958 of the portion of the total adjustment to be taken into account which could not be properly allocated to the taxable year or years consecutively preceding 1958.
(iii) The tax attributable to the adjustment is determined by selecting the smallest of the three following amounts:
Increase in tax attributable to adjustment computed under section 481(b)(2) ($1,280 + $1,492)
$2,772
Increase in tax attributable to adjustment computed under section 481(b)(1) (Example 2)
2,596
Increase in tax if the entire adjustment is taken into account in the taxable year of the change (Example 1)
3,058
The final tax for 1958 is then $3,540 computed as follows:
Tax before inclusion of any adjustment
$944
Increase in tax attributable to adjustments (smallest of $2,772, $2,596 or $3,058)
2,596
Total tax for 1958 (limited in accordance with section 481(b)(1))
3,540

As indicated above, taxable income for 1953 and 1954, as determined under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, was $2,000 and $4,000, respectively, and after application of the net operating loss carryback from 1955, the taxable income was reduced to zero in 1953 and to $1,000 in 1954. The taxpayer was unable to establish taxable income for these years under an accrual method of accounting; however, under section 481(b)(3)(A), increases or decreases in the tax for taxable years to which no adjustment is allocated must, nevertheless, be taken into account to the extent the tax for such years would be affected by a net operating loss determined with reference to taxable years to which adjustments are allocated. The total amount of the adjustments required under section 481(a) and attributable to the taxable years 1953 through 1957 in this example is assumed to be $10,000. The redetermination of taxable income established by the taxpayer for the taxable years 1955, 1956, and 1957 appears under the heading “Taxable income established under accrual method” in the above tabulation. The tabulation assumes that the taxpayer has been able to recompute the income for those years so as to establish a net adjustment of $9,000, which leaves a balance of $1,000 unaccounted for. In accordance with the requirements of section 481(b)(2), the $1,000 amount is allocated to 1958, the taxable year of the change. The following computations are necessary in order to determine the tax attributable to the adjustments under section 481(a):
Increase in tax attributable to inclusion in 1958 of the entire $10,000 adjustment
Tax on income of 1958 increased by entire amount of adjustment ($100,000 + $10,000)
$51,700

Attributable to recomputations of net operating loss carrybacks determined with reference to net operating loss in 1955.
2
Attributable to the inclusion of $1,000 in the year of the change which represents the portion of the $10,000 adjustment not allocated to taxable years prior to the year of the change for which taxable income is established under the new method.
Since the limitation under section 481(b)(2) ($3,880) on the amount of tax attributable to the adjustments is applicable, the final tax for the taxable year of the change is computed by adding such amount to the tax for that year computed without the inclusion of any amount attributable to the adjustments, that is, $46,500 plus $3,880, or $50,380.

§ 1.481-3
Adjustments attributable to pre-1954 years where change was not initiated by taxpayer.
If the adjustments required by section 481(a) and § 1.481-1 are attributable to a change in method of accounting which was not initiated by the taxpayer, no portion of any adjustments which is attributable to pre-1954 years shall be taken into account in computing taxable income. For example, if the total adjustments in the case of a change in method of accounting which is not initiated by the taxpayer amount to $10,000, of which $4,000 is attributable to pre-1954 years, only $6,000 of the $10,000 total adjustments is required to be taken into account under section 481 in computing taxable income. The portion of the adjustments which is attributable to pre-1954 years is the net amount of the adjustments which would have been required if the taxpayer had changed his method of accounting in his first taxable year which began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954.

§ 1.481-4
Adjustments taken into account with consent.
(a) In addition to the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner under § 1.446-1(e)(3) for effecting a change in method of accounting, including the taxable year or years in which the amount of the adjustments required by section 481(a) is to be taken into account, or the methods of allocation described in section 481(b), a taxpayer may request approval of an alternative method of allocating the amount of the adjustments under section 481. See section 481(c). Requests for approval of an alternative method of allocation shall set forth in detail the facts and circumstances upon which the taxpayer bases its request. Permission will be granted only if the taxpayer and the Commissioner agree to the terms and conditions under which the allocation is to be effected. See § 1.446-1(e) for the rules regarding how to secure the Commissioner's consent to a change in method of accounting.
(b) An agreement to the terms and conditions of a change in method of accounting under § 1.446-1(e)(3), including the taxable year or years prescribed by the Commissioner under that section (or an alternative method described in paragraph (a) of this section) for taking the amount of the adjustments under section 481(a) into account, shall be in writing and shall be signed by the Commissioner and the taxpayer. It shall set forth the items to be adjusted, the amount of the adjustments, the taxable year or years for which the adjustments are to be taken into account, and the amount of the adjustments allocable to each year. The agreement shall be binding on the parties except upon a showing of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of material fact.

§ 1.481-5
Eligible terminated S corporation.
(a)
Scope.
Section 481(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and this section provide rules relating to the qualification of a corporation as an eligible terminated S corporation (ETSC). Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth the requirements a corporation must meet to qualify as an ETSC. Paragraph (c) of this section describes certain transfers and other events that are disregarded for purposes of determining whether a corporation qualifies as an ETSC, as well as the treatment of revocations for which the effective date is the first day of the taxable year during which the revocation is made. Paragraph (d) of this section contains examples illustrating the rules of this section.
(b)
ETSC qualification.
For a C corporation to qualify as an ETSC, it must satisfy the following requirements:
(1) The corporation must have been an S corporation on December 21, 2017;
(2) During the 2-year period beginning on December 22, 2017, the corporation must have made a valid revocation of its S election under section 1362(d)(1) and the regulatory provisions in this part under section 1362 of the Code (revocation); and
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owners of the shares of stock of the corporation must be the same (and in identical proportions) on both:
(i) December 22, 2017; and
(ii) The day on which the revocation is made.
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Certain disregarded events.
The following events are disregarded for purposes of determining whether the requirement in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is satisfied:
(i) Transfers of stock between a shareholder and that shareholder's trust treated as wholly owned by that shareholder under subpart E of subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code;
(ii) Transfers of stock between a shareholder and an entity owned by that shareholder that is disregarded as separate from its owner under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of the Procedure and Administration Regulations;
(iii) An election by a shareholder trust to be treated as part of a decedent's estate under section 645 of the Code or the termination of an election under that section;
(iv) A change in the status of a shareholder trust from one type of eligible S corporation shareholder trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A) of the Code to another type of eligible S corporation shareholder trust; for example, a trust to which the shares of stock were transferred pursuant to the terms of a will (testamentary trust) described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(iii) that elects to become an electing small business trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(v) and (e); and
(v) A transaction that includes more than one of the events described in this paragraph (c)(1).
(2)
Certain revocations.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, a revocation with an effective date that is the first day of the taxable year during which the revocation is made pursuant to section 1362(d)(1)(C)(i) may be treated as having been made on the day the revocation was made or on the effective date of the revocation.
(d)
Examples.
Paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section (
Examples 1
through
3
) illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section
(
Examples 1
through
3
), as of December 1, 2017, X is a calendar year S corporation with 100 shares of stock outstanding that is owned equally by unrelated individuals A and B. Pursuant to section 1362(d)(1) and §§ 1.1362-2 and 1.1362-6, X made a valid revocation of its S election on March 15, 2019, effective on January 1, 2019. X treats the revocation as having been made on March 15, 2019, for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(ii). At all times, X has a single class of stock outstanding. Paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section (
Examples 1
through
3
) describe all relevant transactions involving the X stock from December 1, 2017, until March 15, 2019.
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Facts.
On June 5, 2018, A contributed 20 of its shares of X stock to Y, a wholly owned limited liability company that is disregarded as an entity separate from A pursuant to § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i). On June 14, 2018, A contributed all of its interest in Y to Trust, which was a revocable trust treated as a wholly owned grantor trust of A pursuant to sections 671 and 676 of the Code. On December 27, 2018, B sold 10 shares of its X stock to C, an unrelated person.
(ii)
Analysis.
X is an ETSC if it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(A)
S corporation.
X was an S corporation on December 21, 2017. Therefore, X satisfies the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(B)
Date of revocation.
X made a valid revocation of its S election pursuant to section 1362(d)(1) on March 15, 2019, which is during the two-year period specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Therefore, X satisfies the requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(C)
Ownership.
For purposes of the requirement in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the relevant dates are: December 22, 2017, and March 15, 2019 (the date X made a revocation of its S corporation status).
(
1
)
A's ownership interest.
As of December 22, 2017, A owned 50 shares of the outstanding shares of X stock. On June 5, 2018, A contributed 20 of its shares of X stock to Y (Transfer). On June 14, 2018, A contributed all of its interest in Y to Trust (Contribution). Both the Transfer and the Contribution are disregarded for purposes of determining whether the requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section is satisfied. See paragraphs (c)(2) and (1) of this section, respectively. Therefore, A owns 50 shares of the outstanding stock of X on March 15, 2019.
(
2
)
B's ownership interest.
As of December 22, 2017, B owned 50 shares of the outstanding shares of X stock. On December 27, 2018, B sold 10 shares to C. Therefore, B owns 40 shares of the outstanding stock of X on March 15, 2019.
(
3
)
C's ownership interest.
As of December 22, 2017, C owned no shares of X stock. On December 27, 2018, C purchased 10 shares from B. Therefore, C owns 10 shares of the outstanding stock of X on March 15, 2019.
(
4
)
Failure to satisfy the requirement in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
As described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(C)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section, B's and C's interest in X were not in the same proportions on December 22, 2017, and March 15, 2019. Therefore, X does not satisfy the requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and does not qualify as an ETSC.
(iii)
Restoration of interests prior to end of PTTP.
If C transferred its shares of X stock back to B on February 1, 2019, then on December 22, 2017, and March 15, 2019, A and B will have owned 50 shares of the outstanding stock of X. Under these facts, X satisfies the requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and qualifies as an ETSC.
(2)
Example 2
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, except that B sold 10 shares of its X stock to C on December 18, 2017, in addition to the sale of 10 shares of X stock on December 27, 2018.
(ii)
Analysis.
The analysis in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section remains the same regarding the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) and (2) of this section. With respect to the requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, on December 22, 2017, A owned 50%, B owned 40%, and C owned 10% of the outstanding stock of X. As in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, the Transfer and the Contribution are disregarded for purposes of determining whether the requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section is satisfied. Therefore, on March 15, 2019, A owned 50% (50
shares), B owned 30% (30 shares), and C owned 20% (20 shares) of the outstanding shares of X. Even though A, B, and C owned shares of X on December 22, 2017, B's and C's proportionate ownership interest of X stock was not the same on December 22, 2017, and March 15, 2019. Therefore, X does not satisfy the requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and does not qualify as an ETSC.
(3)
Example 3
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, except that X made a valid revocation of its S election on November 1, 2019, effective on January 1, 2020.
(ii)
Analysis.
The analysis in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section remains the same regarding the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) through (3) of this section, except that the relevant dates are: December 22, 2017, and November 1, 2019 (the date X made a revocation of its S corporation status). Although the effective date of X's revocation of its S election (January 1, 2020) occurs after the conclusion of the two-year period specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of this section are satisfied.

§ 1.482-1
Allocation of income and deductions among taxpayers.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Purpose and scope.
The purpose of section 482 is to ensure that taxpayers clearly reflect income attributable to controlled transactions and to prevent the avoidance of taxes with respect to such transactions. Section 482 places a controlled taxpayer on a tax parity with an uncontrolled taxpayer by determining the true taxable income of the controlled taxpayer. This section sets forth general principles and guidelines to be followed under section 482. Section 1.482-2 provides rules for the determination of the true taxable income of controlled taxpayers in specific situations, including controlled transactions involving loans or advances or the use of tangible property. Sections 1.482-3 through 1.482-6 provide rules for the determination of the true taxable income of controlled taxpayers in cases involving the transfer of property. Section 1.482-7T sets forth the cost sharing provisions applicable to taxable years beginning on or after January 5, 2009. Section 1.482-8 provides examples illustrating the application of the best method rule. Finally, § 1.482-9 provides rules for the determination of the true taxable income of controlled taxpayers in cases involving the performance of services.
(2)
Authority to make allocations.
The district director may make allocations between or among the members of a controlled group if a controlled taxpayer has not reported its true taxable income. In such case, the district director may allocate income, deductions, credits, allowances, basis, or any other item or element affecting taxable income (referred to as allocations). The appropriate allocation may take the form of an increase or decrease in any relevant amount.
(3)
Taxpayer's use of section 482.
If necessary to reflect an arm's length result, a controlled taxpayer may report on a timely filed U.S. income tax return (including extensions) the results of its controlled transactions based upon prices different from those actually charged. Except as provided in this paragraph, section 482 grants no other right to a controlled taxpayer to apply the provisions of section 482 at will or to compel the district director to apply such provisions. Therefore, no untimely or amended returns will be permitted to decrease taxable income based on allocations or other adjustments with respect to controlled transactions. See § 1.6662-6T(a)(2) or successor regulations.
(b)
Arm's length standard
—(1)
In general.
In determining the true taxable income of a controlled taxpayer, the standard to be applied in every case is that of a taxpayer dealing at arm's length with an uncontrolled taxpayer. A controlled transaction meets the arm's length standard if the results of the transaction are consistent with the results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances (arm's length result). However, because identical transactions can rarely be located, whether
a transaction produces an arm's length result generally will be determined by reference to the results of comparable transactions under comparable circumstances. See § 1.482-1(d)(2) (Standard of comparability). Evaluation of whether a controlled transaction produces an arm's length result is made pursuant to a method selected under the best method rule described in § 1.482-1(c).
(2)
Arm's length methods
—(i)
Methods.
Sections 1.482-2 through 1.482-7 and 1.482-9 provide specific methods to be used to evaluate whether transactions between or among members of the controlled group satisfy the arm's length standard, and if they do not, to determine the arm's length result. This section provides general principles applicable in determining arm's length results of such controlled transactions, but do not provide methods, for which reference must be made to those other sections in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section. Section 1.482-7 provides the specific methods to be used to evaluate whether a cost sharing arrangement as defined in § 1.482-7 produces results consistent with an arm's length result.
(ii)
Selection of category of method applicable to transaction.
The methods listed in § 1.482-2 apply to different types of transactions, such as transfers of property, services, loans or advances, and rentals. Accordingly, the method or methods most appropriate to the calculation of arm's length results for controlled transactions must be selected, and different methods may be applied to interrelated transactions if such transactions are most reliably evaluated on a separate basis. For example, if services are provided in connection with the transfer of property, it may be appropriate to separately apply the methods applicable to services and property in order to determine an arm's length result. But see § 1.482-1(f)(2)(i) (Aggregation of transactions). In addition, other applicable provisions of the Code may affect the characterization of a transaction, and therefore affect the methods applicable under section 482. See for example section 467.
(iii)
Coordination of methods applicable to certain intangible development arrangements.
Section 1.482-7 provides the specific methods to be used to determine arm's length results of controlled transactions in connection with a cost sharing arrangement as defined in § 1.482-7. Sections 1.482-4 and 1.482-9, as appropriate, provide the specific methods to be used to determine arm's length results of arrangements, including partnerships, for sharing the costs and risks of developing intangibles, other than a cost sharing arrangement covered by § 1.482-7. See also §§ 1.482-4(g) (Coordination with rules governing cost sharing arrangements) and 1.482-9(m)(3) (Coordination with rules governing cost sharing arrangements).
(c)
Best method rule
—(1)
In general.
The arm's length result of a controlled transaction must be determined under the method that, under the facts and circumstances, provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result. Thus, there is no strict priority of methods, and no method will invariably be considered to be more reliable than others. An arm's length result may be determined under any method without establishing the inapplicability of another method, but if another method subsequently is shown to produce a more reliable measure of an arm's length result, such other method must be used. Similarly, if two or more applications of a single method provide inconsistent results, the arm's length result must be determined under the application that, under the facts and circumstances, provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result. See § 1.482-8 for examples of the application of the best method rule. See § 1.482-7 for the applicable methods in the case of a cost sharing arrangement.
(2)
Determining the best method.
Data based on the results of transactions between unrelated parties provides the most objective basis for determining whether the results of a controlled transaction are arm's length. Thus, in determining which of two or more available methods (or applications of a single method) provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result, the two primary factors to take into account are the degree of comparability between the controlled transaction (or taxpayer) and any uncontrolled comparables, and the quality of the data and assumptions used in
the analysis. In addition, in certain circumstances, it also may be relevant to consider whether the results of an analysis are consistent with the results of an analysis under another method. These factors are explained in paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.
(i)
Comparability.
The relative reliability of a method based on the results of transactions between unrelated parties depends on the degree of comparability between the controlled transaction or taxpayers and the uncontrolled comparables, taking into account the factors described in § 1.482-1(d)(3) (Factors for determining comparability), and after making adjustments for differences, as described in § 1.482-1(d)(2) (Standard of comparability). As the degree of comparability increases, the number and extent of potential differences that could render the analysis inaccurate is reduced. In addition, if adjustments are made to increase the degree of comparability, the number, magnitude, and reliability of those adjustments will affect the reliability of the results of the analysis. Thus, an analysis under the comparable uncontrolled price method will generally be more reliable than analyses obtained under other methods if the analysis is based on closely comparable uncontrolled transactions, because such an analysis can be expected to achieve a higher degree of comparability and be susceptible to fewer differences than analyses under other methods. See § 1.482-3(b)(2)(ii)(A). An analysis will be relatively less reliable, however, as the uncontrolled transactions become less comparable to the controlled transaction.
(ii)
Data and assumptions.
Whether a method provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result also depends upon the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, the reliability of the assumptions, and the sensitivity of the results to possible deficiencies in the data and assumptions. Such factors are particularly relevant in evaluating the degree of comparability between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions. These factors are discussed in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (A), (B), and (C) of this section.
(A)
Completeness and accuracy of data.
The completeness and accuracy of the data affects the ability to identify and quantify those factors that would affect the result under any particular method. For example, the completeness and accuracy of data will determine the extent to which it is possible to identify differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, and the reliability of adjustments that are made to account for such differences. An analysis will be relatively more reliable as the completeness and accuracy of the data increases.
(B)
Reliability of assumptions.
All methods rely on certain assumptions. The reliability of the results derived from a method depends on the soundness of such assumptions. Some assumptions are relatively reliable. For example, adjustments for differences in payment terms between controlled and uncontrolled transactions may be based on the assumption that at arm's length such differences would lead to price differences that reflect the time value of money. Although selection of the appropriate interest rate to use in making such adjustments involves some judgement, the economic analysis on which the assumption is based is relatively sound. Other assumptions may be less reliable. For example, the residual profit split method may be based on the assumption that capitalized intangible development expenses reflect the relative value of the intangible property contributed by each party. Because the costs of developing an intangible may not be related to its market value, the soundness of this assumption will affect the reliability of the results derived from this method.
(C)
Sensitivity of results to deficiencies in data and assumptions.
Deficiencies in the data used or assumptions made may have a greater effect on some methods than others. In particular, the reliability of some methods is heavily dependent on the similarity of property or services involved in the controlled and uncontrolled transaction. For certain other methods, such as the resale price method, the analysis of the extent to which controlled and uncontrolled taxpayers undertake the same or similar functions, employ similar
resources, and bear similar risks is particularly important. Finally, under other methods, such as the profit split method, defining the relevant business activity and appropriate allocation of costs, income, and assets may be of particular importance. Therefore, a difference between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions for which an accurate adjustment cannot be made may have a greater effect on the reliability of the results derived under one method than the results derived under another method. For example, differences in management efficiency may have a greater effect on a comparable profits method analysis than on a comparable uncontrolled price method analysis, while differences in product characteristics will ordinarily have a greater effect on a comparable uncontrolled price method analysis than on a comparable profits method analysis.
(iii)
Confirmation of results by another method.
If two or more methods produce inconsistent results, the best method rule will be applied to select the method that provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result. If the best method rule does not clearly indicate which method should be selected, an additional factor that may be taken into account in selecting a method is whether any of the competing methods produce results that are consistent with the results obtained from the appropriate application of another method. Further, in evaluating different applications of the same method, the fact that a second method (or another application of the first method) produces results that are consistent with one of the competing applications may be taken into account.
(d)
Comparability
—(1)
In general.
Whether a controlled transaction produces an arm's length result is generally evaluated by comparing the results of that transaction to results realized by uncontrolled taxpayers engaged in comparable transactions under comparable circumstances. For this purpose, the comparability of transactions and circumstances must be evaluated considering all factors that could affect prices or profits in arm's length dealings (comparability factors). While a specific comparability factor may be of particular importance in applying a method, each method requires analysis of all of the factors that affect comparability under that method. Such factors include the following—
(i) Functions;
(ii) Contractual terms;
(iii) Risks;
(iv) Economic conditions; and
(v) Property or services.
(2)
Standard of comparability.
In order to be considered comparable to a controlled transaction, an uncontrolled transaction need not be identical to the controlled transaction, but must be sufficiently similar that it provides a reliable measure of an arm's length result. If there are material differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, adjustments must be made if the effect of such differences on prices or profits can be ascertained with sufficient accuracy to improve the reliability of the results. For purposes of this section, a material difference is one that would materially affect the measure of an arm's length result under the method being applied. If adjustments for material differences cannot be made, the uncontrolled transaction may be used as a measure of an arm's length result, but the reliability of the analysis will be reduced. Generally, such adjustments must be made to the results of the uncontrolled comparable and must be based on commercial practices, economic principles, or statistical analyses. The extent and reliability of any adjustments will affect the relative reliability of the analysis. See § 1.482-1(c)(1) (Best method rule). In any event, unadjusted industry average returns themselves cannot establish arm's length results.
(3)
Factors for determining comparability.
The comparability factors listed in § 1.482-1(d)(1) are discussed in this section. Each of these factors must be considered in determining the degree of comparability between transactions or taxpayers and the extent to which comparability adjustments may be necessary. In addition, in certain cases involving special circumstances, the rules under paragraph (d)(4) of this section must be considered.
(i)
Functional analysis.
Determining the degree of comparability between
controlled and uncontrolled transactions requires a comparison of the functions performed, and associated resources employed, by the taxpayers in each transaction. This comparison is based on a functional analysis that identifies and compares the economically significant activities undertaken, or to be undertaken, by the taxpayers in both controlled and uncontrolled transactions. A functional analysis should also include consideration of the resources that are employed, or to be employed, in conjunction with the activities undertaken, including consideration of the type of assets used, such as plant and equipment, or the use of valuable intangibles. A functional analysis is not a pricing method and does not itself determine the arm's length result for the controlled transaction under review. Functions that may need to be accounted for in determining the comparability of two transactions include—
(A) Research and development;
(B) Product design and engineering;
(C) Manufacturing, production and process engineering;
(D) Product fabrication, extraction, and assembly;
(E) Purchasing and materials management;
(F) Marketing and distribution functions, including inventory management, warranty administration, and advertising activities;
(G) Transportation and warehousing; and
(H) Managerial, legal, accounting and finance, credit and collection, training, and personnel management services.
(ii)
Contractual terms
—(A)
In general.
Determining the degree of comparability between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions requires a comparison of the significant contractual terms that could affect the results of the two transactions. These terms include—
(
1
) The form of consideration charged or paid;
(
2
) Sales or purchase volume;
(
3
) The scope and terms of warranties provided;
(
4
) Rights to updates, revisions or modifications;
(
5
) The duration of relevant license, contract or other agreements, and termination or renegotiation rights;
(
6
) Collateral transactions or ongoing business relationships between the buyer and the seller, including arrangements for the provision of ancillary or subsidiary services; and
(
7
) Extension of credit and payment terms. Thus, for example, if the time for payment of the amount charged in a controlled transaction differs from the time for payment of the amount charged in an uncontrolled transaction, an adjustment to reflect the difference in payment terms should be made if such difference would have a material effect on price. Such comparability adjustment is required even if no interest would be allocated or imputed under § 1.482-2(a) or other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations.
(B)
Identifying contractual terms
—(
1
)
Written agreement.
The contractual terms, including the consequent allocation of risks, that are agreed to in writing before the transactions are entered into will be respected if such terms are consistent with the economic substance of the underlying transactions. In evaluating economic substance, greatest weight will be given to the actual conduct of the parties, and the respective legal rights of the parties (see, for example, § 1.482-4(f)(3) (Ownership of intangible property)). If the contractual terms are inconsistent with the economic substance of the underlying transaction, the district director may disregard such terms and impute terms that are consistent with the economic substance of the transaction.
(
2
)
No written agreement.
In the absence of a written agreement, the district director may impute a contractual agreement between the controlled taxpayers consistent with the economic substance of the transaction. In determining the economic substance of the transaction, greatest weight will be given to the actual conduct of the parties and their respective legal rights (see, for example, § 1.482-4(f)(3) (Ownership of intangible property)). For example, if, without a written agreement, a controlled taxpayer operates at full capacity and regularly sells all of its
output to another member of its controlled group, the district director may impute a purchasing contract from the course of conduct of the controlled taxpayers, and determine that the producer bears little risk that the buyer will fail to purchase its full output. Further, if an established industry convention or usage of trade assigns a risk or resolves an issue, that convention or usage will be followed if the conduct of the taxpayers is consistent with it. See UCC 1-205. For example, unless otherwise agreed, payment generally is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive goods. See UCC 2-310.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d)(3)(ii).

# Example 1. Differences in volume.
USP, a United States agricultural exporter, regularly buys transportation services from FSub, its foreign subsidiary, to ship its products from the United States to overseas markets. Although FSub occasionally provides transportation services to URA, an unrelated domestic corporation, URA accounts for only 10% of the gross revenues of FSub, and the remaining 90% of FSub's gross revenues are attributable to FSub's transactions with USP. In determining the degree of comparability between FSub's uncontrolled transaction with URA and its controlled transaction with USP, the difference in volumes involved in the two transactions and the regularity with which these services are provided must be taken into account if such difference would have a material effect on the price charged. Inability to make reliable adjustments for these differences would affect the reliability of the results derived from the uncontrolled transaction as a measure of the arm's length result.

# Example 2. Reliability of adjustment for differences in volume.
(i) FS manufactures product XX and sells that product to its parent corporation, P. FS also sells product XX to uncontrolled taxpayers at a price of $100 per unit. Except for the volume of each transaction, the sales to P and to uncontrolled taxpayers take place under substantially the same economic conditions and contractual terms. In uncontrolled transactions, FS offers a 2% discount for quantities of 20 per order, and a 5% discount for quantities of 100 per order. If P purchases product XX in quantities of 60 per order, in the absence of other reliable information, it may reasonably be concluded that the arm's length price to P would be $100, less a discount of 3.5%.
(ii) If P purchases product XX in quantities of 1,000 per order, a reliable estimate of the appropriate volume discount must be based on proper economic or statistical analysis, not necessarily a linear extrapolation from the 2% and 5% catalog discounts applicable to sales of 20 and 100 units, respectively.

# Example 3. Contractual terms imputed from economic substance.
(i) FP, a foreign producer of wristwatches, is the registered holder of the YY trademark in the United States and in other countries worldwide. In year 1, FP enters the United States market by selling YY wristwatches to its newly organized United States subsidiary, USSub, for distribution in the United States market. USSub pays FP a fixed price per wristwatch. USSub and FP undertake, without separate compensation, marketing activities to establish the YY trademark in the United States market. Unrelated foreign producers of trademarked wristwatches and their authorized United States distributors respectively undertake similar marketing activities in independent arrangements involving distribution of trademarked wristwatches in the United States market. In years 1 through 6, USSub markets and sells YY wristwatches in the United States. Further, in years 1 through 6, USSub undertakes incremental marketing activities in addition to the activities similar to those observed in the independent distribution transactions in the United States market. FP does not directly or indirectly compensate USSub for performing these incremental activities during years 1 through 6. Assume that, aside from these incremental activities, and after any adjustments are made to improve the reliability of the comparison, the price paid per wristwatch by the independent, authorized distributors of wristwatches would provide the most reliable measure of the arm's length price paid per YY wristwatch by USSub.
(ii) By year 7, the wristwatches with the YY trademark generate a premium return in the United States market, as compared to wristwatches marketed by the independent distributors. In year 7, substantially all the premium return from the YY trademark in the United States market is attributed to FP, for example through an increase in the price paid per watch by USSub, or by some other means.
(iii) In determining whether an allocation of income is appropriate in year 7, the Commissioner may consider the economic substance of the arrangements between USSub and FP, and the parties' course of conduct throughout their relationship. Based on this analysis, the Commissioner determines that it is unlikely that,
ex ante,
an uncontrolled taxpayer operating at arm's length would engage in the incremental marketing activities to develop or enhance intangible property owned by another party unless it received contemporaneous compensation or otherwise had a reasonable anticipation of receiving a future benefit from those activities. In this
case, USSub's undertaking the incremental marketing activities in years 1 through 6 is a course of conduct that is inconsistent with the parties' attribution to FP in year 7 of substantially all the premium return from the enhanced YY trademark in the United States market. Therefore, the Commissioner may impute one or more agreements between USSub and FP, consistent with the economic substance of their course of conduct, which would afford USSub an appropriate portion of the premium return from the YY trademark wristwatches. For example, the Commissioner may impute a separate services agreement that affords USSub contingent-payment compensation for its incremental marketing activities in years 1 through 6, which benefited FP by contributing to the value of the trademark owned by FP. In the alternative, the Commissioner may impute a long-term, exclusive agreement to exploit the YY trademark in the United States that allows USSub to benefit from the incremental marketing activities it performed. As another alternative, the Commissioner may require FP to compensate USSub for terminating USSub's imputed long-term, exclusive agreement to exploit the YY trademark in the United States, an agreement that USSub made more valuable at its own expense and risk. The taxpayer may present additional facts that could indicate which of these or other alternative agreements best reflects the economic substance of the underlying transactions, consistent with the parties' course of conduct in the particular case.

# Example 4. Contractual terms imputed from economic substance.
(i) FP, a foreign producer of athletic gear, is the registered holder of the AA trademark in the United States and in other countries worldwide. In year 1, FP enters into a licensing agreement that affords its newly organized United States subsidiary, USSub, exclusive rights to certain manufacturing and marketing intangible property (including the AA trademark) for purposes of manufacturing and marketing athletic gear in the United States under the AA trademark. The contractual terms of this agreement obligate USSub to pay FP a royalty based on sales, and also obligate both FP and USSub to undertake without separate compensation specified types and levels of marketing activities. Unrelated foreign businesses license independent United States businesses to manufacture and market athletic gear in the United States, using trademarks owned by the unrelated foreign businesses. The contractual terms of these uncontrolled transactions require the licensees to pay royalties based on sales of the merchandise, and obligate the licensors and licensees to undertake without separate compensation specified types and levels of marketing activities. In years 1 through 6, USSub manufactures and sells athletic gear under the AA trademark in the United States. Assume that, after adjustments are made to improve the reliability of the comparison for any material differences relating to marketing activities, manufacturing or marketing intangible property, and other comparability factors, the royalties paid by independent licensees would provide the most reliable measure of the arm's length royalty owed by USSub to FP, apart from the additional facts in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 4.
(ii) In years 1 through 6, USSub performs incremental marketing activities with respect to the AA trademark athletic gear, in addition to the activities required under the terms of the license agreement with FP, that are also incremental as compared to those observed in the comparables. FP does not directly or indirectly compensate USSub for performing these incremental activities during years 1 through 6. By year 7, AA trademark athletic gear generates a premium return in the United States, as compared to similar athletic gear marketed by independent licensees. In year 7, USSub and FP enter into a separate services agreement under which FP agrees to compensate USSub on a cost basis for the incremental marketing activities that USSub performed during years 1 through 6, and to compensate USSub on a cost basis for any incremental marketing activities it may perform in year 7 and subsequent years. In addition, the parties revise the license agreement executed in year 1, and increase the royalty to a level that attributes to FP substantially all the premium return from sales of the AA trademark athletic gear in the United States.
(iii) In determining whether an allocation of income is appropriate in year 7, the Commissioner may consider the economic substance of the arrangements between USSub and FP and the parties' course of conduct throughout their relationship. Based on this analysis, the Commissioner determines that it is unlikely that, ex ante, an uncontrolled taxpayer operating at arm's length would engage in the incremental marketing activities to develop or enhance intangible property owned by another party unless it received contemporaneous compensation or otherwise had a reasonable anticipation of a future benefit. In this case, USSub's undertaking the incremental marketing activities in years 1 through 6 is a course of conduct that is inconsistent with the parties' adoption in year 7 of contractual terms by which FP compensates USSub on a cost basis for the incremental marketing activities that it performed. Therefore, the Commissioner may impute one or more agreements between USSub and FP, consistent with the economic substance of their course of conduct, which would afford USSub an appropriate portion
of the premium return from the AA trademark athletic gear. For example, the Commissioner may impute a separate services agreement that affords USSub contingent-payment compensation for the incremental activities it performed during years 1 through 6, which benefited FP by contributing to the value of the trademark owned by FP. In the alternative, the Commissioner may impute a long-term, exclusive United States license agreement that allows USSub to benefit from the incremental activities. As another alternative, the Commissioner may require FP to compensate USSub for terminating USSub's imputed long-term United States license agreement, a license that USSub made more valuable at its own expense and risk. The taxpayer may present additional facts that could indicate which of these or other alternative agreements best reflects the economic substance of the underlying transactions, consistent with the parties' course of conduct in this particular case.

# Example 5. Non-arm's length compensation.
(i) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of
Example 4.
As in
Example 4,
assume that, after adjustments are made to improve the reliability of the comparison for any material differences relating to marketing activities, manufacturing or marketing intangible property, and other comparability factors, the royalties paid by independent licensees would provide the most reliable measure of the arm's length royalty owed by USSub to FP, apart from the additional facts described in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 5.
(ii) In years 1 through 4, USSub performs certain incremental marketing activities with respect to the AA trademark athletic gear, in addition to the activities required under the terms of the basic license agreement, that are also incremental as compared with those activities observed in the comparables. At the start of year 1, FP enters into a separate services agreement with USSub, which states that FP will compensate USSub quarterly, in an amount equal to specified costs plus X%, for these incremental marketing functions. Further, these written agreements reflect the intent of the parties that USSub receive such compensation from FP throughout the term of the agreement, without regard to the success or failure of the promotional activities. During years 1 through 4, USSub performs marketing activities pursuant to the separate services agreement and in each year USSub receives the specified compensation from FP on a cost of services plus basis.
(iii) In evaluating year 4, the Commissioner performs an analysis of independent parties that perform promotional activities comparable to those performed by USSub and that receive separately-stated compensation on a current basis without contingency. The Commissioner determines that the magnitude of the specified cost plus X% is outside the arm's length range in each of years 1 through 4. Based on an evaluation of all the facts and circumstances, the Commissioner makes an allocation to require payment of compensation to USSub for the promotional activities performed in year 4, based on the median of the interquartile range of the arm's length markups charged by the uncontrolled comparables described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(iv) Given that based on facts and circumstances, the terms agreed by the controlled parties were that FP would bear all risks associated with the promotional activities performed by USSub to promote the AA trademark product in the United States market, and given that the parties' conduct during the years examined was consistent with this allocation of risk, the fact that the cost of services plus markup on USSub's services was outside the arm's length range does not, without more, support imputation of additional contractual terms based on alternative views of the economic substance of the transaction, such as terms indicating that USSub, rather than FP, bore the risk associated with these activities.

# Example 6. Contractual terms imputed from economic substance.
(i) Company X is a member of a controlled group that has been in operation in the pharmaceutical sector for many years. In years 1 through 4, Company X undertakes research and development activities. As a result of those activities, Company X developed a compound that may be more effective than existing medications in the treatment of certain conditions.
(ii) Company Y is acquired in year 4 by the controlled group that includes Company X. Once Company Y is acquired, Company X makes available to Company Y a large amount of technical data concerning the new compound, which Company Y uses to register patent rights with respect to the compound in several jurisdictions, making Company Y the legal owner of such patents. Company Y then enters into licensing agreements with group members that afford Company Y 100% of the premium return attributable to use of the intangible property by its subsidiaries.
(iii) In determining whether an allocation is appropriate in year 4, the Commissioner may consider the economic substance of the arrangements between Company X and Company Y, and the parties' course of conduct throughout their relationship. Based on this analysis, the Commissioner determines that it is unlikely that an uncontrolled taxpayer operating at arm's length would make available the results of its research and development or perform services that resulted in transfer of valuable know how to another party unless it received contemporaneous compensation or otherwise had a reasonable anticipation of receiving a future benefit
from those activities. In this case, Company X's undertaking the research and development activities and then providing technical data and know-how to Company Y in year 4 is inconsistent with the registration and subsequent exploitation of the patent by Company Y. Therefore, the Commissioner may impute one or more agreements between Company X and Company Y consistent with the economic substance of their course of conduct, which would afford Company X an appropriate portion of the premium return from the patent rights. For example, the Commissioner may impute a separate services agreement that affords Company X contingent-payment compensation for its services in year 4 for the benefit of Company Y, consisting of making available to Company Y technical data, know-how, and other fruits of research and development conducted in previous years. These services benefited Company Y by giving rise to and contributing to the value of the patent rights that were ultimately registered by Company Y. In the alternative, the Commissioner may impute a transfer of patentable intangible property rights from Company X to Company Y immediately preceding the registration of patent rights by Company Y. The taxpayer may present additional facts that could indicate which of these or other alternative agreements best reflects the economic substance of the underlying transactions, consistent with the parties' course of conduct in the particular case.
(iii)
Risk
—(A)
Comparability.
Determining the degree of comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions requires a comparison of the significant risks that could affect the prices that would be charged or paid, or the profit that would be earned, in the two transactions. Relevant risks to consider include—
(
1
) Market risks, including fluctuations in cost, demand, pricing, and inventory levels;
(
2
) Risks associated with the success or failure of research and development activities;
(
3
) Financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency rates of exchange and interest rates;
(
4
) Credit and collection risks;
(
5
) Product liability risks; and
(
6
) General business risks related to the ownership of property, plant, and equipment.
(B)
Identification of taxpayer that bears risk.
In general, the determination of which controlled taxpayer bears a particular risk will be made in accordance with the provisions of § 1.482-1(d)(3)(ii)(B) (Identifying contractual terms). Thus, the allocation of risks specified or implied by the taxpayer's contractual terms will generally be respected if it is consistent with the economic substance of the transaction. An allocation of risk between controlled taxpayers after the outcome of such risk is known or reasonably knowable lacks economic substance. In considering the economic substance of the transaction, the following facts are relevant—
(
1
) Whether the pattern of the controlled taxpayer's conduct over time is consistent with the purported allocation of risk between the controlled taxpayers; or where the pattern is changed, whether the relevant contractual arrangements have been modified accordingly;
(
2
) Whether a controlled taxpayer has the financial capacity to fund losses that might be expected to occur as the result of the assumption of a risk, or whether, at arm's length, another party to the controlled transaction would ultimately suffer the consequences of such losses; and
(
3
) The extent to which each controlled taxpayer exercises managerial or operational control over the business activities that directly influence the amount of income or loss realized. In arm's length dealings, parties ordinarily bear a greater share of those risks over which they have relatively more control.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d)(3)(iii).

# Example 1.
FD, the wholly-owned foreign distributor of USM, a U.S. manufacturer, buys widgets from USM under a written contract. Widgets are a generic electronic appliance. Under the terms of the contract, FD must buy and take title to 20,000 widgets for each of the five years of the contract at a price of $10 per widget. The widgets will be sold under FD's label, and FD must finance any marketing strategies to promote sales in the foreign market. There are no rebate or buy back provisions. FD has adequate financial capacity to fund its obligations under the contract under any circumstances that could reasonably be expected to arise. In Years 1, 2 and 3, FD sold only 10,000 widgets at a price of $11 per unit. In Year 4, FD sold its entire inventory of widgets at a price of $25 per unit. Since the contractual terms allocating market risk were agreed to before
the outcome of such risk was known or reasonably knowable, FD had the financial capacity to bear the market risk that it would be unable to sell all of the widgets it purchased currently, and its conduct was consistent over time, FD will be deemed to bear the risk.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that in Year 1 FD had only $100,000 in total capital, including loans. In subsequent years USM makes no additional contributions to the capital of FD, and FD is unable to obtain any capital through loans from an unrelated party. Nonetheless, USM continues to sell 20,000 widgets annually to FD under the terms of the contract, and USM extends credit to FD to enable it to finance the purchase. FD does not have the financial capacity in Years 1, 2 and 3 to finance the purchase of the widgets given that it could not sell most of the widgets it purchased during those years. Thus, notwithstanding the terms of the contract, USM and not FD assumed the market risk that a substantial portion of the widgets could not be sold, since in that event FD would not be able to pay USM for all of the widgets it purchased.

# Example 3.
S, a Country X corporation, manufactures small motors that it sells to P, its U.S. parent. P incorporates the motors into various products and sells those products to uncontrolled customers in the United States. The contract price for the motors is expressed in U.S. dollars, effectively allocating the currency risk for these transactions to S for any currency fluctuations between the time the contract is signed and payment is made. As long as S has adequate financial capacity to bear this currency risk (including by hedging all or part of the risk) and the conduct of S and P is consistent with the terms of the contract (i.e., the contract price is not adjusted to reflect exchange rate movements), the agreement of the parties to allocate the exchange risk to S will be respected.

# Example 4.
USSub is the wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of FP, a foreign manufacturer. USSub acts as a distributor of goods manufactured by FP. FP and USSub execute an agreement providing that FP will bear any ordinary product liability costs arising from defects in the goods manufactured by FP. In practice, however, when ordinary product liability claims are sustained against USSub and FP, USSub pays the resulting damages. Therefore, the district director disregards the contractual arrangement regarding product liability costs between FP and USSub, and treats the risk as having been assumed by USSub.
(iv)
Economic conditions.
Determining the degree of comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions requires a comparison of the significant economic conditions that could affect the prices that would be charged or paid, or the profit that would be earned in each of the transactions. These factors include—
(A) The similarity of geographic markets;
(B) The relative size of each market, and the extent of the overall economic development in each market;
(C) The level of the market (e.g., wholesale, retail, etc.);
(D) The relevant market shares for the products, properties, or services transferred or provided;
(E) The location-specific costs of the factors of production and distribution;
(F) The extent of competition in each market with regard to the property or services under review;
(G) The economic condition of the particular industry, including whether the market is in contraction or expansion; and
(H) The alternatives realistically available to the buyer and seller.
(v)
Property or services.
Evaluating the degree of comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions requires a comparison of the property or services transferred in the transactions. This comparison may include any intangible property that is embedded in tangible property or services being transferred (embedded intangibles). The comparability of the embedded intangibles will be analyzed using the factors listed in § 1.482-4(c)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) (comparable intangible property). The relevance of product comparability in evaluating the relative reliability of the results will depend on the method applied. For guidance concerning the specific comparability considerations applicable to transfers of tangible and intangible property and performance of services,
see
§§ 1.482-3 through 1.482-6 and § 1.482-9;
see also
§§ 1.482-3(f), 1.482-4(f)(4), and 1.482-9(m), dealing with the coordination of intangible and tangible property and performance of services rules.
(4)
Special circumstances
—(i)
Market share strategy.
In certain circumstances, taxpayers may adopt strategies to enter new markets or to increase a product's share of an existing market (market share strategy). Such a strategy would be reflected by
temporarily increased market development expenses or resale prices that are temporarily lower than the prices charged for comparable products in the same market. Whether or not the strategy is reflected in the transfer price depends on which party to the controlled transaction bears the costs of the pricing strategy. In any case, the effect of a market share strategy on a controlled transaction will be taken into account only if it can be shown that an uncontrolled taxpayer engaged in a comparable strategy under comparable circumstances for a comparable period of time, and the taxpayer provides documentation that substantiates the following—
(A) The costs incurred to implement the market share strategy are borne by the controlled taxpayer that would obtain the future profits that result from the strategy, and there is a reasonable likelihood that the strategy will result in future profits that reflect an appropriate return in relation to the costs incurred to implement it;
(B) The market share strategy is pursued only for a period of time that is reasonable, taking into consideration the industry and product in question; and
(C) The market share strategy, the related costs and expected returns, and any agreement between the controlled taxpayers to share the related costs, were established before the strategy was implemented.
(ii)
Different geographic markets
—(A)
In general.
Uncontrolled comparables ordinarily should be derived from the geographic market in which the controlled taxpayer operates, because there may be significant differences in economic conditions in different markets. If information from the same market is not available, an uncontrolled comparable derived from a different geographic market may be considered if adjustments are made to account for differences between the two markets. If information permitting adjustments for such differences is not available, then information derived from uncontrolled comparables in the most similar market for which reliable data is available may be used, but the extent of such differences may affect the reliability of the method for purposes of the best method rule. For this purpose, a geographic market is any geographic area in which the economic conditions for the relevant product or service are substantially the same, and may include multiple countries, depending on the economic conditions.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(4)(ii).

# Example.
Manuco, a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of P, a U.S. corporation, manufactures products in Country Z for sale to P. No uncontrolled transactions are located that would provide a reliable measure of the arm's length result under the comparable uncontrolled price method. The district director considers applying the cost plus method or the comparable profits method. Information on uncontrolled taxpayers performing comparable functions under comparable circumstances in the same geographic market is not available. Therefore, adjusted data from uncontrolled manufacturers in other markets may be considered in order to apply the cost plus method. In this case, comparable uncontrolled manufacturers are found in the United States. Accordingly, data from the comparable U.S. uncontrolled manufacturers, as adjusted to account for differences between the United States and Country Z's geographic market, is used to test the arm's length price paid by P to Manuco. However, the use of such data may affect the reliability of the results for purposes of the best method rule. See § 1.482-1(c).
(C)
Location savings.
If an uncontrolled taxpayer operates in a different geographic market than the controlled taxpayer, adjustments may be necessary to account for significant differences in costs attributable to the geographic markets. These adjustments must be based on the effect such differences would have on the consideration charged or paid in the controlled transaction given the relative competitive positions of buyers and sellers in each market. Thus, for example, the fact that the total costs of operating in a controlled manufacturer's geographic market are less than the total costs of operating in other markets ordinarily justifies higher profits to the manufacturer only if the cost differences would increase the profits of comparable uncontrolled manufacturers operating at arm's length, given the competitive positions of buyers and sellers in that market.
(D)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C).

# Example.
Couture, a U.S. apparel design corporation, contracts with Sewco, its wholly owned Country Y subsidiary, to manufacture its clothes. Costs of operating in Country Y are significantly lower than the operating costs in the United States. Although clothes with the Couture label sell for a premium price, the actual production of the clothes does not require significant specialized knowledge that could not be acquired by actual or potential competitors to Sewco at reasonable cost. Thus, Sewco's functions could be performed by several actual or potential competitors to Sewco in geographic markets that are similar to Country Y. Thus, the fact that production is less costly in Country Y will not, in and of itself, justify additional profits derived from lower operating costs in Country Y inuring to Sewco, because the competitive positions of the other actual or potential producers in similar geographic markets capable of performing the same functions at the same low costs indicate that at arm's length such profits would not be retained by Sewco.
(iii)
Transactions ordinarily not accepted as comparables
—(A)
In general.
Transactions ordinarily will not constitute reliable measures of an arm's length result for purposes of this section if—
(
1
) They are not made in the ordinary course of business; or
(
2
) One of the principal purposes of the uncontrolled transaction was to establish an arm's length result with respect to the controlled transaction.
(B)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principle of this paragraph (d)(4)(iii).

# Example 1. Not in the ordinary course of business.
USP, a United States manufacturer of computer software, sells its products to FSub, its foreign distributor in country X. Compco, a United States competitor of USP, also sells its products in X through unrelated distributors. However, in the year under review, Compco is forced into bankruptcy, and Compco liquidates its inventory by selling all of its products to unrelated distributors in X for a liquidation price. Because the sale of its entire inventory was not a sale in the ordinary course of business, Compco's sale cannot be used as an uncontrolled comparable to determine USP's arm's length result from its controlled transaction.

# Example 2. Principal purpose of establishing an arm's length result.
USP, a United States manufacturer of farm machinery, sells its products to FSub, its wholly-owned distributor in Country Y. USP, operating at nearly full capacity, sells 95% of its inventory to FSub. To make use of its excess capacity, and also to establish a comparable uncontrolled price for its transfer price to FSub, USP increases its production to full capacity. USP sells its excess inventory to Compco, an unrelated foreign distributor in Country X. Country X has approximately the same economic conditions as that of Country Y. Because one of the principal purposes of selling to Compco was to establish an arm's length price for its controlled transactions with FSub, USP's sale to Compco cannot be used as an uncontrolled comparable to determine USP's arm's length result from its controlled transaction.
(e)
Arm's length range
—(1)
In general.
In some cases, application of a pricing method will produce a single result that is the most reliable measure of an arm's length result. In other cases, application of a method may produce a number of results from which a range of reliable results may be derived. A taxpayer will not be subject to adjustment if its results fall within such range (arm's length range).
(2)
Determination of arm's length range
—(i)
Single method.
The arm's length range is ordinarily determined by applying a single pricing method selected under the best method rule to two or more uncontrolled transactions of similar comparability and reliability. Use of more than one method may be appropriate for the purposes described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section (Best method rule).
(ii)
Selection of comparables.
Uncontrolled comparables must be selected based upon the comparability criteria relevant to the method applied and must be sufficiently similar to the controlled transaction that they provide a reliable measure of an arm's length result. If material differences exist between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, adjustments must be made to the results of the uncontrolled transaction if the effect of such differences on price or profits can be ascertained with sufficient accuracy to improve the reliability of the results. See § 1.482-1(d)(2) (Standard of comparability). The arm's length range will be derived only from those uncontrolled comparables that have, or through adjustments can be brought to, a similar level of comparability and reliability, and uncontrolled
comparables that have a significantly lower level of comparability and reliability will not be used in establishing the arm's length range.
(iii)
Comparables included in arm's length range
—(A)
In general.
The arm's length range will consist of the results of all of the uncontrolled comparables that meet the following conditions: the information on the controlled transaction and the uncontrolled comparables is sufficiently complete that it is likely that all material differences have been identified, each such difference has a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on price or profit, and an adjustment is made to eliminate the effect of each such difference.
(B)
Adjustment of range to increase reliability.
If there are no uncontrolled comparables described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the arm's length range is derived from the results of all the uncontrolled comparables, selected pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, that achieve a similar level of comparability and reliability. In such cases the reliability of the analysis must be increased, where it is possible to do so, by adjusting the range through application of a valid statistical method to the results of all of the uncontrolled comparables so selected. The reliability of the analysis is increased when statistical methods are used to establish a range of results in which the limits of the range will be determined such that there is a 75 percent probability of a result falling above the lower end of the range and a 75 percent probability of a result falling below the upper end of the range. The interquartile range ordinarily provides an acceptable measure of this range; however a different statistical method may be applied if it provides a more reliable measure.
(C)
Interquartile range.
For purposes of this section, the interquartile range is the range from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the results derived from the uncontrolled comparables. For this purpose, the 25th percentile is the lowest result derived from an uncontrolled comparable such that at least 25 percent of the results are at or below the value of that result. However, if exactly 25 percent of the results are at or below a result, then the 25th percentile is equal to the average of that result and the next higher result derived from the uncontrolled comparables. The 75th percentile is determined analogously.
(3)
Adjustment if taxpayer's results are outside arm's length range.
If the results of a controlled transaction fall outside the arm's length range, the district director may make allocations that adjust the controlled taxpayer's result to any point within the arm's length range. If the interquartile range is used to determine the arm's length range, such adjustment will ordinarily be to the median of all the results. The median is the 50th percentile of the results, which is determined in a manner analogous to that described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C) of this section (Interquartile range). In other cases, an adjustment normally will be made to the arithmetic mean of all the results. See § 1.482-1(f)(2)(iii)(D) for determination of an adjustment when a controlled taxpayer's result for a multiple year period falls outside an arm's length range consisting of the average results of uncontrolled comparables over the same period.
(4)
Arm's length range not prerequisite to allocation.
The rules of this paragraph (e) do not require that the district director establish an arm's length range prior to making an allocation under section 482. Thus, for example, the district director may properly propose an allocation on the basis of a single comparable uncontrolled price if the comparable uncontrolled price method, as described in § 1.482-3(b), has been properly applied. However, if the taxpayer subsequently demonstrates that the results claimed on its income tax return are within the range established by additional equally reliable comparable uncontrolled prices in a manner consistent with the requirements set forth in § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii), then no allocation will be made.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (e).

# Example 1. Selection of comparables.
(i) To evaluate the arm's length result of a controlled transaction between USSub, the United States taxpayer under review, and FP, its foreign parent, the district director considers applying the resale price method.
The district director identifies ten potential uncontrolled transactions. The distributors in all ten uncontrolled transactions purchase and resell similar products and perform similar functions to those of USSub.
(ii) Data with respect to three of the uncontrolled transactions is very limited, and although some material differences can be identified and adjusted for, the level of comparability of these three uncontrolled comparables is significantly lower than that of the other seven. Further, of those seven, adjustments for the identified material differences can be reliably made for only four of the uncontrolled transactions. Therefore, pursuant to § 1.482-1(e)(2)(ii) only these four uncontrolled comparables may be used to establish an arm's length range.

# Example 2. Arm's length range consists of all the results.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
Applying the resale price method to the four uncontrolled comparables, and making adjustments to the uncontrolled comparables pursuant to § 1.482-1(d)(2), the district director derives the following results:
Comparable
Result (price)
1
$44.00
2
45.00
3
45.00
4
45.50
(ii) The district director determines that data regarding the four uncontrolled transactions is sufficiently complete and accurate so that it is likely that all material differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions have been identified, such differences have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect, and appropriate adjustments were made for such differences. Accordingly, if the resale price method is determined to be the best method pursuant to § 1.482-1(c), the arm's length range for the controlled transaction will consist of the results of all of the uncontrolled comparables, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. Thus, the arm's length range in this case would be the range from $44 to $45.50.

# Example 3. Arm's length range limited to interquartile range.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except in this case there are some product and functional differences between the four uncontrolled comparables and USSub. However, the data is insufficiently complete to determine the effect of the differences. Applying the resale price method to the four uncontrolled comparables, and making adjustments to the uncontrolled comparables pursuant to § 1.482-1(d)(2), the district director derives the following results:
Uncontrolled comparable
Result (price)
1
$42.00
2
44.00
3
45.00
4
47.50
(ii) It cannot be established in this case that all material differences are likely to have been identified and reliable adjustments made for those differences. Accordingly, if the resale price method is determined to be the best method pursuant to § 1.482-1(c), the arm's length range for the controlled transaction must be established pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. In this case, the district director uses the interquartile range to determine the arm's length range, which is the range from $43 to $46.25. If USSub's price falls outside this range, the district director may make an allocation. In this case that allocation would be to the median of the results, or $44.50.

# Example 4. Arm's length range limited to interquartile range.
(i) To evaluate the arm's length result of controlled transactions between USP, a United States manufacturing company, and FSub, its foreign subsidiary, the district director considers applying the comparable profits method. The district director identifies 50 uncontrolled taxpayers within the same industry that potentially could be used to apply the method.
(ii) Further review indicates that only 20 of the uncontrolled manufacturers engage in activities requiring similar capital investments and technical know-how. Data with respect to five of the uncontrolled manufacturers is very limited, and although some material differences can be identified and adjusted for, the level of comparability of these five uncontrolled comparables is significantly lower than that of the other 15. In addition, for those five uncontrolled comparables it is not possible to accurately allocate costs between the business activity associated with the relevant transactions and other business activities. Therefore, pursuant to § 1.482-1(e)(2)(ii) only the other fifteen uncontrolled comparables may be used to establish an arm's length range.
(iii) Although the data for the fifteen remaining uncontrolled comparables is relatively complete and accurate, there is a significant possibility that some material differences may remain. The district director has determined, for example, that it is likely that there are material differences in the level of technical expertise or in management efficiency. Accordingly, if the comparable profits method is determined to be the best method pursuant to § 1.482-1(c), the arm's length range for the controlled transaction may be established only pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
(f)
Scope of review
—(1)
In general.
The authority to determine true taxable income extends to any case in which either by inadvertence or design the taxable income, in whole or in part, of a controlled taxpayer is other than it would have been had the taxpayer, in the conduct of its affairs, been dealing at arm's length with an uncontrolled taxpayer.
(i)
Intent to evade or avoid tax not a prerequisite.
In making allocations under section 482, the district director is not restricted to the case of improper accounting, to the case of a fraudulent, colorable, or sham transaction, or to the case of a device designed to reduce or avoid tax by shifting or distorting income, deductions, credits, or allowances.
(ii)
Realization of income not a prerequisite
—(A)
In general.
The district director may make an allocation under section 482 even if the income ultimately anticipated from a series of transactions has not been or is never realized. For example, if a controlled taxpayer sells a product at less than an arm's length price to a related taxpayer in one taxable year and the second controlled taxpayer resells the product to an unrelated party in the next taxable year, the district director may make an appropriate allocation to reflect an arm's length price for the sale of the product in the first taxable year, even though the second controlled taxpayer had not realized any gross income from the resale of the product in the first year. Similarly, if a controlled taxpayer lends money to a related taxpayer in a taxable year, the district director may make an appropriate allocation to reflect an arm's length charge for interest during such taxable year even if the second controlled taxpayer does not realize income during such year. Finally, even if two controlled taxpayers realize an overall loss that is attributable to a particular controlled transaction, an allocation under section 482 is not precluded.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates this paragraph (f)(1)(ii).

# Example.
USSub is a U.S. subsidiary of FP, a foreign corporation. Parent manufactures product X and sells it to USSub. USSub functions as a distributor of product X to unrelated customers in the United States. The fact that FP may incur a loss on the manufacture and sale of product X does not by itself establish that USSub, dealing with FP at arm's length, also would incur a loss. An independent distributor acting at arm's length with its supplier would in many circumstances be expected to earn a profit without regard to the level of profit earned by the supplier.
(iii)
Nonrecognition provisions may not bar allocation
—(A)
In general.
If necessary to prevent the avoidance of taxes or to clearly reflect income, the district director may make an allocation under section 482 with respect to transactions that otherwise qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (such as section 351 or 1031).
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates this paragraph (f)(1)(iii).

# Example.
(i) In Year 1 USP, a United States corporation, bought 100 shares of UR, an unrelated corporation, for $100,000. In Year 2, when the value of the UR stock had decreased to $40,000, USP contributed all 100 shares of UR stock to its wholly-owned subsidiary in exchange for subsidiary's capital stock. In Year 3, the subsidiary sold all of the UR stock for $40,000 to an unrelated buyer, and on its U.S. income tax return, claimed a loss of $60,000 attributable to the sale of the UR stock. USP and its subsidiary do not file a consolidated return.
(ii) In determining the true taxable income of the subsidiary, the district director may disallow the loss of $60,000 on the ground that the loss was incurred by USP.
National Securities Corp. v Commissioner,
137 F.2d 600 (3rd Cir. 1943), cert. denied, 320 U.S. 794 (1943).
(iv)
Consolidated returns.
Section 482 and the regulations thereunder apply to all controlled taxpayers, whether the controlled taxpayer files a separate or consolidated U.S. income tax return. If a controlled taxpayer files a separate return, its true separate taxable income will be determined. If a controlled taxpayer is a party to a consolidated return, the true consolidated taxable income of the affiliated group and the true separate taxable income of the controlled taxpayer must be determined consistently with the principles of a consolidated return.
(2)
Rules relating to determination of true taxable income.
The following rules
must be taken into account in determining the true taxable income of a controlled taxpayer.
(i)(A) through (E) [Reserved]. For further guidance see § 1.482-1T(f)(2)(i)(A) through (E).
(ii)
Allocation based on taxpayer's actual transactions
—(A)
In general.
The Commissioner will evaluate the results of a transaction as actually structured by the taxpayer unless its structure lacks economic substance. However, the Commissioner may consider the alternatives available to the taxpayer in determining whether the terms of the controlled transaction would be acceptable to an uncontrolled taxpayer faced with the same alternatives and operating under comparable circumstances. In such cases the Commissioner may adjust the consideration charged in the controlled transaction based on the cost or profit of an alternative as adjusted to account for material differences between the alternative and the controlled transaction, but will not restructure the transaction as if the alternative had been adopted by the taxpayer.
See
paragraph (d)(3) of this section (factors for determining comparability; contractual terms and risk); §§ 1.482-3(e), 1.482-4(d), and 1.482-9(h) (unspecified methods).
(B) [Reserved]. For further guidance see § 1.482-1T(f)(2)(ii)(B).
(iii)
Multiple year data
—(A)
In general.
The results of a controlled transaction ordinarily will be compared with the results of uncontrolled comparables occurring in the taxable year under review. It may be appropriate, however, to consider data relating to the uncontrolled comparables or the controlled taxpayer for one or more years before or after the year under review. If data relating to uncontrolled comparables from multiple years is used, data relating to the controlled taxpayer for the same years ordinarily must be considered. However, if such data is not available, reliable data from other years, as adjusted under paragraph (d)(2) (Standard of comparability) of this section may be used.
(B)
Circumstances warranting consideration of multiple year data.
The extent to which it is appropriate to consider multiple year data depends on the method being applied and the issue being addressed. Circumstances that may warrant consideration of data from multiple years include the extent to which complete and accurate data are available for the taxable year under review, the effect of business cycles in the controlled taxpayer's industry, or the effects of life cycles of the product or intangible property being examined. Data from one or more years before or after the taxable year under review must ordinarily be considered for purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section (risk), paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section (market share strategy), § 1.482-4(f)(2) (periodic adjustments), § 1.482-5 (comparable profits method), § 1.482-9(f) (comparable profits method for services), and § 1.482-9(i) (contingent-payment contractual terms for services). On the other hand, multiple year data ordinarily will not be considered for purposes of applying the comparable uncontrolled price method of § 1.482-3(b) or the comparable uncontrolled services price method of § 1.482-9(c) (except to the extent that risk or market share strategy issues are present).
(C)
Comparable effect over comparable period.
Data from multiple years may be considered to determine whether the same economic conditions that caused the controlled taxpayer's results had a comparable effect over a comparable period of time on the uncontrolled comparables that establish the arm's length range. For example, given that uncontrolled taxpayers enter into transactions with the ultimate expectation of earning a profit, persistent losses among controlled taxpayers may be an indication of non-arm's length dealings. Thus, if a controlled taxpayer that realizes a loss with respect to a controlled transaction seeks to demonstrate that the loss is within the arm's length range, the district director may take into account data from taxable years other than the taxable year of the transaction to determine whether the loss was attributable to arm's length dealings. The rule of this paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(C) is illustrated by
Example 3
of paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(E) of this section.
(D)
Applications of methods using multiple year averages.
If a comparison of a controlled taxpayer's average result
over a multiple year period with the average results of uncontrolled comparables over the same period would reduce the effect of short-term variations that may be unrelated to transfer pricing, it may be appropriate to establish a range derived from the average results of uncontrolled comparables over a multiple year period to determine if an adjustment should be made. In such a case the district director may make an adjustment if the controlled taxpayer's average result for the multiple year period is not within such range. Such a range must be determined in accordance with § 1.482-1(e) (Arm's length range). An adjustment in such a case ordinarily will be equal to the difference, if any, between the controlled taxpayer's result for the taxable year and the mid-point of the uncontrolled comparables' results for that year. If the interquartile range is used to determine the range of average results for the multiple year period, such adjustment will ordinarily be made to the median of all the results of the uncontrolled comparables for the taxable year. See
Example 2
of § 1.482-5(e). In other cases, the adjustment normally will be made to the arithmetic mean of all the results of the uncontrolled comparables for the taxable year. However, an adjustment will be made only to the extent that it would move the controlled taxpayer's multiple year average closer to the arm's length range for the multiple year period or to any point within such range. In determining a controlled taxpayer's average result for a multiple year period, adjustments made under this section for prior years will be taken into account only if such adjustments have been finally determined, as described in § 1.482-1(g)(2)(iii). See
Example 3
of § 1.482-5(e).
(E)
Examples.
The following examples, in which S and P are controlled taxpayers, illustrate this paragraph (f)(2)(iii).
Examples 1
and
4
also illustrate the principle of the arm's length range of paragraph (e) of this section.

# Example 1.
P sold product Z to S for $60 per unit in 1995. Applying the resale price method to data from uncontrolled comparables for the same year establishes an arm's length range of prices for the controlled transaction from $52 to $59 per unit. Since the price charged in the controlled transaction falls outside the range, the district director would ordinarily make an allocation under section 482. However, in this case there are cyclical factors that affect the results of the uncontrolled comparables (and that of the controlled transaction) that cannot be adequately accounted for by specific adjustments to the data for 1995. Therefore, the district director considers results over multiple years to account for these factors. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to average the results of the uncontrolled comparables over the years 1993, 1994, and 1995 to determine an arm's length range. The averaged results establish an arm's length range of $56 to $58 per unit. For consistency, the results of the controlled taxpayers must also be averaged over the same years. The average price in the controlled transaction over the three years is $57. Because the controlled transfer price of product Z falls within the arm's length range, the district director makes no allocation.

# Example 2.
(i) FP, a Country X corporation, designs and manufactures machinery in Country X. FP's costs are incurred in Country X currency. USSub is the exclusive distributor of FP's machinery in the United States. The price of the machinery sold by FP to USSub is expressed in Country X currency. Thus, USSub bears all of the currency risk associated with fluctuations in the exchange rate between the time the contract is signed and the payment is made. The prices charged by FP to USSub for 1995 are under examination. In that year, the value of the dollar depreciated against the currency of Country X, and as a result, USSub's gross margin was only 8%.
(ii) UD is an uncontrolled distributor of similar machinery that performs distribution functions substantially the same as those performed by USSub, except that UD purchases and resells machinery in transactions where both the purchase and resale prices are denominated in U.S. dollars. Thus, UD had no currency exchange risk. UD's gross margin in 1995 was 10%. UD's average gross margin for the period 1990 to 1998 has been 12%.
(iii) In determining whether the price charged by FP to USSub in 1995 was arm's length, the district director may consider USSub's average gross margin for an appropriate period before and after 1995 to determine whether USSub's average gross margin during the period was sufficiently greater than UD's average gross margin during the same period such that USSub was sufficiently compensated for the currency risk it bore throughout the period. See § 1.482- 1(d)(3)(iii) (Risk).

# Example 3.
FP manufactures product X in Country M and sells it to USSub, which distributes X in the United States. USSub realizes losses with respect to the controlled
transactions in each of five consecutive taxable years. In each of the five consecutive years a different uncontrolled comparable realized a loss with respect to comparable transactions equal to or greater than USSub's loss. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the district director examines whether the uncontrolled comparables realized similar losses over a comparable period of time, and finds that each of the five comparables realized losses in only one of the five years, and their average result over the five-year period was a profit. Based on this data, the district director may conclude that the controlled taxpayer's results are not within the arm's length range over the five year period, since the economic conditions that resulted in the controlled taxpayer's loss did not have a comparable effect over a comparable period of time on the uncontrolled comparables.

# Example 4.
(i) USP, a U.S. corporation, manufactures product Y in the United States and sells it to FSub, which acts as USP's exclusive distributor of product Y in Country N. The resale price method described in § 1.482-3(c) is used to evaluate whether the transfer price charged by USP to FSub for the 1994 taxable year for product Y was arm's length. For the period 1992 through 1994, FSub had a gross profit margin for each year of 13%. A, B, C and D are uncontrolled distributors of products that compete directly with product Y in country N. After making appropriate adjustments in accordance with §§ 1.482-1(d)(2) and 1.482-3(c), the gross profit margins for A, B, C, and D are as follows:
1992
1993
1994
Average
A
13
3
8
8.00
B
11
13
2
8.67
7C
4
7
13
8.00
7D
7
9
6
7.33
(ii) Applying the provisions of § 1.482-1(e), the district director determines that the arm's length range of the average gross profit margins is between 7.33 and 8.67. The district director concludes that FSub's average gross margin of 13% is not within the arm's length range, despite the fact that C's gross profit margin for 1994 was also 13%, since the economic conditions that caused S's result did not have a comparable effect over a comparable period of time on the results of C or the other uncontrolled comparables. In this case, the district director makes an allocation equivalent to adjusting FSub's gross profit margin for 1994 from 13% to the mean of the uncontrolled comparables' results for 1994 (7.25%).
(iv)
Product lines and statistical techniques.
The methods described in §§ 1.482-2 through 1.482-6 are generally stated in terms of individual transactions. However, because a taxpayer may have controlled transactions involving many different products, or many separate transactions involving the same product, it may be impractical to analyze every individual transaction to determine its arm's length price. In such cases, it is permissible to evaluate the arm's length results by applying the appropriate methods to the overall results for product lines or other groupings. In addition, the arm's length results of all related party transactions entered into by a controlled taxpayer may be evaluated by employing sampling and other valid statistical techniques.
(v)
Allocations apply to results, not methods
—(A)
In general.
In evaluating whether the result of a controlled transaction is arm's length, it is not necessary for the district director to determine whether the method or procedure that a controlled taxpayer employs to set the terms for its controlled transactions corresponds to the method or procedure that might have been used by a taxpayer dealing at arm's length with an uncontrolled taxpayer. Rather, the district director will evaluate the result achieved rather than the method the taxpayer used to determine its prices.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates this paragraph (f)(2)(v).

# Example.
(i) FS is a foreign subsidiary of P, a U.S. corporation. P manufactures and sells household appliances. FS operates as P's exclusive distributor in Europe. P annually establishes the price for each of its appliances sold to FS as part of its annual budgeting, production allocation and scheduling, and performance evaluation processes. FS's aggregate gross margin earned in its distribution business is 18%.
(ii) ED is an uncontrolled European distributor of competing household appliances. After adjusting for minor differences in the level of inventory, volume of sales, and warranty programs conducted by FS and ED, ED's aggregate gross margin is also 18%. Thus, the district director may conclude that the aggregate prices charged by P for its appliances sold to FS are arm's length, without determining whether the budgeting, production, and performance evaluation processes of P are similar to such processes used by ED.
(g)
Collateral adjustments with respect to allocations under section 482
—(1)
In general.
The district director will take
into account appropriate collateral adjustments with respect to allocations under section 482. Appropriate collateral adjustments may include correlative allocations, conforming adjustments, and setoffs, as described in this paragraph (g).
(2)
Correlative allocations
—(i)
In general.
When the district director makes an allocation under section 482 (referred to in this paragraph (g)(2) as the primary allocation), appropriate correlative allocations will also be made with respect to any other member of the group affected by the allocation. Thus, if the district director makes an allocation of income, the district director will not only increase the income of one member of the group, but correspondingly decrease the income of the other member. In addition, where appropriate, the district director may make such further correlative allocations as may be required by the initial correlative allocation.
(ii)
Manner of carrying out correlative allocation.
The district director will furnish to the taxpayer with respect to which the primary allocation is made a written statement of the amount and nature of the correlative allocation. The correlative allocation must be reflected in the documentation of the other member of the group that is maintained for U.S. tax purposes, without regard to whether it affects the U.S. income tax liability of the other member for any open year. In some circumstances the allocation will have an immediate U.S. tax effect, by changing the taxable income computation of the other member (or the taxable income computation of a shareholder of the other member, for example, under the provisions of subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code). Alternatively, the correlative allocation may not be reflected on any U.S. tax return until a later year, for example when a dividend is paid.
(iii)
Events triggering correlative allocation.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), a primary allocation will not be considered to have been made (and therefore, correlative allocations are not required to be made) until the date of a final determination with respect to the allocation under section 482. For this purpose, a final determination includes—
(A) Assessment of tax following execution by the taxpayer of a Form 870 (Waiver of Restrictions on Assessment and Collection of Deficiency in Tax and Acceptance of Overassessment) with respect to such allocation;
(B) Acceptance of a Form 870-AD (Offer of Waiver of Restriction on Assessment and Collection of Deficiency in Tax and Acceptance of Overassessment);
(C) Payment of the deficiency;
(D) Stipulation in the Tax Court of the United States; or
(E) Final determination of tax liability by offer-in-compromise, closing agreement, or final resolution (determined under the principles of section 7481) of a judicial proceeding.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (g)(2). In each example, X and Y are members of the same group of controlled taxpayers and each regularly computes its income on a calendar year basis.

# Example 1.
(i) In 1996, Y, a U.S. corporation, rents a building owned by X, also a U.S. corporation. In 1998 the district director determines that Y did not pay an arm's length rental charge. The district director proposes to increase X's income to reflect an arm's length rental charge. X consents to the assessment reflecting such adjustment by executing Form 870, a Waiver of Restrictions on Assessment and Collection of Deficiency in Tax and Acceptance of Overassessment. The assessment of the tax with respect to the adjustment is made in 1998. Thus, the primary allocation, as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, is considered to have been made in 1998.
(ii) The adjustment made to X's income under section 482 requires a correlative allocation with respect to Y's income. The district director notifies X in writing of the amount and nature of the adjustment made with respect to Y. Y had net operating losses in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997. Although a correlative adjustment will not have an effect on Y's U.S. income tax liability for 1996, an adjustment increasing Y's net operating loss for 1996 will be made for purposes of determining Y's U.S. income tax liability for 1998 or a later taxable year to which the increased net operating loss may be carried.

# Example 2.
(i) In 1995, X, a U.S. construction company, provided engineering services to Y, a U.S. corporation, in the construction of Y's factory. In 1997, the district director determines that the fees paid by Y to X for
its services were not arm's length and proposes to make an adjustment to the income of X. X consents to an assessment reflecting such adjustment by executing Form 870. An assessment of the tax with respect to such adjustment is made in 1997. The district director notifies X in writing of the amount and nature of the adjustment to be made with respect to Y.
(ii) The fees paid by Y for X's engineering services properly constitute a capital expenditure. Y does not place the factory into service until 1998. Therefore, a correlative adjustment increasing Y's basis in the factory does not affect Y's U.S. income tax liability for 1997. However, the correlative adjustment must be made in the books and records maintained by Y for its U.S. income tax purposes and such adjustment will be taken into account in computing Y's allowable depreciation or gain or loss on a subsequent disposition of the factory.

# Example 3.
In 1995, X, a U.S. corporation, makes a loan to Y, its foreign subsidiary not engaged in a U.S. trade or business. In 1997, the district director, upon determining that the interest charged on the loan was not arm's length, proposes to adjust X's income to reflect an arm's length interest rate. X consents to an assessment reflecting such allocation by executing Form 870, and an assessment of the tax with respect to the section 482 allocation is made in 1997. The district director notifies X in writing of the amount and nature of the correlative allocation to be made with respect to Y. Although the correlative adjustment does not have an effect on Y's U.S. income tax liability, the adjustment must be reflected in the documentation of Y that is maintained for U.S. tax purposes. Thus, the adjustment must be reflected in the determination of the amount of Y's earnings and profits for 1995 and subsequent years, and the adjustment must be made to the extent it has an effect on any person's U.S. income tax liability for any taxable year.
(3)
Adjustments to conform accounts to reflect section 482 allocations
—(i)
In general.
Appropriate adjustments must be made to conform a taxpayer's accounts to reflect allocations made under section 482. Such adjustments may include the treatment of an allocated amount as a dividend or a capital contribution (as appropriate), or, in appropriate cases, pursuant to such applicable revenue procedures as may be provided by the Commissioner (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), repayment of the allocated amount without further income tax consequences.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (g)(3).

# Example. Conforming cash accounts.
(i) USD, a United States corporation, buys Product from its foreign parent, FP. In reviewing USD's income tax return, the district director determines that the arm's length price would have increased USD's taxable income by $5 million. The district director accordingly adjusts USD's income to reflect its true taxable income.
(ii) To conform its cash accounts to reflect the section 482 allocation made by the district director, USD applies for relief under Rev. Proc. 65-17, 1965-1 C.B. 833 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), to treat the $5 million adjustment as an account receivable from FP, due as of the last day of the year of the transaction, with interest accruing therefrom.
(4)
Setoffs
—(i)
In general.
If an allocation is made under section 482 with respect to a transaction between controlled taxpayers, the Commissioner will take into account the effect of any other non-arm's length transaction between the same controlled taxpayers in the same taxable year which will result in a setoff against the original section 482 allocation. Such setoff, however, will be taken into account only if the requirements of paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section are satisfied. If the effect of the setoff is to change the characterization or source of the income or deductions, or otherwise distort taxable income, in such a manner as to affect the U.S. tax liability of any member, adjustments will be made to reflect the correct amount of each category of income or deductions. For purposes of this setoff provision, the term arm's length refers to the amount defined in paragraph (b) of this section (arm's length standard), without regard to the rules in § 1.482-2(a) that treat certain interest rates as arm's length rates of interest.
(ii)
Requirements.
The district director will take a setoff into account only if the taxpayer—
(A) Establishes that the transaction that is the basis of the setoff was not at arm's length and the amount of the appropriate arm's length charge;
(B) Documents, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, all correlative adjustments resulting from the proposed setoff; and
(C) Notifies the district director of the basis of any claimed setoff within 30 days after the earlier of the date of a letter by which the district director transmits an examination report notifying the taxpayer of proposed adjustments or the date of the issuance of the notice of deficiency.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (g)(4).

# Example 1.
P, a U.S. corporation, renders construction services to S, its foreign subsidiary in Country Y, in connection with the construction of S's factory. An arm's length charge for such services determined under § 1.482-9 would be $100,000. During the same taxable year P makes available to S the use of a machine to be used in the construction of the factory, and the arm's length rental value of the machine is $25,000. P bills S $125,000 for the services, but does not charge S for the use of the machine. No allocation will be made with respect to the undercharge for the machine if P notifies the district director of the basis of the claimed setoff within 30 days after the date of the letter from the district director transmitting the examination report notifying P of the proposed adjustment, establishes that the excess amount charged for services was equal to an arm's length charge for the use of the machine and that the taxable income and income tax liabilities of P are not distorted, and documents the correlative allocations resulting from the proposed setoff.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that, if P had reported $25,000 as rental income and $25,000 less as service income, it would have been subject to the tax on personal holding companies. Allocations will be made to reflect the correct amounts of rental income and service income.

Special rules
—(1)
Small taxpayer safe harbor.
[Reserved]
(2)
Effect of foreign legal restrictions
—(i)
In general.
The district director will take into account the effect of a foreign legal restriction to the extent that such restriction affects the results of transactions at arm's length. Thus, a foreign legal restriction will be taken into account only to the extent that it is shown that the restriction affected an uncontrolled taxpayer under comparable circumstances for a comparable period of time. In the absence of evidence indicating the effect of the foreign legal restriction on uncontrolled taxpayers, the restriction will be taken into account only to the extent provided in paragraphs (h)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section (Deferred income method of accounting).
(ii)
Applicable legal restrictions.
Foreign legal restrictions (whether temporary or permanent) will be taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (h)(2) only if, and so long as, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (h)(2)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section are met.
(A) The restrictions are publicly promulgated, generally applicable to all similarly situated persons (both controlled and uncontrolled), and not imposed as part of a commercial transaction between the taxpayer and the foreign sovereign;
(B) The taxpayer (or other member of the controlled group with respect to which the restrictions apply) has exhausted all remedies prescribed by foreign law or practice for obtaining a waiver of such restrictions (other than remedies that would have a negligible prospect of success if pursued);
(C) The restrictions expressly prevented the payment or receipt, in any form, of part or all of the arm's length amount that would otherwise be required under section 482 (for example, a restriction that applies only to the deductibility of an expense for tax purposes is not a restriction on payment or receipt for this purpose); and
(D) The related parties subject to the restriction did not engage in any arrangement with controlled or uncontrolled parties that had the effect of circumventing the restriction, and have not otherwise violated the restriction in any material respect.
(iii)
Requirement for electing the deferred income method of accounting.
If a foreign legal restriction prevents the payment or receipt of part or all of the arm's length amount that is due with respect to a controlled transaction, the restricted amount may be treated as deferrable if the following requirements are met—
(A) The controlled taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that the payment or receipt of the arm's length amount was prevented because of a foreign legal restriction and circumstances described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section; and
(B) The controlled taxpayer whose U.S. tax liability may be affected by
the foreign legal restriction elects the deferred income method of accounting, as described in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, on a written statement attached to a timely U.S. income tax return (or an amended return) filed before the IRS first contacts any member of the controlled group concerning an examination of the return for the taxable year to which the foreign legal restriction applies. A written statement furnished by a taxpayer subject to the Coordinated Examination Program will be considered an amended return for purposes of this paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) if it satisfies the requirements of a qualified amended return for purposes of § 1.6664-2(c)(3) as set forth in those regulations or as the Commissioner may prescribe by applicable revenue procedures. The election statement must identify the affected transactions, the parties to the transactions, and the applicable foreign legal restrictions.
(iv)
Deferred income method of accounting.
If the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section are satisfied, any portion of the arm's length amount, the payment or receipt of which is prevented because of applicable foreign legal restrictions, will be treated as deferrable until payment or receipt of the relevant item ceases to be prevented by the foreign legal restriction. For purposes of the deferred income method of accounting under this paragraph (h)(2)(iv), deductions (including the cost or other basis of inventory and other assets sold or exchanged) and credits properly chargeable against any amount so deferred, are subject to deferral under the provisions of § 1.461- 1(a)(4). In addition, income is deferrable under this deferred income method of accounting only to the extent that it exceeds the related deductions already claimed in open taxable years to which the foreign legal restriction applied.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples, in which Sub is a Country FC subsidiary of U.S. corporation, Parent, illustrate this paragraph (h)(2).

# Example 1.
Parent licenses an intangible to Sub. FC law generally prohibits payments by any person within FC to recipients outside the country. The FC law meets the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section. There is no evidence of unrelated parties entering into transactions under comparable circumstances for a comparable period of time, and the foreign legal restrictions will not be taken into account in determining the arm's length amount. The arm's length royalty rate for the use of the intangible property in the absence of the foreign restriction is 10% of Sub's sales in country FC. However, because the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section are satisfied, Parent can elect the deferred income method of accounting by attaching to its timely filed U.S. income tax return a written statement that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that Sub, although it makes no royalty payment to Parent, arranges with an unrelated intermediary to make payments equal to an arm's length amount on its behalf to Parent.
(ii) The district director makes an allocation of royalty income to Parent, based on the arm's length royalty rate of 10%. Further, the district director determines that because the arrangement with the third party had the effect of circumventing the FC law, the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(D) of this section are not satisfied. Thus, Parent could not validly elect the deferred income method of accounting, and the allocation of royalty income cannot be treated as deferrable. In appropriate circumstances, the district director may permit the amount of the distribution to be treated as payment by Sub of the royalty allocated to Parent, under the provisions of § 1.482-1(g) (Collateral adjustments).

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the laws of FC do not prevent distributions from corporations to their shareholders. Sub distributes an amount equal to 8% of its sales in country FC. Because the laws of FC did not expressly prevent all forms of payment from Sub to Parent, Parent cannot validly elect the deferred income method of accounting with respect to any of the arm's length royalty amount. In appropriate circumstances, the district director may permit the 8% that was distributed to be treated as payment by Sub of the royalty allocated to Parent, under the provisions of § 1.482-1(g) (Collateral adjustments).

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that Country FC law permits the payment of a royalty, but limits the amount to 5% of sales, and Sub pays the 5% royalty to Parent. Parent demonstrates the existence of a comparable uncontrolled transaction for purposes of the comparable uncontrolled transaction method in which an uncontrolled party accepted a royalty rate of 5%. Given the evidence of the comparable uncontrolled transaction, the 5% royalty
rate is determined to be the arm's length royalty rate.
(3)
Coordination with section 936
—(i)
Cost sharing under section 936.
If a possessions corporation makes an election under section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(I), the corporation must make a section 936 cost sharing payment that is at least equal to the payment that would be required under section 482 if the electing corporation were a foreign corporation. In determining the payment that would be required under section 482 for this purpose, the provisions of §§ 1.482-1 and 1.482-4 will be applied, and to the extent relevant to the valuation of intangibles, §§ 1.482-5 and 1.482-6 will be applied. The provisions of section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(II) (Effect of Election—electing corporation treated as owner of intangible property) do not apply until the payment that would be required under section 482 has been determined.
(ii)
Use of terms.
A cost sharing payment, for the purposes of section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(I), is calculated using the provisions of section 936 and the regulations thereunder and the provisions of this paragraph (h)(3). The provisions relating to cost sharing under section 482 do not apply to payments made pursuant to an election under section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(I). Similarly, a profit split payment, for the purposes of section 936(h)(5)(C)(ii)(I), is calculated using the provisions of section 936 and the regulations thereunder, not section 482 and the regulations thereunder.
(i)
Definitions.
The definitions set forth in paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(10) of this section apply to this section and §§ 1.482-2 through 1.482-9.
(1)
Organization
includes an organization of any kind, whether a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a trust, an estate, an association, or a corporation (as each is defined or understood in the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder), irrespective of the place of organization, operation, or conduct of the trade or business, and regardless of whether it is a domestic or foreign organization, whether it is an exempt organization, or whether it is a member of an affiliated group that files a consolidated U.S. income tax return, or a member of an affiliated group that does not file a consolidated U.S. income tax return.
(2)
Trade
or
business
includes a trade or business activity of any kind, regardless of whether or where organized, whether owned individually or otherwise, and regardless of the place of operation. Employment for compensation will constitute a separate trade or business from the employing trade or business.
(3)
Taxpayer
means any person, organization, trade or business, whether or not subject to any internal revenue tax.
(4)
Controlled
includes any kind of control, direct or indirect, whether legally enforceable or not, and however exercisable or exercised, including control resulting from the actions of two or more taxpayers acting in concert or with a common goal or purpose. It is the reality of the control that is decisive, not its form or the mode of its exercise. A presumption of control arises if income or deductions have been arbitrarily shifted.
(5)
Controlled taxpayer
means any one of two or more taxpayers owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, and includes the taxpayer that owns or controls the other taxpayers.
Uncontrolled taxpayer
means any one of two or more taxpayers not owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests.
(6)
Group, controlled group,
and
group of controlled taxpayers
mean the taxpayers owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests.
(7)
Transaction
means any sale, assignment, lease, license, loan, advance, contribution, or any other transfer of any interest in or a right to use any property (whether tangible or intangible, real or personal) or money, however such transaction is effected, and whether or not the terms of such transaction are formally documented. A transaction also includes the performance of any services for the benefit of, or on behalf of, another taxpayer.
(8)
Controlled transaction
or
controlled transfer
means any transaction or transfer between two or more members of the same group of controlled taxpayers. The term
uncontrolled transaction
means any transaction between two or more taxpayers that are not
members of the same group of controlled taxpayers.
(9)
True taxable income
means, in the case of a controlled taxpayer, the taxable income that would have resulted had it dealt with the other member or members of the group at arm's length. It does not mean the taxable income resulting to the controlled taxpayer by reason of the particular contract, transaction, or arrangement the controlled taxpayer chose to make (even though such contract, transaction, or arrangement is legally binding upon the parties thereto).
(10)
Uncontrolled comparable
means the uncontrolled transaction or uncontrolled taxpayer that is compared with a controlled transaction or taxpayer under any applicable pricing methodology. Thus, for example, under the comparable profits method, an uncontrolled comparable is any uncontrolled taxpayer from which data is used to establish a comparable operating profit.
(j)
Effective dates
—(1) The regulations in this are generally effective for taxable years beginning after October 6, 1994.
(2) Taxpayers may elect to apply retroactively all of the provisions of these regulations for any open taxable year. Such election will be effective for the year of the election and all subsequent taxable years.
(3) Although these regulations are generally effective for taxable years as stated, the final sentence of section 482 (requiring that the income with respect to transfers or licenses of intangible property be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible) is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. For the period prior to the effective date of these regulations, the final sentence of section 482 must be applied using any reasonable method not inconsistent with the statute. The IRS considers a method that applies these regulations or their general principles to be a reasonable method.
(4) These regulations will not apply with respect to transfers made or licenses granted to foreign persons before November 17, 1985, or before August 17, 1986, for transfers or licenses to others. Nevertheless, they will apply with respect to transfers or licenses before such dates if, with respect to property transferred pursuant to an earlier and continuing transfer agreement, such property was not in existence or owned by the taxpayer on such date.
(5) The last sentences of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (c)(1) of this section and of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of § 1.482-5 apply for taxable years beginning on or after August 26, 2003.

§ 1.482-1T
Allocation of income and deductions among taxpayers (temporary).
(a) through (f)(2) [Reserved]. For further guidance see § 1.482-1(a) through (f)(2).
(i)
Compensation independent of the form or character of controlled transaction
—(A)
In general.
All value provided between controlled taxpayers in a controlled transaction requires an arm's length amount of compensation determined under the best method rule of § 1.482-1(c). Such amount must be consistent with, and must account for all of, the value provided between the parties in the transaction, without regard to the form or character of the
transaction. For this purpose, it is necessary to consider the entire arrangement between the parties, as determined by the contractual terms, whether written or imputed in accordance with the economic substance of the arrangement, in light of the actual conduct of the parties. See, e.g., § 1.482-1(d)(3)(ii)(B) (identifying contractual terms) and (f)(2)(ii)(A) (regarding reference to realistic alternatives).
(B)
Aggregation.
The combined effect of two or more separate transactions (whether before, during, or after the year under review), including for purposes of an analysis under multiple provisions of the Code or regulations, may be considered if the transactions, taken as a whole, are so interrelated that an aggregate analysis of the transactions provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result determined under the best method rule of § 1.482-1(c). Whether two or more transactions are evaluated separately or in the aggregate depends on the extent to which the transactions are economically interrelated and on the relative reliability of the measure of an arm's length result provided by an aggregate analysis of the transactions as compared to a separate analysis of each transaction. For example, consideration of the combined effect of two or more transactions may be appropriate to determine whether the overall compensation in the transactions is consistent with the value provided, including any synergies among items and services provided.
(C)
Coordinated best method analysis and evaluation.
Consistent with the principles of paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, a coordinated best method analysis and evaluation of two or more controlled transactions to which one or more provisions of the Code or regulations apply may be necessary to ensure that the overall value provided, including any synergies, is properly taken into account. A coordinated best method analysis would include a consistent consideration of the facts and circumstances of the functions performed, resources employed, and risks assumed in the relevant transactions, and a consistent measure of the arm's length results, for purposes of all relevant statutory and regulatory provisions.
(D)
Allocations of value.
In some cases, it may be necessary to allocate one or more portions of the arm's length result that was properly determined under a coordinated best method analysis described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(C) of this section. Any such allocation of the arm's length result determined under the coordinated best method analysis must be made using the method that, under the facts and circumstances, provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result for each allocated amount. For example, if the full value of compensation due in controlled transactions whose tax treatment is governed by multiple provisions of the Code or regulations has been most reliably determined on an aggregate basis, then that full value must be allocated in a manner that provides the most reliable measure of each allocated amount.
(E)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (f)(2)(i). For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (E), P is a domestic corporation, and S1, S2, and S3 are foreign corporations that are wholly owned by P.

# Example 1.
Aggregation of interrelated licensing, manufacturing, and selling activities.
P enters into a license agreement with S1 that permits S1 to use a proprietary manufacturing process and to sell the output from this process throughout a specified region. S1 uses the manufacturing process and sells its output to S2, which in turn resells the output to uncontrolled parties in the specified region. In evaluating whether the royalty paid by S1 to P is an arm's length amount, it may be appropriate to evaluate the royalty in combination with the transfer prices charged by S1 to S2 and the aggregate profits earned by S1 and S2 from the use of the manufacturing process and the sale to uncontrolled parties of the products produced by S1.

# Example 2.
Aggregation of interrelated manufacturing, marketing, and services activities.
S1 is the exclusive Country Z distributor of computers manufactured by P. S2 provides marketing services in connection with sales of P computers in Country Z and in this regard uses significant marketing intangibles provided by P. S3 administers the warranty program with respect to P computers in Country Z, including maintenance and repair services. In evaluating whether the transfer prices paid by S1 to P, the fees paid by S2 to
P for the use of P marketing intangibles, and the service fees earned by S2 and S3 are arm's length amounts, it would be appropriate to perform an aggregate analysis that considers the combined effects of these interrelated transactions if they are most reliably analyzed on an aggregated basis.

# Example 3.
Aggregation and reliability of comparable uncontrolled transactions.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2.
In addition, U1, U2, and U3 are uncontrolled taxpayers that carry out functions comparable to those of S1, S2, and S3, respectively, with respect to computers produced by unrelated manufacturers. R1, R2, and R3 constitute a controlled group of taxpayers (unrelated to the P controlled group) that carry out functions comparable to those of S1, S2, and S3 with respect to computers produced by their common parent. Prices charged to uncontrolled customers of the R group differ from the prices charged to customers of U1, U2, and U3. In determining whether the transactions of U1, U2, and U3, or the transactions of R1, R2, and R3, would provide a more reliable measure of the arm's length result, it is determined that the interrelated R group transactions are more reliable than the wholly independent transactions of U1, U2, and U3, given the interrelationship of the P group transactions.

# Example 4.
Non-aggregation of transactions that are not interrelated.
P enters into a license agreement with S1 that permits S1 to use a proprietary process for manufacturing product X and to sell product X to uncontrolled parties throughout a specified region. P also sells to S1 product Y, which is manufactured by P in the United States and unrelated to product X. Product Y is resold by S1 to uncontrolled parties in the specified region. There is no connection between product X and product Y other than the fact that they are both sold in the same specified region. In evaluating whether the royalty paid by S1 to P for the use of the manufacturing process for product X and the transfer prices charged for unrelated product Y are arm's length amounts, it would not be appropriate to consider the combined effects of these separate and unrelated transactions.

# Example 5.
Aggregation of interrelated patents.
P owns 10 individual patents that, in combination, can be used to manufacture and sell a successful product. P anticipates that it could earn profits of $25x from the patents based on a discounted cash flow analysis that provides a more reliable measure of the value of the patents exploited as a bundle rather than separately. P licenses all 10 patents to S1 to be exploited as a bundle. Evidence of uncontrolled licenses of similar individual patents indicates that, exploited separately, each license of each patent would warrant a price of $1x, implying a total price for the patents of $10x. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, in determining the arm's length royalty for the license of the bundle of patents, it would not be appropriate to use the uncontrolled licenses as comparables for the license of the bundle of patents, because, unlike the discounted cash flow analysis, the uncontrolled licenses considered separately do not reliably reflect the enhancement to value resulting from the interrelatedness of the 10 patents exploited as a bundle.

# Example 6.
Consideration of entire arrangement, including imputed contractual terms
—(i) P conducts a business (“Business”) from the United States, with a worldwide clientele, but until Date X has no foreign operations. The success of Business significantly depends on intangibles (including marketing, manufacturing, technological, and goodwill or going concern value intangibles, collectively the “IP”), as well as ongoing support activities performed by P (including related research and development, central marketing, manufacturing process enhancement, and oversight activities, collectively “Support”), to maintain and improve the IP and otherwise maximize the profitability of Business.
(ii) On Date X, Year 1, P contributes the foreign rights to conduct Business, including the foreign rights to the IP, to newly incorporated S1. S1, utilizing the IP of which it is now the owner, commences foreign operations consisting of local marketing, manufacturing, and back office activities in order to conduct and expand Business in the foreign market.
(iii) Later, on Date Y, Year 1, P and S1 enter into a cost sharing arrangement (“CSA”) to develop and exploit the rights to conduct the Business. Under the CSA, P is entitled to the U.S. rights to conduct the Business, and S1 is entitled to the rest-of-the-world (“ROW”) rights to conduct the Business. P continues after Date Y to perform the Support, employing resources, capabilities, and rights that as a factual matter were not contributed to S1 in the Date X transaction, for the benefit of the Business worldwide. Pursuant to the CSA, P and S1 share the costs of P's Support in proportion to their reasonably anticipated benefit shares from their respective rights to the Business.
(iv) P treats the Date X transaction as a transfer described in section 351 that is subject to 367 and treats the Date Y transaction as the commencement of a CSA subject to section 482 and § 1.482-7. P takes the position that the only platform contribution transactions (“PCTs”) in connection with the Date Y CSA consist of P's contribution of the U.S. Business IP rights and S1's contribution of the ROW Business IP rights of which S1 had become the owner on account of the prior Date X transaction.
(v) Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, in determining whether an allocation of income is appropriate in Year 1 or
subsequent years, the Commissioner may consider the economic substance of the entire arrangement between P and S1, including the parties' actual conduct throughout their relationship, regardless of the form or character of the contractual arrangement the parties have expressly adopted. The Commissioner determines that the parties' formal arrangement fails to reflect the full scope of the value provided between the parties in accordance with the economic substance of their arrangement. Therefore, the Commissioner may impute one or more agreements between P and S1, consistent with the economic substance of their arrangement, that fully reflect their respective reasonably anticipated commitments in terms of functions performed, resources employed, and risks assumed over time. For example, because P continues after Date Y to perform the Support, employing resources, capabilities, and rights not contributed to S1, for the benefit of the Business worldwide, the Commissioner may impute another PCT on Date Y pursuant to which P commits to so continuing the Support. See § 1.482-7(b)(1)(ii). The taxpayer may present additional facts that could indicate whether this or another alternative agreement best reflects the economic substance of the underlying transactions and course of conduct, provided that the taxpayer's position fully reflects the value of the entire arrangement consistent with the realistic alternatives principle.

# Example 7.
Distinguishing provision of value from characterization
—(i) P developed a collection of resources, capabilities, and rights (“Collection”) that it uses on an interrelated basis in ongoing research and development of computer code that is used to create a successful line of software products. P can continue to use the Collection on such interrelated basis in the future to further develop computer code and, thus, further build on its successful line of software products. Under § 1.482-7(g)(2)(ix), P determines that the interquartile range of the net present value of its own use of the Collection in future research and development and software product marketing is between $1000x and $1100x, and this range provides the most reliable measure of the value to P of continuing to use the Collection on an interrelated basis in future research, development, and exploitation. Instead, P enters into an exchange described in section 351 in which it transfers certain intangible property related to the Collection to S1 for use in future research, development, and exploitation but continues to perform the same development functions that it did prior to the exchange, now on behalf of S1, under express or implied commitments in connection with S1's use of the intangible property. P takes the position that a portion of the Collection, consisting of computer code and related instruction manuals and similar intangible property (Portion 1), was transferrable intangible property and was the subject of the section 351 exchange and compensable under section 367(d). P claims that another portion of the Collection consists of items that either do not constitute property for purposes of section 367 or are not transferrable (Portion 2). P then takes the position that the value of Portion 2 does not give rise to income under section 367(d) or gain under section 367(a).
(ii) Under paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) and (C) of this section, any part of the value in Portion 2 that is not taken into account in an exchange under section 367 must nonetheless be evaluated under section 482 and the regulations thereunder to determine arm's length compensation for any value provided to S1. Accordingly, even if P's assertion that certain items were either not property or not capable of being transferred were correct, arm's length compensation is nonetheless required for all of the value associated with P's contributions under the section 482 regulations. Alternatively, the Commissioner may determine under all the facts and circumstances that P's assertion is incorrect and that the transaction in fact constitutes an exchange of property subject to, and therefore to be taken into account under, section 367. Thus, whether any item that P identifies as being within Portion 2 is properly characterized as property under section 367 (transferable or otherwise) is irrelevant because any value in Portion 2 that is provided to S1 must be compensated by S1 in a manner consistent with the $1000x to $1100x interquartile range of the overall value.

# Example 8.
Arm's length compensation for equivalent provisions of intangibles under sections 351 and 482.
P owns the worldwide rights to manufacturing and marketing intangibles that it uses to manufacture and market a product in the United States (“US intangibles”) and the rest of the world (“ROW intangibles”). P transfers all the ROW intangibles to S1 in an exchange described in section 351 and retains the US intangibles. Immediately after the exchange, P and S1 entered into a CSA described in § 1.482-7(b) that covers all research and development of intangibles conducted by the parties. A realistic alternative that was available to P and that would have involved the controlled parties performing similar functions, employing similar resources, and assuming similar risks as in the controlled transaction, was to transfer all ROW intangibles to S1 upon entering into the CSA in a platform contribution transaction described in § 1.482-7(c), rather than in an exchange described in section 351 immediately before entering into the CSA. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the arm's length compensation for the ROW intangibles must correspond to the
value provided between the parties, regardless of the form of the transaction. Accordingly, the arm's length compensation for the ROW intangibles is the same in both scenarios, and the analysis of the amount to be taken into account under section 367(d) pursuant to §§ 1.367(d)-1T(c) and 1.482-4 should include consideration of the amount that P would have charged for the realistic alternative determined under § 1.482-7(g) (and § 1.482-4, to the extent of any make-or-sell rights transferred). See §§ 1.482-1(b)(2)(iii) and 1.482-4(g).

# Example 9.
Aggregation of interrelated manufacturing and marketing intangibles governed by different statutes and regulations.
The facts are the same as in
Example 8
except that P transfers only the ROW intangibles related to manufacturing to S1 in an exchange described in section 351 and, upon entering into the CSA, then transfers the ROW intangibles related to marketing to S1 in a platform contribution transaction described in § 1.482-7(c) (rather than transferring all ROW intangibles only upon entering into the CSA or only in a prior exchange described in section 351). The value of the ROW intangibles that P transferred in the two transactions is greater in the aggregate, due to synergies among the different types of ROW intangibles, than if valued as two separate transactions. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the arm's length standard requires these synergies to be taken into account in determining the arm's length results for the transactions.

# Example 10.
Services provided using intangibles.
—(i) P's worldwide group produces and markets Product X and subsequent generations of products, which result from research and development performed by P's R
D Team. Through this collaboration with respect to P's proprietary products, the members of the R
D Team have individually and as a group acquired specialized knowledge and expertise subject to non-disclosure agreements (collectively, “knowhow”).
(ii) P arranges for the R
D Team to provide research and development services to create a new line of products, building on the Product X platform, to be owned and exploited by S1 in the overseas market. P asserts that the arm's length charge for the services is only reimbursement to P of its associated R
D Team compensation costs.
(iii) Even though P did not transfer the platform or the R
D Team to S1, P is providing value associated with the use of the platform, along with the value associated with the use of the knowhow, to S1 by way of the services performed by the R
D Team for S1 using the platform and the knowhow. The R
D Team's use of intangible property, and any other valuable resources, in P's provision of services (regardless of whether the service effects a transfer of intangible property or valuable resources and regardless of whether the property is relatively high or low value) must be evaluated under the section 482 regulations, including the regulations specifically applicable to controlled services transactions in § 1.482-9, to ensure that P receives arm's length compensation for any value (attributable to such property or services) provided to S1 in a controlled transaction. See §§ 1.482-4 and 1.482-9(m). Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the arm's length compensation for the services performed by the R
D Team for S1 must be consistent with the value provided to S1, including the value of the knowhow and any synergies with the platform. Under paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, the best method analysis may determine that the compensation is most reliably determined on an aggregate basis reflecting the interrelated value of the services and embedded value of the platform and knowhow.
(iv) In the alternative, the facts are the same as above, except that P assigns to S1 all or a pertinent portion of the R
D Team and the relevant rights in the platform. P takes the position that, although the transferred platform rights must be compensated, the knowhow does not have substantial value independent of the services of any individual on the R
D Team and therefore is not an intangible within the meaning of § 1.482-4(b). In P's view, S1 owes no compensation to P on account of the R
D Team, as S1 will directly bear the cost of the relevant R
D Team compensation. However, in assembling and arranging to assign the relevant R
D Team, and thereby making available the value of the knowhow to S1, rather than other employees without the knowhow, P is performing services for S1 under imputed contractual terms based on the parties' course of conduct. Therefore, even if P's position were correct that the knowhow is not an intangible under § 1.482-4(b), a position that the Commissioner may challenge, arm's length compensation is required for all of the value that P provides to S1 through the interrelated provision of platform rights, knowhow, and services under paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.

# Example 11.
Allocating arm's length compensation determined under an aggregate analysis
—(i) P provides services to S1, which is incorporated in Country A. In connection with those services, P licenses intellectual property to S2, which is incorporated in Country B. S2 sublicenses the intellectual property to S1.
(ii) Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, if an aggregate analysis of the service and license transactions provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result, then an aggregate analysis must be performed. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(D) of this section, if an allocation of the value that results from such an aggregate analysis is necessary, for example, for purposes of sourcing
the services income that P receives from S1 or determining deductible expenses incurred by S1, then the value determined under the aggregate analysis must be allocated using the method that provides the most reliable measure of the services income and deductible expenses.
(ii)(A) [Reserved]. For further guidance see § 1.482-1(f)(2)(ii)(A).
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates this paragraph (f)(2)(ii):

# Example.
P and S are controlled taxpayers. P licenses a proprietary process to S for S's use in manufacturing product X. Using its sales and marketing employees, S sells product X to related and unrelated customers outside the United States. If the license between P and S has economic substance, the Commissioner ordinarily will not restructure the taxpayer's transaction to treat P as if it had elected to exploit directly the manufacturing process. However, because P could have directly exploited the manufacturing process and manufactured product X itself, this realistic alternative may be taken into account under § 1.482-4(d) in determining the arm's length consideration for the controlled transaction. For examples of such an analysis, see
Examples 7
and

in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(E) of this section and the

§ 1.482-2
Determination of taxable income in specific situations.
(a)
Loans or advances
—(1)
Interest on bona fide indebtedness
—(i)
In general.
Where one member of a group of controlled entities makes a loan or advance directly or indirectly to, or otherwise becomes a creditor of, another member of such group and either charges no interest, or charges interest at a rate which is not equal to an arm's length rate of interest (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) with respect to such loan or advance, the district director may make appropriate allocations to reflect an arm's length rate of interest for the use of such loan or advance.
(ii)
Application of paragraph (a) of this section
—(A)
Interest on bona fide indebtedness.
Paragraph (a) of this section applies only to determine the appropriateness of the rate of interest charged on the principal amount of a bona fide indebtedness between members of a group of controlled entities, including—
(
1
) Loans or advances of money or other consideration (whether or not evidenced by a written instrument); and
(
2
) Indebtedness arising in the ordinary course of business from sales, leases, or the rendition of services by or between members of the group, or any other similar extension of credit.
(B)
Alleged indebtedness.
This paragraph (a) does not apply to so much of an alleged indebtedness which is not in fact a bona fide indebtedness, even if the stated rate of interest thereon would be within the safe haven rates prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. For example, paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to payments with respect to all or a portion of such alleged indebtedness where in fact all or a portion of an alleged indebtedness is a contribution to the capital of a corporation or a distribution by a corporation with respect to its shares. Similarly, this paragraph (a) does not apply to payments with respect to an alleged purchase-money debt instrument given in consideration for an alleged sale of property between two controlled entities where in fact the transaction constitutes a lease of the property. Payments made with respect to alleged indebtedness (including alleged stated interest thereon) shall be treated according to their substance. See § 1.482-2(a)(3)(i).
(iii)
Period for which interest shall be charged
—(A)
General rule.
This paragraph (a)(1)(iii) is effective for indebtedness arising after June 30, 1988. See § 1.482-2(a)(3) (26 CFR Part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1988) for indebtedness arising before July 1, 1988. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(B) through (E) of this section, the period for which interest shall be
charged with respect to a bona fide indebtedness between controlled entities begins on the day after the day the indebtedness arises and ends on the day the indebtedness is satisfied (whether by payment, offset, cancellation, or otherwise). Paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(B) through (E) of this section provide certain alternative periods during which interest is not required to be charged on certain indebtedness. These exceptions apply only to indebtedness described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A)(2) of this section (relating to indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business from sales, services, etc., between members of the group) and not evidenced by a written instrument requiring the payment of interest. Such amounts are hereinafter referred to as intercompany trade receivables. The period for which interest is not required to be charged on intercompany trade receivables under this paragraph (a)(1)(iii) is called the interest-free period. In general, an intercompany trade receivable arises at the time economic performance occurs (within the meaning of section 461(h) and the regulations thereunder) with respect to the underlying transaction between controlled entities. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(iii), the term United States includes any possession of the United States, and the term foreign country excludes any possession of the United States.
(B)
Exception for certain intercompany transactions in the ordinary course of business.
Interest is not required to be charged on an intercompany trade receivable until the first day of the third calendar month following the month in which the intercompany trade receivable arises.
(C)
Exception for trade or business of debtor member located outside the United States.
In the case of an intercompany trade receivable arising from a transaction in the ordinary course of a trade or business which is actively conducted outside the United States by the debtor member, interest is not required to be charged until the first day of the fourth calendar month following the month in which such intercompany trade receivable arises.
(D)
Exception for regular trade practice of creditor member or others in creditor's industry.
If the creditor member or unrelated persons in the creditor member's industry, as a regular trade practice, allow unrelated parties a longer period without charging interest than that described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section (whichever is applicable) with respect to transactions which are similar to transactions that give rise to intercompany trade receivables, such longer interest-free period shall be allowed with respect to a comparable amount of intercompany trade receivables.
(E)
Exception for property purchased for resale in a foreign country—(1) General rule.
If in the ordinary course of business one member of the group (related purchaser) purchases property from another member of the group (related seller) for resale to unrelated persons located in a particular foreign country, the related purchaser and the related seller may use as the interest-free period for the intercompany trade receivables arising during the related seller's taxable year from the purchase of such property within the same product group an interest-free period equal the sum of—
(
i
) The number of days in the related purchaser's average collection period (as determined under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(
2
) of this section) for sales of property within the same product group sold in the ordinary course of business to unrelated persons located in the same foreign country; plus
(
ii
) Ten (10) calendar days.
(
2
)
Interest-free period.
The interest-free period under this paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E), however, shall in no event exceed 183 days. The related purchaser does not have to conduct business outside the United States in order to be eligible to use the interest-free period of this paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E). The interest-free period under this paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E) shall not apply to intercompany trade receivables attributable to property which is manufactured, produced, or constructed (within the meaning of § 1.954-3(a)(4)) by the related purchaser. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E) a product group includes all products within the same three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code (as prepared by the
Statistical Policy Division of the Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President.)
(
3
)
Average collection period.
An average collection period for purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E) is determined as follows—
(
i
)
Step 1.
Determine total sales (less returns and allowances) by the related purchaser in the product group to unrelated persons located in the same foreign country during the related purchaser's last taxable year ending on or before the first day of the related seller's taxable year in which the intercompany trade receivable arises.
(
ii
)
Step 2.
Determine the related purchaser's average month-end accounts receivable balance with respect to sales described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(
2
)(
i
) of this section for the related purchaser's last taxable year ending on or before the first day of the related seller's taxable year in which the intercompany trade receivable arises.
(
iii
)
Step 3.
Compute a receivables turnover rate by dividing the total sales amount described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(
2
)(
i
) of this section by the average receivables balance described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section.
(
iv
)
Step 4.
Divide the receivables turnover rate determined under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(
2
)(
iii
) of this section into 365, and round the result to the nearest whole number to determine the number of days in the average collection period.
(
v
)
Other considerations.
If the related purchaser makes sales in more than one foreign country, or sells property in more than one product group in any foreign country, separate computations of an average collection period, by product group within each country, are required. If the related purchaser resells fungible property in more than one foreign country and the intercompany trade receivables arising from the related party purchase of such fungible property cannot reasonably be identified with resales in particular foreign countries, then solely for the purpose of assigning an interest-free period to such intercompany trade receivables under this paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E), an amount of each such intercompany trade receivable shall be treated as allocable to a particular foreign country in the same proportion that the related purchaser's sales of such fungible property in such foreign country during the period described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(2)(i) of this section bears to the related purchaser's sales of all such fungible property in all such foreign countries during such period. An interest-free period under this paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E) shall not apply to any intercompany trade receivables arising in a taxable year of the related seller if the related purchaser made no sales described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(2)(i) of this section from which the appropriate interest-free period may be determined.

Illustration.
The interest-free period provided under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
X and Y use the calendar year as the taxable year and are members of the same group of controlled entities within the meaning of section 482. For Y's 1988 calendar taxable year X and Y intend to use the interest-free period determined under this paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E) for intercompany trade receivables attributable to X's purchases of certain products from Y for resale by X in the ordinary course of business to unrelated persons in country Z. For its 1987 calendar taxable year all of X's sales in country Z were of products within a single product group based upon a three-digit SIC code, were not manufactured, produced, or constructed (within the meaning of § 1.954-3(a)(4)) by X, and were sold in the ordinary course of X's trade or business to unrelated persons located only in country Z. These sales and the month-end accounts receivable balances (for such sales and for such sales uncollected from prior months) are as follows:

(ii)
Average collection period.
X's total sales within the same product group to unrelated persons within country Z for the period are $6,200,000. The average receivables balance for the period is $2,805,430 ($33,665,160/12). The average collection period in whole days is determined as follows:
ER08JY94.000
ER08JY94.001
(iii)
Interest-free period.
Accordingly, for intercompany trade receivables incurred by X during Y's 1988 calendar taxable year attributable to the purchase of property from Y for resale to unrelated persons located in country Z and included in the product group, X may use an interest-free period of 175 days (165 days in the average collection period plus 10 days, but not in excess of a maximum of 183 days). All other intercompany trade receivables incurred by X are subject to the interest-free periods described in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) (B), (C), or (D), whichever are applicable. If X makes sales in other foreign countries in addition to country Z or makes sales of property in more than one product group in any foreign country, separate computations of X's average collection period, by product group within each country, are required in order for X and Y to determine an interest-free period for such product groups in such foreign countries under this paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E).
(iv)
Payment; book entries
—(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(1)(iv), in determining the period of time for which an amount owed by one member of the group to another member is outstanding, payments or other credits to an account are considered to be applied against the earliest amount outstanding, that is, payments or credits are applied against amounts in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. Thus, tracing payments to individual intercompany trade receivables is generally not required in order to determine whether a particular intercompany trade receivable has been paid within the applicable interest-free period determined under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section. The application of this paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
X and Y are members of a group of controlled entities within the meaning of section 482. Assume that the balance of intercompany trade receivables owed by X to Y on June 1 is $100, and that all of the $100 balance represents amounts incurred by X to Y during the month of May. During the month of June X incurs an additional $200 of intercompany trade receivables to Y. Assume that on July 15, $60 is properly credited against X's intercompany account to Y, and that $240 is properly credited against the intercompany account on August 31. Assume that under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(B) of this section interest must be charged on X's intercompany trade receivables to Y beginning with the first day of the third calendar month following the month the intercompany trade receivables arise, and that no alternative interest-free period applies. Thus, the interest-free period for intercompany trade receivables incurred during the month of May ends on July 31, and the interest-free period for intercompany trade receivables incurred during the month of June ends on August 31.
(ii)
Application of payments.
Using a FIFO payment order, the aggregate payments of $300 are applied first to the opening June balance, and then to the additional amounts incurred during the month of June. With respect to X's June opening balance of $100, no interest is required to be accrued on $60 of such balance paid by X on July 15, because such portion was paid within its interest-free period. Interest for 31 days, from August 1 to August 31 inclusive, is required to be accrued on the $40 portion of the opening balance not paid until August 31. No interest is required to be accrued on the $200 of intercompany trade receivables X incurred to Y during June because the $240 credited on August 31, after eliminating the $40 of indebtedness remaining from periods before June, also eliminated the $200 incurred by X during June prior to the end of the interest-free period for that amount. The amount of interest incurred by X to Y on the $40 amount during
August creates bona fide indebtedness between controlled entities and is subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section without regard to any of the exceptions contained in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(B) through (E).
(B) Notwithstanding the first-in, first-out payment application rule described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, the taxpayer may apply payments or credits against amounts owed in some other order on its books in accordance with an agreement or understanding of the related parties if the taxpayer can demonstrate that either it or others in its industry, as a regular trade practice, enter into such agreements or understandings in the case of similar balances with unrelated parties.
(2)
Arm's length interest rate
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 482 and paragraph (a) of this section, an arm's length rate of interest shall be a rate of interest which was charged, or would have been charged, at the time the indebtedness arose, in independent transactions with or between unrelated parties under similar circumstances. All relevant factors shall be considered, including the principal amount and duration of the loan, the security involved, the credit standing of the borrower, and the interest rate prevailing at the situs of the lender or creditor for comparable loans between unrelated parties.
(ii)
Funds obtained at situs of borrower.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the loan or advance represents the proceeds of a loan obtained by the lender at the situs of the borrower, the arm's length rate for any taxable year shall be equal to the rate actually paid by the lender increased by an amount which reflects the costs or deductions incurred by the lender in borrowing such amounts and making such loans, unless the taxpayer establishes a more appropriate rate under the standards set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Safe haven interest rates for certain loans and advances made after May 8, 1986
—(A)
Applicability
—(
1
)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) applies with respect to the rate of interest charged and to the amount of interest paid or accrued in any taxable year—
(
i
) Under a term loan or advance between members of a group of controlled entities where (except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section) the loan or advance is entered into after May 8, 1986; and
(
ii
) After May 8, 1986 under a demand loan or advance between such controlled entities.
(
2
)
Grandfather rule for existing loans.
The safe haven rates prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section shall not apply, and the safe haven rates prescribed in § 1.482-2(a)(2)(iii) (26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1985), shall apply to—
(
i
) Term loans or advances made before May 9, 1986; and
(
ii
) Term loans or advances made before August 7, 1986, pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before May 9, 1986.
(B)
Safe haven interest rate based on applicable Federal rate.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2), in the case of a loan or advance between members of a group of controlled entities, an arm's length rate of interest referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section shall be for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code—
(
1
) The rate of interest actually charged if that rate is—
(
i
) Not less than 100 percent of the applicable Federal rate (lower limit); and
(
ii
) Not greater than 130 percent of the applicable Federal rate (upper limit); or
(
2
) If either no interest is charged or if the rate of interest charged is less than the lower limit, then an arm's length rate of interest shall be equal to the lower limit, compounded semiannually; or
(
3
) If the rate of interest charged is greater than the upper limit, then an arm's length rate of interest shall be equal to the upper limit, compounded semiannually, unless the taxpayer establishes a more appropriate compound rate of interest under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. However, if the compound rate of interest actually charged is greater than the upper limit and less than the rate determined
under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, or if the compound rate actually charged is less than the lower limit and greater than the rate determined under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, then the compound rate actually charged shall be deemed to be an arm's length rate under paragraph (a)(2)(i). In the case of any sale-leaseback described in section 1274(e), the lower limit shall be 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate, compounded semiannually.
(C)
Applicable Federal rate.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the term applicable Federal rate means, in the case of a loan or advance to which this section applies and having a term of—
(
1
) Not over 3 years, the Federal short-term rate;
(
2
) Over 3 years but not over 9 years, the Federal mid-term rate; or
(
3
) Over 9 years, the Federal long-term rate, as determined under section 1274(d) in effect on the date such loan or advance is made. In the case of any sale or exchange between controlled entities, the lower limit shall be the lowest of the applicable Federal rates in effect for any month in the 3-calendar- month period ending with the first calendar month in which there is a binding written contract in effect for such sale or exchange (lowest 3-month rate, as defined in section 1274(d)(2)). In the case of a demand loan or advance to which this section applies, the applicable Federal rate means the Federal short-term rate determined under section 1274(d) (determined without regard to the lowest 3-month short term rate determined under section 1274(d)(2)) in effect for each day on which any amount of such loan or advance (including unpaid accrued interest determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section) is outstanding.
(D)
Lender in business of making loans.
If the lender in a loan or advance transaction to which paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies is regularly engaged in the trade or business of making loans or advances to unrelated parties, the safe haven rates prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section shall not apply, and the arm's length interest rate to be used shall be determined under the standards described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, including reference to the interest rates charged in such trade or business by the lender on loans or advances of a similar type made to unrelated parties at and about the time the loan or advance to which paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies was made.
(E)
Foreign currency loans.
The safe haven interest rates prescribed in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section do not apply to any loan or advance the principal or interest of which is expressed in a currency other than U.S. dollars.
(3)
Coordination with interest adjustments required under certain other Code sections.
If the stated rate of interest on the stated principal amount of a loan or advance between controlled entities is subject to adjustment under section 482 and is also subject to adjustment under any other section of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 467, 483, 1274 or 7872), section 482 and paragraph (a) of this section may be applied to such loan or advance in addition to such other Internal Revenue Code section. After the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1964, Pub. L. 98-369, and the enactment of Pub. L. 99-121, such other Internal Revenue Code sections include sections 467, 483, 1274 and 7872. The order in which the different provisions shall be applied is as follows—
(i) First, the substance of the transaction shall be determined; for this purpose, all the relevant facts and circumstances shall be considered and any law or rule of law (assignment of income, step transaction, etc.) may apply. Only the rate of interest with respect to the stated principal amount of the bona fide indebtedness (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section), if any, shall be subject to adjustment under section 482, paragraph (a) of this section, and any other Internal Revenue Code section.
(ii) Second, the other Internal Revenue Code section shall be applied to the loan or advance to determine whether any amount other than stated interest is to be treated as interest, and if so, to determine such amount according to the provisions of such other Internal Revenue Code section.
(iii) Third, whether or not the other Internal Revenue Code section applies
to adjust the amounts treated as interest under such loan or advance, section 482 and paragraph (a) of this section may then be applied by the district director to determine whether the rate of interest charged on the loan or advance, as adjusted by any other Code section, is greater or less than an arm's length rate of interest, and if so, to make appropriate allocations to reflect an arm's length rate of interest.
(iv) Fourth, section 482 and paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section and §§ 1.482-3 through 1.482-7, if applicable, may be applied by the district director to make any appropriate allocations, other than an interest rate adjustment, to reflect an arm's length transaction based upon the principal amount of the loan or advance and the interest rate as adjusted under paragraph (a)(3) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this section. For example, assume that two commonly controlled taxpayers enter into a deferred payment sale of tangible property and no interest is provided, and assume also that section 483 is applied to treat a portion of the stated sales price as interest, thereby reducing the stated sales price. If after this recharacterization of a portion of the stated sales price as interest, the recomputed sales price does not reflect an arm's length sales price under the principles of § 1.482-3, the district director may make other appropriate allocations (other than an interest rate adjustment) to reflect an arm's length sales price.
(4)
Examples.
The principles of paragraph (a)(3) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
An individual, A, transfers $20,000 to a corporation controlled by A in exchange for the corporation's note which bears adequate stated interest. The district director recharacterizes the transaction as a contribution to the capital of the corporation in exchange for preferred stock. Under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, section 1.482-2(a) does not apply to the transaction because there is no bona fide indebtedness.

# Example 2.
B, an individual, is an employee of Z corporation, and is also the controlling shareholder of Z. Z makes a term loan of $15,000 to B at a rate of interest that is less than the applicable Federal rate. In this instance the other operative Code section is section 7872. Under section 7872(b), the difference between the amount loaned and the present value of all payments due under the loan using a discount rate equal to 100 percent of the applicable Federal rate is treated as an amount of cash transferred from the corporation to B and the loan is treated as having original issue discount equal to such amount. Under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, section 482 and paragraph (a) of this section may also be applied by the district director to determine if the rate of interest charged on this $15,000 loan (100 percent of the AFR, compounded semiannually, as adjusted by section 7872) is an arm's length rate of interest. Because the rate of interest on the loan, as adjusted by section 7872, is within the safe haven range of 100-130 percent of the AFR, compounded semiannually, no further interest rate adjustments under section 482 and paragraph (a) of this section will be made to this loan.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that the amount lent by Z to B is $9,000, and that amount is the aggregate outstanding amount of loans between Z and B. Under the $10,000 de minimis exception of section 7872(c)(3), no adjustment for interest will be made to this $9,000 loan under section 7872. Under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, the district director may apply section 482 and paragraph (a) of this section to this $9,000 loan to determine whether the rate of interest charged is less than an arm's length rate of interest, and if so, to make appropriate allocations to reflect an arm's length rate of interest.

# Example 4.
X and Y are commonly controlled taxpayers. At a time when the applicable Federal rate is 12 percent, compounded semiannually, X sells property to Y in exchange for a note with a stated rate of interest of 18 percent, compounded semiannually. Assume that the other applicable Code section to the transaction is section 483. Section 483 does not apply to this transaction because, under section 483(d), there is no total unstated interest under the contract using the test rate of interest equal to 100 percent of the applicable Federal rate. Under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, section 482 and paragraph (a) of this section may be applied by the district director to determine whether the rate of interest under the note is excessive, that is, to determine whether the 18 percent stated interest rate under the note exceeds an arm's length rate of interest.

# Example 5.
Assume that A and B are commonly controlled taxpayers and that the applicable Federal rate is 10 percent, compounded semiannually. On June 30, 1986, A sells property to B and receives in exchange B's purchase-money note in the amount of $2,000,000. The stated interest rate on the note is 9%, compounded semiannually, and the stated redemption price at maturity on the note is $2,000,000. Assume that the other applicable Code section to this transaction is section 1274. As provided in section 1274A(a)
and (b), the discount rate for purposes of section 1274 will be nine percent, compounded semiannually, because the stated principal amount of B's note does not exceed $2,800,000. Section 1274 does not apply to this transaction because there is adequate stated interest on the debt instrument using a discount rate equal to 9%, compounded semiannually, and the stated redemption price at maturity does not exceed the stated principal amount. Under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, the district director may apply section 482 and paragraph (a) of this section to this $2,000,000 note to determine whether the 9% rate of interest charged is less than an arm's length rate of interest, and if so, to make appropriate allocations to reflect an arm's length rate of interest.
(b)
Rendering of services.
For rules governing allocations under section 482 to reflect an arm's length charge for controlled transactions involving the rendering of services,
see
§ 1.482-9.
(c)
Use of tangible property
—(1)
General rule.
Where possession, use, or occupancy of tangible property owned or leased by one member of a group of controlled entities (referred to in this paragraph as the owner) is transferred by lease or other arrangement to another member of such group (referred to in this paragraph as the user) without charge or at a charge which is not equal to an arm's length rental charge (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) the district director may make appropriate allocations to properly reflect such arm's length charge. Where possession, use, or occupancy of only a portion of such property is transferred, the determination of the arm's length charge and the allocation shall be made with reference to the portion transferred.
(2)
Arm's length charge
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, an arm's length rental charge shall be the amount of rent which was charged, or would have been charged for the use of the same or similar property, during the time it was in use, in independent transactions with or between unrelated parties under similar circumstances considering the period and location of the use, the owner's investment in the property or rent paid for the property, expenses of maintaining the property, the type of property involved, its condition, and all other relevant facts.
(ii)
Safe haven rental charge.
See § 1.482-2(c)(2)(ii) (26 CFR Part 1 revised as of April 1, 1985), for the determination of safe haven rental charges in the case of certain leases entered into before May 9, 1986, and for leases entered into before August 7, 1986, pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before May 9, 1986.
(iii)
Subleases
—(A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, where possession, use, or occupancy of tangible property, which is leased by the owner (lessee) from an unrelated party is transferred by sublease or other arrangement to the user, an arm's length rental charge shall be considered to be equal to all the deductions claimed by the owner (lessee) which are attributable to the property for the period such property is used by the user. Where only a portion of such property was transferred, any allocations shall be made with reference to the portion transferred. The deductions to be considered include the rent paid or accrued by the owner (lessee) during the period of use and all other deductions directly and indirectly connected with the property paid or accrued by the owner (lessee) during such period. Such deductions include deductions for maintenance and repair, utilities, management and other similar deductions.
(B) The provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall not apply if either—
(
1
) The taxpayer establishes a more appropriate rental charge under the general rule set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; or
(
2
) During the taxable year, the owner (lessee) or the user was regularly engaged in the trade or business of renting property of the same general type as the property in question to unrelated persons.
(d)
Transfer of property.
For rules governing allocations under section 482 to reflect an arm's length consideration for controlled transactions involving the transfer of property, see §§ 1.482-3 through 1.482-6.
(e)
Cost sharing arrangement.
For rules governing allocations under section 482 to reflect an arm's length consideration for controlled transactions involving a cost sharing arrangement, see § 1.482-7.
(f)
Effective/applicability date
—(1)
In general.
The provision of paragraph (b) of this section is generally applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006. The provision of paragraph (e) of this section is generally applicable on January 5, 2009.
(2)
Election to apply paragraph (b) to earlier taxable years.
A person may elect to apply the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section to earlier taxable years in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.482-9(n)(2).
[T.D. 8552, 59 FR 35002, July 8, 1994; 60 FR 16381, 16382, Mar. 30, 1995; T.D. 9278, 71 FR 44484, Aug. 4, 2006; T.D. 9456, 74 FR 38842, Aug. 4, 2009; T.D. 9568, 76 FR 80090, Dec. 22, 2011]
§ 1.482-3
Methods to determine taxable income in connection with a transfer of tangible property.
(a)
In general.
The arm's length amount charged in a controlled transfer of tangible property must be determined under one of the six methods listed in this paragraph (a). Each of the methods must be applied in accordance with all of the provisions of § 1.482-1, including the best method rule of § 1.482-1(c), the comparability analysis of § 1.482-1(d), and the arm's length range of § 1.482-1(e). The methods are—
(1) The comparable uncontrolled price method, described in paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) The resale price method, described in paragraph (c) of this section;
(3) The cost plus method, described in paragraph (d) of this section;
(4) The comparable profits method, described in § 1.482-5;
(5) The profit split method, described in § 1.482-6; and
(6) Unspecified methods, described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Comparable uncontrolled price method
—(1)
In general.
The comparable uncontrolled price method evaluates whether the amount charged in a controlled transaction is arm's length by reference to the amount charged in a comparable uncontrolled transaction.
(2)
Comparability and reliability considerations
—(i)
In general.
Whether results derived from applications of this method are the most reliable measure of the arm's length result must be determined using the factors described under the best method rule in § 1.482-1(c). The application of these factors under the comparable uncontrolled price method is discussed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
(ii)
Comparability
—(A)
In general.
The degree of comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions is determined by applying the provisions of § 1.482-1(d). Although all of the factors described in § 1.482-1(d)(3) must be considered, similarity of products generally will have the greatest effect on comparability under this method. In addition, because even minor differences in contractual terms or economic conditions could materially affect the amount charged in an uncontrolled transaction, comparability under this method depends on close similarity with respect to these factors, or adjustments to account for any differences. The results derived from applying the comparable uncontrolled price method generally will be the most direct and reliable measure of an arm's length price for the controlled transaction if an uncontrolled transaction has no differences with the controlled transaction that would affect the price, or if there are only minor differences that have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on price and for which appropriate adjustments are made. If such adjustments cannot be made, or if there are more than minor differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, the comparable uncontrolled price method may be used, but the reliability of the results as a measure of the arm's length price will be reduced. Further, if there are material product differences for which reliable adjustments cannot be made, this method ordinarily will not provide a reliable measure of an arm's length result.
(B)
Adjustments for differences between controlled and uncontrolled transactions.
If there are differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions that would affect price, adjustments should be made to the price of the uncontrolled transaction according to the comparability provisions of § 1.482-1(d)(2). Specific examples of the factors that may be particularly relevant to this method include—
(
1
) Quality of the product;
(
2
) Contractual terms (e.g., scope and terms of warranties provided, sales or purchase volume, credit terms, transport terms);
(
3
) Level of the market (i.e., wholesale, retail, etc.);
(
4
) Geographic market in which the transaction takes place;
(
5
) Date of the transaction;
(
6
) Intangible property associated with the sale;
(
7
) Foreign currency risks; and
(
8
) Alternatives realistically available to the buyer and seller.
(iii)
Data and assumptions.
The reliability of the results derived from the comparable uncontrolled price method is affected by the completeness and accuracy of the data used and the reliability of the assumptions made to apply the method. See § 1.482-1(c) (Best method rule).
(3)
Arm's length range.
See § 1.482-1(e)(2) for the determination of an arm's length range.
(4)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Comparable Sales of Same Product.
USM, a U.S. manufacturer, sells the same product to both controlled and uncontrolled distributors. The circumstances surrounding the controlled and uncontrolled transactions are substantially the same, except that the controlled sales price is a delivered price and the uncontrolled sales are made f.o.b. USM's factory. Differences in the contractual terms of transportation and insurance generally have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on price, and adjustments are made to the results of the uncontrolled transaction to account for such differences. No other material difference has been identified between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions. Because USM sells in both the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, it is likely that all material differences between the two transactions have been identified. In addition, because the comparable uncontrolled price method is applied to an uncontrolled comparable with no product differences, and there are only minor contractual differences that have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on price, the results of this application of the comparable uncontrolled price method will provide the most direct and reliable measure of an arm's length result. See § 1.482-3(b)(2)(ii)(A).

# Example 2. Effect of Trademark.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that USM affixes its valuable trademark to the property sold in the controlled transactions, but does not affix its trademark to the property sold in the uncontrolled transactions. Under the facts of this case, the effect on price of the trademark is material and cannot be reliably estimated. Because there are material product differences for which reliable adjustments cannot be made, the comparable uncontrolled price method is unlikely to provide a reliable measure of the arm's length result. See § 1.482-3(b)(2)(ii)(A).

# Example 3. Minor Product Differences.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that USM, which manufactures business machines, makes minor modifications to the physical properties of the machines to satisfy specific requirements of a customer in controlled sales, but does not make these modifications in uncontrolled sales. If the minor physical differences in the product have a material effect on prices, adjustments to account for these differences must be made to the results of the uncontrolled transactions according to the provisions of § 1.482- 1(d)(2), and such adjusted results may be used as a measure of the arm's length result.

# Example 4. Effect of Geographic Differences.
FM, a foreign specialty radio manufacturer, sells its radios to a controlled U.S. distributor, AM, that serves the West Coast of the United States. FM sells its radios to uncontrolled distributors to serve other regions in the United States. The product in the controlled and uncontrolled transactions is the same, and all other circumstances surrounding the controlled and uncontrolled transactions are substantially the same, other than the geographic differences. If the geographic differences are unlikely to have a material effect on price, or they have definite and reasonably ascertainable effects for which adjustments are made, then the adjusted results of the uncontrolled sales may be used under the comparable uncontrolled price method to establish an arm's length range pursuant to § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(A). If the effects of the geographic differences would be material but cannot be reliably ascertained, then the reliability of the results will be diminished. However, the comparable uncontrolled price method may still provide the most reliable measure of an arm's length result, pursuant to the best method rule of § 1.482-1(c), and, if so, an arm's length range may be established pursuant to § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(B).
(5)
Indirect evidence of comparable uncontrolled transactions
—(i)
In general.
A comparable uncontrolled price may be derived from data from public exchanges or quotation media, but only if the following requirements are met—
(A) The data is widely and routinely used in the ordinary course of business
in the industry to negotiate prices for uncontrolled sales;
(B) The data derived from public exchanges or quotation media is used to set prices in the controlled transaction in the same way it is used by uncontrolled taxpayers in the industry; and
(C) The amount charged in the controlled transaction is adjusted to reflect differences in product quality and quantity, contractual terms, transportation costs, market conditions, risks borne, and other factors that affect the price that would be agreed to by uncontrolled taxpayers.
(ii)
Limitation.
Use of data from public exchanges or quotation media may not be appropriate under extraordinary market conditions.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b)(5).

# Example 1. Use of Quotation Medium.
(i) On June 1, USOil, a United States corporation, enters into a contract to purchase crude oil from its foreign subsidiary, FS, in Country Z. USOil and FS agree to base their sales price on the average of the prices published for that crude in a quotation medium in the five days before August 1, the date set for delivery. USOil and FS agree to adjust the price for the particular circumstances of their transactions, including the quantity of the crude sold, contractual terms, transportation costs, risks borne, and other factors that affect the price.
(ii) The quotation medium used by USOil and FS is widely and routinely used in the ordinary course of business in the industry to establish prices for uncontrolled sales. Because USOil and FS use the data to set their sales price in the same way that unrelated parties use the data from the quotation medium to set their sales prices, and appropriate adjustments were made to account for differences, the price derived from the quotation medium used by USOil and FS to set their transfer prices will be considered evidence of a comparable uncontrolled price.

# Example 2. Extraordinary Market Conditions.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that before USOil and FS enter into their contract, war breaks out in Countries X and Y, major oil producing countries, causing significant instability in world petroleum markets. As a result, given the significant instability in the price of oil, the prices listed on the quotation medium may not reflect a reliable measure of an arm's length result. See § 1.482-3(b)(5)(ii).
(c)
Resale price method
—(1)
In general.
The resale price method evaluates whether the amount charged in a controlled transaction is arm's length by reference to the gross profit margin realized in comparable uncontrolled transactions. The resale price method measures the value of functions performed, and is ordinarily used in cases involving the purchase and resale of tangible property in which the reseller has not added substantial value to the tangible goods by physically altering the goods before resale. For this purpose, packaging, repackaging, labelling, or minor assembly do not ordinarily constitute physical alteration. Further the resale price method is not ordinarily used in cases where the controlled taxpayer uses its intangible property to add substantial value to the tangible goods.
(2)
Determination of arm's length price
—(i)
In general.
The resale price method measures an arm's length price by subtracting the appropriate gross profit from the applicable resale price for the property involved in the controlled transaction under review.
(ii)
Applicable resale price.
The applicable resale price is equal to either the resale price of the particular item of property involved or the price at which contemporaneous resales of the same property are made. If the property purchased in the controlled sale is resold to one or more related parties in a series of controlled sales before being resold in an uncontrolled sale, the applicable resale price is the price at which the property is resold to an uncontrolled party, or the price at which contemporaneous resales of the same property are made. In such case, the determination of the appropriate gross profit will take into account the functions of all members of the group participating in the series of controlled sales and final uncontrolled resales, as well as any other relevant factors described in § 1.482-1(d)(3).
(iii)
Appropriate gross profit.
The appropriate gross profit is computed by multiplying the applicable resale price by the gross profit margin (expressed as a percentage of total revenue derived from sales) earned in comparable uncontrolled transactions.
(iv)
Arm's length range.
See § 1.482-1(e)(2) for determination of the arm's length range.
(3)
Comparability and reliability considerations
—(i)
In general.
Whether results
derived from applications of this method are the most reliable measure of the arm's length result must be determined using the factors described under the best method rule in § 1.482-1(c). The application of these factors under the resale price method is discussed in paragraphs (c)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
(ii)
Comparability
—(A)
Functional comparability.
The degree of comparability between an uncontrolled transaction and a controlled transaction is determined by applying the comparability provisions of § 1.482-1(d). A reseller's gross profit provides compensation for the performance of resale functions related to the product or products under review, including an operating profit in return for the reseller's investment of capital and the assumption of risks. Therefore, although all of the factors described in § 1.482-1(d)(3) must be considered, comparability under this method is particularly dependent on similarity of functions performed, risks borne, and contractual terms, or adjustments to account for the effects of any such differences. If possible, appropriate gross profit margins should be derived from comparable uncontrolled purchases and resales of the reseller involved in the controlled sale, because similar characteristics are more likely to be found among different resales of property made by the same reseller than among sales made by other resellers. In the absence of comparable uncontrolled transactions involving the same reseller, an appropriate gross profit margin may be derived from comparable uncontrolled transactions of other resellers.
(B)
Other comparability factors.
Comparability under this method is less dependent on close physical similarity between the products transferred than under the comparable uncontrolled price method. For example, distributors of a wide variety of consumer durables might perform comparable distribution functions without regard to the specific durable goods distributed. Substantial differences in the products may, however, indicate significant functional differences between the controlled and uncontrolled taxpayers. Thus, it ordinarily would be expected that the controlled and uncontrolled transactions would involve the distribution of products of the same general type (e.g., consumer electronics). Furthermore, significant differences in the value of the distributed goods due, for example, to the value of a trademark, may also affect the reliability of the comparison. Finally, the reliability of profit measures based on gross profit may be adversely affected by factors that have less effect on prices. For example, gross profit may be affected by a variety of other factors, including cost structures (as reflected, for example, in the age of plant and equipment), business experience (such as whether the business is in a start-up phase or is mature), or management efficiency (as indicated, for example, by expanding or contracting sales or executive compensation over time). Accordingly, if material differences in these factors are identified based on objective evidence, the reliability of the analysis may be affected.
(C)
Adjustments for differences between controlled and uncontrolled transactions.
If there are material differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions that would affect the gross profit margin, adjustments should be made to the gross profit margin earned with respect to the uncontrolled transaction according to the comparability provisions of § 1.482-1(d)(2). For this purpose, consideration of operating expenses associated with functions performed and risks assumed may be necessary, because differences in functions performed are often reflected in operating expenses. If there are differences in functions performed, however, the effect on gross profit of such differences is not necessarily equal to the differences in the amount of related operating expenses. Specific examples of the factors that may be particularly relevant to this method include—
(
1
) Inventory levels and turnover rates, and corresponding risks, including any price protection programs offered by the manufacturer;
(
2
) Contractual terms (e.g., scope and terms of warranties provided, sales or purchase volume, credit terms, transport terms);
(
3
) Sales, marketing, advertising programs and services, (including promotional programs, rebates, and co-op advertising);
(
4
) The level of the market (e.g., wholesale, retail, etc.); and
(
5
) Foreign currency risks.
(D)
Sales agent.
If the controlled taxpayer is comparable to a sales agent that does not take title to goods or otherwise assume risks with respect to ownership of such goods, the commission earned by such sales agent, expressed as a percentage of the uncontrolled sales price of the goods involved, may be used as the comparable gross profit margin.
(iii)
Data and assumptions
—(A)
In general.
The reliability of the results derived from the resale price method is affected by the completeness and accuracy of the data used and the reliability of the assumptions made to apply this method. See § 1.482-1(c) (Best method rule).
(B)
Consistency in accounting.
The degree of consistency in accounting practices between the controlled transaction and the uncontrolled comparables that materially affect the gross profit margin affects the reliability of the result. Thus, for example, if differences in inventory and other cost accounting practices would materially affect the gross profit margin, the ability to make reliable adjustments for such differences would affect the reliability of the results. Further, the controlled transaction and the uncontrolled comparable should be consistent in the reporting of items (such as discounts, returns and allowances, rebates, transportation costs, insurance, and packaging) between cost of goods sold and operating expenses.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (c).

# Example 1.
A controlled taxpayer sells property to another member of its controlled group that resells the property in uncontrolled sales. There are no changes in the beginning and ending inventory for the year under review. Information regarding an uncontrolled comparable is sufficiently complete to conclude that it is likely that all material differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions have been identified and adjusted for. If the applicable resale price of the property involved in the controlled sale is $100 and the appropriate gross profit margin is 20%, then an arm's length result of the controlled sale is a price of $80 ($100 minus (20% × $100)).

# Example 2.
(i) S, a U.S. corporation, is the exclusive distributor for FP, its foreign parent. There are no changes in the beginning and ending inventory for the year under review. S's total reported cost of goods sold is $800, consisting of $600 for property purchased from FP and $200 of other costs of goods sold incurred to unrelated parties. S's applicable resale price and reported gross profit are as follows:
Applicable resale price
$1000
Cost of goods sold:
Cost of purchases from FP
600
Costs incurred to unrelated parties
200
Reported gross profit
200
(ii) The district director determines that the appropriate gross profit margin is 25%. Therefore, S's appropriate gross profit is $250 (i.e., 25% of the applicable resale price of $1000). Because S is incurring costs of sales to unrelated parties, an arm's length price for property purchased from FP must be determined under a two-step process. First, the appropriate gross profit ($250) is subtracted from the applicable resale price ($1000). The resulting amount ($750) is then reduced by the costs of sales incurred to unrelated parties ($200). Therefore, an arm's length price for S's cost of sales of FP's product in this case equals $550 (i.e., $750 minus $200).

# Example 3.
FP, a foreign manufacturer, sells Product to USSub, its U.S. subsidiary, which in turn sells Product to its domestic affiliate Sister. Sister sells Product to unrelated buyers. In this case, the applicable resale price is the price at which Sister sells Product in uncontrolled transactions. The determination of the appropriate gross profit margin for the sale from FP to USSub will take into account the functions performed by USSub and Sister, as well as other relevant factors described in § 1.482-1(d)(3).

# Example 4.
USSub, a U.S. corporation, is the exclusive distributor of widgets for its foreign parent. To determine whether the gross profit margin of 25% earned by USSub is an arm's length result, the district director considers applying the resale price method. There are several uncontrolled distributors that perform similar functions under similar circumstances in uncontrolled transactions. However, the uncontrolled distributors treat certain costs such as discounts and insurance as cost of goods sold, while USSub treats such costs as operating expenses. In such cases, accounting reclassifications, pursuant to § 1.482-3(c)(3)(iii)(B), must be made to ensure consistent treatment of such material items. Inability to make such accounting reclassifications will decrease the reliability of the results of the uncontrolled transactions.

# Example 5.
(i) USP, a U.S. corporation, manufactures Product X, an unbranded widget, and sells it to FSub, its wholly owned foreign subsidiary. FSub acts as a distributor of Product X in country M, and sells it to uncontrolled parties in that country. Uncontrolled distributors A, B, C, D, and E distribute competing products of approximately similar value in country M. All such products are unbranded.
(ii) Relatively complete data is available regarding the functions performed and risks borne by the uncontrolled distributors and the contractual terms under which they operate in the uncontrolled transactions. In addition, data is available to ensure accounting consistency between all of the uncontrolled distributors and FSub. Because the available data is sufficiently complete and accurate to conclude that it is likely that all material differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions have been identified, such differences have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect, and reliable adjustments are made to account for such differences, the results of each of the uncontrolled distributors may be used to establish an arm's length range pursuant to § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(A).

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as
Example 5,
except that sufficient data is not available to determine whether any of the uncontrolled distributors provide warranties or to determine the payment terms of the contracts. Because differences in these contractual terms could materially affect price or profits, the inability to determine whether these differences exist between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions diminishes the reliability of the results of the uncontrolled comparables. However, the reliability of the results may be enhanced by the application of a statistical method when establishing an arm's length range pursuant to § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(B).

# Example 7.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5,
except that Product X is branded with a valuable trademark that is owned by P. A, B, and C distribute unbranded competing products, while D and E distribute products branded with other trademarks. D and E do not own any rights in the trademarks under which their products are sold. The value of the products that A, B, and C sold are not similar to the value of the products sold by S. The value of products sold by D and E, however, is similar to that of Product X. Although close product similarity is not as important for a reliable application of the resale price method as for the comparable uncontrolled price method, significant differences in the value of the products involved in the controlled and uncontrolled transactions may affect the reliability of the results. In addition, because in this case it is difficult to determine the effect the trademark will have on price or profits, reliable adjustments for the differences cannot be made. Because D and E have a higher level of comparability than A, B, and C with respect to S, pursuant to § 1.482-1(e)(2)(ii), only D and E may be included in an arm's length range.
(d)
Cost plus method
—(1)
In general.
The cost plus method evaluates whether the amount charged in a controlled transaction is arm's length by reference to the gross profit markup realized in comparable uncontrolled transactions. The cost plus method is ordinarily used in cases involving the manufacture, assembly, or other production of goods that are sold to related parties.
(2)
Determination of arm's length price
—(i)
In general.
The cost plus method measures an arm's length price by adding the appropriate gross profit to the controlled taxpayer's costs of producing the property involved in the controlled transaction.
(ii)
Appropriate gross profit.
The appropriate gross profit is computed by multiplying the controlled taxpayer's cost of producing the transferred property by the gross profit markup, expressed as a percentage of cost, earned in comparable uncontrolled transactions.
(iii)
Arm's length range.
See § 1.482-1(e)(2) for determination of an arm's length range.
(3)
Comparability and reliability considerations
—(i)
In general.
Whether results derived from the application of this method are the most reliable measure of the arm's length result must be determined using the factors described under the best method rule in § 1.482-1(c).
(ii)
Comparability
—(A)
Functional comparability.
The degree of comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions is determined by applying the comparability provisions of § 1.482-1(d). A producer's gross profit provides compensation for the performance of the production functions related to the product or products under review, including an operating profit for the producer's investment of capital and assumption of risks. Therefore, although all of the factors described in § 1.482-1(d)(3) must be considered, comparability under this method is particularly dependent on similarity of functions performed, risks borne, and
contractual terms, or adjustments to account for the effects of any such differences. If possible, the appropriate gross profit markup should be derived from comparable uncontrolled transactions of the taxpayer involved in the controlled sale, because similar characteristics are more likely to be found among sales of property by the same producer than among sales by other producers. In the absence of such sales, an appropriate gross profit markup may be derived from comparable uncontrolled sales of other producers whether or not such producers are members of the same controlled group.
(B)
Other comparability factors.
Comparability under this method is less dependent on close physical similarity between the products transferred than under the comparable uncontrolled price method. Substantial differences in the products may, however, indicate significant functional differences between the controlled and uncontrolled taxpayers. Thus, it ordinarily would be expected that the controlled and uncontrolled transactions involve the production of goods within the same product categories. Furthermore, significant differences in the value of the products due, for example, to the value of a trademark, may also affect the reliability of the comparison. Finally, the reliability of profit measures based on gross profit may be adversely affected by factors that have less effect on prices. For example, gross profit may be affected by a variety of other factors, including cost structures (as reflected, for example, in the age of plant and equipment), business experience (such as whether the business is in a start-up phase or is mature), or management efficiency (as indicated, for example, by expanding or contracting sales or executive compensation over time). Accordingly, if material differences in these factors are identified based on objective evidence, the reliability of the analysis may be affected.
(C)
Adjustments for differences between controlled and uncontrolled transactions.
If there are material differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions that would affect the gross profit markup, adjustments should be made to the gross profit markup earned in the comparable uncontrolled transaction according to the provisions of § 1.482-1(d)(2). For this purpose, consideration of the operating expenses associated with the functions performed and risks assumed may be necessary, because differences in functions performed are often reflected in operating expenses. If there are differences in functions performed, however, the effect on gross profit of such differences is not necessarily equal to the differences in the amount of related operating expenses. Specific examples of the factors that may be particularly relevant to this method include—
(
1
) The complexity of manufacturing or assembly;
(
2
) Manufacturing, production, and process engineering;
(
3
) Procurement, purchasing, and inventory control activities;
(
4
) Testing functions;
(
5
) Selling, general, and administrative expenses;
(
6
) Foreign currency risks; and
(
7
) Contractual terms (e.g., scope and terms of warranties provided, sales or purchase volume, credit terms, transport terms).
(D)
Purchasing agent.
If a controlled taxpayer is comparable to a purchasing agent that does not take title to property or otherwise assume risks with respect to ownership of such goods, the commission earned by such purchasing agent, expressed as a percentage of the purchase price of the goods, may be used as the appropriate gross profit markup.
(iii)
Data and assumptions
—(A)
In general.
The reliability of the results derived from the cost plus method is affected by the completeness and accuracy of the data used and the reliability of the assumptions made to apply this method. See § 1.482-1(c) (Best method rule).
(B)
Consistency in accounting.
The degree of consistency in accounting practices between the controlled transaction and the uncontrolled comparables that materially affect the gross profit markup affects the reliability of the result. Thus, for example, if differences in inventory and other cost accounting practices would materially affect the gross profit markup,
the ability to make reliable adjustments for such differences would affect the reliability of the results. Further, the controlled transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transaction should be consistent in the reporting of costs between cost of goods sold and operating expenses. The term
cost of producing
includes the cost of acquiring property that is held for resale.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d).

# Example 1.
(i) USP, a domestic manufacturer of computer components, sells its products to FS, its foreign distributor. UT1, UT2, and UT3 are domestic computer component manufacturers that sell to uncontrolled foreign purchasers.
(ii) Relatively complete data is available regarding the functions performed and risks borne by UT1, UT2, and UT3, and the contractual terms in the uncontrolled transactions. In addition, data is available to ensure accounting consistency between all of the uncontrolled manufacturers and USP. Because the available data is sufficiently complete to conclude that it is likely that all material differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions have been identified, the effect of the differences are definite and reasonably ascertainable, and reliable adjustments are made to account for the differences, an arm's length range can be established pursuant to § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(A).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that USP accounts for supervisory, general, and administrative costs as operating expenses, which are not allocated to its sales to FS. The gross profit markups of UT1, UT2, and UT3, however, reflect supervisory, general, and administrative expenses because they are accounted for as costs of goods sold. Accordingly, the gross profit markups of UT1, UT2, and UT3 must be adjusted as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section to provide accounting consistency. If data is not sufficient to determine whether such accounting differences exist between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, the reliability of the results will be decreased.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that under its contract with FS, USP uses materials consigned by FS. UT1, UT2, and UT3, on the other hand, purchase their own materials, and their gross profit markups are determined by including the costs of materials. The fact that USP does not carry an inventory risk by purchasing its own materials while the uncontrolled producers carry inventory is a significant difference that may require an adjustment if the difference has a material effect on the gross profit markups of the uncontrolled producers. Inability to reasonably ascertain the effect of the difference on the gross profit markups will affect the reliability of the results of UT1, UT2, and UT3.

# Example 4.
(i) FS, a foreign corporation, produces apparel for USP, its U.S. parent corporation. FS purchases its materials from unrelated suppliers and produces the apparel according to designs provided by USP. The district director identifies 10 uncontrolled foreign apparel producers that operate in the same geographic market and are similar in many respect to FS.
(ii) Relatively complete data is available regarding the functions performed and risks borne by the uncontrolled producers. In addition, data is sufficiently detailed to permit adjustments for differences in accounting practices. However, sufficient data is not available to determine whether it is likely that all material differences in contractual terms have been identified. For example, it is not possible to determine which parties in the uncontrolled transactions bear currency risks. Because differences in these contractual terms could materially affect price or profits, the inability to determine whether differences exist between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions will diminish the reliability of these results. Therefore, the reliability of the results of the uncontrolled transactions must be enhanced by the application of a statistical method in establishing an arm's length range pursuant to § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(B).
(e)
Unspecified methods
—(1)
In general.
Methods not specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section may be used to evaluate whether the amount charged in a controlled transaction is arm's length. Any method used under this paragraph (e) must be applied in accordance with the provisions of § 1.482-1. Consistent with the specified methods, an unspecified method should take into account the general principle that uncontrolled taxpayers evaluate the terms of a transaction by considering the realistic alternatives to that transaction, and only enter into a particular transaction if none of the alternatives is preferable to it. For example, the comparable uncontrolled price method compares a controlled transaction to similar uncontrolled transactions to provide a direct estimate of the price to which the parties would have agreed had they resorted directly to a market alternative to the controlled transaction. Therefore, in establishing
whether a controlled transaction achieved an arm's length result, an unspecified method should provide information on the prices or profits that the controlled taxpayer could have realized by choosing a realistic alternative to the controlled transaction. As with any method, an unspecified method will not be applied unless it provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the best method rule. See § 1.482-1(c). Therefore, in accordance with § 1.482-1(d) (Comparability), to the extent that a method relies on internal data rather than uncontrolled comparables, its reliability will be reduced. Similarly, the reliability of a method will be affected by the reliability of the data and assumptions used to apply the method, including any projections used.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates an application of the principle of this paragraph (e).

# Example.
Amcan, a U.S. company, produces unique vessels for storing and transporting toxic waste, toxicans, at its U.S. production facility. Amcan agrees by contract to supply its Canadian subsidiary, Cancan, with 4000 toxicans per year to serve the Canadian market for toxicans. Prior to entering into the contract with Cancan, Amcan had received a bona fide offer from an independent Canadian waste disposal company, Cando, to serve as the Canadian distributor for toxicans and to purchase a similar number of toxicans at a price of $5,000 each. If the circumstances and terms of the Cancan supply contract are sufficiently similar to those of the Cando offer, or sufficiently reliable adjustments can be made for differences between them, then the Cando offer price of $5,000 may provide reliable information indicating that an arm's length consideration under the Cancan contract will not be less than $5,000 per toxican.
(f)
Coordination with intangible property rules.
The value of an item of tangible property may be affected by the value of intangible property, such as a trademark affixed to the tangible property (embedded intangible). Ordinarily, the transfer of tangible property with an embedded intangible will not be considered a transfer of such intangible if the controlled purchaser does not acquire any rights to exploit the intangible property other than rights relating to the resale of the tangible property under normal commercial practices. Pursuant to § 1.482-1(d)(3)(v), however, the embedded intangible must be accounted for in evaluating the comparability of the controlled transaction and uncontrolled comparables. For example, because product comparability has the greatest effect on an application of the comparable uncontrolled price method, trademarked tangible property may be insufficiently comparable to unbranded tangible property to permit a reliable application of the comparable uncontrolled price method. The effect of embedded intangibles on comparability will be determined under the principles of § 1.482-4. If the transfer of tangible property conveys to the recipient a right to exploit an embedded intangible (other than in connection with the resale of that item of tangible property), it may be necessary to determine the arm's length consideration for such intangible separately from the tangible property, applying methods appropriate to determining the arm's length result for a transfer of intangible property under § 1.482-4. For example, if the transfer of a machine conveys the right to exploit a manufacturing process incorporated in the machine, then the arm's length consideration for the transfer of that right must be determined separately under § 1.482-4.

§ 1.482-4
Methods to determine taxable income in connection with a transfer of intangible property.
(a)
In general.
The arm's length amount charged in a controlled transfer of intangible property must be determined under one of the four methods listed in this paragraph (a). Each of the methods must be applied in accordance with all of the provisions of § 1.482-1, including the best method rule of § 1.482-1(c), the comparability analysis of § 1.482-1(d), and the arm's length range of § 1.482-1(e). The arm's length consideration for the transfer of an intangible determined under this section must be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible. See § 1.482-4(f)(2) (Periodic adjustments). The available methods are—
(1) The comparable uncontrolled transaction method, described in paragraph (c) of this section;
(2) The comparable profits method, described in § 1.482-5;
(3) The profit split method, described in § 1.482-6; and
(4) Unspecified methods described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Definition of intangible.
For purposes of section 482, an intangible is an asset that comprises any of the following items and has substantial value independent of the services of any individual—
(1) Patents, inventions, formulae, processes, designs, patterns, or know-how;
(2) Copyrights and literary, musical, or artistic compositions;
(3) Trademarks, trade names, or brand names;
(4) Franchises, licenses, or contracts;
(5) Methods, programs, systems, procedures, campaigns, surveys, studies, forecasts, estimates, customer lists, or technical data; and
(6) Other similar items. For purposes of section 482, an item is considered similar to those listed in paragraph (b)(1) through (5) of this section if it derives its value not from its physical attributes but from its intellectual content or other intangible properties.
(c)
Comparable uncontrolled transaction method
—(1)
In general.
The comparable uncontrolled transaction method evaluates whether the amount charged for a controlled transfer of intangible property was arm's length by reference to the amount charged in a comparable uncontrolled transaction. The amount determined under this method may be adjusted as required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section (Periodic adjustments).
(2)
Comparability and reliability considerations
—(i)
In general.
Whether results derived from applications of this method are the most reliable measure of an arm's length result is determined using the factors described under the best method rule in § 1.482-1(c). The application of these factors under the comparable uncontrolled transaction method is discussed in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section.
(ii)
Reliability.
If an uncontrolled transaction involves the transfer of the same intangible under the same, or substantially the same, circumstances as the controlled transaction, the results derived from applying the comparable uncontrolled transaction method will generally be the most direct and reliable measure of the arm's length result for the controlled transfer of an intangible. Circumstances between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions will be considered substantially the same if there are at most only minor differences that have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on the amount charged and for which appropriate adjustments are made. If such uncontrolled transactions cannot be identified, uncontrolled transactions that involve the transfer of comparable intangibles under comparable circumstances may be used to apply this method, but the reliability of the analysis will be reduced.
(iii)
Comparability
—(A)
In general.
