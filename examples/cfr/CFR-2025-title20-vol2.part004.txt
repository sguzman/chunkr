determine that requiring your representative payee to provide such evidence would be inappropriate or unnecessary considering the nature of your impairment(s). If your representative payee refuses without good cause to comply with this requirement, and if we decide that it is in your best interests, we may pay your benefits to another representative payee or to you directly.
(1)
What we mean by treatment that is medically necessary.
Treatment that is medically necessary means treatment that is expected to improve or restore your functioning and that was prescribed by your medical source. If you do not have a medical source, we will decide whether there is treatment that is medically necessary that could have been prescribed by a medical source. The treatment may include (but is not limited to)—
(i) Medical management;
(ii) Psychological or psychosocial counseling;
(iii) Physical therapy; and
(iv) Home therapy, such as administering oxygen or giving injections.
(2)
How we will consider whether medically necessary treatment is available.
When we decide whether medically necessary treatment is available, we will consider such things as (but not limited to)—
(i) The location of an institution or facility or place where treatment, services, or resources could be provided to you in relationship to where you reside;
(ii) The availability and cost of transportation for you and your payee to the place of treatment;
(iii) Your general health, including your ability to travel for the treatment;
(iv) The capacity of an institution or facility to accept you for appropriate treatment;
(v) The cost of any necessary medications or treatments that are not paid for by Medicaid or another insurer or source; and
(vi) The availability of local community resources (e.g., clinics, charitable organizations, public assistance agencies) that would provide free treatment or funds to cover treatment.
(3)
When we will not require evidence of treatment that is medically necessary and available.
We will not require your representative payee to present evidence that you are and have been receiving treatment if we find that the condition(s) that was the basis for providing you benefits is not amenable to treatment.
(4)
Removal of a payee who does not provide evidence that a child is and has been receiving treatment that is medically necessary and available.
If your representative payee refuses without good cause to provide evidence that you are and have been receiving treatment that is medically necessary and available, we may, if it is in your best interests, suspend payment of benefits to the representative payee, and pay benefits to another payee or to you. When we decide whether your representative payee had good cause, we will consider factors such as the acceptable reasons for failure to follow prescribed treatment in § 416.930(c) and other factors similar to those describing good cause for missing deadlines in § 416.1411.
(5)
If you do not have a representative payee.
If you do not have a representative payee and we make your payments directly to you, the provisions of this paragraph do not apply to you. However, we may still decide that you are failing to follow prescribed treatment under the provisions of § 416.930, if the requirements of that section are met.

§ 416.995
If we make a determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, did not exist or is no longer disabling (Medical Cessation Determination).
If we make a determination that the physical or mental impairment(s) on the basis of which disability or blindness benefits were payable has ceased, did not exist or is no longer disabling (a medical cessation determination), your benefits will stop. You will receive a written notice explaining this determination and the month your benefits will stop. The written notice will also explain your right to appeal if
you disagree with our determination and your right to request that your disability or blindness benefits be continued under § 416.996. The continued benefit provisions of this section do not apply to an initial determination on an application for disability or blindness benefits or to a determination that you were disabled or blind only for a specified period of time.
[53 FR 29023, Aug. 2, 1988]
§ 416.996
Continued disability or blindness benefits pending appeal of a medical cessation determination.
(a)
General.
If we determine that you are not eligible for disability or blindness benefits because the physical or mental impairment(s) on the basis of which such benefits were payable is found to have ceased, not to have existed, or to no longer be disabling, and you appeal that determination, you may choose to have your disability or blindness benefits, including special cash benefits or special SSI eligibility status under §§ 416.261 and 416.264, continued pending reconsideration and/or a hearing before an administrative law judge on the disability/blindness cessation determination. If you appeal a medical cessation under both title II and title XVI (a concurrent case), the title II claim will be handled in accordance with title II regulations while the title XVI claim will be handled in accordance with the title XVI regulations.
(1) Benefits may be continued under this section only if the determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling is made after October 1984.
(2) Continued benefits under this section will stop effective with the earlier of: (i) The month before the month in which an administrative law judge's hearing decision finds that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling or the month before the month of a new administrative law judge decision (or final action is taken by the Appeals Council on the administrative law judge's recommended decision) if your case was sent back to an administrative law judge for further action; or (ii) the month before the month in which no timely request for reconsideration or administrative law judge hearing is pending after notification of our initial or reconsideration cessation determination. These benefits may be stopped or adjusted because of certain events (such as, change in income or resources or your living arrangements) which may occur while you are receiving these continued benefits, in accordance with § 416.1336(b).
(b)
Statement of choice.
If you or another party (see § 416.1432(a)) request reconsideration under § 416.1409 or a hearing before an administrative law judge in accordance with § 416.1433 on our determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling, or if your case is sent back (remanded) to an administrative law judge for further action, we will explain your right to receive continued benefits and ask you to complete a statement indicating that you wish to have benefits continued pending the outcome of the reconsideration or administrative law judge hearing. If you request reconsideration and/or hearing but you do not want to receive continued benefits, we will ask you to complete a statement declining continued benefits indicating that you do not want to have your benefits continued during the appeal. A separate election must be made at each level of appeal.
(c)
What you must do to receive continued benefits pending notice of our reconsideration determination.
(1) If you want to receive continued benefits pending the outcome of your request for reconsideration, you must request reconsideration and continuation of benefits no later than 10 days after the date you receive the notice of our initial determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling. Reconsideration must be requested as provided in § 416.1409, and you must request continued benefits using a statement in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) If you fail to request reconsideration and continued benefits within the 10-day period required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but later ask that we continue your benefits pending a reconsidered determination, we will use
the rules in § 416.1411 to determine whether good cause exists for your failing to request benefit continuation within 10 days after receipt of the notice of the initial cessation determination. If you request continued benefits after the 10-day period, we will consider the request to be timely and will pay continued benefits only if good cause for delay is established.
(d)
What you must do to receive continued benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision.
(1) To receive continued benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision on our reconsideration determination, you must request a hearing and continuation of benefits no later than 10 days after the date you receive the notice of our reconsideration determination that your physical or mental impairment(s) has ceased, has never existed, or is no longer disabling. A hearing must be requested as provided in § 416.1433, and you must request continued benefits using a statement in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) If you fail to request a hearing and continued benefits within the 10-day period required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but you later ask that we continue your benefits pending an administrative law judge's decision, we will use the rules as provided in § 416.1411 to determine whether good cause exists for your failing to request benefit continuation within 10 days after receipt of the reconsideration determination. If you request continued benefits after the 10-day period, we will consider the delayed request to be timely and will pay continued benefits only if good cause for delay is established.
(e)
What you must do when your case is remanded to an administrative law judge.
If we send back (remand) your case to an administrative law judge for further action under the rules provided in § 416.1477, and the administrative law judge's decision or dismissal order issued on your medical cessation appeal is vacated and is no longer in effect, you may be eligible for continued benefits pending a new decision by the administrative law judge or final action by the Appeals Council on the administrative law judge's recommended decision.
(1) When your case is remanded to an administrative law judge, and you have elected to receive continued benefits, we will contact you to update our file to verify that you continue to meet the nonmedical requirements to receive benefits based on disability or blindness. To determine your correct payment amount, we will ask you to provide information about events such as changes in living arrangements, income, or resources since our last contact with you. If you have returned to work, we will request additional information about this work activity. Unless your earnings cause your income to be too much to receive benefits, your continued benefits will be paid while your appeal of the medical cessation of your disability/blindness is still pending, unless you have completed a trial work period and are engaging in substantial gainful activity. If you have completed a trial work period and previously received continued benefits you may still be eligible for special cash benefits under § 416.261 or special SSI eligibility status under § 416.264. (Effective July 1, 1987, a title XVI individual is no longer subject to a trial work period or cessation based on engaging in substantial gainful activity in order to be eligible for special benefits under § 416.261 or special status under § 416.264.) If we determine that you no longer meet a requirement to receive benefits, we will send you a written notice. The written notice will explain why your continued benefits will not be reinstated or will be for an amount less than you received before the prior administrative law judge's decision. The notice will also explain your right to reconsideration under § 416.1407, if you disagree. If you request a reconsideration, you will have the chance to explain why you believe your benefits should be reinstated or should be at a higher amount. If the final decision on your appeal of your medical cessation is a favorable one, we will send you a written notice in which we will advise you of any right to reentitlement to benefits including special benefits under § 416.261 or special status under § 416.264. If you disagree with our determination on your appeal, you will have the right to appeal this decision.
(2) After we verify that you meet all the nonmedical requirements to receive benefits as stated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and if you previously elected to receive continued benefits pending the administrative law judge's decision, we will start continued benefits again. We will send you a notice telling you this. You do not have to complete a request to have these same benefits continued through the month before the month the new decision or order of dismissal is issued by the administrative law judge or through the month before the month the Appeals Council takes final action on the administrative law judge's recommended decision. These continued benefits will begin again with the first month of nonpayment based on the prior administrative law judge hearing decision or dismissal order. Our notice explaining continued benefits will also tell you to report to us any changes or events that affect your receipt of benefits.
(3) When your case is remanded to an administrative law judge, and if you did
not
previously elect to have benefits continued pending an administrative law judge decision, we will send you a notice telling you that if you want to change that election, you must request to do so no later than 10 days after you receive our notice. If you do make this new election, and after we verify that you meet all the nonmedical requirements as explained in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, benefits will begin with the month of the Appeals Council remand order and will continue as stated in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(4) If a court orders that your case be sent back to us (remanded) and your case is sent to an administrative law judge for further action under the rules provided in § 416.1483, the administrative law judge's decision or dismissal order on your medical cessation appeal is vacated and is no longer in effect. You may be eligible for continued benefits pending a new decision by the administrative law judge or final action by the Appeals Council on the administrative law judge's recommended decision. In these court-remanded cases reaching the administrative law judge, we will follow the same rules provided in paragraph (e) (1), (2), and (3) of this section.
(f)
What if your benefits are suspended, reduced or terminated for other reasons.
If we determine that your payments should be reduced, suspended or terminated for reasons not connected with your medical condition (see subpart M of Regulations No. 16) benefits may be continued under the procedure described in § 416.1336.
(g)
Responsibility to pay back continued benefits.
(1) If the final decision of the Secretary affirms the determination that you are not entitled to benefits, you will be asked to pay back any continued benefits you receive. However, you will have the right to ask that you not be required to pay back the benefits as described in the overpayment recovery and waiver provisions of subpart E of this part.
(2) Waiver of recovery of an overpayment resulting from continued benefits to you may be considered as long as the cessation determination was appealed in good faith. We will assume that your appeal was made in good faith and, therefore, you have the right to waiver consideration
unless
you fail to cooperate in connection with the appeal, e.g., if you fail (without good reason) to give us medical or other evidence we request, or to go for a physical or mental examination when requested, in connection with the appeal. In determining whether you have good cause for failure to cooperate and, thus, whether an appeal was made in good faith, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) you may have which may have caused your failure to cooperate.

§ 416.998
If you become disabled by another impairment(s).
If a new severe impairment(s) begins in or before the month in which your last impairment(s) ends, we will find that your disability is continuing. The new impairment(s) need not be expected to last 12 months or to result in death, but it must be severe enough to keep you from doing substantial gainful activity, or severe enough so that
you are still disabled under § 416.994, or, if you are a child, to result in marked and severe functional limitations.
[62 FR 6432, Feb. 11, 1997]
§ 416.999
What is expedited reinstatement?
The expedited reinstatement provision provides you another option for regaining eligibility for benefits when we previously terminated your eligibility for disability benefits due to your work activity. The expedited reinstatement provision provides you the option of requesting that your prior eligibility for disability benefits be reinstated, rather than filing a new application for a new period of eligibility. Since January 1, 2001, you can request to be reinstated to benefits if you stop doing substantial gainful activity within 60 months of your prior termination. You must not be able to do substantial gainful activity because of your medical condition. Your current impairment must be the same as or related to your prior impairment and you must be disabled. To determine if you are disabled, we will use our medical improvement review standard that we use in our continuing disability review process. The advantage of using the medical improvement review standard is that we will generally find that you are disabled unless your impairment has improved so that you are able to work or unless an exception under the medical improvement review standard process applies. We explain the rules for expedited reinstatement in §§ 416.999a through 416.999d.
[70 FR 57144, Sept. 30, 2005]
§ 416.999a
Who is eligible for expedited reinstatement?
(a) You can have your eligibility to benefits reinstated under expedited reinstatement if—
(1) You were previously eligible for a benefit based on disability or blindness as explained in § 416.202;
(2) Your disability or blindness eligibility referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section was terminated because of earned income or a combination of earned and unearned income;
(3) You file your request for reinstatement timely under § 416.999b; and
(4) In the month you file your request for reinstatement—
(i) You are not able or become unable to do substantial gainful activity because of your medical condition as determined under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) Your current impairment is the same as or related to the impairment that we used as the basis for your previous eligibility referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section,
(iii) You are disabled or blind, as determined under the medical improvement review standard in §§ 416.994 or 416.994a, and
(iv) You meet the non-medical requirements for eligibility as explained in § 416.202.
(b) You are eligible for reinstatement if you are the spouse of an individual who can be reinstated under § 416.999a if—
(1) You were previously an eligible spouse of the individual;
(2) You meet the requirements for eligibility as explained in § 416.202 except the requirement that you must file an application; and
(3) You request reinstatement.
(c) We will determine that you are not able to do substantial gainful activity because of your medical condition, under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, when:
(1) You certify under § 416.999b(e) that you are unable to do substantial gainful activity because of your medical condition;
(2) You are not able or become unable to do substantial gainful activity in the month you file your request for reinstatement; and
(3) We determine that you are disabled under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.
[70 FR 57144, Sept. 30, 2005, as amended at 81 FR 71370, Oct. 17, 2016]
§ 416.999b
How do I request reinstatement?
(a) You must make your request for reinstatement in writing.
(b) You must have filed your request on or after January 1, 2001.
(c) You must provide the information we request so that we can determine whether you meet the eligibility requirements listed in § 416.999a.
(d) We must receive your request within the consecutive 60-month period that begins with the month in which your eligibility terminated due to earned income, or a combination of earned and unearned income. If we receive your request after the 60-month period, we can grant you an extension if we determine you had good cause, under the standards explained in § 416.1411, for not filing the request timely.
(e) You must certify that you are disabled, that your current impairment(s) is the same as or related to the impairment(s) that we used as the basis for the eligibility you are requesting to be reinstated, that you are unable to do substantial gainful activity because of your medical condition, and that you meet the non-medical requirements for eligibility for benefits.
[70 FR 57144, Sept. 30, 2005]
§ 416.999c
How do we determine provisional benefits?
(a) You may receive up to six consecutive months of provisional cash benefits and Medicaid during the provisional benefit period, while we determine whether we can reinstate your disability benefit eligibility under § 416.999a—
(1) We will pay you provisional benefits beginning with the month after you file your request for reinstatement under § 416.999a(a).
(2) If you are an eligible spouse, you can receive provisional benefits with the month your spouse's provisional benefits begin.
(3) If you do not have an eligible spouse, we will pay you a monthly provisional benefit amount equal to the monthly amount that would be payable to an eligible individual under §§ 416.401 through 416.435 with the same kind and amount of income as you have.
(4) If you have an eligible spouse, we will pay you and your spouse a monthly provisional benefit amount equal to the monthly amount that would be payable to an eligible individual and eligible spouse under § 416.401 through 416.435 with the same kind and amount of income as you and your spouse have.
(5) Your provisional benefits will not include state supplementary payments payable under §§ 416.2001 through 416.2176.
(b) You cannot receive provisional cash benefits or Medicaid a second time under this section when—
(1) You request reinstatement under § 416.999a;
(2) You previously received provisional cash benefits or Medicaid under this section based upon a prior request for reinstatement filed under § 416.999a(a); and
(3) Your requests under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) are for the same previous disability eligibility referred to in § 416.999a(a)(2) of this section.
(4)
Examples:

# Example 1:
Mr. K files a request for reinstatement in April 2004. His disability benefit had previously terminated in January 2003. Since Mr. K meets the other factors for possible reinstatement (
i.e.
, his prior eligibility was terminated within the last 60 months because of his work activity) we start paying him provisional benefits beginning May 2004 while we determine whether he is disabled and whether his current impairment(s) is the same as or related to the impairment(s) that we used as the basis for the benefit that was terminated in January 2003. In July 2004 we determine that Mr. K cannot be reinstated because he is not disabled under the medical improvement review standard; therefore we stop his provisional benefits. Mr. K does not request review of the determination. In January 2005 Mr. K again requests reinstatement on the eligibility that terminated in January 2003. Since this request again meets all the other factors for possible reinstatement mentioned above, and his request is still within 60 months from January 2003, we will make a new determination on whether he is disabled and whether his current impairment(s) is the same as or related to the impairment(s) that we used as the basis for the benefit that was terminated in January 2003. Since the January 2005 request and the April 2004 request both request reinstatement on the same benefit that terminated in January 2003, and since we already paid Mr. K provisional benefits based upon the April 2004 request, we will not pay additional provisional benefits on the January 2005 request for reinstatement.

# Example 2:
Assume the same facts as shown in Example 1 of this section, with the addition of these facts. We approve Mr. K's January 2005 request for reinstatement and start his reinstated benefits beginning February 2005. Mr. K subsequently returns to work and his benefits are again terminated due to his work activity in January 2008. Mr. K again stops work and requests reinstatement in
January 2010. Since Mr. K meets the other factors for possible reinstatement (
i.e.
, his prior eligibility was terminated within the last 60 months because of his work activity) we start paying him provisional benefits beginning February 2010 while we determine whether he is disabled and whether his current impairment(s) is the same as or related to the impairment(s) that we used as the basis for the benefit that was terminated in January 2008.
(c) We will not pay you a provisional benefit for a month where you are not eligible for a payment under §§ 416.1322, 416.1323, 416.1325, 416.1327, 416.1329, 416.1330, 416.1334, and 416.1339.
(d) We will not pay you a provisional benefit for any month that is after the earliest of either: the month we send you notice of our determination on your request for reinstatement; or, the sixth month following the month you requested expedited reinstatement.
(e) You are not eligible for provisional benefits if—
(1) Prior to starting your provisional benefits we determine that you do not meet the requirements for reinstatement under §§ 416.999a(a); or
(2) We determine that your statements on your request for reinstatement, made under § 416.999b(d)(2), are false.
(f) Determinations we make regarding your provisional benefits under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are final and are not subject to administrative and judicial review under subpart N of part 416.
(g) If you were previously overpaid benefits under title II or title XVI of the Act, we will not recover the overpayment from your provisional benefits unless you give us permission.
(h) If we determine you are not eligible to receive reinstated benefits, provisional benefits we have already paid you under this section that were made prior to the termination month under paragraph (d) of this section will not be subject to recovery as an overpayment unless we determine that you knew, or should have known, you did not meet the requirements for reinstatement in § 416.999a. If we inadvertently pay you provisional benefits when you are not entitled to them because we have already made a determination described in paragraph (e) of this section, they will be subject to recover as an overpayment under subpart E of part 416.
[70 FR 57144, Sept. 30, 2005]
§ 416.999d
How do we determine reinstated benefits?
(a) If you meet the requirements for reinstatement under § 416.999a(a), we will reinstate your benefits with the month after the month you filed your request for reinstatement. We cannot reinstate your eligibility for any month prior to February 2001.
(b) We will compute your reinstated benefit amount and determine benefits payable under the applicable paragraphs in §§ 416.401 through 416.435. We will reduce your reinstated benefit due in a month by a provisional benefit we already paid you for that month. If your provisional benefit paid for a month equals or exceeds the reinstated benefit due, we will treat the difference as an overpayment under § 416.536.
(c) Once you have been reinstated under § 416.999a you cannot be reinstated again until you have completed a 24-month initial reinstatement period. Your initial reinstatement period begins with the month your reinstated benefits begin under paragraph (a) of this section and ends when you have had 24 payable months of reinstated benefits. We consider you to have a payable month for the purposes of this paragraph when you are due a cash benefit of any amount for the month based upon our normal computation and payment rules in § 416.401 through § 416.435 or if you are considered to be receiving SSI benefits in a month under section 1619(b) of the Social Security Act. If your entire benefit payment due you for a month is adjusted for recovery of an overpayment under §§ 416.570 and 416.571 or if the amount of the provisional benefit already paid you for a month exceeds the amount of the reinstated benefit payable for that month so that no additional payment is due, we will consider the month a payable month.
(d) Your eligibility for reinstated benefits ends with the month preceding the earliest of the following months—
(1) The month an applicable terminating event in §§ 416.1331 through 416.1339 occurs;
(2) The third month following the month in which your disability ceases; or
(3) The month in which you die.
(e) Determinations we make under this section are initial determinations under § 416.1402 and are subject to review under subpart N of part 416.
(f) If we determine you are not eligible for reinstated benefits, we will consider your request filed under § 416.999a(a) your intent to claim benefits under § 416.340.

How a State notifies us that it wishes to perform the disability determination function.
(a)
Deemed notice.
Any State that has in effect as of June 1, 1981, an agreement with us to make disability determinations will be deemed to have given us notice that it wishes to perform the disability determination function, in lieu of continuing the agreement in effect after June 1, 1981.
(b)
Written notice.
After June 1, 1981, a State not making disability determinations that wishes to perform the disability determination function under these regulations must notify us in writing. The notice must be from an official authorized to act for the State for this purpose. The State will provide an opinion from the State's Attorney General verifying the authority of the official who sent the notice to act for the State.
§ 416.1011
How we notify a State whether it may perform the disability determination function.
(a) If a State notifies us in writing that it wishes to perform the disability determination function, we will notify the State in writing whether or not it may perform the function. The State will begin performing the disability determination function beginning with the month we and the State agree upon.
(b) If we have previously found that a State agency has substantially failed to make disability determinations in accordance with the law or these regulations and other written guidelines or if the State has previously notified us in writing that it does not wish to make disability determinations, the notice will advise the State whether the State agency may again make the disability determinations and, if so, the date and the conditions under which the State may again make them.
§ 416.1013
Disability determinations the State makes.
(a)
General rule.
A State agency will make determinations of disability with respect to all persons in the State except those individuals whose cases are in a class specifically excluded by our written guidelines. A determination of disability made by the State is the determination of the Commissioner, except as described in § 416.903(d)(1).
(b)
New classes of cases.
Where any new class or classes of cases arise requiring determinations of disability, we will determine the conditions under which a State may choose not to make the disability determinations. We will provide the State with the necessary funding to do the additional work.
(c)
Temporary transfer of classes of cases.
We will make disability determinations for classes of cases temporarily transferred to us by the State agency if the State agency asks us to do so and we agree. The State agency will make written arrangements with us which will specify the period of time
and the class or classes of cases we will do.
[46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981, as amended at 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]
§ 416.1014
Responsibilities for obtaining evidence to make disability determinations.

(a) When making a disability determination, the State agency will apply subpart I, part 416, of our regulations.
(b) The State agency will make disability determinations based only on the medical and nonmedical evidence in its files.
(c) Disability determinations will be made by:
(1) A State agency medical or psychological consultant and a State agency disability examiner;
(2) A State agency disability examiner alone when there is no medical evidence to be evaluated (
i.e.
, no medical evidence exists or we are unable, despite making every reasonable effort, to obtain any medical evidence that may exist) and the individual fails or refuses, without a good reason, to attend a consultative examination (see § 416.918);
(3) A State agency disability examiner alone if you are not a child (a person who has not attained age 18), and the claim is adjudicated under the quick disability determination process (see § 416.1019) or the compassionate allowance process (see § 416.1002), and the initial or reconsidered determination is fully favorable to you. This paragraph (c)(3) will no longer be effective on December 28, 2018 unless we terminate it earlier by publication of a final rule in the
Federal Register
; or
(4) A State agency disability hearing officer.
See § 416.1016 for the definition of medical or psychological consultant and § 416.1415 for the definition of disability hearing officer. The State agency disability examiner and disability hearing officer must be qualified to interpret and evaluate medical reports and other evidence relating to the claimant's physical or mental impairments and as necessary to determine the capacities of the claimant to perform substantial gainful activity. See § 416.972 for what we mean by substantial gainful activity.
(d) In making a determination under title XVI with respect to the disability of a child to whom paragraph (d) of this section does not apply, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that a qualified pediatrician or other individual who specializes in a field of medicine appropriate to the child's impairment(s) evaluates the case of the child.
(e) The State agency will certify each determination of disability to us on forms we provide.
(f) The State agency will furnish us with all the evidence it considered in making its determination.

§ 416.1016
Medical consultants and psychological consultants.
(a)
What is a medical consultant?
A medical consultant is a member of a team that makes disability determinations in a State agency (see § 416.1015), or who is a member of a team that makes disability determinations for us when we make disability determinations ourselves. The medical consultant completes the medical portion of
the case review and any applicable residual functional capacity assessment about all physical impairment(s) in a claim.
(b)
What qualifications must a medical consultant have?
A medical consultant is a licensed physician, as defined in § 416.902(a)(1).
(c)
What is a psychological consultant?
A psychological consultant is a member of a team that makes disability determinations in a State agency (see § 416.1015), or who is a member of a team that makes disability determinations for us when we make disability determinations ourselves. The psychological consultant completes the medical portion of the case review and any applicable residual functional capacity assessment about all mental impairment(s) in a claim. When we are unable to obtain the services of a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist despite making every reasonable effort (see § 416.1017) in a claim involving a mental impairment(s), a medical consultant will evaluate the mental impairment(s).
(d)
What qualifications must a psychological consultant have?
A psychological consultant can be either a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist. We will only consider a psychologist qualified to be a psychological consultant if he or she:
(1) Is licensed or certified as a psychologist at the independent practice level of psychology by the State in which he or she practices; and
(2)(i) Possesses a doctorate degree in psychology from a program in clinical psychology of an educational institution accredited by an organization recognized by the Council on Post-Secondary Accreditation; or
(ii) Is listed in a national register of health service providers in psychology which the Commissioner of Social Security deems appropriate; and
(3) Possesses 2 years of supervised clinical experience as a psychologist in health service, at least 1 year of which is post-masters degree.
(e)
Cases involving both physical and mental impairments.
In a case where there is evidence of both physical and mental impairments, the medical consultant will evaluate the physical impairments in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and the psychological consultant will evaluate the mental impairment(s) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
[82 FR 5883, Jan. 18, 2017]
§ 416.1017
Reasonable efforts to obtain review by a physician, psychiatrist, and psychologist.
(a) When the evidence of record indicates the existence of a physical impairment, the State agency must make every reasonable effort to ensure that a medical consultant completes the medical portion of the case review and any applicable residual functional capacity assessment. When the evidence of record indicates the existence of a mental impairment, the State agency must make every reasonable effort to ensure that a psychological consultant completes the medical portion of the case review and any applicable residual functional capacity assessment. The State agency must determine if additional physicians, psychiatrists, and psychologists are needed to make the necessary reviews. When it does not have sufficient resources to make the necessary reviews, the State agency must attempt to obtain the resources needed. If the State agency is unable to obtain additional physicians, psychiatrists, and psychologists because of low salary rates or fee schedules, it should attempt to raise the State agency's levels of compensation to meet the prevailing rates for these services. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the State agency will seek assistance from us. We will assist the State agency as necessary. We will also monitor the State agency's efforts and where the State agency is unable to obtain the necessary services, we will make every reasonable effort to provide the services using Federal resources.
(b) Federal resources may include the use of Federal contracts for the services of qualified psychiatrists and psychologists to review mental impairment cases. Where Federal resources are required to perform these reviews, which are a basic State agency responsibility, and where appropriate, the State agency's budget will be reduced accordingly.
(c) Where every reasonable effort is made to obtain the services of a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist to review a mental impairment case, but the professional services are not obtained, a physician who is not a psychiatrist will review the mental impairment case. For these purposes, every reasonable effort to ensure that a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist review mental impairment cases will be considered to have been made only after efforts by both State and Federal agencies as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are made.

# Quick Disability Determinations
§ 416.1019
Quick disability determination process.
(a) If we identify a claim as one involving a high degree of probability that the individual is disabled, and we expect that the individual's allegations will be easily and quickly verified, we will refer the claim to the State agency for consideration under the quick disability determination process pursuant to this section and § 416.1020(c).
(b) If we refer a claim to the State agency for a quick disability determination, a designated quick disability determination examiner must do all of the following:
(1) Subject to the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section, make the disability determination after consulting with a State agency medical or psychological consultant if the State agency disability examiner determines consultation is appropriate or if consultation is required under § 416.926(c). The State agency may certify the disability determination forms to us without the signature of the medical or psychological consultant.
(2) Make the quick disability determination based only on the medical and nonmedical evidence in the file.
(3) Subject to the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section, make the quick disability determination by applying the rules in subpart I of this part.
(c) If the quick disability determination examiner cannot make a determination that is fully favorable, or if there is an unresolved disagreement between the disability examiner and the medical or psychological consultant (except when a disability examiner makes the determination alone under § 416.1015(c)(3)), the State agency will adjudicate the claim using the regularly applicable procedures in this subpart.
[72 FR 51178, Sept. 6, 2007, as amended at 75 FR 62684, Oct. 13, 2010]

# Administrative Responsibilities and Requirements
§ 416.1020
General administrative requirements.
(a) The State will provide the organizational structure, qualified personnel, medical consultant services, and a quality assurance function sufficient to ensure that disability determinations are made accurately and promptly. We may impose specific administrative requirements in these areas and in those under “Administrative Responsibilities and Requirements” in order to establish uniform, national administrative practices or to correct the areas of deficiencies which may later cause the State to be substantially failing to comply with our regulations or other written guidelines. We will notify the State, in writing, of the administrative requirements being imposed and of any administrative deficiencies it is required to correct. We will allow the State 90 days from the date of this notice to make appropriate corrections. Once corrected, we will monitor the State's administrative practices for 180 days. If the State does not meet the requirements or correct all of the deficiencies, or, if some of the deficiencies recur, we may initiate procedures to determine if the State is substantially failing to follow our regulations or other written guidelines.

L. 98-502) which establishes audit requirements for States receiving Federal assistance. If the audit performed by the State meets our program requirements, we will accept the findings and recommendations of the audit. The State will make every effort to act upon and resolve any items questioned in the audit.
(2)
Questioned items.
Items questioned as a result of an audit under the Single Audit Act of 1984 of a cross-cutting nature will be resolved by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Grant and Contract Financial Management. A cross-cutting issue is one that involves more than one Federal awarding agency. Questioned items affecting only the disability program will be resolved by SSA in accord with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(3)
State appeal of audit determinations.
The Office of Grant and Contract Financial Management will notify the State of its determination on questioned cross-cutting items. If the State disagrees with that determination, it may appeal in writing within 60 days of receiving the determination. State appeals of a cross-cutting issue as a result of an audit under the Single Audit Act of 1984 will be made to the Department of Health and Human Services' Departmental Appeals Board. The rules for hearings and appeals are provided in 45 CFR part 16.
(b)
Audits performed by the Commissioner
—(1)
Generally.
If the State does not perform an audit under the Single Audit Act of 1984 or the audit performed is not satisfactory for disability program purposes, the books of account and records in the State pertaining to the administration of the disability programs under the Act will be audited by the SSA's Inspector General or audited or reviewed by SSA as appropriate. These audits or reviews will be conducted to determine whether the expenditures were made for the intended purposes and in amounts necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the disability programs. Audits or reviews will also be made to inspect the work and activities required by the regulations to ensure compliance with pertinent Federal statutes and regulations. The State will make every effort to act upon and resolve any items questioned in an audit or review.
(2)
Questioned items.
Expenditures of State agencies will be audited or reviewed, as appropriate, on the basis of cost principles and written guidelines in effect at the time the expenditures were made or incurred. Both the State and the State agency will be informed and given a full explanation of any items questioned. They will be given reasonable time to explain items questioned. Any explanation furnished by the State or State agency will be given full consideration before a final determination is made on the audit or review report.
(3)
State appeal of audit determinations.
The appropriate Social Security Administration Regional Commissioner will notify the State of his or her determination on the audit or review report. If the State disagrees with that determination, the State may request reconsideration in writing within 60 days of the date of the Regional Commissioner's notice of the determination. The written request may be made, through the Associate Commissioner, Office of Disability, to the Commissioner of Social Security, Room 900, Altmeyer Building, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235. The Commissioner will make a determination and notify the State of the decision in writing no later than 90 days from the date the Social Security Administration receives the State's appeal and all supporting documents. The decision by the Commissioner on other than monetary disallowances will be final and binding upon the State. The decision by the Commissioner on monetary disallowances will be final and binding upon the State unless the State appeals the decision in writing to the Department of Health and Human Services' Departmental Appeals Board within 30 days after receiving the Commissioner's decision. See § 416.1083.

§ 416.1028
Property.
The State will have title to equipment purchased for disability program purposes. The State will be responsible for maintaining all property it acquires or which we furnish to it for performing the disability determination function. The State will identify the equipment by labeling and by inventory and will credit the SSA account with the fair market value of disposed property. In the event we assume the disability determination function from a State, ownership of all property and equipment acquired with SSA funds will be transferred to us effective on the date the State is notified that we are assuming the disability determination function or we are notified that the State is terminating the relationship.
§ 416.1029
Participation in research and demonstration projects.
We will invite State participation in federally funded research and demonstration projects to assess the effectiveness of the disability program and to ascertain the effect of program policy changes. Where we determine that State participation is necessary for the project to be complete, for example, to provide national uniformity in a claims process, State participation is mandatory.
§ 416.1030
Coordination with other agencies.
(a) The State will establish cooperative working relationships with other agencies concerned with serving the disabled and, insofar as practicable, use
their services, facilities, and records to:
(1) Assist the State in developing evidence and making determinations of disability; and

(b) The State agency making determinations of disability will comply with our written guidelines that are not designated as advisory or discretionary. (See § 416.1002 for what we mean by written guidelines.)
(c) A representative group of State agencies will be given an opportunity to participate in formulating disability program policies that have an effect on their role in carrying out the disability determination function. State agencies will also be given an opportunity to comment before changes are made in written guidelines unless delay in issuing a change may impair service to the public.
[46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981, as amended at 56 FR 11023, Mar. 14, 1991]

# Performance Standards
§ 416.1040
General.
The following sections provide the procedures and guidelines we use to determine whether the State agency is substantially complying with our regulations and other written guidelines, including meeting established national performance standards. We use performance standards to help assure effective and uniform administration of our disability program and to measure whether the performance of the disability determination function by each State agency is acceptable. Also, the standards are designed to improve overall State agency performance in the disability determination process and to ensure that benefits are made available to all eligible persons in an accurate and efficient manner. We measure the performance of a State agency in two areas—processing time and quality of documentation and decisions on claims. State agency compliance is also judged by State agency adherence to other program requirements.
[56 FR 11023, Mar. 14, 1991]
§ 416.1041
Standards of performance.
(a)
General.
The performance standards include both a target level of performance and a threshold level of performance for the State agency. The target level represents a level of performance that we and the States will work to attain in the future. The threshold level is the minimum acceptable level of performance. Performance below the threshold level will be the basis for the Commissioner's taking from the State agency partial or complete responsibility for performing the disability determination function. Intermediate State agency goals are designed to help each State agency move from its current performance levels to the target levels.
(b)
The target level.
The target level is the optimum level of performance.
There are three targets—one for combined title II and title XVI initial performance accuracy, one for title II initial processing time, and one for title XVI initial processing time.
(c)
The threshold level.
The threshold level is the minimum acceptable level of performance. There are three thresholds—one for combined title II and title XVI initial performance accuracy, one for title II initial processing time, and one for title XVI initial processing time.
(d)
Intermediate goals.
Intermediate goals are levels of performance between the threshold levels and the target levels established by our appropriate Regional Commissioner after negotiation with each State agency. The intermediate goals are designed to help the State agencies reach the target levels. Failure to meet these goals is not a cause for considering the State agency to be substantially failing to comply with the performance standards. However, failure to meet the intermediate goals may result in consultation and an offer of optional performance support depending on the availability of our resources.
[46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981, as amended at 56 FR 11023, Mar. 14, 1991; 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]
§ 416.1042
Processing time standards.
(a)
General.
Title II processing time refers to the average number of days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) it takes a State agency to process an initial disability claim from the day the case folder is received in the State agency until the day it is released to us by the State agency. Title XVI processing time refers to the average number of days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, from the day of receipt of the initial disability claim in the State agency until systems input of a presumptive disability decision or the day the case folder is released to us by the State agency, whichever is earlier.
(b)
Target levels.
The processing time target levels are:
(1) 37 days for title II initial claims.
(2) 43 days for title XVI initial claims.
(c)
Threshold levels.
The processing time threshold levels are:
(1) 49.5 days for title II initial claims.
(2) 57.9 days for title XVI initial claims.
[46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981, as amended at 56 FR 11023, Mar. 14, 1991]
§ 416.1043
Performance accuracy standard.
(a)
General.
Performance accuracy refers to the percentage of cases that do not have to be returned to State agencies for further development or correction of decisions based on evidence in the files and as such represents the reliability of State agency adjudication. The definition of performance accuracy includes the measurement of factors that have a potential for affecting a decision, as well as the correctness of the decision. For example, if a particular item of medical evidence should have been in the file but was not included, even though its inclusion does not change the result in the case, that is a performance error. Performance accuracy, therefore, is a higher standard than decisional accuracy. As a result, the percentage of correct decisions is significantly higher than what is reflected in the error rate established by SSA's quality assurance system.
(b)
Target level.
The State agency initial performance accuracy target level for combined title II and title XVI cases is 97 percent with a corresponding decision accuracy rate of 99 percent.
(c)
Intermediate goals.
These goals will be established annually by SSA's regional commissioner after negotiation with the State and should be used as stepping stones to progress towards our targeted level of performance.
(d)
Threshold levels.
The State agency initial performance accuracy threshold level for combined title II and title XVI cases is 90.6 percent.
§ 416.1044
How and when we determine whether the processing time standards are met.
(a)
How we determine processing times.
For all initial title II cases, we calculate the mean number of days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, from the day the case folder is received in the State agency until the day it is released to us by the State agency. For initial title XVI cases, we
calculate the mean number of days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, from the day the case folder is received in the State agency until the day there is systems input of a presumptive disability decision or the day the case folder is released to us by the State agency, whichever is earlier.
(b)
Frequency of review.
Title II processing times and title XVI processing times are monitored separately on a quarterly basis. The determination as to whether or not the processing time thresholds have been met is made at the end of each quarter each year. Quarterly State-by-State mean processing times are compared with the threshold levels for both title II and title XVI.
[46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981, as amended at 56 FR 11023, Mar. 14, 1991]
§ 416.1045
How and when we determine whether the performance accuracy standard is met.
(a)
How we determine performance accuracy.
We determine a State agency's performance accuracy rate on the basis of decision and documentation errors identified in our review of the sample cases.
(b)
Frequency of review.
Title II and title XVI initial performance accuracy are monitored together on a quarterly basis. The determinations as to whether the performance accuracy threshold has been met is made at the end of each quarter each year. Quarterly State-by-State combined initial performance accuracy rates are compared to the established threshold level.
§ 416.1050
Action we will take if a State agency does not meet the standards.
If a State agency does not meet two of the three established threshold levels (one of which must be performance accuracy) for two or more consecutive calendar quarters, we will notify the State agency in writing that it is not meeting the standards. Following our notification, we will provide the State agency appropriate performance support described in §§ 416.1060, 416.1061 and 416.1062 for a period of up to 12 months.
[56 FR 11023, Mar. 14, 1991]

# Performance Monitoring and Support
§ 416.1060
How we will monitor.
We will regularly analyze State agency combined title II and title XVI initial performance accuracy rate, title II initial processing time, and title XVI initial processing time. Within budgeted resources, we will also routinely conduct fiscal and administrative management reviews and special onsite reviews. A fiscal and administrative management review is a fact-finding mission to review particular aspects of State agency operations. During these reviews we will also review the quality assurance function. This regular monitoring and review program will allow us to determine the progress each State is making and the type and extent of performance support we will provide to help the State progress toward threshold, intermediate, and/or target levels.
[56 FR 11023, Mar. 14, 1991]
§ 416.1061
When we will provide performance support.
(a)
Optional support.
We may offer, or a State may request, performance support at any time that the regular monitoring and review process reveals that support could enhance performance. The State does not have to be below the initial performance accuracy rate of 90.6 percent to receive performance support. Support will be offered, or granted upon request, based on available resources.
(b)
Mandatory support.
(1) We will provide a State agency with performance support if regular monitoring and review reveal that two of three threshold levels (one of which must be performance accuracy) are not met for two consecutive calendar quarters.
(2) We may also decide to provide a State agency with mandatory performance support if regular monitoring and review reveal that any one of the three threshold levels is not met for two consecutive calendar quarters. Support will be provided based on available resources.
(3) The threshold levels are:
(i) Combined title II and title XVI initial performance accuracy rate—90.6 percent,
(ii) Title II initial processing time—49.5 days, and
(iii) Title XVI initial processing time—57.9 days.
[56 FR 11023, Mar. 14, 1991]
§ 416.1062
What support we will provide.
Performance support may include, but is not limited to, any or all of the following:
(a) An onsite review of cases processed by the State agency emphasizing adherence to written guidelines.
(b) A request that necessary administrative measures be implemented (e.g., filling staffing vacancies, using overtime, assisting with training activities, etc.).
(c) Provisions for Federal personnel to perform onsite reviews, conduct training, or perform other functions needed to improve performance.
(d) Provisions for fiscal aid to allow for overtime, temporary hiring of additional staff, etc., above the authorized budget.
[56 FR 11024, Mar. 14, 1991]

# Substantial Failure
§ 416.1070
General.
After a State agency falls below two of three established threshold levels, one being performance accuracy, for two consecutive quarters, and after the mandatory performance support period, we will give the State agency a 3-month adjustment period. During this 3-month period we will not require the State agency to meet the threshold levels. Following the adjustment period, if the State agency again falls below two of three threshold levels, one being performance accuracy, in two consecutive quarters during the next 12 months, we will notify the State that we propose to find that the State agency has substantially failed to comply with our standards and advise it that it may request a hearing on that issue. After giving the State notice and an opportunity for a hearing, if it is found that a State agency has substantially failed to make disability determinations consistent with the Act, our regulations, or other written guidelines, we will assume partial or complete responsibility for performing the disability determination function after we have complied with §§ 416.1090 and 416.1092.
[56 FR 11024, Mar. 14, 1991]
§ 416.1071
Good cause for not following the Act, our regulations, or other written guidelines.
If a State has good cause for not following the Act, our regulations, or other written guidelines, we will not find that the State agency has substantially failed to meet our standards. We will determine if good cause exists. Some of the factors relevant to good cause are:
(a) Disasters such as fire, flood, or civil disorder, that—
(1) Require the diversion of significant personnel normally assigned to the disability determination function, or
(2) Destroyed or delayed access to significant records needed to make accurate disability determinations;
(b) Strikes of State agency staff or other government or private personnel necessary to the performance of the disability determination function;
(c) Sudden and unanticipated workload changes which result from changes in Federal law, regulations, or written guidelines, systems modification or systems malfunctions, or rapid, unpredictable caseload growth for a 6-month period or longer.
[56 FR 11024, Mar. 14, 1991]
§ 416.1075
Finding of substantial failure.
A finding of substantial failure with respect to a State may not be made unless and until the State is afforded an opportunity for a hearing.

# Hearings and Appeals
§ 416.1080
Notice of right to hearing on proposed finding of substantial failure.
If, following the mandatory performance support period and the 3-month adjustment period, a State agency again falls below two of three threshold levels (one being performance accuracy) in two consecutive quarters in the succeeding 12 months, we will notify the State in writing that we will
find that the State agency has substantially failed to meet our standards unless the State submits a written request for a hearing with the Department of Health and Human Services' Departmental Appeals Board within 30 days after receiving the notice. The notice will identify the threshold levels that were not met by the State agency, the period during which the thresholds were not met, and the accuracy and processing time levels attained by the State agency during this period. If a hearing is not requested, the State agency will be found to have substantially failed to meet our standards, and we will implement our plans to assume the disability determination function.
[56 FR 11024, Mar. 14, 1991]
§ 416.1081
Disputes on matters other than substantial failure.
Disputes concerning monetary disallowances will be resolved in proceedings before the Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeals Board if the issue cannot be resolved between us and the State. Disputes other than monetary disallowances will be resolved through an appeal to the Commissioner of Social Security, who will make the final decision. (See § 416.1027.)
[56 FR 11024, Mar. 14, 1991]
§ 416.1082
Who conducts the hearings.
If a hearing is required, it will be conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services' Departmental Appeals Board (the Board).
[46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981, as amended at 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]
§ 416.1083
Hearings and appeals process.
The rules for hearings and appeals before the Board are provided in 45 CFR part 16. A notice under § 416.1080 of this subpart will be considered a “final written decision” for purposes of Board review.

# Assumption of Disability Determination Function
§ 416.1090
Assumption when we make a finding of substantial failure.
(a)
Notice to State.
When we find that substantial failure exists, we will notify the State in writing that we will assume responsibility for performing the disability determination function from the State agency, whether the assumption will be partial or complete, and the date on which the assumption will be effective.
(b)
Effective date of assumption.
The date of any partial or complete assumption of the disability determination function from a State agency may not be earlier than 180 days after our finding of substantial failure, and not before compliance with the requirements of § 416.1092.
§ 416.1091
Assumption when State no longer wishes to perform the disability determination function.
(a)
Notice to the Commissioner.
If a State no longer wishes to perform the disability determination function, it will notify us in writing. The notice must be from an official authorized to act for the State for this purpose. The State will provide an opinion from the State's Attorney General verifying the authority of the official who gave the notice.
(b)
Effective date of assumption.
The State agency will continue to perform whatever activities of the disability determination function it is performing at the time the notice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is given for not less than 180 days or, if later, until we have complied with the requirements of § 416.1092. For example, if the State is not making disability determinations (because we previously assumed responsibility for making them) but is performing other activities related to the disability determination function at the time it gives notice, the State will continue to do these activities until the requirements of this paragraph are met. Thereafter, we will assume complete responsibility for performing the disability determination function.
[46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981, as amended at 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]
§ 416.1092
Protection of State employees.
(a)
Hiring preference.
We will develop and initiate procedures to implement a plan to partially or completely assume the disability determination function from the State agency under § 416.1090 or § 416.1091, as appropriate. Except for the State agency's administrator, deputy administrator, or assistant administrator (or his equivalent), we will give employees of the State agency who are capable of performing duties in the disability determination function preference over any other persons in filling positions with us for which they are qualified. We may also give a preference in hiring to the State agency's administrator, deputy administrator, or assistant administrator (or his equivalent). We will establish a system for determining the hiring priority among the affected State agency employees in those instances where we are not hiring all of them.
(b)
Determination by Secretary of Labor.
We will not assume responsibility for performing the disability determination function from a State until the Secretary of Labor determines that the State has made fair and equitable arrangements under applicable Federal, State and local law to protect the interests of employees who will be displaced from their employment because of the assumption and who we will not hire.
§ 416.1093
Limitation on State expenditures after notice.
The State agency may not, after it receives the notice referred to in § 416.1090, or gives the notice referred to in § 416.1091, make any new commitments to spend funds allocated to it for performing the disability determination function without the approval of the appropriate SSA regional commissioner. The State will make every effort to close out as soon as possible all existing commitments that relate to performing the disability determination function.
§ 416.1094
Final accounting by the State.
The State will submit its final claims to us as soon as possible, but in no event later than 1 year from the effective date of our assumption of the disability determination function unless we grant an extension of time. When the final claim(s) is submitted, a final accounting will be made by the State of any funds paid to the State under § 416.1026 which have not been spent or committed prior to the effective date of our assumption of the disability determination function. Disputes concerning final accounting issues which cannot be resolved between the State and us will be resolved in proceedings before the Grant Appeals Board as described in 45 CFR part 416.

# General
§ 416.1100
Income and SSI eligibility.
You are eligible for supplemental security income (SSI) benefits if you are an aged, blind, or disabled person who meets the requirements described in subpart B and who has limited income and resources. Thus, the amount of income you have is a major factor in deciding whether you are eligible for SSI benefits and the amount of your benefit. We count income on a monthly basis. Generally, the more income you have the less your benefit will be. If you have too much income, you are not eligible for a benefit. However, we do not count all of your income to determine your eligibility and benefit amount. We explain in the following sections how we treat your income for the SSI program. These rules apply to the Federal benefit and to any optional State supplement paid by us on behalf of a State (§ 416.2025) except as noted in subpart T and in the Federal-State agreements with individual States. While this subpart explains how we count income, subpart D of these regulations explains how we determine your benefits, including the provision that we generally use countable income in a prior month to determine how much your benefit amount will be
for a month in which you are eligible (§ 416.420).
[50 FR 48573, Nov. 26, 1985]
§ 416.1101
Definition of terms.
As used in this subpart—
Calendar quarter
means a period of three full calendar months beginning with January, April, July, or October.
Child
means someone who is not married, is not the head of a household, and is either under age 18 or is under age 22 and a student. (See § 416.1856)
Couple
means an eligible individual and his or her eligible spouse.
Current market value
means the price of an item on the open market in your locality.
Federal benefit rate
means the monthly payment rate for an eligible individual or couple. It is the figure from which we subtract countable income to find out how much your Federal SSI benefit should be. The Federal benefit rate does not include the rate for any State supplement paid by us on behalf of a State.
Institution
means an establishment which makes available some treatment or services beyond food and shelter to four or more persons who are not related to the proprietor. (See § 416.201)
Spouse
means someone who lives with another person as that person's husband or wife. (See § 416.1806)
We, Us,
or
Our
means the Social Security Administration.
You
or
Your
means a person who is applying for, or already receiving, SSI benefits.

§ 416.1102
What is income?
Income is anything that you receive in cash or in-kind that you can use to meet your needs for food or shelter. For purposes of this definition, income may be received actually or constructively. Income is received constructively, unless there are significant restrictions on your ability to receive it, if it is under your control or you can use it despite not actually receiving it. Sometimes income also includes more or less than you actually receive (see §§ 416.1110 and 416.1123(b)). In-kind income is not cash but is something else that you can use to meet your needs for food or shelter. Exception: Food is not included in the calculations of in-kind support and maintenance, which is a type of unearned income that we have special rules for valuing (see §§ 416.1130 through 416.1148).
[89 FR 21209, Mar. 27, 2024]
§ 416.1103
What is not income?
Some things you receive are not income because you cannot use them as food or shelter, or use them to obtain food or shelter. In addition, what you receive from the sale or exchange of your own property is not income; it remains a resource. The following are some items that are not income:
(a)
Medical care and services.
Medical care and services are not income if they are any of the following:
(1) Given to you free of charge or paid for directly to the provider by someone else;
(2) Room and board you receive during a medical confinement;
(3) Assistance provided in cash or in kind (including food or shelter) under a Federal, State, or local government program whose purpose is to provide medical care or medical services (including vocational rehabilitation);
(4) In-kind assistance (except shelter) provided under a nongovernmental program whose purpose is to provide medical care or medical services;
(5) Cash provided by any nongovernmental medical care or medical services program or under a health insurance policy (except cash to cover food or shelter) if the cash is either:
(i) Repayment for program-approved services you have already paid for; or
(ii) A payment restricted to the future purchase of a program-approved service.

# Example:
If you have paid for prescription drugs and get the money back from your health insurance, the money is not income.
(6) Direct payment of your medical insurance premiums by anyone on your behalf.
(7) Payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs resulting from unusual medical expenses.
(b)
Social services.
Social services are not income if they are any of the following:
(1) Assistance provided in cash or in kind (but not received in return for a service you perform) under any Federal, State, or local government program whose purpose is to provide social services including vocational rehabilitation (Example: Cash given you by the Department of Veterans Affairs to purchase aid and attendance);
(2) In-kind assistance (except shelter) provided under a nongovernmental program whose purpose is to provide social services; or
(3) Cash provided by a nongovernmental social services program (except cash to cover food or shelter) if the cash is either:
(i) Repayment for program-approved services you already have paid for; or
(ii) A payment restricted to the future purchase of a program-approved service.

# Example:
If you are unable to do your own household chores and a private social services agency provides you with cash to pay a homemaker the cash is not income.
(c)
Receipts from the sale, exchange, or replacement of a resource.
Receipts from the sale, exchange, or replacement of a resource are not income but are resources that have changed their form. This includes any cash or in-kind item that is provided to replace or repair a resource (see subpart L) that has been lost, damaged, or stolen. Sections 416.1150 and 416.1151 discuss treatment of receipts to replace or repair a resource following a major disaster or following some other event causing damage or loss of a resource.

# Example:
If you sell your automobile, the money you receive is not income; it is another form of a resource.
(d)
Income tax refunds.
Any amount refunded on income taxes you have already paid is not income.
(e)
Payments by credit life or credit disability insurance.
Payments made under a credit life or credit disability insurance policy on your behalf are not income.

# Example:
If a credit disability policy pays off the mortgage on your home after you become disabled in an accident, we do not consider either the payment or your increased equity in the home to be income.
(f)
Proceeds of a loan.
Money you borrow or money you receive as repayment of a loan is not income. However, interest you receive on money you have lent is income. Buying on credit is treated as though you were borrowing money and what you purchase this way is not income.
(g)
Bills paid for you.
Payment of your bills by someone else directly to the supplier is not income. However, we count the value of anything you receive because of the payment if it is in-kind income as defined in § 416.1102.
Examples:
If your daughter uses her own money to pay your mortgage payment directly to the mortgage lender, the payment itself is not your income because you do not receive it. However, because of your daughter's payment, the transaction provides you with shelter; the mortgage payment is in-kind income for shelter to you. Similarly, if you book a hotel room on credit and your son later pays the bill, the payment to the hotel is not income to you, but the payment of the bill is in-kind income for shelter to you. In this example, if your son pays for the hotel bill in a month after the month of the hotel stay, we will count the in-kind income to you in the month in which he pays the bill. On the other hand, if your brother pays a lawn service to mow your grass, the payment is not income to you because the mowing cannot be used to meet your needs for food or shelter. Therefore, the payment for the lawn service is not in-kind income as defined in § 416.1102.
(h)
Replacement of income you have already received.
If income is lost, destroyed, or stolen and you receive a replacement, the replacement is not income.

# Example:
If your paycheck is stolen and you get a replacement check, we count the first check as income. The replacement check is not income.
(i)
Weatherization assistance.
Weatherization assistance (Examples: Insulation, storm doors and windows) is not income.
(j)
Receipt of certain noncash items.
Any item you receive (except shelter as defined in § 416.1130) which would be an
excluded nonliquid resource (as described in subpart L of this part) if you kept it, is not income.
Example 1:
A community takes up a collection to buy you a specially equipped van, which is your only vehicle. The value of this gift is not income because the van does not provide you with food or shelter and will become an excluded nonliquid resource under § 416.1218 in the month following the month of receipt.
Example 2:
You inherit a house which is your principal place of residence. The value of this inheritance is income because the house provides you with shelter and shelter is income. However, we value the house under the rule in § 416.1140.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 49 FR 48038, Dec. 10, 1984; 57 FR 53850, Nov. 13, 1992; 59 FR 33907, July 1, 1994; 70 FR 6344, Feb. 7, 2005; 89 FR 21209, Mar. 27, 2024]
§ 416.1104
Income we count.
We have described generally what income is and is not for SSI purposes (§ 416.1103). There are different types of income, earned and unearned, and we have rules for counting each. The earned income rules are described in §§ 416.1110 through 416.1112 and the unearned income rules are described in §§ 416.1120 through 416.1124. One type of unearned income is in-kind support and maintenance (shelter), which we value depending on your living arrangement. These rules are described in §§ 416.1130 through 416.1148 of this part. In some situations we must consider the income of certain people with whom you live as available to you and part of your income. These rules are described in §§ 416.1160 through 416.1169. We use all of these rules to determine the amount of your countable income—the amount that is left after we subtract what is not income or is not counted.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 65 FR 16815, Mar. 30, 2000; 70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005; 89 FR 21209, Mar. 27, 2024]

# Earned Income
§ 416.1110
What is earned income.
Earned income may be in cash or in kind. We may include more of your earned income than you actually receive. We include more than you actually receive if amounts are withheld from earned income because of a garnishment or to pay a debt or other legal obligation, or to make any other payments. Earned income consists of the following types of payments:
(a)
Wages
—(1)
Wages paid in cash—general.
Wages are what you receive (before any deductions) for working as someone else's employee. Wages are the same for SSI purposes as for the social security retirement program's earnings test. (
See
§ 404.429(c) of this chapter.) Wages include salaries, commissions, bonuses, severance pay, and any other special payments received because of your employment.
(2)
Wages paid in cash to uniformed service members.
Wages paid in cash to uniformed service members include basic pay, some types of special pay, and some types of allowances. Allowances for on-base housing or privatized military housing are unearned income in the form of in-kind support and maintenance. Cash allowances paid to uniformed service members for private housing are wages.
(3)
Wages paid in kind.
Wages may also include the value of food, clothing, shelter, or other items provided instead of cash. We refer to this type of income as in-kind earned income. However, if you are a domestic or agricultural worker, the law requires us to treat your in-kind pay as unearned income.
(b)
Net earnings from self-employment.
Net earnings from self-employment are your gross income from any trade or business that you operate, less allowable deductions for that trade or business. Net earnings also include your share of profit or loss in any partnership to which you belong. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2001, net earnings from self-employment under the SSI program are the same net earnings that we would count under the social security retirement insurance program and that you would report on your Federal income tax return. (See § 404.1080 of this chapter.) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, net earnings from self-employment under the SSI program will also include the earnings of statutory employees. In addition, for SSI purposes only, we consider statutory
employees to be self-employed individuals. Statutory employees are agent or commission drivers, certain full-time life insurance salespersons, home workers, and traveling or city salespersons. (
See
§ 404.1008 of this chapter for a more detailed description of these types of employees).
(c)
Refunds of Federal income taxes and advance payments by employers made in accordance with the earned income credit provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Refunds on account of earned income credits are payments made to you under the provisions of section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These
refunds
may be greater than taxes you have paid. You may receive earned income tax credit payments along with any other Federal income tax refund you receive because of overpayment of your income tax, (Federal income tax refunds made on the basis of taxes you have already paid are not income to you as stated in § 416.1103(d).) Advance payments of earned income tax credits are made by your employer under the provisions of section 3507 of the same code. You can receive earned income tax credit payments only if you meet certain requirements of family composition and income limits.
(d)
Payments for services performed in a sheltered workshop or work activities center.
Payments for services performed in a sheltered workshop or work activities center are what you receive for participating in a program designed to help you become self-supporting.
(e)
Certain royalties and honoraria.
Royalties that are earned income are payments to an individual in connection with any publication of the work of the individual. (See § 416.1110(b) if you receive a royalty as part of your trade or business. See § 416.1121(c) if you receive another type of royalty.) Honoraria that are earned income are those portions of payments, such as an honorary payment, reward, or donation, received in consideration of services rendered for which no payment can be enforced by law. (See § 416.1120 if you receive another type of honorarium.)

§ 416.1111
How we count earned income.
(a)
Wages.
We count wages at the earliest of the following points: when you receive them or when they are credited to your account or set aside for your use. We determine wages for each month. We count wages for services performed as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in § 404.1330 of this chapter) as received in the month in which they are earned.
(b)
Net earnings from self-employment.
We count net earnings from self-employment on a taxable year basis. However, we divide the total of these earnings equally among the months in the taxable year to get your earnings for each month. For example, if your net earnings for a taxable year are $2,400, we consider that you received $200 in each month. If you have net losses from self-employment, we divide them over the taxable year in the same way, and we deduct them only from your other earned income.
(c)
Payments for services in a sheltered workshop or activities center.
We count payments you receive for services performed in a sheltered workshop or work activities center when you receive them or when they are set aside for your use. We determine the amount of the payments for each calendar quarter.
(d)
In-kind earned income.
We use the current market value of in-kind earned income for SSI purposes. (See § 416.1101 for a definition of current market value.) If you receive an item that is not fully paid for and are responsible for the unpaid balance, only the paid-up value is income to you. (See the example in § 416.1123(c)).
(e)
Royalties and honoraria.
We count payments of royalties to you in connection with any publication of your work, and honoraria, to the extent received for services rendered, at the earliest of the following points: when you receive them, when they are credited
to your account, or when they are set aside for your use. (See § 416.1111(b) if you receive royalties as part of your trade or business.)
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 23179, May 24, 1983; 48 FR 30357, July 1, 1983; 50 FR 48574, Nov. 26, 1985; 58 FR 63889, Dec. 3, 1993; 59 FR 43471, Aug. 24, 1994; 71 FR 45378, Aug. 9, 2006]
§ 416.1112
Earned income we do not count.
(a)
General.
While we must know the source and amount of all of your earned income for SSI, we do not count all of it to determine your eligibility and benefit amount. We first exclude income as authorized by other Federal laws (see paragraph (b) of this section). Then we apply the other exclusions in the order listed in paragraph (c) of this section to the rest of your income in the month. We never reduce your earned income below zero or apply any unused earned income exclusion to unearned income.
(b)
Other Federal laws.
Some Federal laws other than the Social Security Act provide that we cannot count some of your earned income for SSI purposes. We list the laws and exclusions in the appendix to this subpart which we update periodically.
(c)
Other earned income we do not count.
We do not count as earned income—
(1) Any refund of Federal income taxes you receive under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to earned income tax credit) and any payment you receive from an employer under section 3507 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to advance payment of earned income tax credit);
(2) The first $30 of earned income received in a calendar quarter if you receive it infrequently or irregularly. We consider income to be received infrequently if you receive it only once during a calendar quarter from a single source and you did not receive it in the month immediately preceding that month or in the month immediately subsequent to that month. We consider income to be received irregularly if you cannot reasonably expect to receive it.
(3) If you are under age 22 and a student who is regularly attending school as described in § 416.1861:
(i)
For earned income beginning January 1, 2002,
monthly and yearly maximum amounts that are the larger of:
(A) The monthly and yearly amounts for the previous year, or
(B) Monthly and yearly maximum amounts increased for changes in the cost-of-living, calculated in the same manner as the Federal benefit rates described in § 416.405, except that we will use the calendar year 2001 amounts as the base amounts and will round the resulting amount to the next higher multiple of $10 where such amount is a multiple of $5 but not of $10 and to the nearest multiple of $10 in any other case.
(ii)
For earned income before January 1, 2002,
the amounts indicated in Table 1 of this section.
Table 1

Up to per month
But not more than in a calendar year
In calendar years before 2001
$400
$1,620
In calendar year 2001

(4) Any portion of the $20 monthly exclusion in § 416.1124(c)(10) which has not been excluded from your unearned income in that same month;
(5) $65 of earned income in a month;
(6) Earned income you use to pay impairment-related work expenses described in § 416.976, if you are disabled (but not blind) and under age 65 or you are disabled (but not blind) and received SSI as a disabled individual (or received disability payments under a former State plan) for the month before you reached age 65.
(i) For periods prior to December 1, 1990, you must be able, however, to establish your initial eligibility for Federal benefits without the use of the impairment-related work expense exclusion. Once you establish your initial eligibility without the use of the impairment-related work expense exclusion, the exclusion applies for determining your eligibility for all subsequent consecutive months for which you are eligible for regular SSI benefits, federally administered optional State supplementary payments, special
SSI cash benefits or special SSI eligibility status. If, in a subsequent month, you are not eligible for any of these benefits, you cannot reestablish your eligibility for Federal SSI benefits or federally administered optional State supplementary payments before December 1, 1990, using the impairment-related work expense exclusion.
(ii) For periods after November 30, 1990, you may also use the impairment-related work expense exclusion to establish initial eligibility and reeligibility following a month in which you were not eligible for regular SSI benefits, a federally administered optional State supplementary payment, special SSI cash benefits or special SSI eligibility status.
(7) One-half of remaining earned income in a month;
(8) Earned income used to meet any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of the income if you are blind and under age 65 or if you receive SSI as a blind person for the month before you reach age 65. (We consider that you “reach” a certain age on the day before that particular birthday.);
(9) Any earned income you receive and use to fulfill an approved plan to achieve self-support if you are blind or disabled and under age 65 or blind or disabled and received SSI as a blind or disabled person for the month before you reached age 65. See §§ 416.1180 through 416.1182 for an explanation of plans to achieve self-support and for the rules on when this exclusion applies; and
(10) Payments made to participants in AmeriCorps State and National and AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC). Payments to participants in AmeriCorps State and National and AmeriCorps NCCC may be made in cash or in-kind and may be made directly to the AmeriCorps participant or on the AmeriCorps participant's behalf. These payments include, but are not limited to: Living allowance payments, stipends, educational awards, and payments in lieu of educational awards.

# Unearned Income
§ 416.1120
What is unearned income.
Unearned income is all income that is not earned income. We describe some of the types of unearned income in § 416.1121. We consider all of these items as unearned income, whether you receive them in cash or in kind.
§ 416.1121
Types of unearned income.
Some types of unearned income are—
(a)
Annuities, pensions, and other periodic payments.
This unearned income is usually related to prior work or service. It includes, for example, private pensions, social security benefits, disability benefits, veterans benefits, worker's compensation, railroad retirement annuities and unemployment insurance benefits.
(b)
Alimony and support payments.
For SSI purposes, alimony and support payments are cash or in-kind contributions to meet some or all of a person's needs for food or shelter. Support payments may be made voluntarily or because of a court order. Alimony (sometimes called
maintenance
) is an allowance made by a court from the funds of one spouse to the other spouse in connection with a suit for separation or divorce.
(c)
Dividends, interest, and certain royalties.
Dividends and interest are returns on capital investments, such as stocks, bonds, or savings accounts. Royalties are compensation paid to the owner for the use of property, usually copyrighted material or natural resources such as mines, oil wells, or timber tracts. Royalty compensation may be expressed as a percentage of receipts from using the property or as an amount per unit produced. (See § 416.1110(b) if you receive royalties as part of your trade or business and § 416.1110(e) if you receive royalties in connection with the publication of your work.)
(d)
Rents.
Rents are payments you receive for the use of real or personal property such as land, housing, or machinery. We deduct from rental payments your ordinary and necessary expenses in the same taxable year. These include only those expenses necessary for the production or collection of the rental income and they must be deducted when paid, not when they are incurred. Some examples of deductible expenses are interest on debts, State and local taxes on real and personal property and on motor fuels, general sales taxes, and expenses of managing or maintaining the property. (Sections 163, 164, and 212 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and related regulations explain this in more detail.) We do not consider depreciation or depletion of property a deductible expense. (See § 416.1110(b) for rules on rental income that is earned from self-employment. For example, you may be in the business of renting properties.)
(e)
Death benefits.
We count payments you get which were occasioned by the death of another person except for the amount of such payments that you spend on the deceased person's last illness and burial expenses. Last illness and burial expenses include related hospital and medical expenses, funeral, burial plot and interment expenses, and other related costs.

# Example:
If you receive $2,000 from your uncle's life insurance policy and you spend $900 on his last illness and burial expenses, the balance, $1,100, is unearned income. If you spend the entire $2,000 for the last illness and burial, there is no unearned income.
(f)
Prizes and awards.
A prize is generally something you win in a contest, lottery or game of chance. An award is usually something you receive as the result of a decision by a court, board of arbitration, or the like.
(g)
Gifts and inheritances.
A gift is something you receive which is not repayment to you for goods or services you provided and which is not given to you because of a legal obligation on the giver's part. An inheritance is something that comes to you as a result of someone's death. It can be in cash or in kind, including any right in real or personal property. Gifts and inheritances occasioned by the death of another person, to the extent that they are used to pay the expenses of the deceased's last illness and burial, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, are not considered income.
(h)
Support and maintenance in-kind.
This is shelter furnished to you that we value depending on your living arrangement. (Food is not included in the calculations of in-kind support and maintenance.) We use one rule if you are living in another person's household, you receive shelter from others living in the household, and others within the household pay for or provide you with all of your meals. We use different rules for other situations in which you receive shelter. We discuss all of the rules in §§ 416.1130 through 416.1148.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 56 FR 36000, July 30, 1991; 59 FR 43471, Aug. 24, 1994; 70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005; 89 FR 21209, Mar. 27, 2024]
§ 416.1123
How we count unearned income.
(a)
When we count unearned income.
We count unearned income at the earliest of the following points: when you receive it or when it is credited to your account or set aside for your use. We determine your unearned income for each month. We describe exceptions to the rule on how we count unearned income in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section.
(b)
Amount considered as income.
We may include more or less of your unearned income than you actually receive.
(1) We include more than you actually receive where another benefit payment (such as a social security insurance benefit) (see § 416.1121) has been reduced to recover a previous overpayment. You are repaying a legal obligation through the withholding of portions of your benefit amount, and the amount of the debt reduction is also part of your unearned income.
Exception:
We do not include more than you actually receive if you received both SSI benefits and the other benefit at the time the overpayment of the other benefit occurred and the overpaid amount was included in figuring your SSI benefit at that time.

# Example:
Joe, an SSI beneficiary, is also entitled to social security insurance benefits
in the amount of $200 per month. However, because of a prior overpayment of his social security insurance benefits, $20 per month is being withheld to recover the overpayment. In figuring the amount of his SSI benefits, the full monthly social security insurance benefit of $200 is included in Joe's unearned income. However, if Joe was receiving both benefits when the overpayment of the social security insurance benefit occurred and we then included the overpaid amount as income, we will compute his SSI benefit on the basis of receiving $180 as a social security insurance benefit. This is because we recognize that we computed his SSI benefit on the basis of the higher amount when he was overpaid.
(2) We also include more than you actually receive if amounts are withheld from unearned income because of a garnishment, or to pay a debt or other legal obligation, or to make any other payment such as payment of your Medicare premiums.
(3) We include less than you actually receive if part of the payment is for an expense you had in getting the payment. For example, if you are paid for damages you receive in an accident, we subtract from the amount of the payment your medical, legal, or other expenses connected with the accident. If you receive a retroactive check from a benefit program other than SSI, legal fees connected with the claim are subtracted. We do not subtract from any taxable unearned income the part you have to use to pay personal income taxes. The payment of taxes is not an expense you have in getting income.
(4) In certain situations, we may consider someone else's income to be available to you, whether or not it actually is. (For the rules on this process, called deeming, see §§ 416.1160 through 416.1169.)
(c)
In-kind income.
We use the current market value (defined in § 416.1101) of in-kind unearned income to determine its value for SSI purposes. We describe some exceptions to this rule in §§ 416.1131 through 416.1147. If you receive an item that is not fully paid for and are responsible for the balance, only the paid-up value is income to you.

# Example:
You are given a $1500 automobile but must pay the $1000 due on it. You are receiving income of $500.
(d)
Retroactive monthly social security benefits.
We count retroactive monthly social security benefits according to the rule in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, unless the exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section applies:
(1)
Periods for which SSI payments have been made.
When you file an application for social security benefits and retroactive monthly social security benefits are payable on that application for a period for which you also received SSI payments (including federally-administered State supplementary payments), we count your retroactive monthly social security benefits as unearned income received in that period. Rather than reducing your SSI payments in months prior to your receipt of a retroactive monthly social security benefit, we will reduce the retroactive social security benefits by an amount equal to the amount of SSI payments (including federally-administered State supplementary payments) that we would not have paid to you if your social security benefits had been paid when regularly due rather than retroactively (see § 404.408b(b)). If a balance is due you from your retroactive social security benefits after this reduction, for SSI purposes we will not count the balance as unearned income in a subsequent month in which you receive it. This is because your social security benefits were used to determine the amount of the reduction. This exception to the unearned income counting rule does not apply to any monthly social security benefits for a period for which you did not receive SSI.
(2)
Social security disability benefits where drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.
If your retroactive social security benefits must be paid in installments because of the limitations on paying lump sum retroactive benefits to disabled recipients whose drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability as described in § 404.480, we will count the total of such retroactive social security benefits as unearned income in the first month such installments are paid, except to the extent the rule in paragraph (d)(1) of this section would provide that such benefits not be counted.
(e)
Certain veterans benefits.
(1) If you receive a veterans benefit that includes an amount paid to you because of a dependent, we do not count as your unearned income the amount paid to you because of the dependent.
(2) If you are a dependent of an individual who receives a veterans benefit and a portion of the benefit is attributable to you as a dependent, we count the amount attributable to you as your unearned cash income if—
(i) You reside with the individual who receives the veterans benefit, or
(ii) You receive your own separate payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
(f)
Uniformed service compensation.
We count compensation for services performed as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in § 404.1330 of this chapter) as received in the month in which it is earned.
(Reporting and recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (b) have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0960-0128)

§ 416.1124
Unearned income we do not count.
(a)
General.
While we must know the source and amount of all of your unearned income for SSI, we do not count all of it to determine your eligibility and benefit amount. We first exclude income as authorized by other Federal laws (see paragraph (b) of this section). Then we apply the other exclusions in the order listed in paragraph (c) of this section to the rest of your unearned income in the month. We never reduce your unearned income below zero or apply any unused unearned income exclusion to earned income except for the $20 general exclusion described in paragraph (c)(12) of this section.
(b)
Other Federal laws.
Some Federal laws other than the Social Security Act provide that we cannot count some of your unearned income for SSI purposes. We list the laws and the exclusions in the appendix to this subpart which we update periodically.
(c)
Other unearned income we do not count.
We do not count as unearned income—
(1) Any public agency's refund of taxes on real property or food;
(2) Assistance based on need which is wholly funded by a State or one of its political subdivisions. (For purposes of this rule, an Indian tribe is considered a political subdivision of a State.) Assistance is based on need when it is provided under a program which uses the amount of your income as one factor to determine your eligibility. Assistance based on need includes State supplementation of Federal SSI benefits as defined in subpart T of this part but does not include payments under a Federal/State grant program such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families under title IV-A of the Social Security Act;
(3) Any portion of a grant, scholarship, fellowship, or gift used or set aside for paying tuition, fees, or other necessary educational expenses. However, we do count any portion set aside or actually used for food or shelter;
(4) Food which you or your spouse raise if it is consumed by you or your household;
(5) Assistance received under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and assistance provided under any Federal statute because of a catastrophe which the President of the United States declares to be a major disaster. See § 416.1150 for a more detailed discussion of this assistance, particularly the treatment of in-kind support and maintenance received as the result of a major disaster;
(6) The first $60 of unearned income received in a calendar quarter if you receive it infrequently or irregularly. We consider income to be received infrequently if you receive it only once during a calendar quarter from a single source and you did not receive it in the month immediately preceding that month or in the month immediately subsequent to that month. We consider income to be received irregularly if you cannot reasonably expect to receive it.
(7) Alaska Longevity Bonus payments made to an individual who is a resident of Alaska and who, prior to
October 1, 1985: met the 25-year residency requirement for receipt of such payments in effect prior to January 1, 1983; and was eligible for SSI;
(8) Payments for providing foster care to an ineligible child who was placed in your home by a public or private nonprofit child placement or child care agency;
(9) Any interest earned on excluded burial funds and any appreciation in the value of an excluded burial arrangement which are left to accumulate and become a part of the separate burial fund. (See § 416.1231 for an explanation of the exclusion of burial assets.) This exclusion from income applies to interest earned on burial funds or appreciation in the value of excluded burial arrangements which occur beginning November 1, 1982, or the date you first become eligible for SSI benefits, if later;
(10) Certain support and maintenance assistance as described in § 416.1157;
(11) One-third of support payments made to or for you by an absent parent if you are a child;
(12) The first $20 of any unearned income in a month other than income in the form of in-kind support and maintenance received in the household of another (see § 416.1131) and income based on need. Income based on need is a benefit that uses financial need as measured by your income as a factor to determine your eligibility. The $20 exclusion does not apply to a benefit based on need that is totally or partially funded by the Federal government or by a nongovernmental agency. However, assistance which is based on need and funded wholly by a State or one of its political subdivisions is excluded totally from income as described in § 416.1124(c)(2). If you have less than $20 of unearned income in a month and you have earned income in that month, we will use the rest of the $20 exclusion to reduce the amount of your countable earned income;
(13) Any unearned income you receive and use to fulfill an approved plan to achieve self-support if you are blind or disabled and under age 65 or blind or disabled and received SSI as a blind or disabled person for the month before you reached age 65. See §§ 416.1180 through 416.1182 for an explanation of plans to achieve self-support and for the rules on when this exclusion applies;
(14) The value of any assistance paid with respect to a dwelling unit under—
(i) The United States Housing Act of 1937;
(ii) The National Housing Act;
(iii) Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965;
(iv) Title V of the Housing Act of 1949; or
(v) Section 202(h) of the Housing Act of 1959;
(15) Any interest accrued on and left to accumulate as part of the value of an excluded burial space purchase agreement. This exclusion from income applies to interest accrued on or after April 1, 1990;
(16) The value of any commercial transportation ticket, for travel by you or your spouse among the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands, which is received as a gift by you or your spouse and is not converted to cash. If such a ticket is converted to cash, the cash you receive is income in the month you receive the cash;
(17) Payments received by you from a fund established by a State to aid victims of crime;
(18) Relocation assistance provided you by a State or local government that is comparable to assistance provided under title II of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 that is subject to the treatment required by section 216 of that Act;
(19) Special pay received from one of the uniformed services pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 310;
(20) Interest or other earnings on a dedicated account which is excluded from resources. (See § 416.1247);
(21) Gifts from an organization as described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code, to, or for the benefit of, an individual who has not attained 18 years of age and who has a
life-threatening condition. We will exclude any in-kind gift that is not converted to cash and cash gifts to the extent that the total gifts excluded pursuant to this paragraph do not exceed $2000 in any calendar year. In-kind gifts converted to cash are considered under income counting rules in the month of conversion;
(22) Interest and dividend income from a countable resource or from a resource excluded under a Federal statute other than section 1613(a) of the Social Security Act; and
(23) AmeriCorps State and National and AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps cash or in-kind payments to AmeriCorps participants or on AmeriCorps participants' behalf. These include, but are not limited to: Food and shelter, and clothing allowances;
(24) Any annuity paid by a State to a person (or his or her spouse) based on the State's determination that the person is:

# In-Kind Support and Maintenance
§ 416.1130
Introduction.
(a)
General.
Both earned income and unearned income include items received in- kind (see § 416.1102). Generally, we value in-kind items at their current market value, and we apply the various exclusions for both earned and unearned income. However, we have special rules for valuing shelter that is received as in-kind support and maintenance (a type of unearned income). This section and the ones that follow discuss these rules. In these sections (
i.e.,
§§ 416.1130 through 416.1148) we use the in-kind support and maintenance you receive in the month as described in § 416.420 to determine your SSI benefit. We value the in-kind support and maintenance using the Federal benefit rate for the month in which you receive it.
Exception:
For the first 2 months for which a cost-of-living adjustment applies, we value in-kind support and maintenance you receive using the VTR or PMV based on the Federal benefit rate as increased by the cost-of-living adjustment.
Example:
Mr. Jones resides in his son's house and receives all of his meals from his son. Mr. Jones receives a monthly SSI Federal benefit rate that is reduced by one-third. This one-third represents the value of the in-kind support and maintenance he receives because he lives, throughout a month, in the household of his son, who provides all of his food and shelter. In January, we increase his SSI benefit because of a cost-of-living adjustment. For that month, we determine that the VTR rule applies by considering the food and shelter he received from his son two months earlier in November, and we calculate the SSI payment using the Federal benefit rate for January.
(b)
How we calculate in-kind support and maintenance.
(1) We calculate in-kind support and maintenance considering any shelter that is given to you or that you receive because someone else pays for it. Shelter includes room, rent, mortgage payments, real property taxes, heating fuel, gas, electricity, water, sewerage, and garbage collection services. You are not receiving in-kind support and maintenance in the form of room or rent if you are paying the amount charged under a business arrangement. A business arrangement exists when the amount of monthly required rent to be paid equals or exceeds the presumed maximum value described in § 416.1140(a)(1). If the required amount of rent is less than the presumed maximum value, we will impute as in-kind support and maintenance the difference between the required amount of rent and either the presumed maximum value or the current market rental value (see § 416.1101), whichever is less. In addition, cash payments to uniformed service members as allowances for on-base
housing or privatized military housing are in-kind support and maintenance.
(2) We have two rules for valuing the in-kind support and maintenance that we count. The one-third reduction rule applies if you are living in another person's household, you receive shelter from others living in the household, and others within the household pay for or provide you with all of your meals (see §§ 416.1131 through 416.1133). The presumed value rule applies in all other situations in which you receive countable in-kind support and maintenance (see §§ 416.1140 through 416.1145). If certain conditions exist, we do not count in-kind support and maintenance. These conditions are discussed in §§ 416.1141 through 416.1145.
[89 FR 21209, Mar. 27, 2024, as amended at 89 FR 25514, Apr. 11, 2024]
§ 416.1131
The one-third reduction rule.
(a)
What the rule is.
Instead of determining the actual dollar value of in-kind support and maintenance, we count one-third of the Federal benefit rate as additional income if you (or you and your eligible spouse)—
(1) Live in another person's household (see § 416.1132) for a full calendar month except for temporary absences (see § 416.1149); and
(2) Receive shelter from others living in the household. (If you do not receive shelter from others living in the household, see § 416.1140); and
(3) Others within the household pay for or provide you with all of your meals. If others within the household do not pay for or provide you with all of your meals, any ISM received for shelter will be calculated under the PMV rule (see § 416.1140).
(b)
How we apply the one-third reduction rule.
The one-third reduction applies in full or not at all. When you are living in another person's household, and the one-third reduction rule applies, we do not apply any income exclusions to the reduction amount. However, we do apply appropriate exclusions to any other earned or unearned income you receive. If you have an eligible spouse we apply the rules described in § 416.1147.
(c)
If you receive other support and maintenance.
If the one-third reduction rule applies to you, we do not count any other in-kind support and maintenance you receive.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 50 FR 48574, Nov. 26, 1985; 89 FR 21210, Mar. 27, 2024]
§ 416.1132
What we mean by “living in another person's household”.
(a)
Household.
For purposes of this subpart, we consider a household to be a personal place of residence. A commercial establishment such as a hotel or boarding house is not a household but a household can exist within a commercial establishment. If you live in a commercial establishment, we do not automatically consider you to be a member of the household of the proprietor. You may, however, live in the household of a roomer or boarder within the hotel or boarding house. An institution is not a household and a household cannot exist within an institution. (Institution is defined in § 416.1101.)
(b)
Another person's household.
You live in another person's household if paragraph (c) of this section does not apply and if the person who supplies the support and maintenance lives in the same household and is not—
(1) Your spouse (as defined in § 416.1806);
(2) A minor child; or
(3) An ineligible person (your spouse, parent, or essential person) whose income may be deemed to you as described in §§ 416.1160 through 416.1169.
(c)
Your own household—not another person's household.
You are not living in another person's household (you live in your own household) if—
(1) You (or your spouse who lives with you or any person whose income is deemed to you) have an ownership interest or a life estate interest in the home;
(2) You (or your spouse who lives with you or any person whose income is deemed to you) are liable to the landlord for payment of any part of the rental charges;
(3) You live in a noninstitutional care situation as described in § 416.1143;
(4) You pay at least a pro rata share of household and operating expenses (see § 416.1133); or
(5) All members of the household receive public income—maintenance payments (§ 416.1142).
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 50 FR 48574, Nov. 26, 1985]
§ 416.1133
What is a pro rata share of household operating expenses.
(a)
General.
If you pay your pro rata share toward monthly household operating expenses, you are living in your own household and are not receiving in-kind support and maintenance from anyone else in the household. The one-third reduction, therefore, does not apply to you. (If you are receiving shelter from someone outside the household, we value it under the rule in § 416.1140.)
(b)
How we determine a pro rata share.
Your pro rata share of household operating expenses is the average monthly household operating expenses (based on a reasonable estimate if exact figures are not available) divided by the number of people in the household, regardless of age.
(c) Household operating expenses are the household's total monthly expenditures for rent, mortgage, property taxes, heating fuel, gas, electricity, water, sewerage, and garbage collection service. (The term does not include the cost of these items if someone outside the household pays for them.) Generally, we average household operating expenses over the past 12 months to determine a pro rata share.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005; 89 FR 21210, Mar. 27, 2024]
§ 416.1140
The presumed value rule.
(a)
How we apply the presumed value rule.
(1) When you receive in-kind support and maintenance and the one-third reduction rule does not apply, we use the presumed value rule. Instead of determining the actual dollar value of any shelter you receive, we presume that it is worth a maximum value. This maximum value is one-third of your Federal benefit rate plus the amount of the general income exclusion described in § 416.1124(c)(12).
(2) The presumed value rule allows you to show that your in-kind support and maintenance is not equal to the presumed value. We will not use the presumed value if you show us that—
(i) The current market value of any shelter you receive, minus any payment you make for it, is lower than the presumed value; or
(ii) The actual amount someone else pays for your shelter is lower than the presumed value.
(b)
How we determine the amount of your ISM under the presumed value rule.
(1) If you choose not to question the use of the presumed value, or if the presumed value is less than the actual value of the shelter you receive, we use the presumed value to figure your ISM.
(2) If you show us, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that the presumed value is higher than the actual value of the shelter you receive, we use the actual amount to figure your ISM.
[89 FR 21210, Mar. 27, 2024]
§ 416.1141
When the presumed value rule applies.
The presumed value rule applies whenever we count in-kind support and maintenance as unearned income and the one-third reduction rule does not apply. This means that the presumed value rule applies if you are living—
(a) In another person's household (as described in § 416.1132(b)); you receive shelter from others living in the household; and others within the household do not pay for or provide you with all of your meals;
(b) In your own household (as described in § 416.1132(c)). For exceptions, see § 416.1142 if you are in a public assistance household and § 416.1143 if you are in a noninstitutional case situation; or
(c) In a nonmedical institution including any—
(1) Public nonmedical institution if you are there for less than a full calendar month;
(2) Public or private nonprofit educational or vocational training institution;
(3) Private nonprofit retirement home or similar institution where there is an express obligation to provide your full support and maintenance or where someone else pays for your support and maintenance. For exceptions, see § 416.1144; and
(4) For-profit institution where someone else pays for your support and maintenance. If you or the institution pay for it, see § 416.1145.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 89 FR 21210, Mar. 27, 2024]
§ 416.1142
If you live in a public assistance household.
(a)
Definition.
For purposes of our programs, a public assistance household is one that has both an SSI applicant or recipient, and at least one other household member who receives one or more of the listed public income maintenance payments. These are payments made under—
(1) Title IV-A of the Social Security Act (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families);
(2) Title XVI of the Social Security Act (SSI, including federally administered State supplements and State administered mandatory supplements);
(3) The Refugee Act of 1980 (Those payments based on need);
(4) The Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
(5) General assistance programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs;
(6) State or local government assistance programs based on need (tax credits or refunds are not assistance based on need);
(7) U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs programs (those payments based on need); and
(8) The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
(b)
How the presumed value rule applies.
If you live in a public assistance household, we consider that you are not receiving in-kind support and maintenance from members of the household. In this situation, we use the presumed value rule only if you receive food or shelter from someone outside the household.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 57 FR 53850, Nov. 13, 1992; 70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005; 70 FR 41137, July 18, 2005; 89 FR 28622, Apr. 19, 2024]
§ 416.1143
If you live in a noninstitutional care situation.
(a)
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart you live in a noninstitutional care situation if all the following conditions exist:
(1) You are placed by a public or private agency under a specific program such as foster or family care;
(2) The placing agency is responsible for your care;
(3) You are in a private household (not an institution) which is licensed or approved by the placing agency to provide care; and
(4) You, a public agency, or someone else pays for your care.
(b)
How the presumed value rule applies.
You are not receiving in-kind support and maintenance and the presumed value rule does not apply if you pay the rate the placing agency establishes. We consider this established rate to be the current market value for the in-kind support and maintenance you are receiving. The presumed value rule applies if you pay less than the established rate and the difference is paid by someone else other than a public or private agency providing social services described in § 416.1103(b) or assistance based on need described in § 416.1124(c)(2).
§ 416.1144
If you live in a nonprofit retirement home or similar institution.
(a)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section the following definitions apply:
(1)
Nonprofit retirement home or similar institution
means a nongovernmental institution as defined under § 416.1101, which is, or is controlled by, a private nonprofit organization and which does not provide you with—
(i) Services which are (or could be) covered under Medicaid, or
(ii) Education or vocational training.
(2)
Nonprofit organization
means a private organization which is tax exempt under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and is of the kind described in section 501 (c) or (d) of that code.
(3) An
express obligation to provide your full support and maintenance
means there is either a legally enforceable written contract or set of membership rules providing that the home, institution, or organization—
(i) Will provide at least all of your food and shelter needs; and
(ii) Does not require any current or future payment for that food and shelter. (For purposes of this paragraph, a
lump sum prepayment for lifetime care is not a current payment.)
(b)
How the presumed value rule applies.
The presumed value rule applies if you are living in a nonprofit retirement home or similar institution where there is an express obligation to provide your full support and maintenance or where someone else pays for your support and maintenance. The rule does not apply to the extent that—
(1) The home, institution, or nonprofit organization does not have an express obligation to provide your full support and maintenance; and
(2) The home, institution, or nonprofit organization receives no payment for your food or shelter, or receives payment from another nonprofit organization.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 34464, Sept. 29, 1986; 70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005]
§ 416.1145
How the presumed value rule applies in a nonmedical for-profit institution.
If you live in a nonmedical for-profit institution, we consider the amount accepted by that institution as payment in full to be the current market value of whatever food or shelter the institution provides. If you are paying or are legally indebted for that amount, you are not receiving in-kind support and maintenance. We do not use the presumed value rule unless someone else pays for you.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005]

# In-Kind Support and Maintenance in Special Circumstances
§ 416.1147
How we value in-kind support and maintenance for a couple.
(a)
Both members of a couple live in another person's household and receive shelter and all of their meals from others living in the household.
When both of you live in another person's household throughout a month, receive shelter from others living in the household, and others within the household pay for or provide you with all of your meals, we apply the one-third reduction to the Federal benefit rate for a couple (§ 416.1131).
(b)
One member of a couple is in a medical institution and the other member of the couple lives in another person's household and receives shelter and all of their meals from others living in the household.
(1) If one of you is living in the household of another person and receives shelter from others living in the household, and others within the household pay for or provide you with all of your meals, and the other is temporarily absent from the household as provided in § 416.1149(c)(1) (in a medical institution that receives substantial Medicaid payments for their care (§ 416.211(b))), and is ineligible in the month for either benefit payable under § 416.212, we compute your benefits as if you were separately eligible individuals (see § 416.414(b)(3)). This begins with the first full calendar month that one of you is in the medical institution. The one living in another person's household is eligible at an eligible individual's Federal benefit rate and one-third of that rate is counted as income not subject to any income exclusions. The one in the medical institution cannot receive more than the reduced benefit described in § 416.414(b)(3)(i).
(2) If the one member of the couple in the institution is eligible for one of the benefits payable under the § 416.212 provisions, we compute benefits as a couple at the rate specified under § 416.412. However, if that one member remains in the institution for a full month after expiration of the period benefits based on § 416.212 can be paid, benefits will be computed as if each person were separately eligible as described under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This begins with the first calendar month after expiration of the period benefits based on § 416.212 can be paid.
(c)
Both members of a couple are subject to the presumed value rule.
If the presumed value rule applies to both of you, we value any shelter you and your spouse receive at one-third of the Federal benefit rate for a couple plus the amount of the general income exclusion (§ 416.1124(c)(12)), unless you can show that its value is less as described in § 416.1140(a)(2).
(d)
One member of a couple is subject to the presumed value rule and the other member is in a medical institution.
(1) If one of you is subject to the presumed value rule and the other is temporarily absent from the household as provided
in § 416.1149(c)(1) (in a medical institution that receives substantial Medicaid payments for his or her care (§ 416.211(b))), and is ineligible in that month for either benefit payable under § 416.212, we compute your benefits as if both members of the couple are separately eligible individuals (see § 416.414(b)(3)). This begins with the first full calendar month that one of you is in the medical institution (see § 416.211(b)). We value any shelter received by the one outside of the medical institution at one-third of an eligible individual's Federal benefit rate, plus the amount of the general income exclusion (§ 416.1124(c)(12)), unless you can show that its value is less as described in § 416.1140(a)(2). The member of the couple in the medical institution cannot receive more than the reduced benefit described in § 416.414(b)(3)(i).
(2) If one of you is subject to the presumed value rule and the other in the institution is eligible for one of the benefits payable under § 416.212, we compute the benefits as a couple at the rate specified under § 416.412. However, if the one in the institution remains in the institution after the period benefits based on § 416.212 can be paid, we will compute benefits as if each member of the couple were separately eligible as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
[60 FR 16375, Mar. 30, 1995, as amended at 61 FR 10279, Mar. 13, 1996; 70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005; 89 FR 21210, Mar. 27, 2024]
§ 416.1147a
Income rules in change-of-status situations involving in-kind support and maintenance.
(a)
General.
This section explains the rules for determining countable income, including in-kind support and maintenance, when eligible individuals become an eligible couple or when an eligible couple becomes eligible individuals. Generally, under retrospective monthly accounting, income in a prior month, including in-kind support and maintenance, affects benefit amounts for a current month. The prior month may be the first or second month prior to the current month (as explained in § 416.420(a)) and the rules in this section apply when a change-of-status becomes effective between the prior month and the current month.
(b)
Eligible individuals become an eligible couple.
If you and your spouse have been eligible individuals and become an eligible couple, we combine the earned and unearned income each of you had as an eligible individual in the prior month. If either or both of you received in-kind support and maintenance, we include its value as income. This may be one-third of the Federal benefit rate that applied in the prior month for one or both of you who lived in the household of another. It may be the presumed maximum value (one-third of the Federal benefit rate plus $20 as explained in § 416.1140) for one or both of you as appropriate. It may also be a combination of the two if each of you received income in one of these forms. We also include income deemed to either or both of you in the prior month.
(c)
Eligible couple becomes one or two eligible individuals.
If you are an eligible individual in the current month but were a member of an eligible couple in the prior month, we determine your countable income in the prior month separately from that of your spouse. We determine the value of any in-kind support and maintenance you and your spouse received in the prior month using the rules contained in § 416.1147. For example, if both of you lived in the household of another and the one-third reduction applied, each of you would have income equal to one-sixth of the Federal benefit rate for a couple. Also, for example, if you received in-kind support and maintenance and the presumed maximum value applied, you would have income equal to one-sixth of the Federal benefit rate for a couple, plus $10. We divide any other income you had as an eligible couple according to who owned the income. If ownership of jointly owned income cannot be determined, we allocate one-half of it to you.
[50 FR 48575, Nov. 26, 1985]
§ 416.1148
If you have both in-kind support and maintenance and income that is deemed to you.
(a)
The one-third reduction and deeming of income.
If you live in the household of your spouse, parent, essential person, or sponsor whose income can be deemed to you, or the household of a parent whose income is not deemed to
you because of the provisions of § 416.1165(i), the one-third reduction does not apply to you. The rules on deeming income are in §§ 416.1160 through 416.1169. However, if you live in another person's household as described in § 416.1131, and someone whose income can be deemed to you lives in the same household, we must apply both the one-third reduction and the deeming rules to you.
(b)
The presumed value rule and deeming of income.
(1) If you live in the same household with someone whose income can be deemed to you (§§ 416.1160 through 416.1169), or with a parent whose income is not deemed to you because of the provisions of § 416.1165(i), any shelter that person provides is not income to you. However, if you receive any shelter from another source, it is income and we value it under the presumed value rule (§ 416.1140). We also apply the deeming rules.
(2) If you are a child under age 18 who lives in the same household with an ineligible parent whose income may be deemed to you, and you are temporarily absent from the household to attend school (§ 416.1167(b)), any shelter you receive at school is income to you unless your parent purchases it. Unless otherwise excluded, we value this income under the presumed value rule (§ 416.1140). We also apply the deeming rules to you (§ 416.1165).
[60 FR 361, Jan. 4, 1995, as amended at 70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005; 89 FR 21211, Mar. 27, 2024]

# Temporary Absence
§ 416.1149
What is a temporary absence from your living arrangement.
(a)
General.
A temporary absence may be due to employment, hospitalization, vacations, or visits. The length of time an absence can be temporary varies depending on the reason for your absence. For purposes of valuing in-kind support and maintenance under §§ 416.1130 through 416.1148, we apply the rules in this section. In general, we will find a temporary absence from your permanent living arrangement if you (or you and your eligible spouse)—
(1) Become a resident of a public institution, or a public or private medical treatment facility where you otherwise would be subject to the reduced benefit rate described in § 416.414, and you are eligible for the benefits payable under § 416.212; or
(2) Were in your permanent living arrangement for at least 1 full calendar month prior to the absence and intend to, and do, return to your permanent living arrangement in the same calendar month in which you (or you and your spouse) leave, or in the next month.
(b)
Rules we apply during a temporary absence.
During a temporary absence, we continue to value your support and maintenance the same way that we did in your permanent living arrangement. For example, if the one-third reduction applies in your permanent living arrangement, we continue to apply the same rule during a temporary absence. However, if you receive in-kind support and maintenance only during a temporary absence we do not count it since you are still responsible for maintaining your permanent quarters during the absence.
(c)
Rules for temporary absence in certain circumstances.
(1)(i) If you enter a medical treatment facility where you are eligible for the reduced benefits payable under § 416.414 for full months in the facility, and you are not eligible for either benefit payable under § 416.212 (and you have not received such benefits during your current period of confinement) and you intend to return to your prior living arrangement, we consider this a temporary absence regardless of the length of your stay in the facility. We use the rules that apply to your permanent living arrangement to value any shelter you receive during the month (for which reduced benefits under § 416.414 are not payable) you enter or leave the facility. During any full calendar month you are in the medical treatment facility, you cannot receive more than the Federal benefit rate described in § 416.414(b)(1). We do not consider shelter provided during a medical confinement to be income.
(ii) If you enter a medical treatment facility and you are eligible for either benefit payable under § 416.212, we also consider this a temporary absence from your permanent living arrangement.
We use the rules that apply to your permanent living arrangement to value any shelter you receive during the month you enter the facility and throughout the period you are eligible for these benefits. We consider your absence to be temporary through the last month benefits under § 416.212 are paid unless you are discharged from the facility in the following month. In that case, we consider your absence to be temporary through the date of discharge.
(2)(i) Generally, if you are a child under age 22, you are temporarily absent while you are away at school, regardless of how long you are away, if you come home on some weekends, lengthy holidays, and vacations (or for extended visits as provided in school regulations).
(ii) However, if you are a child under age 18, and your permanent living arrangement is with an ineligible parent or essential person (§ 416.222), we follow the rules in § 416.1148(b)(2). When you reach age 18, or if you are under age 18 and deeming does not apply, we consider the circumstances of your permanent living arrangement to value any in-kind support and maintenance you receive.

# Disasters
§ 416.1150
How we treat income received because of a major disaster.
(a)
General.
The Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and other Federal statutes provide assistance to victims of major disasters. In this section we describe when we do not count certain kinds of assistance you receive under these statutes.
(b)
Support and maintenance.
(1) We do not count the value of support and maintenance (in cash or in kind) received from a Federal, State, or local government source, or from a disaster assistance organization, and the one-third reduction rule does not apply if—
(i) You live in a household which you or you and another person maintain as your home when a catastrophe occurs in the area;
(ii) The President of the United States declares the catastrophe to be a major disaster for purposes of the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
(iii) You stop living in the home because of the catastrophe and within 30 days after the catastrophe you begin to receive support and maintenance; and
(iv) You receive the support and maintenance while living in a residential facility maintained by another person.
(2) We do not count the value of support and maintenance (in cash or in kind) received from any other source, such as from a private household, and the one-third reduction rule does not apply for up to 18 months after you begin to receive it if—
(i) You live in a household which you or you and another person maintain as your home when a catastrophe occurs in the area;
(ii) The President of the United States declares the catastrophe to be a major disaster for purposes of the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act;
(iii) You stop living in the home because of the catastrophe and within 30 days after the catastrophe you begin to receive support and maintenance; and
(iv) You receive the support and maintenance while living in a residential facility (including a private household) maintained by another person.
(c)
Other assistance you receive.
We do not consider other assistance to be income if you receive it under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act or under another Federal statute because of a catastrophe which the President declares to be a major disaster or if you receive it from a State or local government or from a disaster assistance organization. For example, you may receive payments to repair or replace your home or other property.
(d)
Interest payments.
We do not count any interest earned on the assistance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section.
[57 FR 53850, Nov. 13, 1992]
§ 416.1151
How we treat the repair or replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen resources.
(a)
General rule.
If a resource is lost, damaged, or stolen, you may receive cash to repair or replace it or the resource may be repaired or replaced for you. We do not count the cash or the repair or replacement of the resource as your income.
(b)
Interest on cash for repair or replacement of a noncash resource.
We do not count any interest earned on the cash you receive for repair or replacement of a noncash resource if the interest is earned within 9 months of the date you receive the cash. We can extend the 9-month period for up to an additional 9 months if we find you have good cause for not repairing or replacing the resource within the initial period. Good cause exists, for example, if you show that circumstances beyond your control prevent the repair or replacement, or contracting for the repair or replacement, of the resource within the first 9-month period.
(c)
Temporary replacement of a damaged or destroyed home.
In determining the amount of in-kind support and maintenance you receive (§§ 416.1130 through 416.1140), we do not count temporary housing if—
(1) Your excluded home is damaged or destroyed, and
(2) You receive the temporary housing only until your home is repaired or replaced.

# Home Energy Assistance
§ 416.1157
Support and maintenance assistance.
(a)
General.
Section 2639 of Pub. L. 98-369, effective October 1, 1984, amended section 1612(b)(13) to provide that certain support and maintenance assistance, which includes home energy assistance, be excluded from countable income for SSI purposes. This section discusses how we apply section 1612(b)(13).
(b)
Definitions.
For support and maintenance assistance purposes—
Appropriate State agency
means the agency designated by the chief executive officer of the State to handle the State's responsibilities as set out in paragraph (c) of this section.
Based on need
means that the provider of the assistance:
(1) Does not have an express obligation to provide the assistance;
(2) States that the aid is given for the purpose of support or maintenance assistance or for home energy assistance (e.g., vouchers for heating or cooling bills, storm doors); and
(3) Provides the aid for an SSI claimant, a member of the household in which an SSI claimant lives or an SSI claimant's ineligible spouse, parent, sponsor (or the sponsor's spouse) of an alien, or essential person.
Private nonprofit agency
means a religious, charitable, educational, or other organization such as described in section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. (Actual tax exempt certification by IRS is not necessary.)
Rate-of-return entity
means an entity whose revenues are primarily received from the entity's charges to the public for goods or services and such charges are based on rates regulated by a State or Federal governmental body.
Support and maintenance assistance
means cash provided for the purpose of meeting food or shelter needs or in-kind support and maintenance as defined in § 416.1121(h). Support and maintenance assistance includes home energy assistance. Home energy assistance means any assistance related to meeting the costs of heating or cooling a home. Home energy assistance includes such items as payments for utility service or bulk fuels; assistance in kind such as portable heaters, fans, blankets, storm doors, or other items which help reduce the costs of heating and cooling such as conservation or weatherization materials and services; etc.
(c)
What assistance we do not count as income.
We do not count as income certain support and maintenance assistance received on or after October 1, 1984, by you or your ineligible spouse, parent, sponsor (or your sponsor's spouse) if you are an alien, or an essential person. We also do not consider certain support and maintenance assistance in determining a pro rata share of household operating expenses under § 416.1133. We do not count that assistance which is certified in writing
by the appropriate State agency to be both based on need and—
(1) Provided in kind by a private nonprofit agency; or
(2) Provided in cash or in kind by—
(i) A supplier of home heating oil or gas;
(ii) A rate-of-return entity providing home energy; or
(iii) A municipal utility providing home energy.

# Deeming of Income
§ 416.1160
What is deeming of income?
(a)
General.
We use the term deeming to identify the process of considering another person's income to be your own. When the deeming rules apply, it does not matter whether the income of the other person is actually available to you. We must apply these rules anyway. There are four categories of individuals whose income may be deemed to you.
(1)
Ineligible spouse.
If you live in the same household with your ineligible spouse, we look at your spouse's income to decide whether we must deem some of it to you. We do this because we expect your spouse to use some of his or her income to take care of some of your needs.
(2)
Ineligible parent.
If you are a child to whom deeming rules apply (see § 416.1165), we look at your ineligible parent's income to decide whether we must deem some of it to be yours. If you live with both your parent and your parent's spouse (
i.e.
, your stepparent), we also look at your stepparent's income to decide whether we must deem some of it to be yours. We do this because we expect your parent (and your stepparent, if living with you and your parent) to use some of his or her income to take care of your needs.
(3)
Sponsor of an alien.
If you are an alien who has a sponsor and you first apply for SSI benefits after September 30, 1980, we look at your sponsor's income to decide whether we must deem some of it to be yours. This rule applies for 3 years after you are admitted to the United States for permanent residence and regardless of whether you live in the same household as your sponsor. We deem your sponsor's income to you because your sponsor agreed to support you (signed an affidavit of support) as a condition of your admission to the United States. If two deeming rules could apply to you because your sponsor is also your ineligible spouse or parent who lives with you, we use the appropriate spouse-to-spouse or parent-to-child deeming rules instead of the sponsor-to-alien rules. If you have a sponsor and also have an ineligible spouse or parent who is not your sponsor and whose income can be deemed to you, both rules apply. If your sponsor is not your parent or spouse but is the ineligible spouse or parent of another SSI beneficiary, we use the sponsor-to-alien deeming rules for you and the appropriate spouse-to-spouse or parent-to-child deeming rules for the other SSI beneficiary.
(4)
Essential person.
If you live in the same household with your essential person (as defined in § 416.222), we must look at that person's income to decide whether we must deem some of it to you. We do this because we have increased your benefit to help meet the needs of your essential person.
(b)
When we deem.
We deem income to determine whether you are eligible for a benefit and to determine the amount of your benefit. However, we may consider this income in different months for each purpose.
(1)
Eligibility.
We consider the income of your ineligible spouse, ineligible parent, sponsor or essential person in the current month to determine whether you are eligible for SSI benefits for that month.
(2)
Amount of benefit.
We consider the income of your ineligible spouse, ineligible parent, sponsor, or essential person in the second month prior to the current month to determine your benefit amount for the current month.
Exceptions:
(i) We use the income from the first month you are initially eligible for payment of SSI benefits (see § 416.501) to determine your benefit amount for that month. In the following month (the second month you are eligible for payment), we use the same countable income that we used in the preceding
month to determine your benefit amount.
(ii) To determine your benefit amount for the first month you again become eligible after you have been ineligible for at least a month, we use the same countable income that we use to determine your eligibility for that month. In the following month (the second month of reeligibility), we use the same countable income that we used in the preceding month to determine your benefit amount.
(iii) To determine the amount of your benefit in the current month, if there are certain changes in your situation which we list below, we use only your own countable income in a prior month, excluding any income deemed to you in that month from an ineligible spouse or parent. These changes are the death of your spouse or parent, your attainment of age 18, or your becoming subject to the $30 Federal benefit rate (§ 416.211(b)).
(iv) To determine the amount of your benefit for the current month, we do not use income deemed from your essential person beginning with the month you can no longer qualify for the essential person increment (§ 416.413). We use only your own countable income in a prior month to determine the amount of your benefit for the current month.
(c)
Steps in deeming.
Although the way we deem income varies depending upon whether you are an eligible individual, an eligible child, an alien with a sponsor, or an individual with an essential person, we follow several general steps to determine how much income to deem.
(1) We determine how much earned and unearned income your ineligible spouse, ineligible parent, sponsor, or essential person has, and we apply the appropriate exclusions. (See § 416.1161(a) for exclusions that apply to an ineligible parent or spouse, and § 416.1161(b) for those that apply to an essential person or to a sponsor.)
(2) Before we deem income to you from either your ineligible spouse or ineligible parent, we allocate an amount for each ineligible child in the household. (Allocations for ineligible children are explained in §§ 416.1163(b) and 416.1165(b).) We also allocate an amount for each eligible alien who is subject to deeming from your ineligible spouse or parent as a sponsor. (Allocations for eligible aliens are explained in § 416.1163(c).)
(3) We then follow the deeming rules which apply to you.
(i) For deeming income from your ineligible spouse, see § 416.1163.
(ii) For deeming income from your ineligible parent, see § 416.1165.
(iii) For deeming income from your ineligible spouse when you also have an eligible child, see § 416.1166.
(iv) For deeming income from your sponsor if you are an alien, see § 416.1166a.
(v) For deeming income from your essential person, see § 416.1168. The rules on when we stop deeming income from your essential person are in § 416.1169.
(vi) For provisions on change in status involving couples see § 416.1163(f) and for those involving parents see § 416.1165(g).
(d)
Definitions for deeming purposes.
For deeming purposes—
Combat zone
means
(i) Any area the President of the United States designates by Executive Order under 26 U.S.C. 112 as an area in which Armed Forces of the United States are or have engaged in combat;
(ii) A qualified hazardous duty area (QHDA) Congress designates be treated in the same manner as an area designated by the President under 26 U.S.C. 112, provided the member of the uniformed services serving in this area is entitled to special pay under 37 U.S.C. 310; or
(iii) An area where the Secretary of Defense or his or her designated representative has certified that Armed Forces members provide direct support for military operations in an area designated by the President under 26 U.S.C. 112 or a QHDA, provided the member of the uniformed services serving in the area certified by the Secretary of Defense or his or her designated representative is entitled to special pay under 37 U.S.C. 310.
Date of admission to
or
date of entry into the United States
means the date established by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as the date the alien is admitted for permanent residence.
Dependent
means the same thing as it does for Federal income tax purposes—we mean someone for whom you are entitled to take a deduction on your personal income tax return.
Exception:
An alien and an alien's spouse are not considered to be dependents of the alien's sponsor for the purposes of these rules.
Essential person
means someone who was identified as essential to your welfare under a State program that preceded the SSI program. (See §§ 416.220 through 416.223 for the rules on essential persons.)
Ineligible child
means your natural child or adopted child, or the natural or adopted child of your spouse, or the natural or adopted child of your parent or of your parent's spouse (as the term
child
is defined in § 416.1101 and the term
spouse
is defined in § 416.1806), who lives in the same household with you, and is not eligible for SSI benefits.
Ineligible parent
means a natural or adoptive parent, or the spouse (as defined in § 416.1101) of a natural or adoptive parent, who lives with you and is not eligible for SSI benefits. The income of ineligible parents affects your benefit only if you are a child under age 18.
Ineligible spouse
means someone who lives with you as your husband or wife and is not eligible for SSI benefits.
Sponsor
means an individual (but not an organization such as the congregation of a church or a service club, or an employer who only guarantees employment for an alien upon entry but does not sign an affidavit of support) who signs an affidavit of support agreeing to support you as a condition of your admission as an alien for permanent residence in the United States.
[52 FR 8882, Mar. 20, 1987, as amended at 54 FR 19164, May 4, 1989; 64 FR 31974, June 15, 1999; 73 FR 28035, May 15, 2008; 75 FR 7554, Feb. 22, 2010]
§ 416.1161
Income of an ineligible spouse, ineligible parent, and essential person for deeming purposes.
The first step in deeming is determining how much income your ineligible spouse, ineligible parent (if you are a child), your sponsor (if you are an alien), or your essential person, has. We do not always include all of their income when we determine how much income to deem. In this section we explain the rules for determining how much of their income is subject to deeming. As part of the process of deeming income from your ineligible spouse or parent, we must determine the amount of income of any ineligible children in the household.
(a)
For an ineligible spouse or parent.
We do not include any of the following types of income (see § 416.1102) of an ineligible spouse or parent:
(1) Income excluded by Federal laws other than the Social Security Act (See the appendix to this subpart.)
(2) Any public income-maintenance payments (§ 416.1142(a)) your ineligible spouse or parent receives, and any income which was counted or excluded in figuring the amount of that payment;
(3) Any of the income of your ineligible spouse or parent that is used by a public income-maintenance program (§ 416.1142(a)) to determine the amount of that program's benefit to someone else;
(4) Any portion of a grant, scholarship, fellowship, or gift used or set aside to pay tuition, fees or other necessary educational expenses;
(5) Money received for providing foster care to an ineligible child;
(6) The value of food stamps and the value of Department of Agriculture donated foods;

(10) Income used to comply with the terms of court-ordered support, or support payments enforced under title IV-D of the Act;
(11) The value of in-kind support and maintenance;
(12) Alaska Longevity Bonus payments made to an individual who is a resident of Alaska and who, prior to October 1, 1985: met the 25-year residency requirement for receipt of such payments in effect prior to January 1, 1983; and was eligible for SSI;
(13) Disaster assistance as described in §§ 416.1150 and 416.1151;
(14) Income received infrequently or irregularly (see §§ 416.1112(c)(1) and 416.1124(c)(6));
(15) Work expenses if the ineligible spouse or parent is blind;
(16) Income of your ineligible spouse or ineligible parent which was paid under a Federal, State, or local government program (For example, payments under title XX of the Social Security Act) to provide you with chore, attendant or homemaker services;

(20) Refunds of Federal income taxes and advances made by an employer relating to an earned income tax credit, as provided in § 416.1112(c);
(21) Payments from a fund established by a State to aid victims of crime (see § 416.1124(c)(17));

(23) Special pay received from one of the uniformed services pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 310;
(24) Impairment-related work expenses, as described in 20 CFR 404.1576, incurred and paid by an ineligible spouse or parent, if the ineligible spouse or parent receives disability benefits under title II of the Act;
(25) Interest earned on excluded burial funds and appreciation in the value of excluded burial arrangements which are left to accumulate and become part of separate burial funds, and interest accrued on and left to accumulate as part of the value of agreements representing the purchase of excluded burial spaces (see § 416.1124(c) (9) and (15));

(i) Your ineligible spouse or parent received the pay as a result of deployment to or service in a combat zone; and
(ii) Your ineligible spouse or parent was not receiving the additional pay immediately prior to deployment to or service in a combat zone.
(b)
For an essential person or for a sponsor of an alien.
We include all the income (as defined in § 416.1102) of an essential person or of a sponsor of an alien and of the spouse of the sponsor (if the sponsor and spouse live in the same household) except for support and maintenance assistance described in § 416.1157(c), and income excluded under Federal laws other than the Social Security Act. For information on these laws see the appendix to this subpart.
(c)
For an ineligible child.
Although we do not deem any income to you from an ineligible child, we reduce his or her allocation if the ineligible child has income (see § 416.1163(b)(2)). For this purpose, we do not include any of the child's income listed in paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, if the ineligible child is a student (see § 416.1861), we exclude his/her earned income subject to the amounts set in § 416.1112(c)(3).
(d)
For an eligible alien.
Although we do not deem any income to you from an eligible alien, if your ineligible spouse or ineligible parent is also a sponsor of an eligible alien, we reduce the alien's allocation if he or she has income (see § 416.1163(c)(2)). For this purpose exclude any of the alien's income listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 46 FR 57276, Nov. 23, 1981; 48 FR 33259, July 21, 1983; 50 FR 48576, Nov. 26, 1985; 51 FR 39523, Oct. 29, 1986; 52 FR 8883, Mar. 20, 1987; 52 FR 44971, Nov. 24, 1987; 55 FR 28378, July 11, 1990; 58 FR 63888, 63890, Dec. 3, 1993; 61 FR 1712, Jan. 23, 1996; 61 FR 49964, Sept. 24, 1996; 67 FR 11034, Mar. 12, 2002; 71 FR 45378, Aug. 9, 2006; 71 FR 66866, Nov. 17, 2006; 75 FR 7554, Feb. 22, 2010]
§ 416.1161a
Income for deeming purposes where Medicaid eligibility is affected.
(a)
General.
In many States, an individual who is eligible for SSI or a Federally administered State optional supplementary payment is in turn eligible for Medicaid. Also, several other States use SSI deeming rules in determining eligibility for Medicaid. In all of these States, in extraordinary cases, the Department will not apply the usual rules on deeming of income where those rules would result in an individual's being ineligible for SSI (or a Federally administered State optional supplementary payment) and Medicaid. Any determination made under this section may at any time be revised based on new information or changed circumstances.
(b)
When special deeming rules apply:
(1) The Department will consider not applying the usual deeming rules only upon application by a State Medicaid agency (requirement approved under OMB No. 0960-0304) and on condition that the agency must show:
(i) Deeming would result in lack of Medicaid eligibility for the individual.
(ii) Medicaid eligibility would, prospectively, result in savings to the Medicaid program; and
(iii) The quality of medical care necessary for the individual would be maintained under the arrangements contemplated.
(2) The Department may also in particular cases require that additional facts be demonstrated, or that other criteria or standards be met, before it determines not to apply the usual deeming rules.
(c)
Amount of income to be deemed.
If the usual rules of deeming do not apply, the Department will determine an amount, if any, to be deemed.
(d)
Temporary effect of special deeming rules.
This provision is temporary and will be continued only through December 31, 1984. Determinations made under this section will nevertheless remain in effect unless they are revised based on changed circumstances (including establishment in the State of a Medicaid program of home and community-based services or eligibility under a State plan provision) or new information.
[49 FR 5747, Feb. 15, 1984]
§ 416.1163
How we deem income to you from your ineligible spouse.
If you have an ineligible spouse who lives in the same household, we apply the deeming rules to your ineligible spouse's income in the following order.
(a)
Determining your ineligible spouse's income.
We first determine how much earned and unearned income your ineligible spouse has, using the appropriate exclusions in § 416.1161(a).
(b)
Allocations for ineligible children.
We then deduct an allocation for ineligible children in the household to help meet their needs.
Exception:
We do not allocate for ineligible children who are receiving public income-maintenance payments (see § 416.1142(a)).
(1) The allocation for each ineligible child is the difference between the Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual. The amount of the allocation automatically increases whenever the Federal benefit rate increases. The amount of the allocation that we use to determine the amount of a benefit for a current month is based on the Federal benefit rate that applied in the second prior month unless one of the exceptions in § 416.1160(b)(2) applies.
(2) Each ineligible child's allocation is reduced by the amount of his or her own income as described in § 416.1161(c).
(3) We first deduct the allocations from your ineligible spouse's unearned income. If your ineligible spouse does not have enough unearned income to cover the allocations we deduct the balance from your ineligible spouse's earned income.
(c)
Allocations for aliens sponsored by your ineligible spouse.
We also deduct an allocation for eligible aliens who have been sponsored by and who have income deemed from your ineligible spouse.
(1) The allocation for each alien who is sponsored by and who has income deemed from your ineligible spouse is the difference between the Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual. The amount of the allocation automatically increases whenever the
Federal benefit rate increases. The amount of the allocation that we use to compute your benefit for a current month is based on the Federal benefit rate that applied in the second prior month (unless the current month is the first or second month of eligibility or re-eligibility as explained in § 416.420(a) and (b) (2) and (3)).
(2) Each alien's allocation is reduced by the amount of his or her own income as described in § 416.1161(d).
(3) We first deduct the allocations from your ineligible spouse's unearned income. If your ineligible spouse does not have enough unearned income to cover the allocations, we deduct the balance from your ineligible spouse's earned income.
(d)
Determining your eligibility for SSI.
(1) If the amount of your ineligible spouse's income that remains after appropriate allocations is not more than the difference between the Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual, there is no income to deem to you from your spouse. In this situation, we subtract only your own countable income from the Federal benefit rate for an individual to determine whether you are eligible for SSI benefits.
(2) If the amount of your ineligible spouse's income that remains after appropriate allocations is more than the difference between the Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual, we treat you and your ineligible spouse as an eligible couple. We do this by:
(i) Combining the remainder of your spouse's unearned income with your own unearned income and the remainder of your spouse's earned income with your earned income;
(ii) Applying all appropriate income exclusions in §§ 416.1112 and 416.1124; and
(iii) Subtracting the couple's countable income from the Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple. (See § 416.2025(b) for determination of the State supplementary payment amount.)
(e)
Determining your SSI benefit.
(1) In determining your SSI benefit amount, we follow the procedure in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. However, we use your ineligible spouse's income in the second month prior to the current month. We vary this rule if any of the exceptions in § 416.1160(b)(2) applies (for example, if this is the first month you are eligible for payment of an SSI benefit or if you are again eligible after at least a month of being ineligible). In the first month of your eligibility for payment (or re-eligibility), we deem your ineligible spouse's income in the current month to determine both whether you are eligible for a benefit and the amount of your benefit. In the second month, we deem your ineligible spouse's income in that month to determine whether you are eligible for a benefit but we deem your ineligible spouse's income in the first month to determine the amount of your benefit.
(2) Your SSI benefit under the deeming rules cannot be higher than it would be if deeming did not apply. Therefore, your benefit is the lesser of the amount computed under the rules in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or the amount remaining after we subtract only your own countable income from an individual's Federal benefit rate.
(f)
Special rules for couples when a change in status occurs.
We have special rules to determine how to deem your spouse's income to you when there is a change in your situation.
(1)
Ineligible spouse becomes eligible.
If your ineligible spouse becomes eligible for SSI benefits, we treat both of you as newly eligible. Therefore, your eligibility and benefit amount for the first month you are an eligible couple will be based on your income in that month. In the second month, your benefit amount will also be based on your income in the first month.
(2)
Spouses separate or divorce.
If you separate from your ineligible spouse or your marriage to an ineligible spouse ends by divorce, we do not deem your ineligible spouse's income to you to determine your eligibility for benefits beginning with the first month following the event. If you remain eligible, we determine your benefit amount by following the rule in paragraph (e) of this section provided deeming from your spouse applied in the prior month.
(3)
Eligible individual begins living with an ineligible spouse.
If you begin to live with your ineligible spouse, we deem your ineligible spouse's income to you in the first month thereafter to determine whether you continue to be eligible for SSI benefits. If you continue to be eligible, we follow the rule in § 416.420(a) to determine your benefit amount.
(4)
Ineligible spouse dies.
If your ineligible spouse dies, we do not deem your spouse's income to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits beginning with the month following the month of death. In determining your benefit amount beginning with the month following the month of death, we use only your own countable income in a prior month, excluding any income deemed to you in that month from your ineligible spouse.
(5)
You become subject to the $30 Federal benefit rate.
If you become a resident of a medical care facility and the $30 Federal benefit rate applies, we do not deem your ineligible spouse's income to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits beginning with the first month for which the $30 Federal benefit rate applies. In determining your benefit amount beginning with the first month for which the $30 Federal benefit rate applies, we use only your own countable income in a prior month, excluding any income deemed to you in that month from your ineligible spouse.
(g)
Examples.
These examples show how we deem income from an ineligible spouse to an eligible individual in cases which do not involve any of the exceptions in § 416.1160(b)(2). The income, the income exclusions, and the allocations are monthly amounts. The Federal benefit rates used are those effective January 1, 1986.

# Example 1.
In September 1986, Mr. Todd, an aged individual, lives with his ineligible spouse, Mrs. Todd, and their ineligible child, Mike. Mr. Todd has a Federal benefit rate of $336 per month. Mrs. Todd receives $252 unearned income per month. She has no earned income and Mike has no income at all. Before we deem any income, we allocate to Mike $168 (the difference between the September Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the September Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual). We subtract the $168 allocation from Mrs. Todd's $252 unearned income, leaving $84. Since Mrs. Todd's $84 remaining income is not more than $168, which is the difference between the September Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the September Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual, we do not deem any income to Mr. Todd. Instead, we compare only Mr. Todd's own countable income with the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual to determine whether he is eligible. If Mr. Todd's own countable income is less than his Federal benefit rate, he is eligible. To determine the amount of his benefit, we determine his countable income, including any income deemed from Mrs. Todd, in July and subtract this income from the appropriate Federal benefit rate for September.

# Example 2.
In September 1986, Mr. Jones, a disabled individual, lives with his ineligible spouse, Mrs. Jones, and ineligible child, Christine. Mr. Jones and Christine have no income. Mrs. Jones has earned income of $401 a month and unearned income of $252 a month. Before we deem any income, we allocate $168 to Christine. We take the $168 allocation from Mrs. Jones' $252 unearned income, leaving $84 in unearned income. Since Mrs. Jones' total remaining income ($84 unearned plus $401 earned) is more than $168, which is the difference between the September Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the September Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual, we compute the combined countable income as we do for a couple. We apply the $20 general income exclusion to the unearned income, reducing it further to $64. We then apply the earned income exclusion ($65 plus one-half the remainder) to Mrs. Jones' earned income of $401, leaving $168. We combine the $64 countable unearned income and $168 countable earned income, and compare it ($232) with the $504 September Federal benefit rate for a couple, and determine that Mr. Jones is eligible. Since Mr. Jones is eligible, we determine the amount of his benefit by subtracting his countable income in July (including any deemed from Mrs. Jones) from September's Federal benefit rate for a couple.

# Example 3.
In September 1986, Mr. Smith, a disabled individual, lives with his ineligible spouse, Mrs. Smith, who earns $201 per month. Mr. Smith receives a pension (unearned income) of $100 a month. Since Mrs. Smith's income is greater than $168, which is the difference between the September Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the September Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual, we deem all of her income to be available to both Mr. and Mrs. Smith and compute the combined countable income for the couple. We apply the $20 general income exclusion to Mr. Smith's $100 unearned income, leaving $80. Then we apply the earned income exclusion ($65 plus one-half of the remainder) to Mrs. Smith's $201, leaving
$68. This gives the couple total countable income of $148. This is less than the $504 September Federal benefit rate for a couple, so Mr. Smith is eligible based on deeming. Since he is eligible, we determine the amount of his benefit based on his income (including any deemed from Mrs. Smith) in July.

# Example 4.
In September 1986, Mr. Simon has a disabled spouse, Mrs. Simon, and has sponsored an eligible alien, Mr. Ollie. Mrs. Simon has monthly unearned income of $100 and Mr. Simon has earned income of $405. From Mr. Simon's earned income we allocate to Mr. Ollie $168, which is the difference between the Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the rate for an eligible individual. Mr. Ollie has no other income. This reduces Mr. Simon's earned income from $405 to $237. Since $237 is more than $168 (the difference between the Federal benefit rate for an eligible couple and the rate for an eligible individual), we deem all of Mr. Simon's remaining income to be available to Mr. and Mrs. Simon and compute the combined countable income for the couple. We apply the $20 general income exclusion to Mrs. Simon's unearned income, leaving $80. Then we apply the general earned income exclusion ($65 plus one-half the remainder) to Mr. Simon's $237 earned income, leaving $86. This gives the couple total income of $166 ($80 + $86.). The $166 is less than the $504 Federal benefit rate for a couple so Mrs. Simon would be eligible based on deeming. Since she is eligible, we determine the amount of her benefit based on her income (including any deemed from Mr. Simon) in July. For the way we deem Mr. Simon's income to Mr. Ollie, see the rules in § 416.1166a.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 50 FR 48576, Nov. 26, 1985; 52 FR 8883, Mar. 20, 1987; 53 FR 25151, July 5, 1988; 54 FR 19164, May 4, 1989; 64 FR 31974, June 15, 1999]
§ 416.1165
How we deem income to you from your ineligible parent(s).
If you are a child living with your parents, we apply the deeming rules to you through the month in which you reach age 18. We follow the rules in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section to determine your eligibility. To determine your benefit amount, we follow the rules in paragraph (f) of this section. The rules in paragraph (g) of this section apply to changes in your family situation. Paragraph (i) of this section discusses the conditions under which we will not deem your ineligible parents' income to you if you are a disabled child living with your parents.
(a)
Determining your ineligible parent's income.
We first determine how much current monthly earned and unearned income your ineligible parents have, using the appropriate exclusions in § 416.1161(a).
(b)
Allocations for ineligible children.
We next deduct an allocation for each ineligible child in the household as described in § 416.1163(b).
(c)
Allocations for aliens who are sponsored by and have income deemed from your ineligible parent.
We also deduct an allocation for eligible aliens who have been sponsored by and have income deemed from your ineligible parent as described in § 416.1163(c).
(d)
Allocations for your ineligible parent(s).
We next deduct allocations for your parent(s). We do not deduct an allocation for a parent who is receiving public income-maintenance payments (see § 416.1142(a)). The allocations are calculated as follows:
(1) We first deduct $20 from the parents' combined unearned income, if any. If they have less than $20 in unearned income, we subtract the balance of the $20 from their combined earned income.
(2) Next, we subtract $65 plus one-half the remainder of their earned income.
(3) We total the remaining earned and unearned income and subtract—
(i) The Federal benefit rate for the month for a couple if both parents live with you; or
(ii) The Federal benefit rate for the month for an individual if only one parent lives with you.
(e)(1)
When you are the only eligible child.
If you are the only eligible child in the household, we deem any of your parents' current monthly income that remains to be your unearned income. We combine it with your own unearned income and apply the exclusions in § 416.1124 to determine your countable unearned income in the month. We add this to any countable earned income you may have and subtract the total from the Federal benefit rate for an individual to determine whether you are eligible for benefits.
(2)
When you are not the only eligible child.
If your parents have more than one eligible child under age 18 in the household, we divide the parental income to be deemed equally among those eligible children.
(3)
When one child's income makes that child ineligible.
We do not deem more income to an eligible child than the amount which, when combined with the child's own income, reduces his or her SSI benefit to zero. (For purposes of this paragraph, an SSI benefit includes any federally administered State supplement). If the share of parental income that would be deemed to a child makes that child ineligible (reduces the amount to zero) because that child has other countable income, we deem any remaining parental income to other eligible children under age 18 in the household in the manner described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(f)
Determining your SSI benefit.
In determining your SSI benefit amount, we follow the procedure in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. However, we use your ineligible parents' income in the second month prior to the current month. We vary this rule if any of the exceptions in § 416.1160(b)(2) applies (for example, if this is the first month you are eligible for payment of an SSI benefit or if you are again eligible after at least a month of being ineligible). In the first month of your eligibility for payment (or re-eligibility) we deem your ineligible parents' income in the current month to determine both whether you are eligible for a benefit and the amount of your benefit. In the second month we deem your ineligible parents' income in that month to determine whether you are eligible for a benefit but we again use your countable income (including any that was deemed to you) in the first month to determine the amount of your benefit.
(g)
Special rules for a change in status.
We have special rules to begin or stop deeming your ineligible parents' income to you when a change in your family situation occurs.
(1)
Ineligible parent becomes eligible.
If your ineligible parent becomes eligible for SSI benefits, there will be no income to deem from that parent to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits beginning with the month your parent becomes eligible. However, to determine your benefit amount, we follow the rule in § 416.420.
(2)
Eligible parent becomes ineligible.
If your eligible parent becomes ineligible, we deem your parents' income to you in the first month of the parents' ineligibility to determine whether you continue to be eligible for SSI benefits. However, if you continue to be eligible, in order to determine your benefit amount, we follow the regular rule of counting your income in the second month prior to the current month.
(3)
Ineligible parent dies.
If your ineligible parent dies, we do not deem that parent's income to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits beginning with the month following the month of death. In determining your benefit amount beginning with the month following the month of death, we use only your own countable income in a prior month, excluding any income deemed to you in that month from your deceased ineligible parent (see § 416.1160(b)(2)(iii)). If you live with two ineligible parents and one dies, we continue to deem income from the surviving ineligible parent who is also your natural or adoptive parent. If you live with a stepparent following the death of your natural or adoptive parent, we do not deem income from the stepparent.
(4)
Ineligible parent and you no longer live in the same household.
If your ineligible parent and you no longer live in the same household, we do not deem that parent's income to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits beginning with the first month following the month in which one of you leaves the household. We also will not deem income to you from your parent's spouse (
i.e.
, your stepparent) who remains in the household with you if your natural or adoptive parent has permanently left the household. To determine your benefit amount if you continue to be eligible, we follow the rule in § 416.420 of counting your income including deemed income from your parent and your parent's spouse (
i.e.
, your stepparent) (if the stepparent and parent lived in the household with you) in the second month prior to the current month.
(5)
Ineligible parent and you begin living in the same household.
If your ineligible parent and you begin living in the same household, we consider that parent's income to determine whether you continue to be eligible for SSI benefits
beginning with the month following the month of change. However (if you continue to be eligible), to determine your benefit amount, we follow the rule in § 416.420 of counting your income in the second month prior to the current month.
(6)
You become subject to the $30 Federal benefit rate.
If you become a resident of a medical treatment facility and the $30 Federal benefit rate applies, we do not deem your ineligible parent's income to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits beginning with the first month for which the $30 Federal benefit rate applies. In determining your benefit amount beginning with the first month for which the $30 Federal benefit rate applies, we only use your own countable income in a prior month, excluding any income deemed to you in that month from your ineligible parent.
(7)
You attain age 18.
In the month following the month in which you attain age 18 and thereafter, we do not deem your ineligible parent's income to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits. In determining your benefit amount beginning with the month following your attainment of age 18, we only use your own countable income in a prior month, excluding any income deemed to you in that month from your ineligible parent (see § 416.1160(b)(2)(B)). Your income for the current and subsequent months must include any income in the form of cash or in-kind support and maintenance provided by your parents. If you attain age 18 and stop living in the same household with your ineligible parent, these rules take precedence over paragraph (g)(4) of this section which requires continued use of deemed income in the benefit computation for 2 months following the month you no longer live in the same household.
(h)
Examples.
These examples show how we deem an ineligible parent's income to an eligible child when none of the exceptions in § 416.1160(b)(2) applies. The Federal benefit rates are those effective January 1, 1992.

# Example 1.
Henry, a disabled child, lives with his mother and father and a 12-year-old ineligible brother. His mother receives a pension (unearned income) of $365 per month and his father earns $1,165 per month. Henry and his brother have no income. First we deduct an allocation of $211 for Henry's brother from the unearned income. This leaves $154 in unearned income. We reduce the remaining unearned income further by the $20 general income exclusion, leaving $134. We then reduce the earned income of $1,165 by $65 leaving $1,100. Then we subtract one-half of the remainder, leaving $550. To this we add the remaining unearned income of $134 resulting in $684. From this, we subtract the parent allocation of $633 (the Federal benefit rate for a couple) leaving $51 to be deemed as Henry's unearned income. Henry has no other income. We apply Henry's $20 general income exclusion which reduces his countable income to $31. Since that amount is less than the $422 Federal benefit rate for an individual, Henry is eligible. We determine his benefit amount by subtracting his countable income (including deemed income) in a prior month from the Federal benefit rate for an individual for the current month. See § 416.420.

# Example 2.
James and Tony are disabled children who live with their mother. The children have no income but their mother receives $542 a month in unearned income. We reduce the unearned income by the $20 general income exclusion, leaving $522. We then subtract the amount we allocate for the mother's needs, $422 (the Federal benefit rate for an individual). The amount remaining to be deemed to James and Tony is $100, which we divide equally between them resulting in $50 deemed unearned income to each child. We then apply the $20 general income exclusion, leaving each child with $30 countable income. The $30 of unearned income is less than the $422 Federal benefit rate for an individual, so the children are eligible. We then determine each child's benefit by subtracting his countable income (including deemed income) in a prior month from the Federal benefit rate for an individual for the current month. See § 416.420.

# Example 3.
Mrs. Jones is the ineligible mother of two disabled children, Beth and Linda, and has sponsored an eligible alien, Mr. Sean. Beth, Linda, and Mr. Sean have no income; Mrs. Jones has unearned income of $924 per month. We reduce the mother's unearned income by the $211 allocation for Mr. Sean, leaving $713. We further reduce her income by the $20 general income exclusion, which leaves a balance of $693. Next, we subtract the amount we allocate for the mother's needs, $422 (the amount of the Federal benefit rate for an individual). The balance of $271 to be deemed is divided equally between Beth and Linda. Each now has unearned income of $135.50 from which we deduct the $20 general income exclusion, leaving each child with $115.50 countable income. Since this is less than the $422 Federal benefit rate for an individual, the girls are eligible. We then determine each child's benefit
by subtracting her countable income (including deemed income) in a prior month from the Federal benefit rate for an individual for the current month. See § 416.420. (For the way we deem the mother's income to Mr. Sean, see examples No. 3 and No. 4 in § 416.1166a.)

# Example 4.
Jack, a disabled child, lives with his mother, father, and two brothers, none of whom are eligible for SSI. Jack's mother receives a private pension of $350 per month and his father works and earns $1,525 per month. We allocate a total of $422 for Jack's ineligible brothers and subtract this from the parents' total unearned income of $350; the parents' unearned income is completely offset by the allocations for the ineligible children with an excess allocation of $72 remaining. We subtract the excess of $72 from the parents' total earned income leaving $1,453. We next subtract the combined general income and earned income exclusions of $85 leaving a remainder of $1,368. We subtract one-half the remainder, leaving $684 from which we subtract the parents' allocation of $633. This results in $51 deemed to Jack. Jack has no other income, so we subtract the general income exclusion of $20 from the deemed income leaving $31 as Jack's countable income. Since this is below the $422 Federal benefit rate for an individual, Jack is eligible. We determine his payment amount by subtracting his countable income (including deemed income) in a prior month from the Federal benefit rate for an individual for the current month. See § 416.420.
(i)
Disabled child under age 18.
If you are a disabled child under the age of 18 living with your parents, we will not deem your parents' income to you if—
(1) You previously received a reduced SSI benefit while a resident of a medical treatment facility, as described in § 416.414;
(2) You are eligible for medical assistance under a Medicaid State home care plan approved by the Secretary under the provisions of section 1915(c) or authorized under section 1902(e)(3) of the Act; and
(3) You would otherwise be ineligible for a Federal SSI benefit because of the deeming of your parents' income or resources.
[52 FR 8885, Mar. 20, 1987, as amended at 54 FR 19164, May 4, 1989; 57 FR 48562, Oct. 27, 1992; 60 FR 361, Jan. 4, 1995; 62 FR 1056, Jan. 8, 1997; 64 FR 31974, June 15, 1999; 72 FR 50874, Sept. 5, 2007; 73 FR 28036, May 15, 2008]
§ 416.1166
How we deem income to you and your eligible child from your ineligible spouse.
If you and your eligible child live in the same household with your ineligible spouse, we deem your ineligible spouse's income first to you, and then we deem any remainder to your eligible child. For the purpose of this section, SSI benefits include any federally administered State supplement. We then follow the rules in § 416.1165(e) to determine the child's eligibility for SSI benefits and in § 416.1165(f) to determine the benefit amount.
(a)
Determining your ineligible spouse's income.
We first determine how much earned and unearned income your ineligible spouse has, using the appropriate exclusions in § 416.1161(a).
(b)
Allocations for ineligible children.
We next deduct an allocation for each ineligible child in the household as described in § 416.1163(b).
(c)
Allocations for aliens who are sponsored by and have income deemed from your ineligible spouse.
We also deduct an allocation for eligible aliens who have been sponsored by and have income deemed from your ineligible spouse as described in § 416.1163(c).
(d)
Determining your eligibility for SSI benefits and benefit amount.
We then follow the rules in § 416.1163(c) to find out if any of your ineligible spouse's current monthly income is deemed to you and, if so, to determine countable income for a couple. Next, we follow paragraph (e) of this section to determine your child's eligibility. However, if none of your spouse's income is deemed to you, none is deemed to your child. Whether or not your spouse's income is deemed to you in determining your eligibility, we determine your benefit amount as explained in § 416.1163(e).
(e)
Determining your child's eligibility and amount of benefits.
(1) If you are eligible for SSI benefits after your spouse's income has been deemed to you, we do not deem any income to your child. To determine the child's eligibility, we subtract the child's own countable income without deeming from the benefit rate for an individual.
(2) If you are not eligible for SSI benefits after your ineligible spouse's income has been deemed to you, we deem
to your eligible child any of your spouse's income which was not used to reduce your SSI benefits to zero.
(f)
Examples.
These examples show how we deem income to an eligible individual and an eligible child in the same household. The Federal benefit rates used are those effective January 1, 1984.

# Example 1.
Mary, a blind individual, lives with her husband, John, and their disabled child, Peter. Mary and Peter have no income, but John is employed and earns $605 per month. We determine Mary's eligibility first. Since John's income is more than $157, which is one-half of the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual, we treat the entire $605 as earned income available to John and Mary as a couple. Because they have no unearned income, we reduce the $605 by the $20 general income exclusion, and then by the earned income exclusion of $65 plus one-half the remainder. This leaves John and Mary with $260 in countable income. The $260 countable income is less than the $472 Federal benefit rate for a couple, so Mary is eligible; therefore, there is no income to be deemed to Peter.

# Example 2.
Al, a disabled individual, resides with his ineligible spouse, Dora, and their disabled son, Jeff. Al and Jeff have no income, but Dora is employed and earns $1,065 a month. Since Dora's income is more than $157, which is one-half of the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual, we treat the entire $1,065 as earned income available to Al and Dora as a couple. We reduce this income by the $20 general income exclusion and then by $65 plus one-half the remainder (earned income exclusion), leaving $490 in countable income. Al is ineligible because the couple's $490 countable income exceeds the $472 Federal benefit rate for a couple. Since Al is ineligible, we deem to Jeff $18, the amount of income over and above the amount which causes Al to be ineligible (the difference between the countable income and the Federal benefit rate for a couple). We treat the $18 deemed to Jeff as unearned income, and we apply the $20 general income exclusion, reducing Jeff's countable income to zero. Jeff is eligible.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 50 FR 48578, Nov. 26, 1985; 52 FR 8887, Mar. 20, 1987; 64 FR 31975, June 15, 1999]
§ 416.1166a
How we deem income to you from your sponsor if you are an alien.
Before we deem your sponsor's income to you if you are an alien, we determine how much earned and unearned income your sponsor has under § 416.1161(b). We then deduct allocations for the sponsor and the sponsor's dependents. This is an amount equal to the Federal benefit rate for an individual for the sponsor (or for each sponsor even if two sponsors are married to each other and living together) plus an amount equal to one-half the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual for each dependent of the sponsor. An ineligible dependent's income is not subtracted from the sponsor's dependent's allocation. We deem the balance of the income to be your unearned income.
(a)
If you are the only alien applying for or already eligible for SSI benefits who has income deemed to you from your sponsor.
If you are the only alien who is applying for or already eligible for SSI benefits and who is sponsored by your sponsor, all the deemed income is your unearned income.
(b)
If you are not the only alien who is applying for or already eligible for SSI benefits and who has income deemed from your sponsor.
If you and other aliens applying for or already eligible for SSI benefits are sponsored by the same sponsor, we deem the income to each of you as though you were the only alien sponsored by that person. The income deemed to you becomes your unearned income.
(c)
When you are an alien and income is no longer deemed from your sponsor.
If you are an alien and have had your sponsor's income deemed to you, we stop deeming the income with the month in which the third anniversary of your admission into the United States occurs.
(d)
When sponsor deeming rules do not apply to you if you are an alien.
If you are an alien, we do not apply the sponsor deeming rules to you if—
(1)
You are a refugee.
You are a refugee admitted to the United States as the result of application of one of three sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act: (1) Section 203(a)(7), effective before April 1, 1980; (2) Section 207(c)(1), effective after March 31, 1980; or (3) Section 212(d)(5);
(2)
You have been granted asylum.
You have been granted political asylum by the Attorney General of the United States; or
(3)
You become blind or disabled.
If you become blind or disabled as defined in § 416.901 (at any age) after your admission to the United States, we do not deem your sponsor's income to you to determine your eligibility for SSI benefits beginning with the month in which your disability or blindness begins. However, to determine your benefit payment, we follow the rule in § 416.420 of counting your income in the second month prior to the current month.
(e)
Examples.
These examples show how we deem a sponsor's income to an eligible individual who is an alien when none of the exceptions in § 416.1160(b)(2) applies. The income, income exclusions, and the benefit rates are in monthly amounts. The Federal benefit rates are those effective January 1, 1986.

# Example 1.
Mr. John, an alien who has no income, has been sponsored by Mr. Herbert who has monthly earned income of $1,300 and unearned income of $70. Mr. Herbert's wife and three children have no income. We add Mr. Herbert's earned and unearned income for a total of $1,370 and apply the allocations for the sponsor and his dependents. Allocations total $1,008. These are made up of $336 (the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual) for the sponsor, plus $672 (one-half the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual, $168 each) for Mr. Herbert's wife and three children. The $1,008 is subtracted from Mr. Herbert's total income of $1,370 which leaves $362 to be deemed to Mr. John as his unearned income. Mr. John's only exclusion is the $20 general income exclusion. Since the $342 balance exceeds the $336 Federal benefit rate, Mr. John is ineligible.

# Example 2.
Mr. and Mrs. Smith are an alien couple who have no income and who have been sponsored by Mr. Hart. Mr. Hart has earned income of $1,350 and his wife, Mrs. Hart, who lives with him, has earned income of $150. Their two children have no income. We combine Mr. and Mrs. Hart's income ($1,350 + $150 = $1,500). We deduct the allocations of $336 for Mr. Hart (the Federal benefit rate for an individual) and $504 for Mrs. Hart and the two children ($168 or one-half the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual for each), a total of $840. The allocations ($840) are deducted from the total $1,500 income which leaves $660. This amount must be deemed independently to Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Mr. and Mrs. Smith would qualify for SSI benefits as a couple in the amount of $504 if no income had been deemed to them. The $1,320 ($660 each to Mr. and Mrs. Smith) deemed income is unearned income to Mr. and Mrs. Smith and is subject to the $20 general income exclusion, leaving $1,300. This exceeds the couple's rate of $504 so Mr. and Mrs. Smith are ineligible for SSI benefits.

# Example 3.
Mr. Bert and Mr. Davis are aliens sponsored by their sister Mrs. Jean, who has earned income of $800. She also receives $250 as survivors' benefits for her two minor children. We do not consider the $250 survivors' benefits to be Mrs. Jean's income because it is the children's income. We exclude $336 for Mrs. Jean (the Federal benefit rate for an individual) plus $336 ($168, one-half the Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual for each child), a total of $672. We subtract the $672 from Mrs. Jean's income of $800, which leaves $128 to be deemed to Mr. Bert and Mr. Davis. Each of the brothers is liable for rent in the boarding house (a commercial establishment) where they live. Each lives in his own household, receives no in-kind support and maintenance, and is eligible for the Federal benefit rate of $336. The $128 deemed income is deemed both to Mr. Bert and to Mr. Davis. As a result, each has countable income of $108 ($128 minus the $20 general income exclusion). This is less than $336, the Federal benefit rate for an individual, so that both are eligible for SSI. We use their income in a prior month to determine their benefit payments.

# Example 4.
The same situation applies as in example 3 except that one of Mrs. Jean's children is disabled and eligible for SSI benefits. The eligibility of the disabled child does not affect the amount of income deemed to Mr. Bert and Mr. Davis since the sponsor-to-alien and parent-to-child rules are applied independently. The child's countable income is computed under the rules in § 416.1165.
[52 FR 8887, Mar. 20, 1987]
§ 416.1167
Temporary absences and deeming rules.
(a)
General.
During a temporary absence, we continue to consider the absent person a member of the household. A temporary absence occurs when—
(1) You, your ineligible spouse, parent, or an ineligible child leaves the household but intends to and does return in the same month or the month immediately following; or
(2) You enter a medical treatment facility and are eligible for either benefit payable under § 416.212. We consider your absence to be temporary through the last month benefits under § 416.212 were paid unless you were discharged from the facility in the following month. In that case, we consider your absence to be temporary through the date of discharge.
(b)
Child away at school.
If you are an eligible child who is away at school but comes home on some weekends or lengthy holidays and if you are subject to the control of your parents, we consider you temporarily absent from your parents' household. However, if you are not subject to parental control, we do not consider your absence temporary and we do not deem parental income (or resources) to you. Being subject to parental control affects deeming to you only if you are away at school.
(c)
Active duty military service.
If your ineligible spouse or parent is absent from the household due solely to a duty assignment as a member of the Armed Forces on active duty, we continue to consider that person to be living in the same household as you, absent evidence to the contrary. If we determine that during such an absence, evidence indicates that your spouse or parent should no longer be considered to be living in the same household as you, then deeming will cease. When such evidence exists, we determine the month in which your spouse or parent should no longer be considered to be living in the same household as you and stop deeming his or her income and resources beginning with the month following that month.

# Example:
Tom is a child who receives SSI. In January 1996, Tom's father leaves the household due solely to an active duty assignment as a member of the Armed Forces. Five months later in June 1996, while Tom's father is still on an active duty assignment, Tom's parents file for divorce. As a result, Tom's father will not be returning to live in Tom's household. Therefore, Tom's father should no longer be considered to be living in the same household with Tom. Beginning July 1, 1996, deeming from Tom's father will cease.
[50 FR 48579, Nov. 26, 1985, as amended at 61 FR 10280, Mar. 13, 1996; 62 FR 42411, Aug. 7, 1997; 72 FR 50874, Sept. 5, 2007]
§ 416.1168
How we deem income to you from your essential person.
(a)
Essential person's income.
If you have an essential person, we deem all of that person's income (except any not counted because of other Federal statutes as described in § 416.1161(b)) to be your own unearned income. If your essential person is also your ineligible spouse, or if you are a child whose essential person is your ineligible parent, we apply the essential person deeming rules in this section. See § 416.1169 for the rules that apply when an ineligible spouse or parent ceases to be your essential person.
(b)
Determining your eligibility for an SSI benefit.
We apply the exclusions to which you are entitled under §§ 416.1112 and 416.1124 to your earned income and to your unearned income which includes any income deemed from your essential person. After combining the remaining amounts of countable income, we compare the total with the Federal benefit rate for a qualified individual (see § 416.413) to determine whether you are eligible for an SSI benefit.
(c)
Determining your SSI benefit amount.
We determine your SSI benefit amount in the same way that we determine your eligibility. However, in following the procedure in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section we use your essential person's income that we deemed to you in the second month prior to the current month.
Exception:
Beginning with the month in which you no longer have your essential person, we do not use any of the income deemed to you from that essential person in a prior month to determine the amount of your benefit (see § 416.1160(a)(3)(ii)(C)). We use only your own countable income in a prior month.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 50 FR 48579, Nov. 26, 1985]
§ 416.1169
When we stop deeming income from an essential person.
If including the income deemed to you from your essential person causes you to be ineligible for an SSI benefit, you are no longer considered to have that essential person whose income makes you ineligible. To determine your eligibility for that month we deduct only your own countable income from your Federal benefit rate. However, other deeming rules may then apply as follows:
(a)
Essential person is your spouse.
If the person who was your essential person is your ineligible spouse, we apply the deeming rules in § 416.1163 beginning with the month that the income of your essential person is no longer deemed to you.
(b)
Essential person is your parent.
If you are a child under age 18, and the person who was your essential person is your ineligible parent, we apply the deeming rules in § 416.1165 beginning with the month that the income of your essential person is no longer deemed to you.
[50 FR 48579, Nov. 26, 1985]

# Alternative Income Counting Rules for Certain Blind Individuals
§ 416.1170
General.
(a)
What the alternative is.
If you are blind and meet the requirements in § 416.1171, we use one of two rules to see how much countable income you have. We use whichever of the following rules results in the lower amount of countable income:
(1) The SSI income exclusions in §§ 416.1112 and 416.1124; or
(2) The disregards that would have applied under the State plan for October 1972.
(b)
State plan.
As used in this subpart,
State plan for October 1972
means a State plan for providing assistance to the blind under title X or XVI (AABD) of the Social Security Act. That plan must have been approved under the provisions of 45 CFR chapter II as in effect for October 1972.
§ 416.1171
When the alternative rules apply.
(a)
Eligibility for the alternative.
We use the alternative income counting rules for you if you meet all the following conditions:
(1) You were eligible for, and received, assistance for December 1973 under a State plan for October 1972;
(2) You have continued to live in that same State since December 1973;
(3) You were transferred to the SSI rolls and received a benefit for January 1974; and
(4) You have not been ineligible for an SSI benefit for any period of more than 6 consecutive months. (For purposes of this section, an SSI benefit means a Federal benefit; it does not include any State supplementation.)
(b)
Living in the same State.
For purposes of this section, you have continued to live in the same State since December 1973 unless you have left it at any time with the intention of moving to another State. If there is no evidence to the contrary, we assume that—
(1) If you leave the State for 90 calendar days or less, the absence is temporary and you still live in that State; and
(2) If you leave the State for more than 90 calendar days, you are no longer living there.

# Rules for Helping Blind and Disabled Individuals Achieve Self-Support
§ 416.1180
General.
One of the objectives of the SSI program is to help blind or disabled persons become self-supporting. If you are blind or disabled, we will pay you SSI benefits and will not count the part of your income (for example, your or a family member's wages, title II benefits, or pension income) that you use or set aside to use for expenses that we determine to be reasonable and necessary to fulfill an approved plan to achieve self-support. (See §§ 416.1112(c)(9) and 1124(c)(13).) You may develop a plan to achieve self-support on your own or with our help. As appropriate, we will refer you to a State rehabilitation agency or agency for the blind for additional assistance in developing a plan.
[45 FR 65547, Oct. 3, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 10616, Mar. 28, 1986; 62 FR 59813, Nov. 5, 1997; 71 FR 28264, May 16, 2006]
§ 416.1181
What is a plan to achieve self-support (PASS)?
(a) A PASS must—
(1) Be designed especially for you;
(2) Be in writing;
(3) Be approved by us (a change of plan must also be approved by us);
(4) Have a specific employment goal that is feasible for you, that is, a goal that you have a reasonable likelihood of achieving;
(5) Have a plan to reach your employment goal that is viable and financially sustainable, that is, the plan—
(i) Sets forth steps that are attainable in order to reach your goal, and
(ii) Shows that you will have enough money to meet your living expenses
while setting aside income or resources to reach your goal;
(6) Be limited to one employment goal; however, the employment goal may be modified and any changes related to the modification must be made to the plan;
(7) Show how the employment goal will generate sufficient earnings to substantially reduce or eliminate your dependence on SSI or eliminate your need for title II disability benefits;

# Example 1:
A Substantial Reduction Exists. Your SSI monthly payment amount is $101 and your PASS employment goal earnings will reduce your SSI payment by $90. We may consider that to be a substantial reduction.

# Example 2:
A Substantial Reduction Exists. You receive a title II benefit of $550 and an SSI payment of $73. Your PASS employment goal will result in work over the SGA level that eliminates your title II benefit but increases your SSI payment by $90. We may consider that a substantial reduction because your work will eliminate your title II payment while only slightly increasing your SSI payment.

# Example 3:
A Substantial Reduction Does Not Exist. Your SSI monthly payment amount is $603 and your PASS employment goal earnings will reduce your SSI payment by $90. We may not consider that to be a substantial reduction.
(8) Contain a beginning date and an ending date to meet your employment goal;
(9) Give target dates for meeting milestones towards your employment goal;
(10) Show what expenses you will have and how they are reasonable and necessary to meet your employment goal;
(11) Show what money you have and will receive, how you will use or spend it to attain your employment goal, and how you will meet your living expenses; and
(12) Show how the money you set aside under the plan will be kept separate from your other funds.
(b) You must propose a reasonable ending date for your PASS. If necessary, we can help you establish an ending date, which may be different than the ending date you propose. Once the ending date is set and you begin your PASS, we may adjust or extend the ending date of your PASS based on progress towards your goal and earnings level reached.
(c) If your employment goal is self-employment, you must include a business plan that defines the business, provides a marketing strategy, details financial data, outlines the operational procedures, and describes the management plan.
(d) Your progress will be reviewed at least annually to determine if you are following the provisions of your plan.
[71 FR 28264, May 16, 2006]
§ 416.1182
When we begin to count the income excluded under the plan.
We will begin to count the earned and unearned income that would have been excluded under your plan in the month in which any of the following circumstances first exist:
(a) You fail to follow the conditions of your plan;
(b) You abandon your plan;
(c) You complete the time schedule outlined in the plan; or
(d) You reach your goal as outlined in the plan.

Pt. 416, Subpt. K, App.

# Appendix to Subpart K of Part 416—List of Types of Income Excluded Under the SSI Program as Provided by Federal Laws Other Than the Social Security Act
Many Federal statutes in addition to the Social Security Act provide assistance or benefits for individuals and specify that the assistance or benefit will not be considered in deciding eligibility for SSI. We have listed these statutes in this appendix and have placed them in categories according to the kind of income or assistance they provide. The list gives the name of the Federal statute (where possible), the public law number, and the citation. Each item briefly describes what the statute provides that will not reduce or eliminate an SSI payment. More detailed information is available from a social security office or by reference to the statutes.
We update this list periodically. However, when new Federal statutes of this kind are enacted, or existing statutes are changed, we apply the law currently in effect, even before this appendix is updated.

# I. Food
(a) Value of food coupons under the Food Stamp Act of 1977, section 1301 of Pub. L. 95-113 (91 Stat. 968, 7 U.S.C. 2017(b)).

L. No. 93-644 and section 5(a)(2) of Pub. L. 95-568 (88 Stat. 2294 as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2809(a)(5)).
(b) Home energy assistance payments or allowances under title XXVI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Public Law 97-35, as amended (42 U.S.C. 8624(f)).

(c) Value of any assistance paid with respect to a dwelling unit under—
(1) The United States Housing Act of 1937;
(2) The National Housing Act;

Indian judgment funds include interest and investment income accrued while such funds are so held in trust. This exclusion extends to initial purchases made with Indian judgment funds. This exclusion does not apply to sales or conversions of initial purchases or to subsequent purchases.

# Note:
This exclusion applies to the income of sponsors of aliens only if the alien lives in the sponsor's household.
(2) All funds held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for an Indian tribe and distributed per capita to a member of that tribe are excluded from income under Public Law 98-64 (97 Stat. 365, 25 U.S.C. 117b). Funds held by Alaska Native Regional and Village Corporations (ANRVC) are not held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior and therefore
ANRVC dividend distributions are not excluded from countable income under this exclusion. For ANRVC dividend distributions, see paragraph IV.(a)(3) of this appendix.

# Note:
This exclusion applies to the income of sponsors of aliens only if the alien lives in the sponsor's household.
(3) Distributions received by an individual Alaska Native or descendant of an Alaska Native from an Alaska Native Regional and Village Corporation pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as follows: cash, including cash dividends on stock received from a Native Corporation, to the extent that it does not, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000 per individual each year; stock, including stock issued or distributed by a Native Corporation as a dividend or distribution on stock; a partnership interest; land or an interest in land, including land or an interest in land received from a Native Corporation as a dividend or distribution on stock; and an interest in a settlement trust. This exclusion is pursuant to section 15 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Amendments of 1987, Public Law 100-241 (101 Stat. 1812, 43 U.S.C. 1626(c)), effective February 3, 1988.

(4) Up to $2,000 per year received by Indians that is derived from individual interests in trust or restricted lands under section 13736 of Public Law 103-66 (107 Stat. 663, 25 U.S.C. 1408, as amended).

§ 416.1201
Resources; general.
(a)
Resources; defined.
For purposes of this subpart L, resources means cash or other liquid assets or any real or personal property that an individual (or spouse, if any) owns and could convert to cash to be used for his or her support and maintenance.
(1) If the individual has the right, authority or power to liquidate the property or his or her share of the property, it is considered a resource. If a property right cannot be liquidated, the property will not be considered a resource of the individual (or spouse).
(2) Support and maintenance assistance not counted as income under § 416.1157(c) will not be considered a resource.
(3) Except for cash reimbursement of medical or social services expenses already paid for by the individual, cash received for medical or social services that is not income under § 416.1103 (a) or (b), or a retroactive cash payment which is income that is excluded from deeming under § 416.1161(a)(16), is not a resource for the calendar month following the month of its receipt. However, cash retained until the first moment of the second calendar month following its receipt is a resource at that time.
(i) For purposes of this provision, a retroactive cash payment is one that is paid after the month in which it was due.
(ii) This provision applies only to the unspent portion of those cash payments identified in this paragraph (a)(3). Once the cash from such payments is spent, this provision does not apply to items purchased with the money, even if the period described above has not expired.
(iii) Unspent money from those cash payments identified in this paragraph (a)(3) must be identifiable from other resources for this provision to apply. The money may be commingled with other funds, but if this is done in such a fashion that an amount from such payments can no longer be separately identified, that amount will count toward the resource limit described in § 416.1205.
(4) Death benefits, including gifts and inheritances, received by an individual, to the extent that they are not income in accordance with paragraphs (e) and (g) of § 416.1121 because they are to be spent on costs resulting from the last
illness and burial of the deceased, are not resources for the calendar month following the month of receipt. However, such death benefits retained until the first moment of the second calendar month following their receipt are resources at that time.
(b)
Liquid resources.
Liquid resources are cash or other property which can be converted to cash within 20 days, excluding certain nonwork days as explained in § 416.120(d). Examples of resources that are ordinarily liquid are stocks, bonds, mutual fund shares, promissory notes, mortgages, life insurance policies, financial institution accounts (including savings, checking, and time deposits, also known as certificates of deposit) and similar items. Liquid resources, other than cash, are evaluated according to the individual's equity in the resources. (See § 416.1208 for the treatment of funds held in individual and joint financial institution accounts.)
(c)
Nonliquid resources.
(1) Nonliquid resources are property which is not cash and which cannot be converted to cash within 20 days excluding certain nonwork days as explained in § 416.120(d). Examples of resources that are ordinarily nonliquid are loan agreements, household goods, automobiles, trucks, tractors, boats, machinery, livestock, buildings and land. Nonliquid resources are evaluated according to their equity value except as otherwise provided. (See § 416.1218 for treatment of automobiles.)
(2) For purposes of this subpart L, the
equity value
of an item is defined as:
(i) The price that item can reasonably be expected to sell for on the open market in the particular geographic area involved; minus
(ii) Any encumbrances.

§ 416.1202
Deeming of resources.
(a)
Married individual.
In the case of an individual who is living with a person not eligible under this part and who is considered to be the husband or wife of such individual under the criteria in §§ 416.1802 through 416.1835 of this part, such individual's resources shall be deemed to include any resources, not otherwise excluded under this subpart, of such spouse whether or not such resources are available to such individual. In addition to the exclusions listed in § 416.1210, we also exclude the following items:
(1) Pension funds that the ineligible spouse may have.
Pension funds
are defined as funds held in individual retirement accounts (IRA), as described by the Internal Revenue Code, or in work-related pension plans (including such plans for self-employed persons, sometimes referred to as Keogh plans);
(2) For 9 months beginning with the month following the month of receipt, the unspent portion of any retroactive payment of special pay an ineligible spouse received from one of the uniformed services pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 310; and
(3) For 9 months beginning with the month following the month of receipt, the unspent portion of any retroactive payment of family separation allowance an ineligible spouse received from one of the uniformed services pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 427 as a result of deployment to or service in a combat zone (as defined in § 416.1160(d)).
(b)
Child
—(1)
General.
In the case of a child (as defined in § 416.1856) who is under age 18, we will deem to that child any resources, not otherwise excluded under this subpart, of his or her ineligible parent who is living in the same household with him or her (as described in § 416.1851). We also will deem to the child the resources of his or her ineligible stepparent. As used in this section, the term “parent” means the natural or adoptive parent of a child, and the term “stepparent” means the spouse (as defined in § 416.1806) of such natural or adoptive parent who is living in the same household with the child and parent. We will deem to a child the resources of his or her parent and stepparent whether or not those resources are available to him or her. We will deem to a child the resources of his or her parent and stepparent only to the extent that those resources exceed the resource limits described in § 416.1205. (If the child is living with
only one parent, we apply the resource limit for an individual. If the child is living with both parents, or the child is living with one parent and a stepparent, we apply the resource limit for an individual and spouse.) We will not deem to a child the resources of his or her parent or stepparent if the child is excepted from deeming under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition to the exclusions listed in § 416.1210, we also exclude the following items:
(i) Pension funds of an ineligible parent (or stepparent).
Pension funds
are defined as funds held in IRAs, as described by the Internal Revenue Code, or in work-related pension plans (including such plans for self-employed persons, sometimes referred to as Keogh plans);
(ii) For 9 months beginning with the month following the month of receipt, the unspent portion of any retroactive payment of special pay an ineligible parent (or stepparent) received from one of the uniformed services pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 310; and
(iii) For 9 months beginning with the month following the month of receipt, the unspent portion of any retroactive payment of family separation allowance an ineligible parent (or stepparent) received from one of the uniformed services pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 427 as a result of deployment to or service in a combat zone (as defined in § 416.1160(d)).
(2)
Disabled child under age 18.
In the case of a disabled child under age 18 who is living in the same household with his or her parents, the deeming provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply if such child—
(i) Previously received a reduced SSI benefit while a resident of a medical treatment facility, as described in § 416.414;
(ii) Is eligible for medical assistance under a Medicaid State home care plan approved by the Secretary under the provisions of section 1915(c) or authorized under section 1902(e)(3) of the Act; and
(iii) Would otherwise be ineligible because of the deeming of his or her parents' resources or income.
(c)
Applicability.
When used in this subpart L, the term
individual
refers to an eligible aged, blind, or disabled person, and also includes a person whose resources are deemed to be the resources of such individual (as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section).
[40 FR 48915, Oct. 20, 1975, as amended at 50 FR 38982, Sept. 26, 1985; 52 FR 8888, Mar. 20, 1987; 52 FR 29841, Aug. 12, 1987; 52 FR 32240, Aug. 26, 1987; 60 FR 361, Jan. 4, 1995; 62 FR 1056, Jan. 8, 1997; 65 FR 16815, Mar. 30, 2000; 72 FR 50875, Sept. 5, 2007; 73 FR 28036, May 15, 2008; 75 FR 7554, Feb. 22, 2010]
§ 416.1203
Deeming of resources of an essential person.
In the case of a qualified individual (as defined in § 416.221) whose payment standard has been increased because of the presence of an essential person (as defined in § 416.222), the resources of such qualified individual shall be deemed to include all the resources of such essential person with the exception of the resources explained in §§ 416.1210(t) and 416.1249. If such qualified individual would not meet the resource criteria for eligibility (as defined in §§ 416.1205 and 416.1260) because of the deemed resources, then the payment standard increase because of the essential person will be nullified and the provision of this section will not apply; essential person status is lost permanently. However, if such essential person is an ineligible spouse of a qualified individual or a parent (or spouse of a parent) of a qualified individual who is a child under age 21, then the resources of such person will be deemed to such qualified individual in accordance with the provision in § 416.1202.
[39 FR 33797, Sept. 20, 1974, as amended at 51 FR 10616, Mar. 28, 1986; 70 FR 41138, July 18, 2005]
§ 416.1204
Deeming of resources of the sponsor of an alien.
The resources of an alien who first applies for SSI benefits after September 30, 1980, are deemed to include the resources of the alien's sponsor for 3 years after the alien's date of admission into the United States. The
date of admission
is the date established by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as the date the alien is admitted for permanent residence. The resources of the sponsor's spouse are included if
the sponsor and spouse live in the same household. Deeming of these resources applies regardless of whether the alien and sponsor live in the same household and regardless of whether the resources are actually available to the alien. For rules that apply in specific situations, see § 416.1166a(d).
(a)
Exclusions from the sponsor's resources.
Before we deem a sponsor's resources to an alien, we exclude the same kinds of resources that are excluded from the resources of an individual eligible for SSI benefits. The applicable exclusions from resources are explained in §§ 416.1210 (paragraphs (a) through (i), (k), and (m) through (t)) through 416.1239 and §§ 416.1247 through 416.1249. For resources excluded by Federal statutes other than the Social Security Act, as applicable to the resources of sponsors deemed to aliens, see the appendix to subpart K of part 416. We next allocate for the sponsor or for the sponsor and spouse (if living together). (The amount of the allocation is the applicable resource limit described in § 416.1205 for an eligible individual and an individual and spouse.)
(b)
An alien sponsored by more than one sponsor.
The resources of an alien who has been sponsored by more than one person are deemed to include the resources of each sponsor.
(c)
More than one alien sponsored by one individual.
If more than one alien is sponsored by one individual the deemed resources are deemed to each alien as if he or she were the only one sponsored by the individual.
(d)
Alien has a sponsor and a parent or a spouse with deemable resources.
Resources may be deemed to an alien from both a sponsor and a spouse or parent (if the alien is a child) provided that the sponsor and the spouse or parent are not the same person and the conditions for each rule are met.
(e)
Alien's sponsor is also the alien's ineligible spouse or parent.
If the sponsor is also the alien's ineligible spouse or parent who lives in the same household, the spouse-to-spouse or parent-to-child deeming rules apply instead of the sponsor-to-alien deeming rules. If the spouse or parent deeming rules cease to apply, the sponsor deeming rules will begin to apply. The spouse or parent rules may cease to apply if an alien child reaches age 18 or if either the sponsor who is the ineligible spouse or parent, or the alien moves to a separate household.
(f)
Alien's sponsor also is the ineligible spouse or parent of another SSI beneficiary.
If the sponsor is also the ineligible spouse or ineligible parent of an SSI beneficiary other than the alien, the sponsor's resources are deemed to the alien under the rules in paragraph (a), and to the eligible spouse or child under the rules in §§ 416.1202, 1205, 1234, 1236, and 1237.
[52 FR 8888, Mar. 20, 1987, as amended at 61 FR 1712, Jan. 23, 1996; 70 FR 41138, July 18, 2005; 73 FR 28036, May 15, 2008]
§ 416.1204a
Deeming of resources where Medicaid eligibility is affected.
Section 416.1161a of this part describes certain circumstances affecting Medicaid eligibility in which the Department will not deem family income to an individual. The Department will follow the same standards, procedures, and limitations set forth in that section with respect to deeming of resources.
[49 FR 5747, Feb. 15, 1984]
§ 416.1205
Limitation on resources.
(a)
Individual with no eligible spouse.
An aged, blind, or disabled individual with no spouse is eligible for benefits under title XVI of the Act if his or her nonexcludable resources do not exceed $1,500 prior to January 1, 1985, and all other eligibility requirements are met. An individual who is living with an ineligible spouse is eligible for benefits under title XVI of the Act if his or her nonexcludable resources, including the resources of the spouse, do not exceed $2,250 prior to January 1, 1985, and all other eligibility requirements are met.
(b)
Individual with an eligible spouse.
An aged, blind, or disabled individual who has an eligible spouse is eligible for benefits under title XVI of the Act if their nonexcludable resources do not exceed $2,250 prior to January 1, 1985, and all other eligibility requirements are met.
(c)
Effective January 1, 1985 and later.
The resources limits and effective dates for January 1, 1985 and later are as follows:

[50 FR 38982, Sept. 26, 1985]
§ 416.1207
Resources determinations.
(a)
General.
Resources determinations are made as of the first moment of the month. A resource determination is based on what assets an individual has, what their values are, and whether or not they are excluded as of the first moment of the month.
(b)
Increase in value of resources.
If, during a month, a resource increases in value or an individual acquires an additional resource or replaces an excluded resource with one that is not excluded, the increase in the value of the resources is counted as of the first moment of the next month
(c)
Decrease in value of resources.
If, during a month, a resource decreases in value or an individual spends a resource or replaces a resource that is not excluded with one that is excluded, the decrease in the value of the resources is counted as of the first moment of the next month.
(d)
Treatment of items under income and resource counting rules.
Items received in cash or in kind during a month are evaluated first under the income counting rules and, if retained until the first moment of the following month, are subject to the rules for counting resources at that time.
(e)
Receipts from the sale, exchange, or replacement of a resource.
If an individual sells, exchanges or replaces a resource, the receipts are not income. They are still considered to be a resource. This rule includes resources that have never been counted as such because they were sold, exchanged or replaced in the month in which they were received. See § 416.1246 for the rule on resources disposed of for less than fair market value (including those disposed of during the month of receipt).

# Example:
Miss L., a disabled individual, receives a $350 unemployment insurance benefit on January 10, 1986. The benefit is unearned income to Miss L. when she receives it. On January 14, Miss L. uses the $350 payment to purchase shares of stock. Miss L. has exchanged one item (cash) for another item (stock). The $350 payment is never counted as a resource to Miss L. because she exchanged it in the same month she received it. The stock is not income; it is a different form of a resource exchanged for the cash. Since a resource is not countable until the first moment of the month following its receipt, the stock is not a countable resource to Miss L. until February 1.
[52 FR 4283, Feb. 11, 1987]
§ 416.1208
How funds held in financial institution accounts are counted.
(a)
General.
Funds held in a financial institution account (including savings, checking, and time deposits, also known as certificates of deposit) are an individual's resource if the individual owns the account and can use the funds for his or her support and maintenance. We determine whether an individual owns the account and can use the funds for his or her support and maintenance by looking at how the individual holds the account. This is reflected in the way the account is titled.
(b)
Individually-held account.
If an individual is designated as sole owner by the account title and can withdraw funds and use them for his or her support and maintenance, all of the funds, regardless of their source, are that individual's resource. For as long as these conditions are met, we presume that the individual owns 100 percent of the funds in the account. This presumption is non-rebuttable.
(c)
Jointly-held account
—(1)
Account holders include one or more SSI claimants or recipients.
If there is only one SSI claimant or recipient account holder on a jointly held account, we presume that all of the funds in the account belong to that individual. If there is more than one claimant or recipient account holder, we presume that all the funds in the account belong to those individuals in equal shares.
(2)
Account holders include one or more deemors.
If none of the account holders is a claimant or recipient, we presume that all of the funds in a jointly-held account belong to the deemor(s), in equal shares if there is more than one deemor. A deemor is a person whose income and resources are required to be considered when determining eligibility and computing the SSI benefit
for an eligible individual (see §§ 416.1160 and 416.1202).
(3)
Right to rebut presumption of ownership.
If the claimant, recipient, or deemor objects or disagrees with an ownership presumption as described in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, we give the individual the opportunity to rebut the presumption. Rebuttal is a procedure as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, which permits an individual to furnish evidence and establish that some or all of the funds in a jointly-held account do not belong to him or her. Successful rebuttal establishes that the individual does not own some or all of the funds. The effect of successful rebuttal may be retroactive as well as prospective.

# Example:
The recipient's first month of eligibility is January 1993. In May 1993 the recipient successfully establishes that none of the funds in a 5-year-old jointly-held account belong to her. We do not count any of the funds as resources for the months of January 1993 and continuing.
(4)
Procedure for rebuttal.
To rebut an ownership presumption as described in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, the individual must:
(i) Submit his/her statement, along with corroborating statements from other account holders, regarding who owns the funds in the joint account, why there is a joint account, who has made deposits to and withdrawals from the account, and how withdrawals have been spent;
(ii) Submit account records showing deposits, withdrawals, and interest (if any) in the months for which ownership of funds is at issue; and
(iii) Correct the account title to show that the individual is no longer a co-owner if the individual owns none of the funds; or, if the individual owns only a portion of the funds, separate the funds owned by the other account holder(s) from his/her own funds and correct the account title on the individual's own funds to show they are solely-owned by the individual.

§ 416.1212
Exclusion of the home.
(a)
Defined.
A home is any property in which an individual (and spouse, if any) has an ownership interest and which serves as the individual's principal place of residence. This property includes the shelter in which an individual resides, the land on which the shelter is located and related outbuildings.
(b)
Home not counted.
We do not count a home regardless of its value. However, see §§ 416.1220 through 416.1224 when there is an income-producing property located on the home property that does not qualify under the home exclusion.
(c)
If an individual changes principal place of residence.
If an individual (and spouse, if any) moves out of his or her home without the intent to return, the home becomes a countable resource because it is no longer the individual's principal place of residence. If an individual leaves his or her home to live in an institution, we still consider the home to be the individual's principal place of residence, irrespective of the individual's intent to return, as long as a spouse or dependent relative of the eligible individual continues to live there. The individual's equity in the former home becomes a countable resource effective with the first day of the month following the month it is no longer his or her principal place of residence.
(d)
If an individual leaves the principal place of residence due to domestic abuse.
If an individual moves out of his or her home without the intent to return, but is fleeing the home as a victim of domestic abuse, we will not count the home as a resource in determining the individual's eligibility to receive, or continue to receive, SSI payments. In that situation, we will consider the home to be the individual's principal place of residence until such time as the individual establishes a new principal place of residence or otherwise takes action rendering the home no longer excludable.
(e)
Proceeds from the sale of an excluded home.
(1) The proceeds from the sale of a home which is excluded from the individual's resources will also be excluded from resources to the extent they are intended to be used and are, in fact, used to purchase another home, which is similarly excluded, within 3 months of the date of receipt of the proceeds.
(2) The value of a promissory note or similar installment sales contract constitutes a “proceed” which can be excluded from resources if—
(i) The note results from the sale of an individual's home as described in § 416.1212(a);
(ii) Within 3 months of receipt (execution) of the note, the individual purchases a replacement home as described in § 416.1212(a) (see paragraph (f) of this section for an exception); and
(iii) All note-generated proceeds are reinvested in the replacement home within 3 months of receipt (see paragraph (g) of this section for an exception).
(3) In addition to excluding the value of the note itself, other proceeds from the sale of the former home are excluded resources if they are used within 3 months of receipt to make payment on the replacement home. Such proceeds, which consist of the downpayment and that portion of any installment amount constituting payment against the principal, represent a conversion of a resource.
(f)
Failure to purchase another excluded home timely.
If the individual does not purchase a replacement home within the 3-month period specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the value of a promissory note or similar installment sales contract received from the sale of an excluded home is a countable resource effective with the first moment of the month following the month the note is executed. If the individual purchases a replacement home after the expiration of the 3-month period, the note becomes an excluded resource the month following the month of purchase of the replacement home provided that all other proceeds are fully and timely reinvested as explained in paragraph (g) of this section.
(g)
Failure to reinvest proceeds timely.
(1) If the proceeds (e.g., installment amounts constituting payment against the principal) from the sale of an excluded home under a promissory note or similar installment sales contract are not reinvested fully and timely (within 3 months of receipt) in a replacement home, as of the first moment of the month following receipt of the payment, the individual's countable resources will include:
(i) The value of the note; and
(ii) That portion of the proceeds, retained by the individual, which was not timely reinvested
(2) The note remains a countable resource until the first moment of the month following the receipt of proceeds that are fully and timely reinvested in the replacement home. Failure to reinvest proceeds for a period of time does not permanently preclude exclusion of the promissory note or installment sales contract. However, previously received proceeds that were not timely reinvested remain countable resources to the extent they are retained.

# Example 1.
On July 10, an SSI recipient received his quarterly payment of $200 from the buyer of his former home under an installment sales contract. As of October 31, the recipient has used only $150 of the July payment in connection with the purchase of a new home. The exclusion of the unused $50 (and of the installment contract itself) is revoked back to July 10. As a result, the $50 and the value of the contract as of August 1, are included in a revised determination of resources for August and subsequent months.

# Example 2.
On April 10, an SSI recipient received a payment of $250 from the buyer of his former home under an installment sales contract. On May 3, he reinvested $200 of the payment in the purchase of a new home. On May 10, the recipient received another $250 payment, and reinvested the full amount on June 3. As of July 31, since the recipient has used only $200 of the April payment in connection with the purchase of the new home, the exclusion of the unused $50 (and of the installment contract itself) is revoked back to April 10. As a result, the $50 and the value of the contract as of May 1 are includable resources. Since the recipient fully and timely reinvested the May payment, the installment contract and the payment are again excludable resources as of June 1. However, the $50 left over from the previous payment remains a countable resource.
(h)
Interest payments.
If interest is received as part of an installment payment resulting from the sale of an excluded home under a promissory note or similar installment sales contract, the interest payments do not represent conversion of a resource. The interest is income under the provisions of §§ 416.1102, 416.1120, and 416.1121(c).

§ 416.1216
Exclusion of household goods and personal effects.
(a)
Household goods.
(1) We do not count household goods as a resource to an individual (and spouse, if any) if they are:
(i) Items of personal property, found in or near the home, that are used on a regular basis; or
(ii) Items needed by the householder for maintenance, use and occupancy of the premises as a home.
(2) Such items include but are not limited to: Furniture, appliances, electronic equipment such as personal computers and television sets, carpets, cooking and eating utensils, and dishes.
(b)
Personal effects.
(1) We do not count personal effects as resources to an individual (and spouse, if any) if they are:
(i) Items of personal property ordinarily worn or carried by the individual; or
(ii) Articles otherwise having an intimate relation to the individual.
(2) Such items include but are not limited to: Personal jewelry including wedding and engagement rings, personal care items, prosthetic devices, and educational or recreational items such as books or musical instruments. We also do not count as resources items of cultural or religious significance to an individual and items required because of an individual's impairment. However, we do count items that were acquired or are held for their value or as an investment because we do not consider these to be personal effects. Such items can include but are not limited to: Gems, jewelry that is not worn or held for family significance, or collectibles. Such items will be subject to the limits in § 416.1205.
[70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005]
§ 416.1218
Exclusion of the automobile.
(a)
Automobile; defined.
As used in this section, the term
automobile
includes, in addition to passenger cars, other vehicles used to provide necessary transportation.
(b)
Limitation on automobiles.
In determining the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any), automobiles are excluded or counted as follows:
(1)
Total exclusion.
One automobile is totally excluded regardless of value if it is used for transportation for the individual or a member of the individual's household.
(2)
Other automobiles.
Any other automobiles are considered to be nonliquid resources. Your equity in the other automobiles is counted as a resource. (See § 416.1201(c).)
[40 FR 48915, Oct. 20, 1975, as amended at 44 FR 43266, July 24, 1979; 50 FR 42687, Oct. 22, 1985; 70 FR 6345, Feb. 7, 2005]
§ 416.1220
Property essential to self-support; general.
When counting the value of resources an individual (and spouse, if any) has, the value of property essential to self-support is not counted, within certain limits. There are different rules for considering this property depending on whether it is income-producing or not. Property essential to self-support can include real and personal property (for example, land, buildings, equipment and supplies, motor vehicles, and tools, etc.) used in a trade or business (as defined in § 404.1066 of part 404), nonbusiness income-producing property (houses or apartments for rent, land other than home property, etc.) and property used to produce goods or services essential to an individual's daily activities. Liquid resources other than those used as part of a trade or business are not property essential to self-support. If the individual's principal place of residence qualifies under the home exclusion, it is not considered in evaluating property essential to self-support.
[50 FR 42687, Oct. 22, 1985]
§ 416.1222
How income-producing property essential to self-support is counted.
(a)
General.
When deciding the value of property used in a trade or business or nonbusiness income-producing activity, only the individual's equity in the property is counted. We will exclude as essential to self-support up to $6,000 of an individual's equity in income-producing property if it produces a net annual income to the individual of at least 6 percent of the excluded equity. If the individual's equity is greater than $6,000, we count only the amount that exceeds $6,000 toward the allowable resource limit specified in § 416.1205 if the net annual income requirement of 6 percent is met on the excluded equity. If the activity produces less than a 6-percent return due to circumstances beyond the individual's control (for example, crop failure, illness, etc.), and there is a reasonable expectation that the individual's activity will again produce a 6-percent return, the property is also excluded. If the individual owns more than one piece of property and each produces income, each is looked at to see if the 6-percent rule is met and then the amounts of the individual's equity in all of those properties producing 6 percent are totaled to see if the total equity is $6,000 or less. The equity in those properties that do not meet the 6-percent rule is counted toward the allowable resource limit specified in § 416.1205. If the individual's total equity in the properties producing 6-percent income is over the $6,000 equity limit, the amount of equity exceeding
$6,000 is counted as a resource toward the allowable resource limit.

# Example 1.
Sharon has a small business in her home making hand-woven rugs. The looms and other equipment used in the business have a current market value of $7,000. The value of her equity is $5,500 since she owes $1,500 on the looms. Sharon's net earnings from self-employment is $400. Since Sharon's equity in the looms and other equipment ($5,500) is under the $6,000 limit for property essential to self-support and her net income after expenses ($400) is greater than 6 percent of her equity, her income-producing property is excluded from countable resources. The home is not considered in any way in valuing property essential to self-support.

# Example 2.
Charlotte operates a farm. She owns 3 acres of land on which her home is located. She also owns 10 acres of farm land not connected to her home. There are 2 tool sheds and 2 animal shelters located on the 10 acres. She has various pieces of farm equipment that are necessary for her farming activities. We exclude the house and the 3 acres under the home exclusion (see § 416.1212). However, we look at the other 10 acres of land, the buildings and equipment separately to see if her total equity in them is no more than $6,000 and if the annual rate of return is 6 percent of her equity. In this case, the 10 acres and buildings are valued at $4,000 and the few items of farm equipment and other inventory are valued at $1,500. Charlotte sells produce which nets her more than 6 percent for this year. The 10 acres and other items are excluded as essential to her self-support and they continue to be excluded as long as she meets the 6-percent annual return requirement and the equity value of the 10 acres and other items remains less than $6,000.

# Example 3.
Henry has an automobile repair business valued at $5,000. There are no debts on the property and bills are paid monthly. For the past 4 years the business has just broken even. Since Henry's income from the business is less then 6 percent of his equity, the entire $5,000 is counted as his resources. Since this exceeds the resources limit as described in § 416.1205, he is not eligible for SSI benefits.
(b)
Exception.
Property that represents the authority granted by a governmental agency to engage in an income-producing activity is excluded as property essential to self-support if it is:
(1) Used in a trade or business or nonbusiness income-producing activity; or
(2) Not used due to circumstances beyond the individual's control, e.g., illness, and there is a reasonable expectation that the use will resume.

# Example:
John owns a commercial fishing permit granted by the State Commerce Commission, a boat, and fishing tackle. The boat and tackle have an equity value of $6,500. Last year, John earned $2,000 from his fishing business. The value of the fishing permit is not determined because the permit is excluded under the exception. The boat and tackle are producing in excess of a 6 percent return on the excluded equity value, so they are excluded under the general rule (see paragraph (a) of this section) up to $6,000. The $500 excess value is counted toward the resource limit as described in § 416.1205.
[50 FR 42687, Oct. 22, 1985]
§ 416.1224
How nonbusiness property used to produce goods or services essential to self-support is counted.
Nonbusiness property is considered to be essential for an individual's (and spouse, if any) self-support if it is used to produce goods or services necessary for his or her daily activities. This type of property includes real property such as land which is used to produce vegetables or livestock only for personal consumption in the individual's household (for example, corn, tomatoes, chicken, cattle). This type of property also includes personal property necessary to perform daily functions exclusive of passenger cars, trucks, boats, or other special vehicles. (See § 416.1218 for a discussion on how automobiles are counted.) Property used to produce goods or services or property necessary to perform daily functions is excluded if the individual's equity in the property does not exceed $6,000. Personal property which is required by the individual's employer for work is not counted, regardless of value, while the individual is employed. Examples of this type of personal property include tools, safety equipment, uniforms and similar items.

# Example:
Bill owns a small unimproved lot several blocks from his home. He uses the lot, which is valued at $4,800, to grow vegetables and fruit only for his own consumption. Since his equity in the property is less than $6,000, the property is excluded as necessary to self-support.

§ 416.1225
An approved plan to achieve self-support; general.
If you are blind or disabled, we will pay you SSI benefits and will not count resources that you use or set aside to use for expenses that we determine to be reasonable and necessary to fulfill an approved plan to achieve self-support.
[71 FR 28265, May 16, 2006]
§ 416.1226
What is a plan to achieve self-support (PASS)?
(a) A PASS must—
(1) Be designed especially for you;
(2) Be in writing;
(3) Be approved by us (a change of plan must also be approved by us);
(4) Have a specific employment goal that is feasible for you, that is, a goal that you have a reasonable likelihood of achieving;
(5) Have a plan to reach your employment goal that is viable and financially sustainable, that is, the plan—
(i) Sets forth steps that are attainable in order to reach your goal, and
(ii) Shows that you will have enough money to meet your living expenses while setting aside income or resources to reach your goal;
(6) Be limited to one employment goal; however, the employment goal may be modified and any changes related to the modification must be made to the plan;
(7) Show how the employment goal will generate sufficient earnings to substantially reduce your dependence on SSI or eliminate your need for title II disability benefits;

# Example 1:
A Substantial Reduction Exists. Your SSI monthly payment amount is $101 and your PASS employment goal earnings will reduce your SSI payment by $90. We may consider that to be a substantial reduction.

# Example 2:
A Substantial Reduction Exists. You receive a title II benefit of $550 and an SSI payment of $73. Your PASS employment goal will result in work over the SGA level that eliminates your title II benefit but increases your SSI payment by $90. We may consider that a substantial reduction because your work will eliminate your title II payment while only slightly increasing your SSI payment.

# Example 3:
A Substantial Reduction Does Not Exist. Your SSI monthly payment amount is $603 and your PASS employment goal earnings will reduce your SSI payment by $90. We may not consider that to be a substantial reduction.
(8) Contain a beginning date and an ending date to meet your employment goal;
(9) Give target dates for meeting milestones towards your employment goal;
(10) Show what expenses you will have and how they are reasonable and necessary to meet your employment goal;
(11) Show what resources you have and will receive, how you will use them to attain your employment goal, and how you will meet your living expenses; and
(12) Show how the resources you set aside under the plan will be kept separate from your other resources.
(b) You must propose a reasonable ending date for your PASS. If necessary, we can help you establish an ending date, which may be different than the ending date you propose. Once the ending date is set and you begin your PASS, we may adjust or extend the ending date of your PASS based on progress towards your goal and earnings level reached.
(c) If your employment goal is self-employment, you must include a business plan that defines the business, provides a marketing strategy, details financial data, outlines the operational procedures, and describes the management plan.
(d) Your progress will be reviewed at least annually to determine if you are following the provisions of your plan.

§ 416.1227
When the resources excluded under a plan to achieve self-support begin to count.
The resources that were excluded under the individual's plan will begin to be counted as of the first day of the month following the month in which any of these circumstances occur:
(a) Failing to follow the conditions of the plan:
(b) Abandoning the plan;
(c) Completing the time schedule outlined in the plan; or
(d) Reaching the goal as outlined in the plan.

§ 416.1228
Exclusion of Alaskan natives' stock in regional or village corporations.
(a) In determining the resources of a native of Alaska (and spouse, if any) there will be excluded from resources, shares of stock held in a regional or village corporation during the period of 20 years in which such stock is inalienable, as provided by sections 7(h) and 8(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1606, 1607). The 20-year period of inalienability terminates on January 1, 1992.

§ 416.1229
Exclusion of payments received as compensation for expenses incurred or losses suffered as a result of a crime.
(a) In determining the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any), any amount received from a fund established by a State to aid victims of crime is excluded from resources for a period of 9 months beginning with the month following the month of receipt.
(b) To be excluded from resources under this section, the individual (or spouse) must demonstrate that any amount received was compensation for expenses incurred or losses suffered as the result of a crime.
[61 FR 1712, Jan. 23, 1996]
§ 416.1230
Exclusion of life insurance.
(a)
General.
In determining the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any), life insurance owned by the individual (and spouse, if any) will be considered to the extent of its cash surrender value. If, however, the total face value of all life insurance policies on any person does not exceed $1,500, no part of the cash surrender value of such life insurance will be taken into account in determining the resources of the individual (and spouse, if any). In determining the face value of life insurance on the individual (and spouse, if any), term insurance and burial insurance will not be taken into account.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Life insurance.
Life insurance is a contract under which the insurer agrees to pay a specified amount upon the death of the insured.
(2)
Insurer.
The insurer is the company or association which contracts with the owner of the insurance.
(3)
Insured.
The insured is the person upon whose life insurance is effected.
(4)
Owner.
The owner is the person who has the right to change the policy. This is normally the person who pays the premiums.
(5)
Term insurance.
Term insurance is a form of life insurance having no cash surrender value and generally furnishing insurance protection for only a specified or limited period of time.
(6)
Face value.
Face value is the basic death benefit of the policy exclusive of dividend additions or additional amounts payable because of accidental death or under other special provisions.
(7)
Cash surrender value.
Cash surrender value is the amount which the insurer will pay (usually to the owner) upon cancellation of the policy before death of the insured or before maturity of the policy.
(8)
Burial insurance.
Burial insurance is insurance whose terms specifically provide that the proceeds can be used only to pay the burial expenses of the insured.
§ 416.1231
Burial spaces and certain funds set aside for burial expenses.
(a)
Burial spaces
—(1)
General.
In determining the resources of an individual, the value of burial spaces for the individual, the individual's spouse or any member of the individual's immediate family will be excluded from resources.
(2)
Burial spaces defined.
For purposes of this section “burial spaces” include burial plots, gravesites, crypts, mausoleums, urns, niches and other customary and traditional repositories for the deceased's bodily remains provided such spaces are owned by the individual or are held for his or her use. Additionally, the term includes necessary and reasonable improvements or additions to or upon such burial spaces including, but not limited to, vaults, headstones, markers, plaques, or burial
containers and arrangements for opening and closing the gravesite for burial of the deceased.
(3)
An agreement representing the purchase of a burial space.
The value of an agreement representing the purchase of a burial space, including any accumulated interest, will be excluded from resources. We do not consider a burial space “held for” an individual under an agreement unless the individual currently owns and is currently entitled to the use of the space under that agreement. For example, we will not consider a burial space “held for” an individual under an installment sales agreement or other similar device under which the individual does not currently own nor currently have the right to use the space, nor is the seller currently obligated to provide the space, until the purchase amount is paid in full.
(4)
Immediate family defined.
For purposes of this section
immediate family
means an individual's minor and adult children, including adopted children and step-children; an individual's brothers, sisters, parents, adoptive parents, and the spouses of those individuals. Neither dependency nor living-in-the-same-household will be a factor in determining whether a person is an immediate family member.
(b)
Funds set aside for burial expenses
—(1)
Exclusion.
In determining the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any) there shall be excluded an amount not in excess of $1,500 each of funds specifically set aside for the burial expenses of the individual or the individual's spouse. This exclusion applies only if the funds set aside for burial expenses are kept separate from all other resources not intended for burial of the individual (or spouse) and are clearly designated as set aside for the individual's (or spouse's) burial expenses. If excluded burial funds are mixed with resources not intended for burial, the exclusion will not apply to any portion of the funds. This exclusion is in addition to the burial space exclusion.
(2)
Exception for parental deeming situations.
If an individual is an eligible child, the burial funds (up to $1,500) that are set aside for the burial arrangements of the eligible child's ineligible parent or parent's spouse will not be counted in determining the resources of such eligible child.
(3)
Burial funds defined.
For purposes of this section “burial funds” are revocable burial contracts, burial trusts, other burial arrangements (including amounts paid on installment sales contracts for burial spaces), cash, accounts, or other financial instruments with a definite cash value clearly designated for the individual's (or spouse's, if any) burial expenses and kept separate from nonburial-related assets. Property other than listed in this definition will not be considered “burial funds.”
(4)
Recipients currently receiving SSI benefits.
Recipients currently eligible as of July 11, 1990, who have had burial funds excluded which do not meet all of the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (3) of this section must convert or separate such funds to meet these requirements unless there is an impediment to such conversion or separation;
i.e.
, a circumstance beyond an individual's control which makes conversion/separation impossible or impracticable. For so long as such an impediment or circumstance exists, the burial funds will be excluded if the individual remains otherwise continuously eligible for the exclusion.
(5)
Reductions.
Each person's (as described in §§ 416.1231(b)(1) and 416.1231(b)(2)) $1,500 exclusion must be reduced by:
(i) The face value of insurance policies on the life of an individual owned by the individual or spouse (if any) if the cash surrender value of those policies has been excluded from resources as provided in § 416.1230; and
(ii) Amounts in an irrevocable trust (or other irrevocable arrangement) available to meet the burial expenses.
(6)
Irrevocable trust or other irrevocable arrangement.
Funds in an irrevocable trust or other irrevocable arrangement which are available for burial are funds which are held in an irrevocable burial contract, an irrevocable burial trust, or an amount in an irrevocable trust which is specifically identified as available for burial expenses.
(7)
Increase in value of burial funds.
Interest earned on excluded burial funds and appreciation in the value of excluded burial arrangements which
occur beginning November 1, 1982, or the date of first SSI eligibility, whichever is later, are excluded from resources if left to accumulate and become part of the separate burial fund.
(8)
Burial funds used for some other purpose.
(i) Excluded burial funds must be used solely for that purpose.
(ii) If any excluded funds are used for a purpose other than the burial arrangements of the individual or the individual's spouse for whom the funds were set aside, future SSI benefits of the individual (or the individual and eligible spouse) will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of excluded burial funds used for another purpose. This penalty for use of excluded burial funds for a purpose other than the burial arrangements of the individual (or spouse) will apply only if, as of the first moment of the month of use, the individual would have had resources in excess of the limit specified in § 416.1205 without application of the exclusion.
(9)
Extension of burial fund exclusion during suspension.
The exclusion of burial funds and accumulated interest and appreciation will continue to apply throughout a period of suspension as described in § 416.1320, so long as the individual's eligibility has not been terminated as described in §§ 416.1331 through 416.1335.

§ 416.1232
Replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen excluded resources.
(a) Cash (including any interest earned on the cash) or in-kind replacement received from any source for purposes of repairing or replacing an excluded resource (as defined in § 416.1210) that is lost, damaged, or stolen is excluded as a resource. This exclusion applies if the cash (and the interest) is used to repair or replace the excluded resource within 9 months of the date the individual received the cash. Any of the cash (and interest) that is not used to repair or replace the excluded resource will be counted as a resource beginning with the month after the 9-month period expires.
(b) The initial 9-month time period will be extended for a reasonable period up to an additional 9 months where we find the individual had good cause for not replacing or repairing the resource. An individual will be found to have good cause when circumstances beyond his or her control prevented the repair or replacement or the contracting for the repair or replacement of the resource. The 9-month extension can only be granted if the individual intends to use the cash or in-kind replacement items to repair or replace the lost, stolen, or damaged excluded resource in addition to having good cause for not having done so. If good cause is found for an individual, any unused cash (and interest) is counted as a resource beginning with the month after the good cause extension period expires.
Exception: For victims of Hurricane Andrew only,
the extension period for good cause may be extended for up to an additional 12 months beyond the 9-month extension when we find that the individual had good cause for not replacing or repairing an excluded resource within the 9-month extension.
(c) The time period described in paragraph (b) of this section (except the time period for individuals granted an additional extension under the Hurricane Andrew provision) may be extended for a reasonable period up to an additional 12 months in the case of a catastrophe which is declared to be a major disaster by the President of the United States if the excluded resource is geographically located within the disaster area as defined by the Presidential order; the individual intends to repair or replace the excluded resource; and, the individual demonstrates good cause why he or she has not been able to repair or replace the excluded resource within the 18-month period.
(d) Where an extension of the time period is made for good cause and the individual changes his or her intent to repair or replace the excluded resource, funds previously held for replacement or repair will be counted as a resource effective with the month that the individual reports this change of intent.

§ 416.1233
Exclusion of certain underpayments from resources.
(a)
General.
In determining the resources of an eligible individual (and spouse, if any), we will exclude, for 9 months following the month of receipt, the unspent portion of any title II or title XVI retroactive payment received on or after March 2, 2004.
Exception:
We will exclude for 6 months following the month of receipt the unspent portion of any title II or title XVI retroactive payment received before March 2, 2004. This exclusion also applies to such payments received by any other person whose resources are subject to deeming under this subpart.
(b)
Retroactive payments.
For purposes of this exclusion, a retroactive payment is one that is paid after the month in which it was due. A title XVI retroactive payment includes any retroactive amount of federally administered State supplementation.
(c)
Limitation on exclusion.
This exclusion applies only to any unspent portion of retroactive payments made under title II or XVI. Once the money from the retroactive payment is spent, this exclusion does not apply to items purchased with the money, even if the 6-month or 9-month period, whichever is applicable (see paragraph (a) of this section), has not expired. However, other exclusions may be applicable. As long as the funds from the retroactive payment are not spent, they are excluded for the full 6-month or 9-month period, whichever is applicable.
(d)
Funds must be identifiable.
Unspent money from a retroactive payment must be identifiable from other resources for this exclusion to apply. The money may be commingled with other funds but, if this is done in such a fashion that the retroactive amount can no longer be separately identified, that amount will count toward the resource limit described in § 416.1205.
(e)
Written notice.
We will give each recipient a written notice of the exclusion limitation when we make the retroactive payment.
[51 FR 34464, Sept. 29, 1986, as amended at 54 FR 19164, May 4, 1989; 70 FR 41138, July 18, 2005]
§ 416.1234
Exclusion of Indian lands.
In determining the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any) who is of Indian descent from a federally recognized Indian tribe, we will exclude any interest of the individual (or spouse, if any) in land which is held in trust by the United States for an individual Indian or tribe, or which is held by an individual Indian or tribe and which can only be sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of with the approval of other individuals, his or her tribe, or an agency of the Federal Government.

§ 416.1235
Exclusion of certain payments related to tax credits.
(a) In determining the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any), we exclude for the 9 months following the month of receipt the following funds received on or after March 2, 2004, the unspent portion of:
(1) Any payment of a refundable credit pursuant to section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to the earned income tax credit);
(2) Any payment from an employer under section 3507 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to advance payment of the earned income tax credit); or
(3) Any payment of a refundable credit pursuant to section 24 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to the child tax credit).
(b) Any unspent funds described in paragraph (a) of this section that are retained until the first moment of the tenth month following their receipt are countable as resources at that time.
(c)
Exception:
For any payments described in paragraph (a) of this section received before March 2, 2004, we will exclude for the month following the month of receipt the unspent portion of any such payment.
[75 FR 1273, Jan. 11, 2010]

(a) Assistance received under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act or other assistance provided under a Federal statute because of a catastrophe which is declared to be a major disaster by the President of the United States or comparable assistance received from a State or local government, or from a disaster assistance organization, is excluded in determining countable resources under § 416.1210.

[61 FR 1712, Jan. 23, 1996]
§ 416.1240
Disposition of resources.
(a) Where the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any) are determined to exceed the limitations prescribed in § 416.1205, such individual (and spouse, if any) shall not be eligible for payment except under the conditions provided in this section. Payment will be made to an individual (and spouse, if any) if the individual agrees in writing to:
(1) Dispose of, at current market value, the nonliquid resources (as defined in § 416.1201(c)) in excess of the limitations prescribed in § 416.1205 within the time period specified in § 416.1242; and
(2) Repay any overpayments (as defined in § 416.1244) with the proceeds of such disposition.
(b) Payment made for the period during which the resources are being disposed of will be conditioned upon the disposition of those resources as prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. Any payments so made are (at the time of disposition) considered overpayments to the extent they would not have been paid had the disposition occurred at the beginning of the period for which such payments were made.
(c) If an individual fails to dispose of the resources as prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, regardless of the efforts he or she makes to dispose of them, the resources will be counted at their current market value and the individual will be ineligible due to excess resources. We will use the original estimate of current market value unless the individual submits evidence establishing a lower value (e.g., an estimate from a disinterested knowledgeable source).
[75 FR 1274, Jan. 11, 2010]
§ 416.1242
Time limits for disposing of resources.
(a) In order for payment conditioned on the disposition of nonliquid resources to be made, the individual must agree in writing to dispose of real property within 9 months and personal property within 3 months. The time period for disposal of property begins on the date we accept the individual's signed written agreement to dispose of the property. If we receive a signed agreement on or after the date we have determined that the individual meets the eligibility requirements described in § 416.202 of this part, with the exception of the resource requirements described in this subpart, our acceptance of the written agreement will occur on the date the individual receives our written notice that the agreement is in effect. If we receive a signed agreement prior to the date we determine that all nonresource requirements are met, our acceptance of the written agreement will not occur until the date the individual receives our written notice that all nonresource requirements are met and that the agreement is in effect. When the written notice is mailed to the individual, we assume that the notice was received 5 days after the date shown on the notice unless the individual shows us that he or she did not receive it within the 5-day period.
(b) The 3-month time period for disposition of personal property will be extended an additional 3 months where it is found that the individual had “good cause” for failing to dispose of the resources within the original time period. The rules on the valuation of real property not disposed of within 9 months are described in § 416.1245(b).
(c) An individual will be found to have “good cause” for failing to dispose of a resource if, despite reasonable and diligent effort on his part, he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from disposing of the resource.
(d) In determining whether the appropriate time limits discussed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section have elapsed, no month will be counted for which an individual's benefits have been suspended as described in § 416.1320, provided that the reason for the suspension is unrelated to the requirements in § 416.1245(b) and that the individual's eligibility has not been terminated as defined in §§ 416.1331 through 416.1335.

§ 416.1244
Treatment of proceeds from disposition of resources.
(a) Upon disposition of the resources, the net proceeds to the individual from the sale are considered available to repay that portion of the payments that would not have been made had the disposition occurred at the beginning of the period for which payment was made.
(b) The net proceeds from disposition will normally be the sales price less any encumbrance on the resource and the expenses of sale such as transfer taxes, fees, advertising costs, etc. where, however, a resource has been sold (or otherwise transferred) by an individual to a friend or relative for less than its current market value, the net proceeds will be the current market value less costs of sale and encumbrance.
(c) After deducting any amount necessary to raise the individual's (and spouse's, if any) resources to the applicable limits described in § 416.1205, as of the beginning of the disposition period, the balance of the net proceeds will be used to recover the payments made to the individual (and spouse, if any). Any remaining proceeds are considered liquid resources.
(d) The overpayment to be recovered is equal to the balance of the net proceeds (as described in paragraph (c) of this section) or the total payments made to the individual (and spouse, if any) for the period of disposition, whichever is less.
[40 FR 48915, Oct. 20, 1975, as amended at 50 FR 38982, Sept. 28, 1985]
§ 416.1245
Exceptions to required disposition of real property.
(a)
Loss of housing for joint owner.
Excess real property which would be a resource under § 416.1201 is not a countable resource for conditional benefit purposes when: it is jointly owned; and sale of the property by an individual would cause the other owner undue hardship due to loss of housing. Undue hardship would result when the property serves as the principal place of residence for one (or more) of the other owners, sale of the property would result in loss of that residence, and no other housing would be readily available for the displaced other owner (e.g., the other owner does not own another house that is legally available for occupancy). However, if undue hardship ceases to exist, its value will be included in countable resources as described in § 416.1207.
(b)
Reasonable efforts to sell.
(1) Excess real property is not included in countable resources for so long as the individual's reasonable efforts to sell it have been unsuccessful. The basis for determining whether efforts to sell are reasonable, as well as unsuccessful, will be a 9-month disposal period described in § 416.1242. If it is determined that reasonable efforts to sell have been unsuccessful, further SSI payments will not be conditioned on the disposition of the property and only the benefits paid during the 9-month disposal period will be subject to recovery. In order to be eligible for payments after the conditional benefits period, the individual must continue to make reasonable efforts to sell.
(2) A conditional benefits period involving excess real property begins as described at § 416.1242(a). The conditional benefits period ends at the earliest of the following times:
(i) Sale of the property;
(ii) Lack of continued reasonable efforts to sell;
(iii) The individual's written request for cancellation of the agreement;
(iv) Countable resources, even without the conditional exclusion, fall below the applicable limit (e.g., liquid resources have been depleted); or
(v) The 9-month disposal period has expired.
(3) Reasonable efforts to sell property consist of taking all necessary steps to sell it in the geographic area covered by the media serving the area in which the property is located, unless the individual has good cause for not taking these steps. More specifically, making a reasonable effort to sell means that:
(i) Except for gaps of no more than 1 week, an individual must attempt to sell the property by listing it with a real estate agent or by undertaking to sell it himself;
(ii) Within 30 days of receiving notice that we have accepted the individual's signed written agreement to dispose of the property, and absent good cause for not doing so, the individual must:
(A) List the property with an agent; or
(B) Begin to advertise it in at least one of the appropriate local media, place a “For Sale” sign on the property (if permitted), begin to conduct “open houses” or otherwise show the property to interested parties on a continuous basis, and attempt any other appropriate methods of sale; and
(iii) The individual accepts any reasonable offer to buy and has the burden of demonstrating that an offer was rejected because it was not reasonable. If the individual receives an offer that is at least two-thirds of the latest estimate of current market value, the individual must present evidence to establish that the offer was unreasonable and was rejected.
(4) An individual will be found to have “good cause” for failing to make reasonable efforts to sell under paragraph (b)(3) of this section if he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from taking the steps specified in paragraph (b)(3) (i) through (ii) of this section.
(5) An individual who has received conditional benefits through the expiration of the 9 month disposal period and whose benefits have been suspended as described at § 416.1320 for reasons unrelated to the property excluded under the conditional benefits agreement, but whose eligibility has not been terminated as defined at §§ 416.1331 through 416.1335, can continue to have the excess real property not included in countable resources upon reinstatement of SSI payments if reasonable efforts to sell the property resume within 1 week of reinstatement. Such an individual will not have to go through a subsequent conditional benefits period. However, the individual whose eligibility has been terminated as defined at §§ 416.1331 through 416.1335 and who subsequently reapplies would be subject to a new conditional benefits period if there is still excess real property.

(1) An individual (or eligible spouse) who gives away or sells a nonexcluded resource for less than fair market value for the purpose of establishing SSI or Medicaid eligibility will be charged with the difference between the fair market value of the resource and the amount of compensation received. The difference is referred to as uncompensated value and is counted toward the resource limit (see § 416.1205) for a period of 24 months from the date of transfer.
(2) If the transferred resource (asset) is returned to the individual, the uncompensated value is no longer counted as of the date of return. If the transferred asset is cash, the uncompensated value is reduced as of the date of return by the amount of cash that is returned. No income will be charged as a result of such returns. The returned asset will be evaluated as a resource according to the rules described in §§ 416.1201 through 416.1230 as of the first day of the following month.
(3) If the individual receives additional compensation in the form of cash for the transferred asset the uncompensated value is reduced, as of the date the additional cash compensation is received, by the amount of that additional compensation.
(b)
Fair market value.
Fair market value is equal to the current market value of a resource at the time of transfer or contract of sale, if earlier. See § 416.1101 for definition of current market value.
(c)
Compensation.
The compensation for a resource includes all money, real or personal property, food, shelter, or
services received by the individual (or eligible spouse) at or after the time of transfer in exchange for the resource if the compensation was provided pursuant to a binding (legally enforceable) agreement in effect at the time of transfer. Compensation also includes all money, real or personal property, food, shelter, or services received prior to the actual transfer if they were provided pursuant to a binding (legally enforceable) agreement whereby the eligible individual would transfer the resource or otherwise pay for such items. In addition, payment or assumption of a legal debt owed by the eligible individual in exchange for the asset is considered compensation.
(d)(1)
Uncompensated value—General.
The uncompensated value is the fair market value of a resource at the time of transfer minus the amount of compensation received by the individual (or eligible spouse) in exchange for the resource. However, if the transferred resource was partially excluded, we will not count uncompensated value in an amount greater than the countable value of the resources at the time of transfer.
(2)
Suspension of counting as a resource the uncompensated value where necessary to avoid undue hardship.
We will suspend counting as a resource the uncompensated value of the transferred asset for any month in the 24-month period if such counting will result in undue hardship. We will resume counting the uncompensated value as a resource for any month of the 24-month period in which counting will not result in undue hardship. We will treat as part of the 24-month period any months during which we suspend the counting of uncompensated value.
(3)
When undue hardship exists.
Undue hardship exists when:
(i) An individual alleges that failure to receive SSI benefits would deprive the individual of food or shelter; and
(ii) The applicable Federal benefit rate (plus the federally-administered State supplementary payment level) exceeds the sum of: The individual's monthly countable and excludable income and monthly countable and excludable liquid resources.
(e)
Presumption that resource was transferred to establish SSI or Medicaid eligibility.
Transfer of a resource for less than fair market value is presumed to have been made for the purpose of establishing SSI or Medicaid eligibility unless the individual (or eligible spouse) furnishes convincing evidence that the resource was transferred exclusively for some other reason. Convincing evidence may be pertinent documentary or non-documentary evidence which shows, for example, that the transfer was ordered by a court, or that at the time of transfer the individual could not have anticipated becoming eligible due to the existence of other circumstances which would have precluded eligibility. The burden of rebutting the presumption that a resource was transferred to establish SSI or Medicaid eligibility rests with the individual (or eligible spouse).
(f)
Applicability.
This section applies only to transfers of resources that occurred before July 1, 1988. Paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, regarding undue hardship, are effective for such transfers on or after April 1, 1988.

§ 416.1247
Exclusion of a dedicated account in a financial institution.
(a)
General.
In determining the resources of an individual (or spouse, if any), the funds in a dedicated account in a financial institution established and maintained in accordance with § 416.640(e) will be excluded from resources. This exclusion applies only to benefits which must or may be deposited in such an account, as specified in § 416.546, and accrued interest or other earnings on these benefits. If these funds are commingled with any other funds (other than accumulated earnings or interest) this exclusion will not apply to any portion of the funds in the dedicated account.
(b)
Exclusion during a period of suspension or termination
—(1)
Suspension.
The exclusion of funds in a dedicated account and interest and other earnings thereon continues to apply during a period of suspension due to ineligibility as described in § 416.1320, administrative suspension, or a period of eligibility for which no payment is due, so long as the individual's eligibility has
not been terminated as described in §§ 416.1331 through 416.1335.
(2)
Termination.
Once an individual's eligibility has been terminated, any funds previously excluded under paragraph (a) of this section may not be excluded if the individual establishes a subsequent period of eligibility by filing a new application.
[61 FR 67207, Dec. 20, 1996]
§ 416.1248
Exclusion of gifts to children with life-threatening conditions.
In determining the resources of an individual who has not attained 18 years of age and who has a life-threatening condition, we will exclude any gifts from an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code. We will exclude any in-kind gift that is not converted to cash and cash gifts to the extent that the total gifts excluded pursuant to this paragraph do not exceed $2000 in any calendar year. In-kind gifts converted to cash are considered under income counting rules in the month of conversion.

§ 416.1249
Exclusion of payments received as restitution for misuse of benefits by a representative payee.
In determining the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any), the unspent portion of any payment received by the individual as restitution for title II, title VIII or title XVI benefits misused by a representative payee under § 404.2041, § 408.641 or § 416.641, respectively, is excluded for 9 months following the month of receipt.

§ 416.1250
How we count grants, scholarships, fellowships or gifts.
(a) When we determine your resources (or your spouse's, if any), we will exclude for 9 months any portion of any grant, scholarship, fellowship, or gift that you use or set aside to pay the cost of tuition, fees, or other necessary educational expenses at any educational institution, including vocational or technical institutions. The 9 months begin the month after the month you receive the educational assistance.
(b)(1) We will count as a resource any portion of a grant, scholarship, fellowship, or gift you (or your spouse, if any) did not use or set aside to pay tuition, fees, or other necessary educational expenses. We will count such portion of a grant, scholarship, fellowship or gift as a resource in the month following the month of receipt.
(2) If you use any of the funds that were set aside for tuition, fees, or other necessary educational expenses for another purpose within the 9-month exclusion period, we will count such portion of the funds used for another purpose as income in the month you use them.
(3) If any portion of the funds are no longer set aside for paying tuition, fees, or other necessary educational expenses within the 9-month exclusion period, we will count the portion of the funds no longer set aside as income in the month when they are no longer set aside for paying tuition, fees, or other necessary educational expenses. We will consider any remaining funds that are no longer set aside or used to pay tuition, fees, or other educational expenses as a resource in the month following the month we count them as income.
(4) We will count any portion of grants, scholarships, fellowships, or gifts remaining unspent after the 9-month exclusion period as a resource beginning with the 10th month after you received the educational assistance.

§ 416.1260
Special resource provision for recipients under a State plan.
(a)
General.
In the case of any individual (or individual and spouse, as the case may be) who for the month of December 1973 was a recipient of aid or assistance under a State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI, of the Act (see § 416.121), the resources of such individual (or individual and spouse, as the case may be) shall be deemed not to exceed the amount specified in § 416.1205 during any period that the resources of such individual (or individual and spouse, as the case may be) do not exceed the maximum amount of
resources specified in such State plan as in effect in October 1972, provided that such individual:
(1) Has, since December 1973, resided continuously in the State under whose plan he was eligible for the month of December 1973; and
(2) Has not, since December 1973, been ineligible for an SSI benefit for a period exceeding 6 consecutive months. An SSI benefit means a Federal benefit only; it does not include any State supplementation.
(b) For purposes of this section, an individual will cease to reside continuously in a State if he leaves the State with the present intention to abandon his home there. In the absence of evidence to the contrary,
(1) If an individual leaves the State for a period of 90 calendar days or less, his absence from the State will be considered temporary and he will be considered to continue to reside in such State; and
(2) If an individual leaves the State for a period in excess of 90 calendar days, he will no longer be considered to reside continuously in such State.
(c)
State plan; defined.
As used in this subpart,
an approved State plan as in effect in October 1972
and

§ 416.1262
Special resource provision applicable in cases involving essential persons.
(a)
Essential persons continuously meet criteria of eligibility.
In determining the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any) who meet the conditions specified in § 416.1260 and whose payment standard is increased because such individual has in his home an essential person (as defined in § 416.222), either the State plan resource limit and exclusions (as specified in § 416.1260) applicable to cases in which the needs of an essential person are taken into account in determining the individual's needs, or the resource limit as specified in § 416.1205 and exclusions as specified in § 416.1210, whichever is most advantageous to the individual (and spouse), will be used.
(b)
Essential person fails to meet criteria of eligibility.

Individual under special resource provision dies after December 1973.
Where only one person, either the eligible individual or the eligible spouse, meets the conditions specified in § 416.1260 and that person dies after December 1973, the State plan resource limitation and exclusions will not be
applied to determine the amount of resources of the surviving individual.

40 FR 1510, Jan. 8, 1975, unless otherwise noted.
§ 416.1320
Suspensions; general.
(a)
When suspension is proper.
Suspension of benefit payments is required when a recipient is alive but no longer meets the requirements of eligibility under title XVI of the Act (see subpart B of this part) and termination in accordance with §§ 416.1331 through 416.1335 does not apply. (This subpart does not cover suspension of payments for administrative reasons, as, for example, when mail is returned as undeliverable by the Postal Service and the Administration does not have a valid mailing address for a recipient or when the representative payee dies and a search is underway for a substitute representative payee.)
(b)
Effect of suspension.
(1) When payments are correctly suspended due to the ineligibility of a recipient, payments shall not be resumed until the individual again meets all requirements for eligibility except the filing of a new application. Such recipient, upon requesting reinstatement, shall be required to submit such evidence as may be necessary (except evidence of age, disability, or blindness) to establish that he or she again meets all requirements for eligibility under this part. Payments to such recipient shall be reinstated effective with the first day such recipient meets all requirements for eligibility except the filing of a new application.
(2) A month of ineligibility for purposes of determining when to prorate the SSI benefit payment for a subsequent month, is a month for which the individual is ineligible for any Federal SSI benefit and any federally administered State supplementation.
(c)
Actions which are not suspensions.
Payments are not “suspended,” but the claim is disallowed, when it is found that:
(1) The claimant was notified in accordance with § 416.210(c) at or about the time he filed application and before he received payment of a benefit that he should file a claim for a payment of the type discussed in § 416.1330 and such claimant has failed, without good cause (see § 416.210(e)(2)), to take all appropriate steps within 30 days after receipt of such notice to file and prosecute an application for such payment;
(2) Upon initial application, payment of benefits was conditioned upon disposal of specified resources which exceeded the permitted amount and the claimant did not comply with the agreed-upon conditions;
(3) Payment was made to an individual faced with a financial emergency who was later found to have been not eligible for payment; or
(4) Payment was made to an individual presumed to be disabled and such disability is not established.
(d)
Exception.
Even though conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section apply because your impairment is no longer disabling or you are no longer blind under § 416.986(a)(1), (a)(2) or (b), we will not suspend your benefits for this reason if—
(1) You are participating in an appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services, as described in § 416.1338(c) and (d);
(2) You began participating in the program before the date your disability or blindness ended; and
(3) We have determined under § 416.1338(e) that your completion of the program, or your continuation in the program for a specified period of time, will increase the likelihood that you
will not have to return to the disability or blindness benefit rolls.

§ 416.1321
Suspension for not giving us permission to contact financial institutions.
(a) If you don't give us permission to contact any financial institution and request any financial records about you when we think it is necessary to determine your SSI eligibility or payment amount, or if you cancel the permission, you cannot be eligible for SSI payments (
see
§ 416.207) and we will stop your payments. Also, if anyone whose income and resources we consider as being available to you (see §§ 416.1160, 416.1202, 416.1203 and 416.1204) doesn't give us permission to contact any financial institution and request any financial records about that person when we think it is necessary to determine your SSI eligibility or payment amount, or that person cancels the permission, you cannot be eligible for SSI payments and we will stop your payments. We will not find you ineligible and/or stop your payments if the person whose income and resources we consider as being available to you fails to give or continue permission and good cause, as discussed in § 416.207(h), exists.
(b) We will suspend your payments starting with the month after the month in which we notify you in writing that:
(1) You failed to give us permission to contact any financial institution and request any financial records about you, or
(2) The person(s) whose income and resources we consider as being available to you failed to give us such permission.
(c) If you are otherwise eligible, we will start your benefits in the month following the month in which:
(1) You give us permission to contact any financial institution and request any financial records about you, or
(2) The person(s) whose income and resources we consider as being available to you gives us such permission.
[68 FR 53509, Sept. 11, 2003]
§ 416.1322
Suspension due to failure to comply with request for information.
(a) Suspension of benefit payments is required effective with the month following the month in which it is determined in accordance with § 416.714(b) that the individual is ineligible for payment due to his or her failure to comply with our request for necessary information. When we have information to establish that benefit payments are again payable, the benefit payments will be reinstated for any previous month for which the individual continued to meet the eligibility requirements of § 416.202. If the reason that an individual's benefits were suspended was failure to comply with our request for information, the payments for the months that benefits are reinstated will not be prorated under § 416.421.
(b) A suspension of payment for failure to comply with our request for information will not apply with respect to any month for which a determination as to eligibility for or amount of payment can be made based on information on record, whether or not furnished by an individual specified in § 416.704(a). Where it is determined that the information of record does not permit a determination with respect to eligibility for or amount of payment, notice of a suspension of payment due to a recipient's failure to comply with a request for information will be sent in accordance with §§ 416.1336 and 416.1404.

§ 416.1323
Suspension due to excess income.
(a)
Effective date.
Suspension of payments due to ineligibility for benefits because of excess income is effective with the first month in which “countable income” (see §§ 416.1100 through 416.1124 of this part) equals or exceeds the amount of benefits otherwise payable for such month (see subpart D of this part). This rule applies regardless
of the month in which the income is received.
(b)
Resumption of payments.
If benefits are otherwise payable, they will be resumed effective with the first month in which a recipient's monthly countable income becomes less than the applicable Federal benefit rate (or the sum of that rate and the level for any federally administered State supplementary payment) for that month. If the reason that a recipient's benefits were suspended was excess income, the payment for the first month that benefits are reinstated will not be prorated under § 416.421.

§ 416.1324
Suspension due to excess resources.
(a)
Effective date.
Except as specified in §§ 416.1240 through 416.1242, suspension of benefit payments because of excess resources is required effective with the month in which:
(1) Ineligibility exists because countable resources are in excess of:
(i) The resource limits prescribed in § 416.1205 for an individual and an individual and spouse, or
(ii) In the case of an eligible individual (and eligible spouse, if any) who for the month of December 1973 was a recipient of aid or assistance under a State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act, the maximum amount of resources specified in such State plan as in effect for October 1972, if greater than the amounts specified in § 416.1205, as applicable; or
(2) After eligibility has been established, payment of benefits was conditioned upon disposal of specified resources, which exceeded the permitted amount and the claimant did not comply with the agreed upon conditions.
(3) The amount of an individual's or couple's countable resources is determined as of the first moment of each calendar quarter.
(b)
Resumption of payments.
If benefits are otherwise payable, they will be resumed effective with the start of the month after the month in which a recipient's countable resources no longer exceed the limit that applies. If the reason that a recipient's benefits were suspended was excess resources, the payment for the first month that benefits are reinstated will not be prorated under § 416.421.

§ 416.1325
Suspension due to status as a resident of a public institution.
(a) Except as provided in § 416.211 (b) and (c), a recipient is ineligible for benefits for the first full calendar month in which he or she is a resident of a public institution (as defined in § 416.201) throughout the calendar month (as defined in § 416.211(a)), and payments are suspended effective with such first full month. Such ineligibility continues for so long as such individual remains a resident of a public institution.
(b)
Resumption of payments.
If benefits are otherwise payable, they will be resumed effective with the earliest day of the month in which a recipient is no longer a resident of a public institution. See § 416.421. A transfer from one public institution to another or a temporary absence from the institution lasting 14 days or less, however, will not change his or her status as a resident, and the suspension will continue.
[51 FR 13494, Apr. 21, 1986]
§ 416.1326
Suspension for failure to comply with treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism.
(a)
Basis for suspension.
If you are disabled and drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability as described in § 416.935, we will refer you to appropriate treatment as defined in § 416.937. You will not be an eligible individual and we will suspend your benefits if you do not comply with the terms, conditions and requirements of treatment prescribed by the institution or facility. (See § 416.940 which explains how we evaluate compliance with treatment.)
(b)
Date of suspension.
We will suspend your benefits for a period starting with the first month after we notify you in writing that you failed to comply with prescribed treatment.
(c)
Resumption of benefits.
If you are complying with prescribed treatment and are otherwise eligible for benefits, we will resume benefits effective with
the first day of the month after you demonstrate and maintain compliance with appropriate treatment for these periods—
(1) 2 consecutive months for the first determination of noncompliance;
(2) 3 consecutive months for the second determination of noncompliance; and
(3) 6 consecutive months for the third and all subsequent determinations of noncompliance.
[60 FR 8152, Feb. 10, 1995]
§ 416.1327
Suspension due to absence from the United States.
(a)
Suspension effective date.
A recipient is not eligible for SSI benefits if he is outside the United States for a full calendar month. For purposes of this paragraph—
(1)
United States
means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands:
(2)
Day
means a full 24-hour day; and
(3) In determining whether a recipient has been outside the United States for a full calendar month, it must be established whether the recipient is outside the United States for 30 consecutive days or more. If yes, he or she will be treated as remaining outside the United States until he or she has returned to and remained in the United States for a period of 30 consecutive days. When a recipient has been outside the United States, the first period of 30 consecutive days of absence is counted beginning with the day after the day the recipient departs from the United States and ending with the day before the day on which he or she returns to the United States. When a recipient has returned to the United States, the second period of 30 consecutive days starts on the day the individual returned and ends on the 30th day of continuous presence in the United States. Benefits will be suspended effective with the first full calendar month in which a recipient is outside the United States.
(b)
Resumption of payments after absence from the United States.
If benefits are otherwise payable they will be resumed—
(1) Effective with the day following the 30th day of continuous presence in the United States after the recipient's return if the absence was for 30 consecutive days or more.
(2) Effective with the day the recipient returned to the United States, if the absence from the United States was for a full calendar month, but for less than 30 consecutive days (this can occur only for the calendar month of February).

# Example 1:
Mike left the United States on March 1 and returned on April 1. Counting March 2 through March 31, he was outside the United States for 30 consecutive days; thus he is also deemed to be outside the United States for 30 additional consecutive days. Therefore, for April 1 through April 30, he is deemed to be outside the United States and not eligible for the calendar month of April. Payments start effective May 1.

# Example 2:
Mary left the United States on April 15 and returned on July 1. Counting April 16 through June 30, she was actually outside the United States and not eligible for the calendar months of May and June. Since she was absent for more than 30 consecutive days, she is deemed to be outside the United States for 30 additional consecutive days. Therefore, for July 1 through July 30, she is deemed to be outside the United States and not eligible for payment until July 31.

§ 416.1329
Suspension due to loss of United States residency, United States citizenship, or status as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law.
(a) A recipient ceases to be an eligible individual or eligible spouse, under section 1614(a)(1)(B) of the Act, when he or she ceases to meet the requirement of § 416.202(b) with respect to United States residency, United States citizenship, or status as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law. Payments are suspended effective with the first month after the last month in which a recipient meets the requirements of § 416.202(b).
(b)
Resumption of payments.
If benefits are otherwise payable, they will be resumed effective with the earliest day of the month on which the recipient again
meets both the residence and citizenship or lawfully admitted alien or color of law requirements. See § 416.421.
[51 FR 13495, Apr. 21, 1986]
§ 416.1330
Suspension due to failure to apply for and obtain other benefits.
(a)
Suspension effective date.
A recipient ceases to be an eligible individual or eligible spouse when, in the absence of a showing of incapacity to do so, or other good cause, he or she fails within 30 days after notice from the Social Security Administration of probable eligibility, to take all appropriate steps to apply for and, if eligible, to obtain payments such as an annuity, pension, retirement, or disability benefit, including veterans' compensation, old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefit, railroad retirement annuity or pension, or unemployment insurance benefit. Benefit payments are suspended due to such ineligibility effective with the month in which the recipient was notified in writing of the requirement that he or she file and take all appropriate steps to receive the other benefits. See § 416.210(e).
(b)
Resumption of payment.
If benefits are otherwise payable, they will be resumed effective with the earliest day of the month on which the recipient takes the necessary steps to obtain the other benefits. See § 416.421.

§ 416.1331
Termination of your disability or blindness payments.
(a)
General.
The last month for which we can pay you benefits based on disability or blindness is the second month after the month in which your disability or blindness ends. (See §§ 416.987(e), 416.994(b)(6) and 416.994a(g) for when disability ends, and § 416.986 for when blindness ends.) See § 416.1338 for an exception to this rule if you are participating in an appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services. You must meet the income, resources, and other eligibility requirements to receive any of the benefits referred to in this paragraph. We will also stop payment of your benefits if you have not cooperated with us in getting information about your disability or blindness.
(b)
After we make a determination that you are not now disabled or blind.
If we determine that you do not meet the disability or blindness requirements of the law, we will send you an advance written notice telling you why we believe you are not disabled or blind and when your benefits should stop. The notice will explain your right to appeal if you disagree with our determination. You may still appeal our determination that you are not now disabled or blind even though your payments are continuing because of your participation in an appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services. You may also appeal a determination that your completion of, or continuation for a specified period of time in, an appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services will not increase the likelihood that you will not have to return to the disability or blindness benefit rolls and, therefore, you are not eligible to continue to receive benefits.
(c)
When benefits terminate due to 12 consecutive suspension months for failure to comply with treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism.
If you are disabled and drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability as described in § 416.935, your benefits will terminate after 12 consecutive months of suspension for noncompliance with treatment requirements as described in § 416.1326.
(d)
When benefits terminate due to payment of 36 months of benefits based on disability when drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.
If you are disabled and drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability as described in § 416.935, your benefits will terminate after you receive a total of 36 months of SSI benefits. The 36-month limit is no longer effective for benefits for months beginning after September 2004.
(e)
Months we count in determining the 36 months of benefits when drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.
Beginning March 1995, we will count all months for which you were paid an SSI benefit, a federally-administered State supplement, a special SSI cash benefit, or you were in special SSI eligibility status, toward the 36 months described in paragraph (d) of this section. Months for which you were not eligible for benefits will not count toward the 36 months.

§ 416.1332
Termination of benefit for disabled individual: Exception.
Special SSI cash benefits (see § 416.261) will be payable for the period beginning January 1, 1981, and ending June 30, 1987 if you meet eligibility requirements in § 416.262. These requirements apply if you, as a disabled recipient, are no longer eligible for regular SSI benefits because you demonstrate that you are able to engage in SGA.
[47 FR 15325, Apr. 9, 1982, as amended at 50 FR 46763, Nov. 13, 1985]
§ 416.1333
Termination at the request of the recipient.
A recipient, his legal guardian, or his representative payee, may terminate his eligibility for benefits under this part by filing a written request for termination which shows an understanding that such termination may extend to other benefits resulting from eligibility under this part. In the case of a representative payee there must also be a showing which establishes that no hardship would result if an eligible recipient were not covered by the supplemental security income program. When such a request is filed, the recipient ceases to be an eligible individual, or eligible spouse, effective with the month following the month the request is filed with the Social Security Administration unless the recipient specifies some other month. However, the Social Security Administration will not effectuate the request for any month for which payment has been or will be made unless there is repayment, or assurance of repayment, of any amounts paid for those months (e.g., from special payments which would be payable for such months under section 228 of the Act). When the Social Security Administration effectuates a termination of eligibility at the request of the recipient, his legal guardian, or his representative payee, notice of the determination will be sent in accordance with § 416.1404, and eligibility, once terminated, can be reestablished, except as provided by § 416.1408, only upon the filing of a new application.
[42 FR 39100, Aug. 2, 1977]
§ 416.1334
Termination due to death of recipient.
Eligibility for benefits ends with the month in which the recipient dies. Payments are terminated effective with the month after the month of death.
§ 416.1335
Termination due to continuous suspension.
We will terminate your eligibility for benefits following 12 consecutive months of benefit suspension for any reason beginning with the first month you were no longer eligible for regular SSI cash benefits, federally-administered State supplementation, special SSI cash benefits described in § 416.262, or special SSI eligibility status described in § 416.265. We will count the 12-month suspension period from the start of the first month that you are no longer eligible for SSI benefits (see § 416.1320(a)) or the start of the month after the month your special SSI eligibility status described in § 416.265 ended. This termination is effective with the start of the 13th month after the suspension began.
[60 FR 8153, Feb. 10, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 31975, June 15, 1999]
§ 416.1336
Notice of intended action affecting recipient's payment status.
(a)
Advance written notice requirement.
Advance written notice of intent to discontinue payment because of an event requiring suspension, reduction (see subpart D of this part), or termination of payments shall be given in all cases, prior to effectuation of the action, except where the Social Security Administration has factual information confirming the death of the recipient, e.g., as enumerated in § 404.704(b)
of this chapter, or a report by a surviving spouse, a legal guardian, a parent or other close relative, or a landlord.
(b)
Continuation of payment pending an appeal.
The written notice of intent to suspend, reduce, or terminate payments shall allow 60 days after the date of receipt of the notice for the recipient to request the appropriate appellate review (see subpart N of this part). If appeal is filed within 10 days after the individual's receipt of the notice, the payment shall be continued or reinstated at the previously established payment level (subject to the effects of intervening events on the payment which are not appealed within 10 days of receipt of a required advance notice or which do not require advance notice, e.g., an increase in the benefit amount) until a decision on such initial appeal is issued, unless the individual specifically waives in writing his right to continuation of payment at the previously established level in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. (See § 416.1337 for exceptions to the continuation of payment level.) Where the request for the appropriate appellate review is filed more than 10 days after the notice is received but within the 60-day period specified in § 416.1413 or § 416.1425 of this part, there shall be no right to continuation or reinstatement of payment at the previously established level unless good cause is established under the criteria specified in § 416.1411 of this part for failure to appeal within 10 days after receipt of the notice. For purposes of this paragraph, the date of receipt of the notice of intent to suspend, reduce, or terminate payments shall be presumed to be 5 days after the date on the face of such notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
(c)
Waiver of right to continued payment.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the recipient, in order to avoid the possibility of an overpayment of benefits, may waive continuation of payment at the previously established level (subject to intervening events which would have increased the benefit for the month in which the incorrect payment was made, in which case the higher amount shall be paid), after having received a full explanation of his rights. The request for waiver of continuation of payment shall be in writing, state that waiver action is being initiated solely at the recipient's request, and state that the recipient understands his right to receive continued payment at the previously established level.
[43 FR 18170, Apr. 28, 1978, as amended at 65 FR 16815, Mar. 30, 2000]
§ 416.1337
Exceptions to the continuation of previously established payment level.
(a)
Multiple payments exception.
(1) Where it is determined that a recipient is receiving two or more regular monthly payments in one month, the Social Security Administration shall determine the correct payment amount and, as soon as practicable thereafter, send the recipient an advance written notice of intent to make subsequent payment in that amount. Payment for the following month shall be made in the correct amount, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(2) The advance notice shall explain:
(i) That multiple payments were made in the one or more months identified in the notice;
(ii) The correct amount of monthly benefits that the recipient is eligible to receive; and
(iii) The recipient's appeal rights.
(3) If an appeal is filed within 10 days after receipt of the written notice of intent, the highest of the two or more check amounts, or the correct amount if higher (subject to the dollar limitation provisions), shall be continued until a decision on such initial level of appeal is issued. See § 416.1474 for criteria as to good cause for failure to file a timely appeal. For purposes of this paragraph, the date of receipt of the notice of intent shall be presumed to be 5 days after the date on the face of such notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
(4) The fact that a recipient is receiving multiple payments is established if the records of the Social Security Administration show that:
(i) Two or more checks are being sent to an individual under the same name or a common logical spelling variation of the name;
(ii) The social security number is the same or a pseudo number appears;
(iii) The checks are being sent to the same address;
(iv) The sex code for such individual is the same; and
(v) The date of birth for such individual is the same.
(b)
Dollar limitation exception.
(1) Where it is determined that a recipient is receiving an erroneous monthly payment which exceeds the dollar limitation applicable to the recipient's payment category, as set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the Social Security Administration shall determine the correct payment amount and, as soon as practicable thereafter, send the recipient an advance written notice of intent to make subsequent payment in that amount. Payment for the following month shall be made in the correct amount, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(2) The advance notice shall explain:
(i) That an erroneous monthly payment which exceeds the dollar limitation applicable to the recipient's payment category was made in the one or more months identified in the notice;
(ii) The correct amount of monthly benefits that the recipient is eligible to receive; and
(iii) The recipient's appeal rights.
(3) If an appeal is filed within 10 days after receipt of the written notice of the intent (see § 416.1474 for criteria as to good cause for failure to file a timely appeal), the amount of payment to be continued, pending decision on appeal, shall be determined as follows:
(i)
Recipient in payment status.
Where the recipient is in payment status, the payment shall be in the amount the recipient received in the month immediately preceding the month the dollar limitation was first exceeded (subject to intervening events which would have increased the benefit for the month in which the incorrect payment was made, in which case the higher amount shall be paid).
(ii)
Recipient in nonpayment status.
If the recipient's benefits were suspended in the month immediately preceding the month the dollar limitation was first exceeded, the payment shall be based on that amount which should have been paid in the month in which the incorrect payment was made. However, if the individual's benefits had been correctly suspended as provided in §§ 416.1320 through 416.1330 or § 416.1339 and they should have remained suspended but a benefit that exceeded the dollar limitation was paid, no further payment shall be made to him or her at this time and notice of the planned action shall not contain any provision regarding continuation of payment pending appeal.
For purposes of this paragraph, the date of receipt of the notice of planned action shall be presumed to be 5 days after the date on the face of such notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
(4) The payment categories and dollar limitations are as follows:

# Payment Category and Dollar Limitation
(i)
Federal supplemental security income benefit only
—$200.
Recipients whose records indicate eligibility for Federal supplemental security income benefits for the month before the month the dollar limitation was first exceeded.
(ii)
Federal supplemental security income benefit and optional supplementation, or optional supplementation only
—$700
Recipients whose records indicate they were eligible for Federal supplemental security income benefits plus federally-administered optional supplementation, or eligible for federally-administered optional supplementation only, for the month before the month the dollar limitation was first exceeded.
(iii)
Federal supplemental security income benefit and mandatory or other supplementation, or mandatory supplementation only
—$2,000
Recipients whose records show eligibility for Federal supplemental security income benefits and federally-administered mandatory supplementation or essential person increment for the month before the month the dollar limitation was first exceeded. This category also includes those eligible for federally-administered mandatory supplementation only and those eligible for Federal supplemental security income benefits plus an essential person increment and federally-administered optional supplementation.
[43 FR 18170, Apr. 28, 1978, as amended at 65 FR 40495, June 30, 2000]
§ 416.1338
If you are participating in an appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services.
(a)
When may your benefits based on disability or blindness be continued?
Your benefits based on disability or blindness may be continued after your impairment is no longer disabling, you are no longer blind as determined under § 416.986(a)(1), (a)(2) or (b), or your disability has ended as determined under § 416.987(b) and (e)(1) in an age-18 redetermination, if—
(1) You are participating in an appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services, as described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section;
(2) You began participating in the program before the date your disability or blindness ended; and
(3) We have determined under paragraph (e) of this section that your completion of the program, or your continuation in the program for a specified period of time, will increase the likelihood that you will not have to return to the disability or blindness benefit rolls.
(b)
When will we stop your benefits?
We generally will stop your benefits with the earliest of these months—
(1) The month in which you complete the program; or
(2) The month in which you stop participating in the program for any reason (see paragraph (d) of this section for what we mean by “participating” in the program); or
(3) The month in which we determine under paragraph (e) of this section that your continuing participation in the program will no longer increase the likelihood that you will not have to return to the disability or blindness benefit rolls.
Exception to paragraph (b):
In no case will we stop your benefits with a month earlier than the second month after the month your disability or blindness ends, provided that you are otherwise eligible for benefits through such month.
(c)
What is an appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services?
An appropriate program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services means—
(1) A program that is carried out under an individual work plan with an employment network under the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program under part 411 of this chapter;
(2) A program that is carried out under an individualized plan for employment with—
(i) A State vocational rehabilitation agency (
i.e.,
a State agency administering or supervising the administration of a State plan approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 720-751)) under 34 CFR part 361; or
(ii) An organization administering a Vocational Rehabilitation Services Project for American Indians with Disabilities authorized under section 121 of part C of title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 741);
(3) A program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services that is carried out under a similar, individualized written employment plan with—
(i) An agency of the Federal government (for example, the Department of Veterans Affairs);
(ii) A one-stop delivery system or specialized one-stop center described in section 134(c) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2864(c)); or
(iii) Another provider of services approved by us; providers we may approve include, but are not limited to—
(A) A public or private organizations with expertise in the delivery or coordination of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services; or
(B) A public, private or parochial school that provides or coordinates a program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services carried out under an individualized program or plan;
(4) An individualized education program developed under policies and procedures approved by the Secretary of Education for assistance to States for the education of individuals with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1400
et seq.
); you must be age
18 through age 21 for this provision to apply.
(d) When are you participating in the program? (1) You are participating in a program described in paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section when you are taking part in the activities and services outlined in your individual work plan, your individualized plan for employment, or your similar individualized written employment plan, as appropriate.
(2) If you are a student age 18 through 21 receiving services under an individualized education program described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, you are participating in your program when you are taking part in the activities and services outlined in your program or plan.
(3) You are participating in your program under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section during temporary interruptions in your program. For an interruption to be considered temporary, you must resume taking part in the activities and services outlined in your plan or program, as appropriate, no more than three months after the month the interruption occurred.
(e)
How will we determine whether or not your completion of the program, or your continuation in the program for a specified period of time, will increase the likelihood that you will not have to return to the disability or blindness benefit rolls?
(1) We will determine that your completion of the program, or your continuation in the program for a specified period of time, will increase the likelihood that you will not have to return to the disability or blindness benefit rolls if your completion of or your continuation in the program will provide you with—
(i) Work experience (see § 416.965) so that you would more likely be able to do past relevant work (see § 416.960(b)), despite a possible future reduction in your residual functional capacity (see § 416.945); or
(ii) Education (see § 416.964) and/or skilled or semi-skilled work experience (see § 416.968) so that you would more likely be able to adjust to other work that exists in the national economy (see § 416.960(c)), despite a possible future reduction in your residual functional capacity (see § 416.945).
(2) If you are a student age 18 through age 21 participating in an individualized education program described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, we will find that your completion of or continuation in the program will increase the likelihood that you will not have to return to the disability or blindness benefit rolls.
(3) If you are receiving transition services after having completed an individualized education program as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, we will determine that the transition services will increase the likelihood that you will not have to return to the disability benefit rolls if they meet the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
[70 FR 36508, June 24, 2005]
§ 416.1339
Suspension due to flight to avoid criminal prosecution or custody or confinement after conviction, or due to violation of probation or parole.
(a)
Basis for suspension.
An individual is ineligible for SSI benefits for any month during which he or she is—
(1) Fleeing to avoid prosecution for a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime, which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees (or which, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor under the laws of that State); or
(2) Fleeing to avoid custody or confinement after conviction for a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime, which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees (or which, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor under the laws of that State); or
(3) Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.
(b)
Suspension effective date.
(1) Suspension of benefit payments because an individual is a fugitive as described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section or a probation or parole violator as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is effective with the first day of whichever of the following months is earlier—
(i) The month in which a warrant or order for the individual's arrest or apprehension, an order requiring the individual's appearance before a court or other appropriate tribunal (e.g., a parole board), or similar order is issued by a court or other duly authorized tribunal on the basis of an appropriate finding that the individual—
(A) Is fleeing, or has fled, to avoid prosecution as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
(B) Is fleeing, or has fled, to avoid custody or confinement after conviction as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
(C) Is violating, or has violated, a condition of his or her probation or parole as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or

(2) An individual will not be considered to be ineligible for SSI benefits and benefit payments will not be suspended under this section for any month prior to August 1996.
(c)
Resumption of payments.
If benefits are otherwise payable, they will be resumed effective with the first month throughout which the individual is determined to be no longer fleeing to avoid such prosecution, fleeing to avoid such custody or confinement after conviction, or violating a condition of his or her probation or parole.
[65 FR 40495, June 30, 2000]
§ 416.1340
Penalty for making false or misleading statements or withholding information.
(a)
Why would SSA penalize me?
You will be subject to a penalty if:
(1) You make, or cause to be made, a statement or representation of a material fact, for use in determining any initial or continuing right to, or the amount of, monthly insurance benefits under title II or benefits or payments under title XVI, that you know or should know is false or misleading; or
(2) You make a statement or representation of a material fact for use as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section with knowing disregard for the truth; or
(3) You omit from a statement or representation made for use as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or otherwise withhold disclosure (for example, fail to come forward to notify us) of, a fact which you know or should know is material to the determination of any initial or continuing right to, or the amount of, monthly insurance benefits under title II or benefits or payments under title XVI, if you know, or should know, that the statement or representation with such omission is false or misleading or that the withholding of such disclosure is misleading.
(b)
What is the penalty?
The penalty is ineligibility for cash benefits under title XVI (including State supplementary payments made by SSA according to § 416.2005) and nonpayment of any benefits under title II that we would otherwise pay you.
(c)
How long will the penalty last?
The penalty will last—
(1) Six consecutive months the first time we penalize you;
(2) Twelve consecutive months the second time we penalize you; and
(3) Twenty-four consecutive months the third or subsequent time we penalize you.
(d)
Will this penalty affect any of my other government benefits?
If we penalize you, the penalty will apply only to your eligibility for benefits under titles II and XVI (including State supplementary payments made by us according to § 416.2005). The penalty will not affect—
(1) Your eligibility for benefits that you would otherwise be eligible for under titles XVIII and XIX but for the imposition of the penalty; and
(2) The eligibility or amount of benefits payable under titles II or XVI to another person. For example, if you and your spouse are receiving title XVI benefits, those benefit payments to your spouse based on the benefit rate for a couple will not be affected because of the penalty. Your spouse will receive one half of the couple rate.
(e)
How will SSA make its decision to penalize me?
In order to impose a penalty on you, we must find that you
knowingly (knew or should have known or acted with knowing disregard for the truth) made a false or misleading statement or omitted or failed to report a material fact if you knew, or should have known, that the omission or failure to disclose was misleading. We will base our decision to penalize you on the evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from that evidence, not on speculation or suspicion. Our decision to penalize you will be documented with the basis and rationale for that decision. In determining whether you knowingly made a false or misleading statement or omitted or failed to report a material fact so as to justify imposition of the penalty, we will consider all evidence in the record, including any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) which you may have had at the time. In determining whether you acted knowingly, we will also consider the significance of the false or misleading statement or omission or failure to disclose in terms of its likely impact on your benefits.
(f)
What should I do if I disagree with SSA's initial determination to penalize me?
If you disagree with our initial determination to impose a penalty, you have the right to request reconsideration of the penalty decision as explained in § 416.1407. We will give you a chance to present your case, including the opportunity for a face-to-face conference. If you request reconsideration of our initial determination to penalize you, you have the choice of a case review, informal conference, or formal conference, as described in § 416.1413(a) through (c). If you disagree with our reconsidered determination you have the right to follow the normal administrative and judicial review process by requesting a hearing before an administrative law judge, Appeals Council review and Federal court, review as explained in § 416.1400.
(g)
When will the penalty period begin and end?
Subject to the additional limitations noted in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, the penalty period will begin the first day of the month for which you would otherwise receive payment of benefits under title II or title XVI were it not for imposition of the penalty. Once a sanction begins, it will run continuously even if payments are intermittent. If more than one penalty has been imposed, but they have not yet run, the penalties will not run concurrently.
(1) If you do not request reconsideration of our initial determination to penalize you, the penalty period will begin no earlier than the first day of the second month following the month in which the time limit for requesting reconsideration ends. The penalty period will end on the last day of the final month of the penalty period. For example, if the time period for requesting reconsideration ends on January 10, a 6-month period of nonpayment begins on March 1 if you would otherwise be eligible to receive benefits for that month, and ends on August 31.
(2) If you request reconsideration of our initial determination to penalize you and the reconsidered determination does not change our original decision to penalize you, the penalty period will begin no earlier than the first day of the second month following the month we notify you of our reconsidered determination. The penalty period will end on the last day of the final month of the penalty period. For example, if we notify you of our reconsidered determination on August 31, 2001, and you are not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits at that time, but would again be eligible to receive payment of benefits on October 1, 2003, a 6-month period of nonpayment would begin on October 1, 2003 and end on March 31, 2004.

# Introduction, Definitions, and Initial Determinations
§ 416.1400
Introduction.
(a)
Explanation of the administrative review process.
This subpart explains the procedures we follow in determining your rights under title XVI of the Social Security Act. The regulations describe the process of administrative review and explain your right to judicial review after you have taken all the necessary administrative steps. The administrative review process consists of several steps, which usually must be requested within certain time periods and in the following order:
(1)
Initial determination.
This is a determination we make about your eligibility or your continuing eligibility for benefits or about any other matter, as discussed in § 416.1402, that gives you a right to further review.
(2)
Reconsideration.
If you are dissatisfied with an initial determination, you may ask us to reconsider it.
(3)
Hearing before an administrative law judge.
If you are dissatisfied with the reconsideration determination, you may request a hearing before an administrative law judge.
(4)
Appeals Council review.
If you are dissatisfied with the decision of the administrative law judge, you may request that the Appeals Council review the decision.
(5)
Federal court review.
When you have completed the steps of the administrative review process listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, we will have made our final decision. If you are dissatisfied with our final decision, you may request judicial review by filing an action in a Federal district court.
(6)
Expedited appeals process.
At some time after your initial determination has been reviewed, if you have no dispute with our findings of fact and our application and interpretation of the controlling laws, but you believe that a part of the law is unconstitutional, you may use the expedited appeals process. This process permits you to go directly to a Federal district court so that the constitutional issue may be resolved.
(b)
Nature of the administrative review process.
In making a determination or decision in your case, we conduct the administrative review process in an informal, non-adversarial manner. Subject to certain timeframes at the hearing level (see § 416.1435) and the limitations on Appeals Council consideration of additional evidence (see § 416.1470), we will consider at each step of the review process any information you present as well as all the information in our records. You may present the information yourself or have someone represent you, including an attorney. If you are dissatisfied with our decision in the review process, but do not take the next step within the stated time period, you will lose your right to further administrative review and your right to judicial review, unless you can show us that there was good cause for your failure to make a timely request for review.

(k) Whether or not you have a disabling impairment as defined in § 416.911;
(l) How much and to whom benefits due a deceased individual will be paid;
(m) A claim for benefits under § 416.351 based on alleged misinformation;

§ 416.1404
Notice of the initial determination.
(a) We will mail a written notice of our initial determination to you at
your last known address. The written notice will explain in simple and clear language what we have determined and the reasons for and the effect of our determination. If our determination involves a determination of disability that is in whole or in part unfavorable to you, our written notice also will contain in understandable language a statement of the case setting forth the evidence on which our determination is based. The notice also will inform you of your right to reconsideration. We will not mail a notice if the beneficiary's entitlement to benefits has ended because of his or her death.
(b) If our initial determination is that we must suspend, reduce or terminate your benefits, the notice will also tell you that you have a right to a reconsideration before the determination takes effect (see § 416.1336).

[51 FR 305, Jan. 3, 1986]
§ 416.1406
Testing modifications to the disability determination procedures.
(a)
Applicability and scope.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this part or part 422 of this chapter, we are establishing the procedures set out in this section to test modifications to our disability determination process. These modifications will enable us to test, either individually or in one or more combinations, the effect of: having disability claim managers assume primary responsibility for processing an application for SSI payments based on disability; providing persons who have applied for benefits based on disability with the opportunity for an interview with a decisionmaker when the decisionmaker finds that the evidence in the file is insufficient to make a fully favorable determination or requires an initial determination denying the claim; having a single decisionmaker make the initial determination with assistance from medical consultants, where appropriate; and eliminating the reconsideration step in the administrative review process and having a claimant who is dissatisfied with the initial determination request a hearing before an administrative law judge. The model procedures we test will be designed to provide us with information regarding the effect of these procedural modifications and enable us to decide whether and to what degree the disability determination process would be improved if they were implemented on a national level.
(b)
Procedures for cases included in the tests.
Prior to commencing each test or group of tests in selected site(s), we will publish a notice in the
Federal Register.
The notice will describe which model or combinations of models we intend to test, where the specific test site(s) will be, and the duration of the test(s). The individuals who participate in the test(s) will be randomly assigned to a test group in each site where the tests are conducted. Paragraph (b) (1) through (4) of this section lists descriptions of each model.
(1) In the disability claim manager model, when you file an application for SSI payments based on disability, a disability claim manager will assume primary responsibility for the processing of your claim. The disability claim manager will be the focal point for your contacts with us during the claims intake process and until an initial determination on your claim is made. The disability claim manager will explain the SSI disability program to you, including the definition of disability and how we determine whether you meet all the requirements for SSI payments based on disability. The disability claim manager will explain what you will be asked to do throughout the claims process and how you can obtain information or assistance through him or her. The disability claim manager will also provide you with information regarding your right to representation, and he or she will provide you with appropriate referral sources for representation. The disability claim manager may be either a State agency employee or a Federal employee. In some instances, the disability claim manager may be assisted by other individuals.
(2) In the single decisionmaker model, the decisionmaker will make the disability determination and may also determine whether the other conditions of eligibility for SSI payments based on disability are met. The decisionmaker will make the disability determination after any appropriate consultation with a medical or psychological consultant. The medical or psychological consultant will not be required to sign the disability determination forms we use to have the State agency certify the determination of disability to us (see § 416.1015). However, before an initial determination is made in any case where there is evidence which indicates the existence of a mental impairment, the decisionmaker will make every reasonable effort to ensure that a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist has completed the medical portion of the case review and any applicable residual functional capacity assessment pursuant to our existing procedures (see § 416.1017). Similarly, in making an initial determination with respect to the disability of a child under age 18 claiming SSI payments based on disability, the decisionmaker will make reasonable efforts to ensure that a qualified pediatrician, or other individual who specializes in a field of medicine appropriate to the child's impairment(s), evaluates the claim of such child (see § 416.903(f)). In some instances the decisionmaker may be the disability claim manager described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. When the decisionmaker is a State agency employee, a team of individuals that includes a Federal employee will determine whether the other conditions of eligibility for SSI payments are met.
(3) In the predecision interview model, if the decisionmaker(s) finds that the evidence in your file is insufficient to make a fully favorable determination or requires an initial determination denying your claim, a predecision notice will be mailed to you. The notice will tell you that, before the decisionmaker(s) makes an initial determination about whether you are disabled, you may request a predecision interview with the decisionmaker(s). The notice will also tell you that you may also submit additional evidence. You must request a predecision interview within 10 days after the date you receive the predecision notice. You must also submit any additional evidence within 10 days after the date you receive the predecision notice. If you request a predecision interview, the decisionmaker(s) will conduct the predecision interview in person, by videoconference, or by telephone as the decisionmaker(s) determines is appropriate under the circumstances. If you make a late request for a predecision interview, or submit additional evidence late, but show in writing that you had good cause under the standards in § 416.1411 for missing the deadline, the decisionmaker(s) will extend the deadline. If you do not request the predecision interview or if you do not appear for a scheduled predecision interview and do not submit additional evidence, or if you do not respond to our attempts to communicate with you, the decisionmaker(s) will make an initial determination based upon the evidence in your file. If you identify additional evidence during the predecision interview, which was previously not available, the decisionmaker(s) will advise you to submit the evidence. If you are unable to do so, the decisionmaker(s) may assist you in obtaining it. The decisionmaker(s) also will advise you of the specific timeframes you have for submitting any additional evidence identified during the predecision interview. If you have no treating source(s) (see § 416.902), or your treating source(s) is unable or unwilling to provide the necessary evidence, or there is a conflict in the evidence that cannot be resolved through evidence from your treating source(s), the decisionmaker(s) may arrange a consultative examination or resolve conflicts according to existing procedures (see § 416.919a). If you attend the predecision interview, or do not attend the predecision interview but you submit additional evidence, the decisionmaker(s) will make an initial determination based on the evidence in your file, including the additional evidence you submit or the evidence obtained as a result of the predecision notice or interview, or both.
(4) In the reconsideration elimination model, we will modify the disability determination process by eliminating the reconsideration step of the administrative review process. If you receive an initial determination on your claim for SSI payments based on disability, and you are dissatisfied with the determination, we will notify you that you may request a hearing before an administrative law judge.

# Reconsideration
§ 416.1407
Reconsideration—general.
Reconsideration is the first step in the administrative review process that we provide if you are dissatisfied with the initial determination. If you are dissatisfied with our reconsideration determination, you may request a hearing before an administrative law judge.
[51 FR 305, Jan. 3, 1986]
§ 416.1408
Parties to a reconsideration.
(a)
Who may request a reconsideration.
If you are dissatisfied with the initial determination, you may request that we reconsider it. In addition, a person who shows in writing that his or her rights may be adversely affected by the initial determination may request a reconsideration.
(b)
Who are parties to a reconsideration.
After a request for the reconsideration, you and any person who shows in writing that his or her rights are adversely affected by the initial determination will be parties to the reconsideration.
§ 416.1409
How to request reconsideration.
(a) We shall reconsider an initial determination if you or any other party to the reconsideration files a written request at one of our offices within 60 days after the date you receive notice of the initial determination (or within the extended time period if we extend the time as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).
(b)
Extension of time to request a reconsideration.
If you want a reconsideration of the initial determination but do not request one in time, you may ask us for more time to request a reconsideration. Your request for an extension of time must be in writing and it must give the reasons why the request for reconsideration was not filed within the stated time period. If you show us that you had good cause for missing the deadline, we will extend the time period. To determine whether good cause exists, we use the standards explained in § 416.1411.
§ 416.1411
Good cause for missing the deadline to request review.
(a) In determining whether you have shown that you have good cause for missing a deadline to request review we consider—
(1) What circumstances kept you from making the request on time;
(2) Whether our action misled you;
(3) Whether you did not understand the requirements of the Act resulting from amendments to the Act, other legislation, or court decisions; and
(4) Whether you had any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) which prevented you from filing a timely request or from understanding or knowing about the need to file a timely request for review.
(b) Examples of circumstances where good cause may exist include, but are not limited to, the following situations:
(1) You were seriously ill and were prevented from contacting us in person, in writing, or through a friend, relative, or other person.
(2) There was a death or serious illness in your immediate family.
(3) Important records were destroyed or damaged by fire or other accidental cause.
(4) You were trying very hard to find necessary information to support your claim but did not find the information within the stated time periods.
(5) You asked us for additional information explaining our action within the time limit, and within 60 days of receiving the explanation you requested reconsideration or a hearing, or within 30 days of receiving the explanation you requested Appeals Council review or filed a civil suit.
(6) We gave you incorrect or incomplete information about when and how to request administrative review or to file a civil suit.
(7) You did not receive notice of the initial determination or decision.
(8) You sent the request to another Government agency in good faith within the time limit and the request did not reach us until after the time period had expired.
(9) Unusual or unavoidable circumstances exist, including the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, which show that you could not have known of the need to file timely, or which prevented you from filing timely.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 59 FR 1637, Jan. 12, 1994]
§ 416.1413
Reconsideration procedures.
If you request reconsideration, we will give you a chance to present your case. How you can present your case depends upon the issue involved and whether you are asking us to reconsider an initial determination on an application or an initial determination on a suspension, reduction or termination of benefits. The methods of reconsideration include the following:
(a)
Case review.
We will give you and the other parties to the reconsideration an opportunity to review the evidence in our files and then to present oral and written evidence to us. We will then make a decision based on all of this evidence. The official who reviews the case will make the reconsidered determination.
(b)
Informal conference.
In addition to following the procedures of a case review, an informal conference allows you and the other parties to the reconsideration an opportunity to present witnesses. A summary record of this proceeding will become part of the case record. The official who conducts the informal conference will make the reconsidered determination.
(c)
Formal conference.
In addition to following the procedures of an informal conference, a formal conference allows you and the other parties to a reconsideration an opportunity to request us to subpoena adverse witnesses and relevant documents and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. A summary record of this proceeding will become a part of the case record. The official who conducts the formal conference will make the reconsidered determination.
(d)
Disability hearing.
If you have been receiving supplemental security income benefits because you are blind or disabled and you request reconsideration of an initial or revised determination that, based on medical factors, you are not now blind or disabled, we will give you and the other parties to the reconsideration an opportunity for a disability hearing. (See §§ 416.1414 through 416.1418.)
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 305, Jan. 3, 1986]
§ 416.1413a
Reconsiderations of initial determinations on applications.
The method of reconsideration we will use when you appeal an initial determination on your application for benefits depends on the issue involved in your case.
(a)
Nonmedical issues.
If you challenge our finding on a nonmedical issue, we shall offer you a case review or an informal conference, and will reach our reconsidered determination on the basis of the review you select.
(b)
Medical issues.
If you challenge our finding on a medical issue (even if you received payments because we presumed you were blind or disabled), we shall reach our reconsidered determination on the basis of a case review.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980. Redesignated at 51 FR 305, Jan. 3, 1986]
§ 416.1413b
Reconsideration procedures for post-eligibility claims.
If you are eligible for supplemental security income benefits and we notify you that we are going to suspend, reduce or terminate your benefits, you can appeal our determination within 60 days of the date you receive our notice. The 60-day period may be extended if you have good cause for an extension of time under the conditions stated in § 416.1411(b). If you appeal a suspension, reduction, or termination of benefits, the method of reconsideration we will use depends on the issue in your case. If the issue in your case is that you are no longer blind or disabled for medical
reasons, you will receive an opportunity for a disability hearing. If any other issue is involved, you have the choice of a case review, informal conference or formal conference.
[51 FR 305, Jan. 3, 1986]
§ 416.1413c
Arrangement for conferences.
(a) As soon as we receive a request for a formal or informal conference, we shall set the time, date and place for the conference.
(b) We shall send you and any other parties to the reconsideration a written notice about the conference (either by mailing it to your last known address or by personally serving you with it) at least 10 days before the conference. However, we may hold the conference sooner if we all agree. We will not send written notice of the time, date, and place of the conference if you waive your right to receive it.
(c) We shall schedule the conference within 15 days after you request it, but, at our discretion or at your request, we will delay the conference if we think the delay will ensure that the conference is conducted efficiently and properly.
(d) We shall hold the conference at one of our offices, by telephone or in person, whichever you prefer. We will hold the conference elsewhere in person if you show circumstances that make this arrangement reasonably necessary.

§ 416.1414
Disability hearing—general.
(a)
Availability.
We will provide you with an opportunity for a disability hearing if:
(1) You have been receiving supplemental security income benefits based on a medical impairment that renders you blind or disabled;
(2) We have made an initial or revised determination based on medical factors that you are not blind or disabled because your impairment:
(i) Has ceased;
(ii) Did not exist; or
(iii) Is no longer disabling; and
(3) You make a timely request for reconsideration of the initial or revised determination.
(b)
Scope.
The disability hearing will address only the initial or revised determination, based on medical factors, that you are not now blind or disabled. Any other issues you raise in connection with your request for reconsideration will be reviewed in accordance with the reconsideration procedures described in § 416.1413 (a) through (c).
(c)
Time and place
—(1)
General.
Either the State agency or the Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her delegate, as appropriate, will set the time and place of your disability hearing. We will send you a notice of the time and place of your disability hearing at least 20 days before the date of the hearing. You may be expected to travel to your disability hearing. (See §§ 416.1495-416.1499 regarding reimbursement for travel expenses.)
(2)
Change of time or place.
If you are unable to travel or have some other reason why you cannot attend your disability hearing at the scheduled time or place, you should request at the earliest possible date that the time or place of your hearing be changed. We will change the time or place if there is good cause for doing so under the standards in § 416.1436 (c) and (d).
(d)
Combined issues.
If a disability hearing is available to you under paragraph (a) of this section, and you file a new application for benefits while your request for reconsideration is still pending, we may combine the issues on both claims for the purpose of the disability hearing and issue a combined initial/reconsidered determination which is binding with respect to the common issues on both claims.
(e)
Definition.
For purposes of the provisions regarding disability hearings (§§ 416.1414 through 416.1418)

§ 416.1415
Disability hearing—disability hearing officers.
(a)
General.
Your disability hearing will be conducted by a disability hearing officer who was not involved in

If the disability hearing officer is appointed by a State agency, that individual will be employed by an adjudicatory unit of the State agency other than the adjudicatory unit which made the determination you are appealing.
(2)
State agency defined.
For purposes of this subpart,
State agency
means the adjudicatory component in the State which issues disability determinations.
(c)

The disability hearing will enable you to introduce evidence and present your views to a disability hearing officer if you are dissatisfied with an initial or revised determination, based on medical factors, that you are not now blind or disabled, as described in § 416.1414(a)(2).
(b)
Your procedural rights.
We will advise you that you have the following procedural rights in connection with the disability hearing process:
(1) You may request that we assist you in obtaining pertinent evidence for your disability hearing and, if necessary, that we issue a subpoena to compel the production of certain evidence or testimony. We will follow subpoena procedures similar to those described in § 416.1450(d) for the administrative law judge hearing process;
(2) You may have a representative at the hearing appointed under subpart O of this part, or you may represent yourself;
(3) You or your representative may review the evidence in your case file, either on the date of your hearing or at an earlier time at your request, and present additional evidence;
(4) You may present witnesses and question any witnesses at the hearing; and
(5) You may waive your right to appear at the hearing. If you do not appear at the hearing, the disability hearing officer will prepare and issue a written reconsidered determination based on the information in your case file.
(c)
Case preparation.
After you request reconsideration, your case file will be reviewed and prepared for the hearing. This review will be conducted in the component of our office (including a State agency) that made the initial or revised determination, by personnel who were not involved in making the initial or revised determination. Any new evidence you submit in connection with your request for reconsideration will be included in this review. If necessary, further development of evidence, including arrangements for medical examinations, will be undertaken by this component. After the case file is prepared for the hearing, it will be forwarded by this component to the disability hearing officer for a hearing. If necessary, the case file may be sent back to this component at any time prior to the issuance of the reconsidered determination for additional development. Under paragraph (d) of this section, this component has the authority to issue a favorable reconsidered determination at any time in its development process.
(d)
Favorable reconsidered determination without a hearing.
If the evidence in your case file supports a finding that you are now blind or disabled, either the component that prepares your case
for hearing under paragraph (c) or the disability hearing officer will issue a written favorable reconsidered determination, even if a disability hearing has not yet been held.
(e)
Opportunity to submit additional evidence after the hearing.
At your request, the disability hearing officer may allow up to 15 days after your disability hearing for receipt of evidence which is not available at the hearing, if:
(1) The disability hearing officer determines that the evidence has a direct bearing on the outcome of the hearing; and
(2) The evidence could not have been obtained before the hearing.
(f)
Opportunity to review and comment on evidence obtained or developed by us after the hearing.
If, for any reason, additional evidence is obtained or developed by us after your disability hearing, and all evidence taken together can be used to support a reconsidered determination that is unfavorable to you with regard to the medical factors of eligibility, we will notify you, in writing, and give you an opportunity to review and comment on the additional evidence. You will be given 10 days from the date you receive our notice to submit your comments (in writing or, in appropriate cases, by telephone), unless there is good cause for granting you additional time, as illustrated by the examples in § 416.1411(b). Your comments will be considered before a reconsidered determination is issued. If you believe that it is necessary to have further opportunity for a hearing with respect to the additional evidence, a supplementary hearing may be scheduled at your request. Otherwise, we will ask for your written comments on the additional evidence, or, in appropriate cases, for your telephone comments.
[51 FR 306, Jan. 3, 1986]
§ 416.1417
Disability hearing—disability hearing officer's reconsidered determination.
(a)
General.
The disability hearing officer who conducts your disability hearing will prepare and will issue a written reconsidered determination, unless:
(1) The disability hearing officer sends the case back for additional development by the component that prepared the case for the hearing, and that component issues a favorable determination, as permitted by § 416.1416(c);
(2) It is determined that you are engaging in substantial gainful activity and that you are therefore not disabled; or
(3) The reconsidered determination prepared by the disability hearing officer is reviewed under § 416.1418.
(b)
Content.
The disability hearing officer's reconsidered determination will give the findings of fact and the reasons for the reconsidered determination. The disability hearing officer must base the reconsidered determination on the preponderance of the evidence offered at the disability hearing or otherwise included in your case file.
(c)
Notice.
We will mail you and the other parties a notice of reconsidered determination in accordance with § 416.1422.
(d)
Effect.
The disability hearing officer's reconsidered determination, or, if it is changed under § 416.1418, the reconsidered determination that is issued by the Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her delegate, is binding in accordance with § 416.1421, subject to the exceptions specified in that section.
[51 FR 306, Jan. 3, 1986, as amended at 71 FR 10432, Mar. 1, 2006; 73 FR 76944, Dec. 18, 2008]
§ 416.1418
Disability hearing—review of the disability hearing officer's reconsidered determination before it is issued.
(a)
General.
The Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her delegate may select a sample of disability hearing officers' reconsidered determinations, before they are issued, and review any such case to determine its correctness on any grounds he or she deems appropriate. The Associate Commissioner or his or her delegate shall review any case within the sample if:
(1) There appears to be an abuse of discretion by the hearing officer;
(2) There is an error of law; or
(3) The action, findings or conclusions of the disability hearing officer
are not supported by substantial evidence.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# ):
If the review indicates that the reconsidered determination prepared by the disability hearing officer is correct, it will be dated and issued immediately upon completion of the review. If the reconsidered determination prepared by the disability hearing officer is found by the Associate Commissioner or his or her delegate to be deficient, it will be changed as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Methods of correcting deficiencies in the disability hearing officer's reconsidered determination.
If the reconsidered determination prepared by the disability hearing officer is found by the Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her delegate to be deficient, the Associate Commissioner or his or her delegate will take appropriate action to assure that the deficiency is corrected before a reconsidered determination is issued. The action taken by the Associate Commissioner or his or her delegate will take one of two forms:
(1) The Associate Commissioner or his or her delegate may return the case file either to the component responsible for preparing the case for hearing or to the disability hearing officer, for appropriate further action; or
(2) The Associate Commissioner or his or her delegate may issue a written reconsidered determination which corrects the deficiency.
(c)
Further action on your case if it is sent back by the Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her delegate either to the component that prepared your case for hearing or to the disability hearing officer.
If the Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her delegate sends your case back either to the component responsible for preparing the case for hearing or to the disability hearing officer for appropriate further action, as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any additional proceedings in your case will be governed by the disability hearing procedures described in § 416.1416(f) or if your case is returned to the disability hearing officer and an unfavorable determination is indicated, a supplementary hearing may be scheduled for you before a reconsidered determination is reached in your case.
(d)
Opportunity to comment before the Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her delegate issues a reconsidered determination that is unfavorable to you.
If the Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her delegate proposes to issue a reconsidered determination as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and that reconsidered determination is unfavorable to you, he or she will send you a copy of the proposed reconsidered determination with an explanation of the reasons for it, and will give you an opportunity to submit written comments before it is issued. At your request, you will also be given an opportunity to inspect the pertinent materials in your case file, including the reconsidered determination prepared by the disability hearing officer, before submitting your comments. You will be given 10 days from the date you receive the Associate Commissioner's notice of proposed action to submit your written comments, unless additional time is necessary to provide access to the pertinent file materials or there is good cause for providing more time, as illustrated by the examples in § 416.1411(b). The Associate Commissioner or his or her delegate will consider your comments before taking any further action on your case.

§ 416.1419
Notice of another person's request for reconsideration.
If any other person files a request for reconsideration of the initial determination in your case, we shall notify you at your last known address before we reconsider the initial determination. We shall also give you an opportunity to present any evidence you think helpful to the reconsidered determination.

§ 416.1420
Reconsidered determination.

determination based on the preponderance of the evidence. The person who makes the reconsidered determination will have had no prior involvement with the initial determination.
[73 FR 76945, Dec. 18, 2008]

# Expedited Appeals Process
§ 416.1423
Expedited appeals process—general.
By using the expedited appeals process you may go directly to a Federal district court without first completing the administrative review process that is generally required before the court will hear your case.
§ 416.1424
When the expedited appeals process may be used.
You may use the expedited appeals process if all of the following requirements are met:
(a) We have made an initial and a reconsidered determination; an administrative law judge has made a hearing decision; or Appeals Council review has been requested, but a final decision has not been issued.
(b) You are a party to the reconsidered determination or the hearing decision.
(c) You have submitted a written request for the expedited appeals process.
(d) You have claimed, and we agree, that the only factor preventing a favorable determination or decision is a provision in the law that you believe is unconstitutional.
(e) If you are not the only party, all parties to the determination or decision agree to request the expedited appeals process.
§ 416.1425
How to request expedited appeals process.
(a)
Time of filing request.
You may request the expedited appeals process—
(1) Within 60 days after the date you receive notice of the reconsidered determination (or within the extended time period if we extend the time as provided in paragraph (c) of this section);
(2) At any time after you have filed a timely request for a hearing but before you receive notice of the administrative law judge's decision;
(3) Within 60 days after the date you receive a notice of the administrative law judge's decision or dismissal (or within the extended time period if we extend the time as provided in paragraph (c) of this section); or
(4) At any time after you have filed a timely request for Appeals Council review, but before you receive notice of the Appeals Council's action.
(b)
Place of filing request.
You may file a written request for the expedited appeals process at one of our offices.
(c)
Extension of time to request expedited appeals process.
If you want to use the expedited appeals process but do not request it within the stated time period, you may ask for more time to submit your request. Your request for an extension of time must be in writing and it must give the reasons why the request for the expedited appeals process was not filed within the stated time period. If you show that you had good cause for missing the deadline, the time period will be extended. To determine whether good cause exists, we use the standards explained in § 416.1411.
§ 416.1426
Agreement in expedited appeals process.
If you meet all the requirements necessary for the use of the expedited appeals process, our authorized representative shall prepare an agreement. The agreement must be signed by you, by every other party to the determination or decision, and by our authorized representative. The agreement must provide that—
(a) The facts in your claim are not in dispute;
(b) The sole issue in dispute is whether a provision of the Act that applies to your case is unconstitutional;
(c) Except for your belief that a provision of the Act is unconstitutional, you agree with our interpretation of the law;
(d) If the provision of the Act that you believe is unconstitutional were not applied to your case, your claim would be allowed; and
(e) Our determination or the decision is final for the purpose of seeking judicial review.
§ 416.1427
Effect of expedited appeals process agreement.
After an expedited appeals process agreement is signed, you will not need to complete the remaining steps of the administrative review process. Instead, you may file an action in a Federal district court within 60 days after the date you receive notice (a signed copy of the agreement will be mailed to you and will constitute notice) that the agreement has been signed by our authorized representative.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 49 FR 46370, Nov. 26, 1984]
§ 416.1428
Expedited appeals process request that does not result in agreement.
If you do not meet all of the requirements necessary to use the expedited appeals process, we shall tell you that your request to use this process is denied and that your request will be considered as a request for a hearing, or Appeals Council review, whichever is appropriate.

# Hearing Before an Administrative Law Judge
§ 416.1429
Hearing before an administrative law judge—general.
If you are dissatisfied with one of the determinations or decisions listed in § 416.1430, you may request a hearing. Subject to § 416.1456, the Deputy Commissioner for Hearings Operations, or their delegate, will appoint an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing. If circumstances warrant, the Deputy Commissioner for Hearings Operations, or their delegate, may assign your case to another administrative law judge. We will schedule you to appear by audio, agency video, online video, or in person as set forth in § 416.1436. Audio means telephone or similar audio-based technology in a private location you choose. Agency video means video, with audio functionality, using our equipment in one of our offices. Online video means video, with audio functionality, using a personal electronic device in a private location you choose. When we determine your manner of appearance, we consider the factors described in § 416.1436 (c)(1)(i) through (ii). You may submit new evidence (subject to the provisions of § 416.1435), examine the evidence used in making the determination or decision under review, and present and question witnesses. The administrative law judge who conducts the hearing may ask you questions. The administrative law judge will issue a decision based on the preponderance of the evidence in the hearing record. If you waive your right to appear at the hearing, the administrative law judge will make a decision based on the preponderance of the evidence that is in the file and, subject to the provisions of § 416.1435, any new evidence that may have been submitted for consideration.
[89 FR 68362, Aug. 26, 2024]

(3) A revised initial determination or revised reconsidered determination that does not involve a suspension, reduction or termination of benefits; or
(4) A revised decision based on evidence not included in the record on which the prior decision was based.
(b) We will hold a hearing only if you or another party to the hearing file a written request for a hearing.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 307, Jan. 3, 1986; 73 FR 2416, Jan. 15, 2008; 76 FR 24812, May 3, 2011]

In addition, any other person may be made a party to the hearing if his or her rights may be adversely affected by the decision, and we notify the person to appear at the hearing or to present evidence supporting his or her interest.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 307, Jan. 3, 1986; 75 FR 39160, July 8, 2010]

Written request.
You may request a hearing by filing a written request. You should include in your request—
(1) Your name and social security number;

Extension of time to request a hearing.
If you have a right to a hearing but do not request one in time, you may ask for more time to make your request. The request for an extension of time must be in writing and it must give the reasons why the request for a hearing was not filed within the stated time period.

[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 307, Jan. 3, 1986]
§ 416.1435
Submitting written evidence to an administrative law judge.
(a) When you submit your request for hearing, you should also submit information or evidence as required by § 416.912 or any summary of the evidence to the administrative law judge. Each party must make every effort to ensure that the administrative law judge receives all of the evidence and must inform us about or submit any written evidence, as required in § 416.912, no later than 5 business days before the date of the scheduled hearing. If you do not comply with this requirement, the administrative law judge may decline to consider or obtain the evidence unless the circumstances described in paragraph (b) of this section apply.
(b) If you have evidence required under § 416.912 but you have missed the deadline described in paragraph (a) of this section, the administrative law judge will accept the evidence if he or she has not yet issued a decision and you did not inform us about or submit the evidence before the deadline because:
(1) Our action misled you;
(2) You had a physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation(s) that prevented you from informing us about or submitting the evidence earlier; or
(3) Some other unusual, unexpected, or unavoidable circumstance beyond your control prevented you from informing us about or submitting the evidence earlier. Examples include, but are not limited to:
(i) You were seriously ill, and your illness prevented you from contacting us in person, in writing, or through a friend, relative, or other person;
(ii) There was a death or serious illness in your immediate family;
(iii) Important records were destroyed or damaged by fire or other accidental cause; or
(iv) You actively and diligently sought evidence from a source and the evidence was not received or was received less than 5 business days prior to the hearing.
(c)
Claims Not Based on an Application For Benefits.
Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (a)-(b) of this section, for claims that are not based on an application for benefits, the evidentiary requirement to inform us about or submit evidence no later than 5 business days before the date of the scheduled hearing will not apply if our other regulations allow you to submit evidence after the date of an administrative law judge decision.
[81 FR 90994, Dec. 16, 2016
§ 416.1436
Time, place, and manner of appearance for a hearing before an administrative law judge.
(a)
General.
We set the time and manner(s) of appearance for any hearing. We will set the place of a hearing when we schedule you and any other parties to the hearing to appear in person or by agency video. We may change the time, manner(s) of appearance, or place, if it is necessary. After sending you reasonable notice of the proposed action, the administrative law judge may adjourn or postpone the hearing or reopen it to receive additional evidence any time before the administrative law judge notifies you of a hearing decision.
(b)
Place of hearing.
If we set the place of the hearing, it can be in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The “place” of the hearing is the hearing office or other site(s) at which you and any other parties to the hearing are located when you make your appearance(s) before the administrative law judge by agency video or in person. A party to a hearing may only appear from the geographic areas, noted in this subsection, in which we hold hearings.
(c)
Determining manner of appearance to schedule.
We will schedule you or any other party to the hearing to appear by audio, agency video, online video, or in person. We may schedule you to appear by online video only if you agree to appear in that manner.
(1) When we determine your manner of appearance at the hearing, we consider the following factors:
(i) Which manner of appearance would be the most efficient for conducting the hearing; and
(ii) Any facts in your particular case that provide a good reason to schedule your appearance by audio, agency video, online video, or in person.
(2) We will generally direct any person we call as a witness, other than you or any other party to the hearing, to appear by audio, by agency video, or by online video. Witnesses include medical experts and vocational experts. Witnesses you call will appear at the hearing pursuant to § 416.1450(e). If they are unable to appear with you in the same manner as you, we will generally direct them to appear by agency video or by audio. We will consider directing witnesses to appear in person only when:
(i) A witness is unable to appear by other available manners of appearance;
(ii) We determine that an alternate manner of appearance would be less efficient than conducting the appearance in person; or
(iii) We find that there are facts in your particular case that provide a good reason to schedule this individual's appearance in person.
(3) We follow the procedures set forth in § 416.1437 to ensure the safety of the public and our employees in our hearing process.
(d)
Objecting to appearing by audio, by agency video, or both.
Prior to scheduling your hearing, we will notify you that we may schedule you to appear by audio or by agency video, or, if you agree, by online video. If you object to appearing by audio, by agency video, or both, you must notify us in writing within 30 days after the date you receive the notice. If you only object to appearing by audio, we may schedule you to appear in person, by agency video, or, if you agree, by online video. Similarly, if you only object to appearing by agency video, we may schedule you to appear in person, by audio, or, if you agree, by online video. If you object to appearing by both audio and agency video, and your residence does not change while your request for hearing is pending, we will schedule you to appear before the administrative law judge in person or, if you agree, by online video.
(1) If you notify us that you object to appearing by audio, by agency video, or both, more than 30 days after the date you receive our notice, we will extend the time period if you show you had good cause for missing the deadline. To determine whether good cause exists for extending the deadline, we use the standards explained in § 416.1411.
(2) Notwithstanding any objections you may have to appearing by audio and subject to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, we will schedule you or any other party to the hearing to appear by audio when we cannot schedule you to appear by agency video or by online video and extraordinary circumstances prevent you from appearing in person. For audio appearances under this subsection, we will call you or any other party to the hearing using your or their telephone number(s).
(3) Notwithstanding any objections you may have to appearing by audio, if you are incarcerated and an appearance by agency video and online video is not available, we will schedule you to appear by audio, unless we find that there are facts in your particular case that provide a good reason to schedule you to appear in person, if allowed by the place of confinement, or by agency video, online video, or in person upon your release. For audio appearances under this subsection, we will call you or any other party to the hearing using your or their telephone number(s).
(4) Notwithstanding any objections you may have to appearing by audio, by agency video, or both, if you change your residence while your request for hearing is pending, we will determine how you will appear, including by audio or by agency video, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. For us to consider your change of residence when we schedule your hearing, you must submit evidence verifying your new residence. For audio appearances under this subsection, we will call you or any other party to the hearing using your or their telephone number(s).
(5) Notwithstanding any objection you may have to appearing by audio, we will schedule you or any other party to the hearing to appear by audio in the circumstances provided in § 416.1437(b)(2)(ii) and (c). For audio appearances under this subsection, we will call you or any other party to the hearing using your or their telephone number(s).
(e)
Time period to agree to an appearance by online video.
Prior to scheduling your hearing, we will notify you that we may schedule you to appear by online video if you agree to appear in that manner. To agree to appear by online video, you must notify us in writing within 30 days after the date you receive the notice. If you notify us that you agree to appearing by online video more than 30 days after the date you receive our notice, we will extend the time period if you show you had good cause for missing the deadline. To determine whether good cause exists for extending the deadline, we use the standards explained in § 416.1411. You may withdraw your agreement any time before the start of your hearing.
(f)
Objecting to the time or place of the hearing.
(1) If you wish to object to the time or place of the hearing, you must:
(i) Notify us in writing at the earliest possible opportunity, but not later than 5 days before the date set for the hearing or 30 days after receiving notice of the hearing, whichever is earlier; and
(ii) State the reason(s) for your objection and state the time or place you want the hearing to be held. If the administrative law judge finds you have
good cause, as determined under paragraph (e) of this section, we will change the time or place of the hearing.
(2) If you notify us that you object to the time or place of hearing less than 5 days before the date set for the hearing or, if earlier, more than 30 days after receiving notice of the hearing, we will consider this objection only if you show you had good cause for missing the deadline. To determine whether good cause exists for missing this deadline, we use the standards explained in § 416.1411.
(g)
Good cause for changing the time or place.
The administrative law judge will determine whether good cause exists for changing the time or place of your scheduled hearing. If the administrative law judge finds that good cause exists, we will set the time or place of the new hearing. A finding that good cause exists to reschedule the time or place of your hearing will generally not change the assignment of the administrative law judge or how you or another party will appear at the hearing, unless we determine a change will promote efficiency in our hearing process.
(1) The administrative law judge will find good cause to change the time or place of your hearing if he or she determines that, based on the evidence:
(i) A serious physical or mental condition or incapacitating injury makes it impossible for you or your representative to travel to the hearing, or a death in the family occurs; or
(ii) Severe weather conditions make it impossible for you or your representative to travel to the hearing.
(2) In determining whether good cause exists in circumstances other than those set out in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the administrative law judge will consider your reason(s) for requesting the change, the facts supporting it, and the impact of the proposed change on the efficient administration of the hearing process. Factors affecting the impact of the change include, but are not limited to, the effect on the processing of other scheduled hearings, delays that might occur in rescheduling your hearing, and whether we previously granted you any changes in the time or place of your hearing. Examples of such other circumstances that you might give for requesting a change in the time or place of the hearing include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) You unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a representative and need additional time to secure representation;
(ii) Your representative was appointed within 30 days of the scheduled hearing and needs additional time to prepare for the hearing;
(iii) Your representative has a prior commitment to be in court or at another administrative hearing on the date scheduled for the hearing;
(iv) A witness who will testify to facts material to your case would be unavailable to attend the scheduled hearing and the evidence cannot be otherwise obtained;
(v) Transportation is not readily available for you to travel to the hearing; or
(vi) You are unrepresented, and you are unable to respond to the notice of hearing because of any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) which you may have.

§ 416.1437
Protecting the safety of the public and our employees in our hearing process.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part or part 422 of this chapter, we are establishing the procedures set out in this section to ensure the safety of the public and our employees in our hearing process.
(b)(1) At the request of any hearing office employee, the Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge will determine, after consultation with the presiding administrative law judge, whether a claimant or other individual poses a reasonable threat to the safety of our employees or other participants in the hearing. The Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge will find that a claimant or other individual poses a threat to the safety of our employees or other participants in the hearing when he or she determines that the individual has made a threat and there is a reasonable likelihood that the claimant or other individual
could act on the threat or when evidence suggests that a claimant or other individual poses a threat. In making a finding under this paragraph, the Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge will consider all relevant evidence, including any information we have in the claimant's record and any information we have regarding the claimant's or other individual's past conduct.
(2) If the Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge determines that the claimant or other individual poses a reasonable threat to the safety of our employees or other participants in the hearing, the Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge will either:
(i) Require the presence of a security guard at the hearing; or
(ii) Require that the hearing be conducted by audio, notwithstanding any objection to appearing by audio, or, if the claimant agrees, by online video.
(c) If we have banned a claimant from any of our facilities, we will provide the claimant with the opportunity for a hearing that will be conducted by audio, notwithstanding any objection to appearing by audio, or, if the claimant agrees, by online video.
(d) The actions of the Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge taken under this section are final and not subject to further review.
(e) For audio appearances under this section, we will call you or any other party to the hearing using your or their telephone number(s).

[68 FR 5220, Feb. 3, 2003, as amended at 75 FR 39161, July 8, 2010; 78 FR 29628, May 21, 2013; 79 FR 35934, June 25, 2014; 81 FR 90995, Dec. 16, 2016; 84 FR 69308, Dec. 18, 2019; 89 FR 68363, Aug. 26, 2024]
§ 416.1439
Objections to the issues.
If you object to the issues to be decided at the hearing, you must notify
the administrative law judge in writing at the earliest possible opportunity, but no later than 5 business days before the date set for the hearing, unless you show that your circumstances meet the conditions described in § 416.1435(b). You must state the reason(s) for your objection(s). The administrative law judge will make a decision on your objection(s) either at the hearing or in writing before the hearing.
[81 FR 90995, Dec. 16, 2016
§ 416.1440
Disqualification of the administrative law judge.
An administrative law judge shall not conduct a hearing if he or she is prejudiced or partial with respect to any party or has any interest in the matter pending for decision. If you object to the administrative law judge who will conduct the hearing, you must notify the administrative law judge at your earliest opportunity. The administrative law judge shall consider your objections and shall decide whether to proceed with the hearing or withdraw. If he or she withdraws, the Associate Commissioner for Hearings and Appeals, or his or her delegate, will appoint another administrative law judge to conduct the hearing. If the administrative law judge does not withdraw, you may, after the hearing, present your objections to the Appeals Council as reasons why the hearing decision should be revised or a new hearing held before another administrative law judge.
§ 416.1441
Prehearing case review.
(a)
General.
After a hearing is requested but before it is held, we may, for the purposes of a prehearing case review, forward the case to the component of our office (including a State agency) that issued the determination being reviewed. That component will decide whether it should revise the determination based on the preponderance of the evidence. A revised determination may be fully or partially favorable to you. A prehearing case review will not delay the scheduling of a hearing unless you agree to continue the review and delay the hearing. If the prehearing case review is not completed before the date of the hearing, the case will be sent to the administrative law judge unless a favorable revised determination is in process or you and the other parties to the hearing agree in writing to delay the hearing until the review is completed.
(b)
When a prehearing case review may be conducted.
We may conduct a prehearing case review if—
(1) Additional evidence is submitted;
(2) There is an indication that additional evidence is available;
(3) There is a change in the law or regulation; or
(4) There is an error in the file or some other indication that the prior determination may be revised.
(c)
Notice of a prehearing revised determination.
If we revise the determination in a prehearing case review, we will mail a written notice of the revised determination to all parties at their last known addresses. We will state the basis for the revised determination and advise all parties of the effect of the revised determination on the request for a hearing.
(d)
Effect of a fully favorable revised determination.
If the revised determination is fully favorable to you, we will tell you in the notice that an administrative law judge will dismiss the request for a hearing. We will also tell you that you or another party to the hearing may request that the administrative law judge vacate the dismissal and reinstate the request for a hearing if you or another party to the hearing disagrees with the revised determination for any reason. If you wish to make this request, you must do so in writing and send it to us within 60 days of the date you receive notice of the dismissal. If the request is timely, an administrative law judge will vacate the dismissal, reinstate the request for a hearing, and offer you and all parties an opportunity for a hearing. The administrative law judge will extend the time limit if you show that you had good cause for missing the deadline. The administrative law judge will use the standards in § 416.1411 to determine whether you had good cause.
(e)
Effect of a partially favorable revised determination.
If the revised determination is partially favorable to you, we will tell you in the notice what was not favorable. We will also tell you that an administrative law judge will
hold the hearing you requested unless you and all other parties to the hearing agree in writing to dismiss the request for a hearing. An administrative law judge will dismiss the request for a hearing if we receive the written statement(s) agreeing to dismiss the request for a hearing before an administrative law judge mails a notice of his or her hearing decision.

§ 416.1442
Prehearing proceedings and decisions by attorney advisors.
(a)
General.
After a hearing is requested but before it is held, an attorney advisor may conduct prehearing proceedings as set out in paragraph (c) of this section. If after the completion of these proceedings we can make a decision that is fully favorable to you and all other parties based on the preponderance of the evidence, an attorney advisor, instead of an administrative law judge, may issue the decision. The conduct of the prehearing proceedings by the attorney advisor will not delay the scheduling of a hearing. If the prehearing proceedings are not completed before the date of the hearing, the case will be sent to the administrative law judge unless a fully favorable decision is in process or you and all other parties to the hearing agree in writing to delay the hearing until the proceedings are completed.
(b)
When prehearing proceedings may be conducted by an attorney advisor.
An attorney advisor may conduct prehearing proceedings if you have filed a claim for SSI benefits based on disability and—
(1) New and material evidence is submitted;
(2) There is an indication that additional evidence is available;
(3) There is a change in the law or regulations; or
(4) There is an error in the file or some other indication that a fully favorable decision may be issued.

Nature of the prehearing proceedings that may be conducted by an attorney advisor.
As part of the prehearing proceedings, the attorney advisor, in addition to reviewing the existing record, may—
(1) Request additional evidence that may be relevant to the claim, including medical evidence; and
(2) If necessary to clarify the record for the purpose of determining if a fully favorable decision is warranted, schedule a conference with the parties.
(d)
Notice of a decision by an attorney advisor.
If an attorney advisor issues a fully favorable decision under this section, we will mail a written notice of the decision to all parties at their last known addresses. We will state the basis for the decision and advise all parties that they may request that an administrative law judge reinstate the request for a hearing if they disagree with the decision for any reason. Any party who wants to make this request must do so in writing and send it to us within 60 days of the date he or she receives notice of the decision. The administrative law judge will extend the time limit if the requestor shows good cause for missing the deadline. The administrative law judge will use the standards in § 416.1411 to determine whether there is good cause. If the request is timely, an administrative law judge will reinstate the request for a hearing and offer all parties an opportunity for a hearing.
(e)
Effect of an attorney advisor's decision.
An attorney advisor's decision under this section is binding unless—
(1) You or another party to the hearing submits a timely request that an administrative law judge reinstate the request for a hearing under paragraph (d) of this section;
(2) The Appeals Council reviews the decision on its own motion pursuant to § 416.1469 as explained in paragraph (f)(3) of this section; or
(3) The decision of the attorney advisor is revised under the procedures explained in § 416.1487.
(f)
Ancillary provisions.
For the purposes of the procedures authorized by this section, the regulations of part 416 shall apply to—
(1) Authorize an attorney advisor to exercise the functions performed by an administrative law judge under §§ 416.913a, 416.920a, 416.926, and 416.946.

[60 FR 34132, June 30, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 35516, June 30, 1998; 64 FR 13678, Mar. 22, 1999; 64 FR 51894, Sept. 27, 1999; 65 FR 16815, Mar. 30, 2000; 72 FR 44765, Aug. 9, 2007; 73 FR 76945, Dec. 18, 2008; 74 FR 33328, July 13, 2009; 76 FR 18384, Apr. 4, 2011; 76 FR 65371, Oct. 21, 2011; 78 FR 45460, July 29, 2013; 80 FR 31991, June 5, 2015; 82 FR 5884, Jan. 18, 2017; 83 FR 712, Jan. 8, 2018; 83 FR 28993, June 22, 2018; 83 FR 40453, Aug. 15, 2018]
§ 416.1443
Responsibilities of the adjudication officer.
(a)(1)
General.
Under the procedures set out in this section we will test modifications to the procedures we follow when you file a request for a hearing before an administrative law judge in connection with a claim for benefits based on disability where the question of whether you are under a disability as defined in §§ 416.905 and 416.906 is at issue. These modifications will enable us to test the effect of having an adjudication officer be your primary point of contact after you file a hearing request and before you have a hearing with an administrative law judge. The tests may be conducted alone, or in combination with the tests of the modifications to the disability determination procedures which we conduct under § 416.1406. The adjudication officer, working with you and your representative, if any, will identify issues in dispute, develop evidence, conduct informal conferences, and conduct any other prehearing proceeding as may be necessary. The adjudication officer has the authority to make a decision fully favorable to you if the evidence so warrants. If the adjudication officer does not make a decision on your claim, your hearing request will be assigned to an administrative law judge for further proceedings.
(2)
Procedures for cases included in the tests.
Prior to commencing tests of the adjudication officer position in selected site(s), we will publish a notice in the
Federal Register.
The notice will describe where the specific test site(s) will be and the duration of the test(s). We will also state whether the tests of the adjudication officer position in each site will be conducted alone, or in combination with the tests of the modifications to the disability determination procedures which we conduct under § 416.1406. The individuals who participate in the test(s) will be assigned randomly to a test group in each site where the tests are conducted.
(b)(1)
Prehearing procedures conducted by an Adjudication Officer.
When you file a request for a hearing before an administrative law judge in connection with a claim for benefits based on disability where the question of whether you are under a disability as defined in §§ 416.905 and 416.906 is at issue, the adjudication officer will conduct an interview with you. The interview may take place in person, by telephone, or by videoconference, as the adjudication officer determines is appropriate under the circumstances of your case. If you file a request for an extension of time to request a hearing in accordance with § 416.1433(c), the adjudication officer may develop information on, and may decide where the adjudication officer issues a fully favorable decision to you that you had good cause for missing the deadline for requesting a hearing. To determine whether you had good cause for missing the deadline, the adjudication officer will use the standards contained in § 416.1411.
(2)
Representation.
The adjudication officer will provide you with information regarding the hearing process, including your right to representation. As may be appropriate, the adjudication officer will provide you with referral sources for representation, and give you copies of necessary documents to facilitate the appointment of a representative. If you have a representative, the adjudication officer will conduct an informal conference with the representative, in person or by telephone, to identify the issues in dispute and prepare proposed written agreements for the approval of the administrative law judge regarding those issues which are not in dispute and those issues proposed for the hearing. If you decide to proceed without representation, the adjudication officer may hold an informal conference with
you. If you obtain representation after the adjudication officer has concluded that your case is ready for a hearing, the administrative law judge will return your case to the adjudication officer who will conduct an informal conference with you and your representative.
(3)
Evidence.
You, or your representative, may submit, or may be asked to obtain and submit, additional evidence to the adjudication officer. As the adjudication officer determines is appropriate under the circumstances of your case, the adjudication officer may refer the claim for further medical or vocational evidence.
(4)
Referral for a hearing.
The adjudication officer will refer the claim to the administrative law judge for further proceedings when the development of evidence is complete, and you or your representative agree that a hearing is ready to be held. If you or your representative are unable to agree with the adjudication officer that the development of evidence is complete, the adjudication officer will note your disagreement and refer the claim to the administrative law judge for further proceedings. At this point, the administrative law judge conducts all further hearing proceedings, including scheduling and holding a hearing, (§ 416.1436), considering any additional evidence or arguments submitted (§§ 416.1435, 416.1444, 416.1449, 416.1450), and issuing a decision or dismissal of your request for a hearing, as may be appropriate (§§ 416.1448, 416.1453, 416.1457). In addition, if the administrative law judge determines on or before the date of your hearing that the development of evidence is not complete, the administrative law judge may return the claim to the adjudication officer to complete the development of the evidence and for such other action as necessary.
(c)(1)
Fully favorable decisions issued by an adjudication officer.
If, after a hearing is requested but before it is held, the adjudication officer decides that the evidence in your case warrants a decision which is fully favorable to you, the adjudication officer may issue such a decision. For purposes of the tests authorized under this section, the adjudication officer's decision shall be considered to be a decision as defined in § 416.1401. If the adjudication officer issues a decision under this section, it will be in writing and will give the findings of fact and the reasons for the decision. The adjudication officer will evaluate the issues relevant to determining whether or not you are disabled in accordance with the provisions of the Social Security Act, the rules in this part and part 422 of this chapter and applicable Social Security Rulings. For cases in which the adjudication officer issues a decision, he or she may determine your residual functional capacity in the same manner that an administrative law judge is authorized to do so in § 416.946. The adjudication officer may also evaluate the severity of your mental impairments in the same manner that an administrative law judge is authorized to do so under § 416.920a. The adjudication officer's decision will be based on the evidence which is included in the record and, subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, will complete the actions that will be taken on your request for hearing. A copy of the decision will be mailed to all parties at their last known address. We will tell you in the notice that the administrative law judge will not hold a hearing unless a party to the hearing requests that the hearing proceed. A request to proceed with the hearing must be made in writing within 30 days after the date the notice of the decision of the adjudication officer is mailed.
(2)
Effect of a decision by an adjudication officer.
A decision by an adjudication officer which is fully favorable to you under this section, and notification thereof, completes the administrative action on your request for hearing and is binding on all parties to the hearing and not subject to further review, unless—
(i) You or another party requests that the hearing continue, as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;
(ii) The Appeals Council decides to review the decision on its own motion under the authority provided in § 416.1469;
(iii) The decision is revised under the procedures explained in §§ 416.1487 through 416.1489; or
(iv) In a case remanded by a Federal court, the Appeals Council assumes jurisdiction under the procedures in § 416.1484.
(3)
Fee for a representative's services.
The adjudication officer may authorize a fee for your representative's services if the adjudication officer makes a decision on your claim that is fully favorable to you, and you are represented. The actions of, and any fee authorization made by, the adjudication officer with respect to representation will be made in accordance with the provisions of subpart O of this part.
(d)
Who may be an adjudication officer.
The adjudication officer described in this section may be an employee of the Social Security Administration or a State agency that makes disability determinations for us.

# Administrative Law Judge Hearing Procedures
§ 416.1444
Administrative law judge hearing procedures—general.
A hearing is open to the parties and to other persons the administrative law judge considers necessary and proper. At the hearing, the administrative law judge looks fully into the issues, questions you and the other witnesses, and, subject to the provisions of § 416.1435, accepts as evidence any documents that are material to the issues; may stop the hearing temporarily and continue it at a later date if the administrative law judge finds that there is material evidence missing at the hearing or one or more variables outside of our control, such as audio quality or video quality, materially affects the hearing; and may reopen the hearing at any time before the administrative law judge mails a notice of the decision in order to receive new and material evidence. For purposes of this section, materially affects means prevents the hearing from proceeding. The administrative law judge may decide when the evidence will be presented and when the issues will be discussed.
[89 FR 68363, Aug. 26, 2024]
§ 416.1446
Issues before an administrative law judge.
(a)
General.
The issues before the administrative law judge include all the issues brought out in the initial, reconsidered or revised determination that were not decided entirely in your favor. However, if evidence presented before or during the hearing causes the administrative law judge to question a fully favorable determination, he or she will notify you and will consider it an issue at the hearing.
(b)
New issues
—(1)
General.
The administrative law judge may consider a new issue at the hearing if he or she notifies you and all the parties about the new issue any time after receiving the hearing request and before mailing notice of the hearing decision. The administrative law judge or any party may raise a new issue; an issue may be raised even though it arose after the request for a hearing and even though it has not been considered in an initial or reconsidered determination. However, it may not be raised if it involves a claim that is within the jurisdiction of a State agency under a Federal-State agreement concerning the determination of disability.
(2)
Notice of a new issue.
The administrative law judge shall notify you and any other party if he or she will consider any new issue. Notice of the time and place of the hearing on any new issues will be given in the manner described in § 416.1438, unless you have indicated in writing that you do not wish to receive the notice.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 307, Jan. 3, 1986]
§ 416.1448
Deciding a case without an oral hearing before an administrative law judge.
(a)
Decision fully favorable.
If the evidence in the hearing record supports a finding in favor of you and all the parties on every issue, the administrative law judge may issue a hearing decision based on a preponderance of the evidence without holding an oral hearing. The notice of the decision will state that you have the right to an oral hearing and to examine the evidence on which the administrative law judge based the decision.
(b)
Parties do not wish to appear.
(1) The administrative law judge may decide a case on the record and not conduct an oral hearing if—
(i) You and all the parties indicate in writing that you do not wish to appear before the administrative law judge at an oral hearing; or
(ii) You live outside the United States, you do not inform us that you wish to appear, and there are no other parties who wish to appear.
(2) When an oral hearing is not held, the administrative law judge shall make a record of the material evidence. The record will include the applications, written statements, certificates, reports, affidavits, and other documents which were used in making the determination under review and any additional evidence you or any other party to the hearing present in writing. The decision of the administrative law judge must be based on this record.
(c)
Case remanded for a revised determination.
(1) The administrative law judge may remand a case to the appropriate component of our office for a revised determination if there is reason to believe that the revised determination would be fully favorable to you. This could happen if the administrative law judge receives new and material evidence or if there is a change in the law that permits the favorable determination.
(2) Unless you request the remand the administrative law judge shall notify you that your case has been remanded and tell you that if you object, you must notify him or her of your objections within 10 days of the date the case is remanded or we will assume that you agree to the remand. If you object to the remand, the administrative law judge will consider the objection and rule on it in writing.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 307, Jan. 3, 1986; 73 FR 76945, Dec. 18, 2008; 75 FR 33169, June 11, 2010; 76 FR 65371, Oct. 21, 2011]
§ 416.1449
Presenting written statements and oral arguments.
You or a person you designate to act as your representative may appear before the administrative law judge to state your case, present a written summary of your case, or enter written statements about the facts and law material to your case in the record. If presenting written statements prior to hearing, you must provide a copy of your written statements for each party no later than 5 business days before the date set for the hearing, unless you show that your circumstances meet the conditions described in § 416.1435(b).
[81 FR 90996, Dec. 16, 2016]
§ 416.1450
Presenting evidence at a hearing before an administrative law judge.
(a)
The right to appear and present evidence.
Any party to a hearing has a right to appear before the administrative law judge, in the manner set forth in § 416.1436, to present evidence and to state their position. A party may also make their appearance by means of a designated representative, who may make their appearance in the manner set forth in § 416.1436.
(b)
Waiver of the right to appear.
You may send the administrative law judge a waiver or a written statement indicating that you do not wish to appear at the hearing. You may withdraw this waiver any time before a notice of the hearing decision is mailed to you. Even if all of the parties waive their right to appear at a hearing, we may notify them of a time and a place for an oral hearing, if the administrative law judge believes that a personal appearance and testimony by you or any other party is necessary to decide the case.
(c)
Admissible evidence.
Subject to the provisions of § 416.1435, the administrative law judge may receive any evidence at the hearing that he or she believes is material to the issues, even though the evidence would not be admissible in court under the rules of evidence used by the court.
(d)
Subpoenas.
(1) When it is reasonably necessary for the full presentation of a case, an administrative law judge or a member of the Appeals Council may, on his or her own initiative or at the request of a party, issue subpoenas for the appearance and testimony of witnesses and for the production of books, records, correspondence, papers, or other documents that are material to an issue at the hearing.
(2) Parties to a hearing who wish to subpoena documents or witnesses must file a written request for the issuance of a subpoena with the administrative law judge or at one of our offices at least 10 business days before the hearing date, unless you show that your circumstances meet the conditions described in § 416.1435(b). The written request must give the names of the witnesses or documents to be produced; describe the address or location of the witnesses or documents with sufficient detail to find them; state the important facts that the witness or document is expected to prove; and indicate why these facts could not be proven without issuing a subpoena.
(3) We will pay the cost of issuing the subpoena.
(4) We will pay subpoenaed witnesses the same fees and mileage they would receive if they had been subpoenaed by a Federal district court.
(e)
Witnesses at a hearing.
Witnesses you call may appear at a hearing with you in the same manner in which you are scheduled to appear. If they are unable to appear with you in the same manner as you, they may appear as prescribed in § 416.1436(c)(2). Witnesses called by the administrative law judge will appear in the manner prescribed in § 416.1436(c)(2). They will testify under oath or affirmation unless the administrative law judge finds an important reason to excuse them from taking an oath or affirmation. The administrative law judge may ask the witness any questions material to the issues and will allow the parties or their designated representatives to do so.
(f)
Collateral estoppel—issues previously decided.
An issue at your hearing may be a fact that has already been decided in one of our previous determinations or decisions in a claim involving the same parties, but arising under a different title of the Act or under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act. If this happens, the administrative law judge will not consider the issue again, but will accept the factual finding made in the previous determination or decision unless there are reasons to believe that it was wrong.

Official record.
(a)
Hearing recording.
All hearings will be recorded. The hearing recording will be prepared as a typed copy of the proceedings if—
(1) The case is sent to the Appeals Council without a decision or with a recommended decision by the administrative law judge;
(2) You seek judicial review of your case by filing an action in a Federal district court within the stated time period, unless we request the court to remand the case; or
(3) An administrative law judge or the Appeals Council asks for a written record of the proceedings.
(b)
Contents of the official record.
All evidence upon which the administrative law judge relies for the decision must be contained in the record, either directly or by appropriate reference. The official record will include the applications, written statements, certificates, reports, affidavits, medical records, and other documents that were used in making the decision under review and any additional evidence or written statements that the administrative law judge admits into the record under §§ 416.1429 and 416.1435. All exhibits introduced as evidence must be marked for identification and incorporated into the record. The official record of your claim will contain all of the marked exhibits and a verbatim recording of all testimony offered at the hearing. It also will include any prior initial determinations or decisions on your claim.

§ 416.1452
Consolidated hearings before an administrative law judge.
(a)
General.
(1) A consolidated hearing may be held if—
(i) You have requested a hearing to decide your eligibility for supplemental security income benefits and you have also requested a hearing to
decide your rights under another law we administer; and
(ii) One or more of the issues to be considered at the hearing you requested are the same issues that are involved in another claim you have pending before us.
(2) If the administrative law judge decides to hold the hearing on both claims, he or she decides both claims, even if we have not yet made an initial or reconsidered determination on the other claim.
(b)
Record, evidence, and decision.
There will be a single record at a consolidated hearing. This means that the evidence introduced in one case becomes evidence in the other(s). The administrative law judge may make either a separate or consolidated decision.

§ 416.1453
The decision of an administrative law judge.
(a)
General.
The administrative law judge shall issue a written decision which gives the findings of fact and the reasons for the decision. The administrative law judge must base the decision on the preponderance of the evidence offered at the hearing or otherwise included in the record. The administrative law judge shall mail a copy of the decision to all the parties at their last known address. The Appeals Council may also receive a copy of the decision.
(b)
Fully favorable oral decision entered into the record at the hearing.
The administrative law judge may enter a fully favorable oral decision based on the preponderance of the evidence into the record of the hearing proceedings. If the administrative law judge enters a fully favorable oral decision into the record of the hearing proceedings, the administrative law judge may issue a written decision that incorporates the oral decision by reference. The administrative law judge may use this procedure only in those categories of cases that we identify in advance. The administrative law judge may only use this procedure in those cases where the administrative law judge determines that no changes are required in the findings of fact or the reasons for the decision as stated at the hearing. If a fully favorable decision is entered into the record at the hearing, the administrative law judge will also include in the record, as an exhibit entered into the record at the hearing, a document that sets forth the key data, findings of fact, and narrative rationale for the decision. If the decision incorporates by reference the findings and the reasons stated in an oral decision at the hearing, the parties shall also be provided, upon written request, a record of the oral decision.
(c)
Time for the administrative law judge's decision.
(1) The administrative law judge must issue the hearing decision no later than 90 days after the request for hearing is filed, unless—
(i) The matter to be decided is whether you are disabled; or
(ii) There is good cause for extending the time period because of unavoidable circumstances.
(2) Good cause for extending the time period may be found under the following circumstances:
(i)
Delay caused by you or by your representative's action.
The time period for decision in this instance may be extended by the total number of days of the delays. The delays include delays in submitting evidence, briefs, or other statements, postponements or adjournments made at your request, and any other delays caused by you or your representative.
(ii)
Other delays.
The time period for decision may be extended where delays occur through no fault of the Commissioner. In this instance, the decision will be issued as soon as practicable.
(d)
Recommended decision.
Although an administrative law judge will usually make a decision, the administrative law judge may send the case to the Appeals Council with a recommended decision based on a preponderance of the evidence when appropriate. The administrative law judge will mail a copy of the recommended decision to the parties at their last known addresses and send the recommended decision to the Appeals Council.

§ 416.1457
Dismissal of a request for a hearing before an administrative law judge.
An administrative law judge may dismiss a request for a hearing under any of the following conditions:
(a) At any time before notice of the hearing decision is mailed, you or the party or parties that requested the hearing ask to withdraw the request. This request may be submitted in writing to the administrative law judge or made orally at the hearing.
(b)(1)(i) Neither you nor the person you designate to act as your representative appears at the time and place set for the hearing and you have been notified before the time set for the hearing that your request for a hearing may be dismissed without further notice if you did not appear at the time and place of hearing, and good cause has not been found by the administrative law judge for your failure to appear; or
(ii) Neither you nor the person you designate to act as your representative appears at the time and place set for the hearing and within 10 days after the administrative law judge mails you a notice asking why you did not appear, you do not give a good reason for the failure to appear.
(2) In determining good cause or good reason under this paragraph, we will
consider any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) which you may have.
(c) The administrative law judge decides that there is cause to dismiss a hearing request entirely or to refuse to consider any one or more of the issues because—
(1) The doctrine of
res judicata
applies in that we have made a previous determination or decision under this subpart about your rights on the same facts and on the same issue or issues, and this previous determination or decision has become final by either administrative or judicial action;
(2) The person requesting a hearing has no right to it under § 416.1430;
(3) You did not request a hearing within the stated time period and we have not extended the time for requesting a hearing under § 416.1433(c); or
(4) You die, there are no other parties, and we have no information to show that you may have a survivor who may be paid benefits due to you under § 416.542(b) and who wishes to pursue the request for hearing, or that you authorized interim assistance reimbursement to a State pursuant to section 1631(g) of the Act. The administrative law judge, however, will vacate a dismissal of the hearing request if, within 60 days after the date of the dismissal:
(i) A person claiming to be your survivor, who may be paid benefits due to you under § 416.542(b), submits a written request for a hearing, and shows that a decision on the issues that were to be considered at the hearing may adversely affect him or her; or
(ii) We receive information showing that you authorized interim assistance reimbursement to a State pursuant to section 1631(g) of the Act.

The administrative law judge or Appeals Council will inform you in writing of the action taken on your request.

If the Appeals Council decides to vacate a dismissal on its own motion, it will do so within 60 days of the date we mail the notice of dismissal and will inform you in writing that it vacated the dismissal.
(b) If you wish to proceed with a hearing after you received a fully favorable revised determination under the prehearing case review process in § 416.1441, you must follow the procedures in § 416.1441(d) to request that an administrative law judge vacate his or her order dismissing your request for a hearing.
[76 FR 65371, Oct. 21, 2011]

hold a prehearing or posthearing conference to facilitate the hearing or the hearing decision. The administrative law judge shall tell the parties of the time, place and purpose of the conference at least seven days before the conference date, unless the parties have indicated in writing that they do not wish to receive a written notice of the conference. At the conference, the administrative law judge may consider matters in addition to those stated in the notice, if the parties consent in writing. A record of the conference will be made.

# Appeals Council Review
§ 416.1466
[Reserved]
§ 416.1467
Appeals Council review—general.
If you or any other party is dissatisfied with the hearing decision or with the dismissal of a hearing request, you may request that the Appeals Council review that action. The Appeals Council may deny or dismiss the request for review, or it may grant the request and either issue a decision or remand the case to an administrative law judge. The Appeals Council shall notify the parties at their last known address of the action it takes.
§ 416.1468
How to request Appeals Council review.
(a)
Time and place to request Appeals Council review.
You may request Appeals Council review by filing a written request. You should submit any evidence you wish to have considered by the Appeals Council with your request for review, and the Appeals Council will consider the evidence in accordance with § 416.1470. You may file your request at one of our offices within 60 days after the date you receive notice of the hearing decision or dismissal (or within the extended time period if we extend the time as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).
(b)
Extension of time to request review.
You or any party to a hearing decision may ask that the time for filing a request for the review be extended. The request for an extension of time must be in writing. It must be filed with the Appeals Council, and it must give the reasons why the request for review was not filed within the stated time period. If you show that you had good cause for missing the deadline, the time period will be extended. To determine whether good cause exists, we use the standards explained in § 416.1411.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 81 FR 90996, Dec. 16, 2016]
§ 416.1469
Appeals Council initiates review.
(a)
General.
Anytime within 60 days after the date of a decision or dismissal that is subject to review under this section, the Appeals Council may decide on its own motion to review the action that was taken in your case. We may refer your case to the Appeals Council for it to consider reviewing under this authority.
(b)
Identification of cases.
We will identify a case for referral to the Appeals Council for possible review under its own-motion authority before we effectuate a decision in the case. We will identify cases for referral to the Appeals Council through random and selective sampling techniques, which we may use in association with examination of the cases identified by sampling. We will also identify cases for referral to the Appeals Council through the evaluation of cases we conduct in order to effectuate decisions.
(1)
Random and selective sampling and case examinations.
We may use random and selective sampling to identify cases involving any type of action (
i.e.
, fully or partially favorable decisions, unfavorable decisions, or dismissals) and any type of benefits (
i.e.
, benefits based on disability and benefits not based on disability). We will use selective sampling to identify cases that exhibit problematic issues or fact patterns that increase the likelihood of error. Neither our random sampling procedures nor our selective sampling procedures will identify cases based on the identity of the decisionmaker or the identity of the office issuing the
decision. We may examine cases that have been identified through random or selective sampling to refine the identification of cases that may meet the criteria for review by the Appeals Council.
(2)
Identification as a result of the effectuation process.
We may refer a case requiring effectuation to the Appeals Council if, in the view of the effectuating component, the decision cannot be effectuated because it contains a clerical error affecting the outcome of the claim; the decision is clearly inconsistent with the Social Security Act, the regulations, or a published ruling; or the decision is unclear regarding a matter that affects the claim's outcome.
(c)
Referral of cases.
We will make referrals that occur as the result of a case examination or the effectuation process in writing. The written referral based on the results of such a case examination or the effectuation process will state the referring component's reasons for believing that the Appeals Council should review the case on its own motion. Referrals that result from selective sampling without a case examination may be accompanied by a written statement identifying the issue(s) or fact pattern that caused the referral. Referrals that result from random sampling without a case examination will only identify the case as a random sample case.
(d)
Appeals Council's action.
If the Appeals Council decides to review a decision or dismissal on its own motion, it will mail a notice of review to all the parties as provided in § 416.1473. The Appeals Council will include with that notice a copy of any written referral it has received under paragraph (c) of this section. The Appeals Council's decision to review a case is established by its issuance of the notice of review. If it is unable to decide within the applicable 60-day period whether to review a decision or dismissal, the Appeals Council may consider the case to determine if the decision or dismissal should be reopened pursuant to §§ 416.1487 and 416.1488. If the Appeals Council decides to review a decision on its own motion or to reopen a decision as provided in §§ 416.1487 and 416.1488, the notice of review or the notice of reopening issued by the Appeals Council will advise, where appropriate, that interim benefits will be payable if a final decision has not been issued within 110 days after the date of the decision that is reviewed or reopened, and that any interim benefits paid will not be considered overpayments unless the benefits are fraudulently obtained.

§ 416.1470
Cases the Appeals Council will review.
(a) The Appeals Council will review a case at a party's request or on its own motion if—
(1) There appears to be an abuse of discretion by the administrative law judge or administrative appeals judge who heard the case;
(2) There is an error of law;
(3) The action, findings or conclusions in the hearing decision or dismissal order are not supported by substantial evidence;
(4) There is a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general public interest; or
(5) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the Appeals Council receives additional evidence that is new, material, and relates to the period on or before the date of the hearing decision, and there is a reasonable probability that the additional evidence would change the outcome of the decision.
(b) In reviewing decisions other than those based on an application for benefits, the Appeals Council will consider the evidence in the administrative law judge hearing record and any additional evidence it believes is material to an issue being considered. However, in reviewing decisions based on an application for benefits, the Appeals Council will only consider additional evidence under paragraph (a)(5) of this section if you show good cause for not informing us about or submitting the evidence as described in § 416.1435 because:
(1) Our action misled you;
(2) You had a physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation(s) that prevented you from informing us about or submitting the evidence earlier; or
(3) Some other unusual, unexpected, or unavoidable circumstance beyond your control prevented you from informing us about or submitting the evidence earlier. Examples include, but are not limited to:
(i) You were seriously ill, and your illness prevented you from contacting us in person, in writing, or through a friend, relative, or other person;
(ii) There was a death or serious illness in your immediate family;
(iii) Important records were destroyed or damaged by fire or other accidental cause;
(iv) You actively and diligently sought evidence from a source and the evidence was not received or was received less than 5 business days prior to the hearing; or
(v) You received a hearing level decision on the record and the Appeals Council reviewed your decision.
(c) If you submit additional evidence that does not relate to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision as required in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, or the Appeals Council does not find you had good cause for missing the deadline to submit the evidence in § 416.1435, the Appeals Council will send you a notice that explains why it did not accept the additional evidence and advises you of your right to file a new application. The notice will also advise you that if you file a new application within 60 days after the date of the Appeals Council's notice, your request for review will constitute a written statement indicating an intent to claim benefits under § 416.340. If you file a new application within 60 days of the Appeals Council's notice, we will use the date you requested Appeals Council review as the filing date for your new application.
[81 FR 90996, Dec. 16, 2016, as amended at 85 FR 73160, Nov. 16, 2020]
§ 416.1471
Dismissal by Appeals Council.
The Appeals Council will dismiss your request for review if you did not file your request within the stated period of time and the time for filing has not been extended. The Appeals Council may also dismiss any proceedings before it if—
(a) You and any other party to the proceedings files a written request for dismissal; or
(b) You die, there are no other parties, and we have no information to show that you may have a survivor who may be paid benefits due to you under § 416.542(b) and who wishes to pursue the request for review, or that you authorized interim assistance reimbursement to a State pursuant to section 1631(g) of the Act. The Appeals Council, however, will vacate a dismissal of the request for review if, within 60 days after the date of the dismissal:
(1) A person claiming to be your survivor, who may be paid benefits due to you under § 416.542(b), submits a written request for review, and shows that a decision on the issues that were to be considered on review may adversely affect him or her; or
(2) We receive information showing that you authorized interim assistance reimbursement to a State pursuant to section 1631(g) of the Act.

Notice of Appeals Council review.
When the Appeals Council decides to review a case, it shall mail a prior notice to all parties at their last known address stating the reasons for the review and the issues to be considered. However, when the Appeals Council plans to issue a decision that is fully favorable to all parties, plans to remand the case for further proceedings, or plans to issue a decision that is favorable in part and remand the remaining issues for further proceedings, it may send the notice of Appeals Council review to all parties with the decision or remand order.

§ 416.1474
Obtaining evidence from Appeals Council.
You may request and receive copies or a statement of the documents or other written evidence upon which the hearing decision or dismissal was based and a copy or summary of the transcript of oral evidence. However, you will be asked to pay the costs of providing these copies unless there is a good reason why you should not pay.
§ 416.1475
Filing briefs with the Appeals Council.

Procedures before the Appeals Council.
(a)
Limitation of issues.
The Appeals Council may limit the issues it considers if it notifies you and the other parties of the issues it will review.
(b)
Evidence the Appeals Council will exhibit.
The Appeals Council will evaluate all additional evidence it receives, but will only mark as an exhibit and make part of the official record additional evidence that it determines meets the requirements of § 416.1470(a)(5) and (b). If we need to file a certified administrative record in Federal court, we will include in that record all additional evidence the Appeals Council received during the administrative review process, including additional evidence that the Appeals Council received but did not exhibit or make part of the official record.
(c)
Oral argument.
You may request to appear before the Appeals Council to present oral argument in support of your request for review. The Appeals Council will grant your request if it decides that your case raises an important question of law or policy or that oral argument would help to reach a proper decision. If your request to appear is granted, the Appeals Council will tell you the time and place of the oral argument at least 10 business days before the scheduled date. The Appeals Council will determine whether your appearance will be by audio, agency video, online video, or in person as set forth in § 416.1436. The Appeals Council will determine whether any other person relevant to the proceeding will appear by audio, agency video, online video, or in person as set forth in § 416.1436(c)(2).

Any issues relating to the claim(s) may be considered by the Appeals Council or administrative law judge whether or not they were raised in the administrative proceedings leading to the final decision in the case.
(b)
Appeals Council decision without a hearing.
If the Appeals Council assumes responsibility under paragraph (a) of this section for issuing a decision without a hearing, it will follow the procedures explained in §§ 416.1473 and 416.1479.
(c)
Administrative appeals judge decision after holding a hearing.
If the Appeals Council assumes responsibility for issuing a decision and a hearing is necessary to complete adjudication of the claim(s), an administrative appeals judge will hold a hearing using the procedures set forth in §§ 416.1429 through 416.1461, as applicable.
(d)
Appeals Council dismissal.
After a Federal court remands a case to the
Commissioner for further consideration, the Appeals Council may dismiss the proceedings before it for any reason that an administrative law judge may dismiss a request for a hearing under § 416.1457. The Appeals Council will not dismiss the proceedings in a claim where we are otherwise required by law or a judicial order to file the Commissioner's additional and modified findings of fact and decision with a court.
(e)
Appeals Council remand.
If the Appeals Council remands a case under paragraph (a) of this section, it will follow the procedures explained in § 416.1477.
[85 FR 73160, Nov. 16, 2020]
§ 416.1484
Appeals Council review of hearing decision in a case remanded by a Federal court.
(a)
General.
In accordance with § 416.1483, when a case is remanded by a Federal court for further consideration and the Appeals Council remands the case to an administrative law judge, or an administrative appeals judge issues a decision pursuant to § 416.1483(c), the decision of the administrative law judge or administrative appeals judge will become the final decision of the Commissioner after remand on your case unless the Appeals Council assumes jurisdiction of the case. The Appeals Council may assume jurisdiction, using the standard set forth in § 416.1470, based on written exceptions to the decision which you file with the Appeals Council or based on its authority pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. If the Appeals Council assumes jurisdiction of the case, it will not dismiss the request for a hearing in a claim where we are otherwise required by law or a judicial order to file the Commissioner's additional and modified findings of fact and decision with a court.
(b)
You file exceptions disagreeing with the hearing decision.
(1) If you disagree with the hearing decision, in whole or in part, you may file exceptions to the decision with the Appeals Council. Exceptions may be filed by submitting a written statement to the Appeals Council setting forth your reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the administrative law judge or administrative appeals judge. The exceptions must be filed within 30 days of the date you receive the hearing decision or an extension of time in which to submit exceptions must be requested in writing within the 30-day period. A timely request for a 30-day extension will be granted by the Appeals Council. A request for an extension of more than 30 days should include a statement of reasons as to why you need the additional time.
(2) If written exceptions are timely filed, the Appeals Council will consider your reasons for disagreeing with the hearing decision and all the issues presented by your case. If the Appeals Council concludes that there is no reason to change the hearing decision, it will issue a notice to you addressing your exceptions and explaining why no change in the hearing decision is warranted. In this instance, the hearing decision is the final decision of the Commissioner after remand.
(3) When you file written exceptions to the hearing decision, the Appeals Council may assume jurisdiction at any time, even after the 60-day time period which applies when you do not file exceptions. If the Appeals Council assumes jurisdiction of your case, any issues relating to your claim may be considered by the Appeals Council whether or not they were raised in the administrative proceedings leading to the final decision in your case or subsequently considered by the administrative law judge or administrative appeals judge in the administrative proceedings following the court's remand order. The Appeals Council will either make a new, independent decision pursuant to § 416.1483(b) or § 416.1483(c), based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record that will be the final decision of the Commissioner after remand, dismiss the request for a hearing, or remand the case to an administrative law judge for further proceedings, including a new decision.
(c)
Appeals Council assumes jurisdiction without exceptions being filed.
Any time within 60 days after the date of the hearing decision, the Appeals Council may decide to assume jurisdiction of your case even though no written exceptions have been filed. Notice of this action will be mailed to all parties at their last known address. You will be
provided with the opportunity to file briefs or other written statements with the Appeals Council about the facts and law relevant to your case. After the Appeals Council receives the briefs or other written statements, or the time allowed (usually 30 days) for submitting them has expired, the Appeals Council will either make a new, independent decision pursuant to § 416.1483(b) or § 416.1483(c), based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record that will be the final decision of the Commissioner after remand, dismiss the request for a hearing, or remand the case to an administrative law judge for further proceedings, including a new decision.
(d)
Exceptions are not filed and the Appeals Council does not otherwise assume jurisdiction.
If no exceptions are filed and the Appeals Council does not assume jurisdiction of your case, the decision of the administrative law judge or administrative appeals judge becomes the final decision of the Commissioner after remand.
[85 FR 73160, Nov. 16, 2020]
§ 416.1485
Application of circuit court law.
The procedures which follow apply to administrative determinations or decisions on claims involving the application of circuit court law.
(a)
General.
We will apply a holding in a United States Court of Appeals decision that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations unless the Government seeks further judicial review of that decision or we relitigate the issue presented in the decision in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. We will apply the holding to claims at all levels of the administrative review process within the applicable circuit unless the holding, by its nature, applies only at certain levels of adjudication.
(b)
Issuance of an Acquiescence Ruling.
When we determine that a United States Court of Appeals holding conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations and the Government does not seek further judicial review or is unsuccessful on further review, we will issue a Social Security Acquiescence Ruling. The Acquiescence Ruling will describe the administrative case and the court decision, identify the issue(s) involved, and explain how we will apply the holding, including, as necessary, how the holding relates to other decisions within the applicable circuit. These Acquiescence Rulings will generally be effective on the date of their publication in the
Federal Register
and will apply to all determinations, redeterminations, and decisions made on or after that date unless an Acquiescence Ruling is rescinded as stated in paragraph (e) of this section. The process we will use when issuing an Acquiescence Ruling follows:
(1) We will release an Acquiescence Ruling for publication in the
Federal Register
for any precedential circuit court decision that we determine contains a holding that conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations no later than 120 days from the receipt of the court's decision. This timeframe will not apply when we decide to seek further judicial review of the circuit court decision or when coordination with the Department of Justice and/or other Federal agencies makes this timeframe no longer feasible.
(2) If we make a determination or decision on your claim between the date of a circuit court decision and the date we publish an Acquiescence Ruling, you may request application of the published Acquiescence Ruling to the prior determination or decision. You must demonstrate that application of the Acquiescence Ruling could change the prior determination or decision in your case. You may demonstrate this by submitting a statement that cites the Acquiescence Ruling or the holding or portion of a circuit court decision which could change the prior determination or decision in your case. If you can so demonstrate, we will readjudicate the claim in accordance with the Acquiescence Ruling at the level at which it was last adjudicated. Any readjudication will be limited to consideration of the issue(s) covered by the Acquiescence Ruling and any new determination or decision on readjudication will be subject to administrative and judicial review in accordance
with this subpart. Our denial of a request for readjudication will not be subject to further administrative or judicial review. If you file a request for readjudication within the 60-day appeal period and we deny that request, we shall extend the time to file an appeal on the merits of the claim to 60 days after the date that we deny the request for readjudication.
(3) After we receive a precedential circuit court decision and determine that an Acquiescence Ruling may be required, we will begin to identify those claims that are pending before us within the circuit and that might be subject to readjudication if an Acquiescence Ruling is subsequently issued. When an Acquiescence Ruling is published, we will send a notice to those individuals whose cases we have identified which may be affected by the Acquiescence Ruling. The notice will provide information about the Acquiescence Ruling and the right to request readjudication under that Acquiescence Ruling, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. It is not necessary for an individual to receive a notice in order to request application of an Acquiescence Ruling to his or her claim, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c)
Relitigation of court's holding after publication of an Acquiescence Ruling.
After we have published an Acquiescence Ruling to reflect a holding of a United States Court of Appeals on an issue, we may decide under certain conditions to relitigate that issue within the same circuit. We may relitigate only when the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section are met, and, in general, one of the events specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section occurs.
(1) Activating events:
(i) An action by both Houses of Congress indicates that a circuit court decision on which an Acquiescence Ruling was based was decided inconsistently with congressional intent, such as may be expressed in a joint resolution, an appropriations restriction, or enactment of legislation which affects a closely analogous body of law;
(ii) A statement in a majority opinion of the same circuit indicates that the court might no longer follow its previous decision if a particular issue were presented again;
(iii) Subsequent circuit court precedent in other circuits supports our interpretation of the Social Security Act or regulations on the issue(s) in question; or
(iv) A subsequent Supreme Court decision presents a reasonable legal basis for questioning a circuit court holding upon which we base an Acquiescence Ruling.
(2) The General Counsel of the Social Security Administration, after consulting with the Department of Justice, concurs that relitigation of an issue and application of our interpretation of the Social Security Act or regulations to selected claims in the administrative review process within the circuit would be appropriate.
(3) We publish a notice in the
Federal Register
that we intend to relitigate an Acquiescence Ruling issue and that we will apply our interpretation of the Social Security Act or regulations within the circuit to claims in the administrative review process selected for relitigation. The notice will explain why we made this decision.
(d)
Notice of relitigation.
When we decide to relitigate an issue, we will provide a notice explaining our action to all affected claimants. In adjudicating claims subject to relitigation, decisionmakers throughout the SSA administrative review process will apply our interpretation of the Social Security Act and regulations, but will also state in written determinations or decisions how the claims would have been decided under the circuit standard. Claims not subject to relitigation will continue to be decided under the Acquiescence Ruling in accordance with the circuit standard. So that affected claimants can be readily identified and any subsequent decision of the circuit court or the Supreme Court can be implemented quickly and efficiently, we will maintain a listing of all claimants who receive this notice and will provide them with the relief ordered by the court.
(e)
Rescission of an Acquiescence Ruling.
We will rescind as obsolete an Acquiescence Ruling and apply our interpretation of the Social Security Act or regulations by publishing a notice in
the
Federal Register
when any of the following events occurs:
(1) The Supreme Court overrules or limits a circuit court holding that was the basis of an Acquiescence Ruling;
(2) A circuit court overrules or limits itself on an issue that was the basis of an Acquiescence Ruling;
(3) A Federal law is enacted that removes the basis for the holding in a decision of a circuit court that was the subject of an Acquiescence Ruling; or
(4) We subsequently clarify, modify or revoke the regulation or ruling that was the subject of a circuit court holding that we determined conflicts with our interpretation of the Social Security Act or regulations, or we subsequently publish a new regulation(s) addressing an issue(s) not previously included in our regulations when that issue(s) was the subject of a circuit court holding that conflicted with our interpretation of the Social Security Act or regulations and that holding was not compelled by the statute or Constitution.
[63 FR 24933, May 6, 1998]

# Reopening and Revising Determinations and Decisions
§ 416.1487
Reopening and revising determinations and decisions.
(a)
General.
Generally, if you are dissatisfied with a determination or decision made in the administrative review process, but do not request further review within the stated time period, you lose your right to further review and that determination or decision becomes final. However, a determination or a decision made in your case which is otherwise final and binding may be reopened and revised by us.
(b)
Procedure for reopening and revision.
We may reopen a final determination or decision on our own initiative, or you may ask that a final determination or a decision to which you were a party be reopened. In either instance, if we reopen the determination or decision, we may revise that determination or decision. The conditions under which we may reopen a previous determination or decision, either on our own initiative or at your request, are explained in § 416.1488.
[59 FR 8535, Feb. 23, 1994]
§ 416.1488
Conditions for reopening.
A determination, revised determination, decision, or revised decision may be reopened—
(a) Within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination, for any reason;
(b) Within two years of the date of the notice of the initial determination if we find good cause, as defined in § 416.1489, to reopen the case; or
(c) At any time if it was obtained by fraud or similar fault. In determining whether a determination or decision was obtained by fraud or similar fault, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) which you may have had at the time.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 59 FR 1637, Jan. 12, 1994]
§ 416.1489
Good cause for reopening.
(a) We will find that there is good cause to reopen a determination or decision if—
(1) New and material evidence is furnished;
(2) A clerical error was made; or
(3) The evidence that was considered in making the determination or decision clearly shows on its face that an error was made.
(b) We will not find good cause to reopen your case if the only reason for reopening is a change of legal interpretation or administrative ruling upon which the determination or decision was made.
§ 416.1491
Late completion of timely investigation.
We may revise a determination or decision after the applicable time period in § 416.1488(a) or § 416.1488(b) expires if we begin an investigation into whether to revise the determination or decision before the applicable time period expires. We may begin the investigation either based on a request by you or by an action on our part. The investigation is a process of gathering facts after a determination or decision has been reopened to determine if a revision of the determination or decision is applicable.
(a) If we have diligently pursued the investigation to its conclusion, we may revise the determination or decision. The revision may be favorable or unfavorable to you. “Diligently pursued” means that in light of the facts and circumstances of a particular case, the necessary action was undertaken and carried out as promptly as the circumstances permitted. Diligent pursuit will be presumed to have been met if we conclude the investigation and if necessary, revise the determination or decision within 6 months from the date we began the investigation.
(b) If we have not diligently pursued the investigation to its conclusion, we will revise the determination or decision if a revision is applicable and if it will be favorable to you. We will not revise the determination or decision if it will be unfavorable to you.

§ 416.1492
Notice of revised determination or decision.
(a) When a determination or decision is revised, notice of the revision will be mailed to the parties at their last known address. The notice will state the basis for the revised determination or decision and the effect of the revision. The notice will also inform the parties of the right to further review.
(b) If a determination is revised and the revised determination requires that your benefits be suspended, reduced, or terminated, the notice will inform you of your right to continued payment (see § 416.1336 and the exceptions set out in § 416.1337) and of your right of reconsideration.
(c) If a determination is revised and the revised determination does not require that your benefits be suspended, reduced, or terminated, the notice will inform you of your right to a hearing before an administrative law judge.
(d) If a reconsidered determination that you are blind or disabled, based on medical factors, is reopened for the purpose of being revised, you will be notified, in writing, of the proposed revision and of your right to request that a disability hearing be held before a revised reconsidered determination is issued. If a revised reconsidered determination is issued, you may request a hearing before an administrative law judge.
(e) If an administrative law judge or the Appeals Council proposes to revise a decision, and the revision would be based on evidence not included in the record on which the prior decision was based, you and any other parties to the decision will be notified, in writing, of the proposed action and of your right to request that a hearing be held before any further action is taken. If a revised decision is issued by an administrative law judge, you and any other party may request that it be reviewed by the Appeals Council, or the Appeals Council may review the decision on its own initiative.
(f) If an administrative law judge or the Appeals Council proposes to revise a decision, and the revision would be based only on evidence included in the record on which the prior decision was based, you and any other parties to the decision will be notified, in writing, of the proposed action. If a revised decision is issued by an administrative law judge, you and any other party may request that it be reviewed by the Appeals Council, or the Appeals Council may review the decision on its own initiative.
(g) An administrative law judge may, in connection with a valid request for a hearing, propose to reopen an issue other than the issue on which the request for a hearing was based. The administrative law judge will follow the time limits for reopenings set out in § 416.1488. The administrative law judge shall mail to the parties at their last known address a notice of the reopening.
[45 FR 52096, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 308, Jan. 3, 1986]
§ 416.1493
Effect of revised determination or decision.
A revised determination or decision is binding unless—
(a) You or a party to the revised determination file a written request for a reconsideration or a hearing;
(b) You or another party to the revised decision file, as appropriate, a request for review by the Appeals Council or a hearing;
(c) The Appeals Council reviews the revised decision; or
(d) The revised determination or decision is further revised.
§ 416.1494
Time and place to request further review or a hearing on revised determination or decision.
You or another party to the revised determination or decision may request, as appropriate, further review or a hearing on the revision by filing a request in writing at one of our offices within 60 days after the date you receive notice of the revision. Further review or a hearing will be held on the revision according to the rules of this subpart.

# Payment of Certain Travel Expenses
§ 416.1495
Payment of certain travel expenses—general.
When you file a claim for supplemental security income (SSI) benefits, you may incur certain travel expenses in pursuing your claim. Sections 416.1496 through 416.1499 explain who may be reimbursed for travel expenses, the types of travel expenses that are reimbursable, and when and how to claim reimbursement. Generally, the agency that requests you to travel will be the agency that reimburses you. No later than when it notifies you of the examination or hearing described in § 416.1496(a), that agency will give you information about the right to travel reimbursement, the right to advance payment and how to request it, the rules on means of travel and unusual travel costs, and the need to submit receipts.
[51 FR 8810, Mar. 14, 1986]
§ 416.1496
Who may be reimbursed.
(a) The following individuals may be reimbursed for certain travel expenses—
(1) You, when you attend medical examinations upon request in connection with disability determinations; these are medical examinations requested by the State agency or by us when additional medical evidence is necessary to make a disability determination (also referred to as consultative examinations, see § 416.917);
(2) You, your representative (see § 416.1505 (a) and (b)), and all unsubpoenaed witnesses we or the State agency determines to be reasonably necessary who attend disability hearings; and
(3) You, your representative, and all unsubpoenaed witnesses we determine to be reasonably necessary who attend hearings on any claim for SSI benefits before an administrative law judge.
(b) Sections 416.1495 through 416.1499 do not apply to subpoenaed witnesses. They are reimbursed under §§ 416.1450(d) and 416.1416(b)(1).
[51 FR 8810, Mar. 14, 1986]
§ 416.1498
What travel expenses are reimbursable.
Reimbursable travel expenses include the ordinary expenses of public or private transportation as well as unusual costs due to special circumstances.
(a) Reimbursement for ordinary travel expenses is limited—
(1) To the cost of travel by the most economical and expeditious means of transportation available and appropriate to the individual's condition of health as determined by the State agency or by us, considering the available means in the following order—
(i) Common carrier (air, rail, or bus);
(ii) Privately owned vehicles;
(iii) Commercially rented vehicles and other special conveyances;
(2) If air travel is necessary, to the coach fare for air travel between the specified travel points involved unless first-class air travel is authorized in advance by the State agency or by the Secretary in instances when—
(i) Space is not available in less-than-first-class accommodations on any scheduled flights in time to accomplish the purpose of the travel;
(ii) First-class accommodations are necessary because you, your representative, or reasonably necessary witness is so handicapped or otherwise impaired that other accommodations are not practical and the impairment is substantiated by competent medical authority;
(iii) Less-than-first-class accommodations on foreign carriers do not provide adequate sanitation or health standards; or
(iv) The use of first-class accommodations would result in an overall savings to the government based on economic considerations, such as the avoidance of additional subsistence
costs that would be incurred while awaiting availability of less-than-first-class accommodations.
(b) Unusual travel costs may be reimbursed but must be authorized in advance and in writing by us or the appropriate State official, as applicable, unless they are unexpected or unavoidable; we or the State agency must determine their reasonableness and necessity and must approve them before payment can be made. Unusual expenses that may be covered in connection with travel include, but are not limited to—
(1) Ambulance services;
(2) Attendant services;
(3) Meals;
(4) Lodging; and
(5) Taxicabs.
(c) If we reimburse you for travel, we apply the rules in §§ 416.1496 through 416.1499 and the same rates and conditions of payment that govern travel expenses for Federal employees as authorized under 41 CFR chapter 301. If a State agency reimburses you, the reimbursement rates shall be determined by the rules in §§ 416.1496 through 416.1499 and that agency's rules and regulations and may differ from one agency to another and also may differ from the Federal reimbursement rates.
(1) When public transportation is used, reimbursement will be made for the actual costs incurred, subject to the restrictions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section on reimbursement for first-class air travel.
(2) When travel is by a privately owned vehicle, reimbursement will be made at the current Federal or State mileage rate specified for that geographic location plus the actual costs of tolls and parking, if travel by a privately owned vehicle is determined appropriate under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Otherwise, the amount of reimbursement for travel by privately owned vehicle cannot exceed the total cost of the most economical public transportation for travel between the same two points. “Total cost” includes the cost for all the authorized travelers who travel in the same privately owned vehicle. Advance approval of travel by privately owned vehicle is not required (but could give you assurance of its approval).
(3) Sometimes your health condition dictates a mode of transportation different from most economical and expeditious. In order for your health to require a mode of transportation other than common carrier or passenger car, you must be so handicapped or otherwise impaired as to require special transportation arrangements and the condition must be substantiated by competent medical authority.
(d) For travel to a hearing—
(1) Reimbursement is limited to travel within the U.S. For this purpose, the U.S. includes the U.S. as defined in § 416.120(c)(10).
(2) When the travel is performed after September 30, 1981, we or the State agency will reimburse you, your representative, or an unsubpoenaed witness only if the distance from the person's residence or office (whichever he or she travels from) to the hearing site exceeds 75 miles.
(3) For travel expenses incurred on or after April 1, 1991, the amount of reimbursement under this section for travel by your representative to attend a disability hearing or a hearing before an administrative law judge shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable under this section for travel to the hearing site from any point within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing.
(i) The geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing means, as appropriate—
(A) The designated geographic service area of the State agency adjudicatory unit having responsibility for providing the disability hearing;
(B) If a Federal disability hearing officer holds the disability hearing, the geographic area of the State (as defined in § 416.120(c)(9)) in which the claimant resides or, if the claimant is not a resident of a State, in which the hearing officer holds the disability hearing; or
(C) The designated geographic service area of the Office of Hearings Operations hearing office having responsibility for providing the hearing.
(ii) We or the State agency determine the maximum amount allowable for travel by a representative based on the distance to the hearing site from the farthest point within the appropriate
geographic area. In determining the maximum amount allowable for travel between these two points, we or the State agency apply the rules in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section and the limitations in paragraph (d) (1) and (4) of this section. If the distance between these two points does not exceed 75 miles, we or the State agency will not reimburse any of your representative's travel expenses.
(4) If a change in the location of the hearing is made at your request from the location we or the State agency selected to one farther from your residence or office, neither your additional travel expenses nor the additional travel expenses of your representative and witnesses will be reimbursed.
[51 FR 8810, Mar. 14, 1986, as amended at 59 FR 8532, Feb. 23, 1994; 85 FR 73161, Nov. 16, 2020]
§ 416.1499
When and how to claim reimbursement.
(a)(1) Generally, you will be reimbursed for your expenses after your trip. However, travel advances may be authorized if you request prepayment and show that the requested advance is reasonable and necessary.
(2) You must submit to us or the State agency, as appropriate, an itemized list of what you spent and supporting receipts to be reimbursed.
(3) Arrangements for special means of transportation and related unusual costs may be made only if we or the State agency authorizes the costs in writing in advance of travel, unless the costs are unexpected or unavoidable. If they are unexpected or unavoidable we or the State agency must determine their reasonableness and necessity and must approve them before payment may be made.
(4) If you receive prepayment, you must, within 20 days after your trip, provide to us or the State agency, as appropriate, an itemized list of your actual travel costs and submit supporting receipts. We or the State agency will require you to pay back any balance of the advanced amount that exceeds any approved travel expenses within 20 days after you are notified of the amount of that balance. (State agencies may have their own time limits in place of the 20-day periods in the preceding two sentences.)
(b) You may claim reimbursable travel expenses incurred by your representative for which you have been billed by your representative, except that if your representative makes a claim for them to us or the State, he or she will be reimbursed directly.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0960-0434)

§ 416.1500
Introduction.
You may appoint someone to represent you in any of your dealings with us. This subpart explains, among other things—
(a) Who may be your representative and what his or her qualifications must be;
(b) How you appoint a representative;
(c) The payment of fees to a representative;
(d) Our rules that representatives must follow; and
(e) What happens to a representative who breaks the rules.
§ 416.1503
Definitions.
As used in this subpart:
Affiliate
means to associate with an entity through our prescribed registration process.
Assignment
means the transfer of the right to receive direct payment of an authorized fee to an entity as described in § 416.1530(e).
Date we notify him or her
means 5 days after the date on the notice, unless the recipient shows us that he or she did not receive it within the 5-day period.
Eligible non-attorney
means a non-attorney representative who we determine is qualified to receive direct payment of his or her fee under § 416.1517(a).
Entity
means any business, firm, or other association, including but not
limited to partnerships, corporations, for-profit organizations, and not-for-profit organizations.
Federal agency
refers to any authority of the Executive branch of the Government of the United States.
Federal program
refers to any program established by an Act of Congress or administered in whole or in part by a Federal agency.
Legal guardian or court-appointed representative
means a court-appointed person, committee, or conservator who is responsible for taking care of and managing the property and rights of an individual who is considered incapable of managing his or her own affairs.

We then reduce that figure by the amount of any reduction of title II or title XVI benefits that was required by section 1127. We do this whether the actual offset, as provided under section 1127, reduced the title II or title XVI benefits. Past-due benefits do not include:
(1) Continued benefits paid pursuant to § 416.996 of this part;
(2) Continued benefits paid pursuant to § 416.1336(b) of this part; or
(3) Interim benefits paid pursuant to section 1631(a)(8) of the Act.

If an applicant timely submits the application fee and a defective application, we will give the applicant 10 calendar days after the date we notify him or her of the defect to correct the application.
(c)
Application fee.
An applicant must timely submit his or her application fee during the application period. We will set the fee annually.
(1) We will refund the fee if:
(i) We do not administer an examination, and an applicant was unable to take the rescheduled examination; or
(ii) Circumstances beyond the applicant's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated and planned for prevent an applicant from taking a scheduled examination.
(2) We will not refund the fee if:
(i) An applicant took and failed the examination; or
(ii) An applicant failed to arrive on time for the examination because of circumstances within the applicant's control that could have been anticipated and planned for.
(d)
Protest procedures.
(1) We may find that a non-attorney representative is ineligible to receive direct fee payment at any time because he or she fails to meet any of the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. A non-attorney representative whom we find to be ineligible for direct fee payment may protest our finding only if we based it on the representative's failure to:
(i) Attest on the application or provide sufficient documentation that he or she possesses the required education or equivalent qualifications, as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section;
(ii) Meet at all times the criminal background investigation criteria, as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section;

(iv) Complete continuing education courses or provide documentation of the required continuing education courses, as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
(2) A non-attorney representative who wants to protest our finding under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must file a protest in writing and provide all relevant supporting documentation to us within 10 calendar days after the
date we notify him or her of our finding.
(3) A representative may not file a protest for reasons other than those listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If a representative files a protest for reasons other than those listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, we will not process the protest and will implement our finding as if no protest had been filed. Our finding in response to the protest is final and not subject to further review.
(e)
Ineligibility and suspension.
(1) If an applicant does not protest, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, our finding about the criteria in paragraphs (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section, the applicant will be either ineligible to take the written examination for which he or she applied or ineligible to receive direct fee payment if the applicant already took and passed the examination prior to our finding. If an applicant protests in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section and we uphold our finding, the applicant will be either ineligible to take the written examination for which he or she applied or ineligible to receive direct fee payment if the applicant already took and passed the examination prior to our finding.
(2) If an eligible non-attorney representative does not protest, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, our finding about the criteria in paragraphs (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section, the non-attorney representative will be ineligible to receive direct fee payment beginning with the month after the month the protest period ends. If the eligible non-attorney representative protests in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section and we uphold our finding, the non-attorney representative will be ineligible to receive direct fee payment beginning with the month after the month we uphold our finding.
(3) If an eligible non-attorney representative does not protest, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, our finding about the criteria in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the non-attorney representative will be ineligible to receive direct fee payment for 6 full calendar months beginning with the month after the month the protest period ends. If the eligible non-attorney representative protests in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section and we uphold our finding, the non-attorney representative will be ineligible to receive direct fee payment for 6 full calendar months beginning with the month after the month we uphold our finding. In either case, the non-attorney representative may provide us with documentation that he or she has acquired and maintains the required liability insurance coverage described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, no earlier than the sixth month of the ineligibility. The non-attorney representative will again be eligible to receive direct fee payment beginning in the first month after the month we find that we have received sufficient documentation that the non-attorney representative meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
(4) If an eligible non-attorney representative does not protest, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, our finding about the criteria in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the non-attorney representative will be ineligible to receive direct fee payment for 6 full calendar months beginning with the month after the month the protest period ends. If the eligible non-attorney representative protests in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section and we uphold our finding, the non-attorney will be ineligible to receive direct fee payment for 6 full calendar months beginning with the month after the month we uphold our finding. In either case, the non-attorney representative may provide us with documentation that he or she has satisfied the criteria in paragraph (a)(7) of this section at any time. The non-attorney representative will again be eligible to receive direct fee payment beginning in the first month after the month we find that we have received sufficient documentation, but not earlier than the month following the end of the 6 month ineligibility period.
(f)
Reapplying.
A representative may reapply to become eligible to receive direct fee payment under paragraph (a) of this section during any subsequent application period if he or she:
(1) Did not meet the initial criteria for eligibility in paragraph (a)(1), (2),
(3), or (5) of this section in a prior application period; or
(2) Failed to timely correct a defective application in a prior application period as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

[45 FR 52106, Aug. 5, 1980, as amended at 72 FR 16725, Apr. 5, 2007; 74 FR 48384, Sept. 23, 2009; 76 FR 45195, July 28, 2011; 89 FR 67555, Aug. 21, 2024]
§ 416.1525
Request for approval of a fee.
(a)
Filing a request.
In order for your representative to obtain approval of a fee for services he or she performed in dealings with us, he or she shall file a written request with one of our offices. This should be done after the proceedings in which he or she was a representative are completed. The request must contain—
(1) The dates the representative's services began and ended;
(2) A list of the services he or she gave and the amount of time he or she spent on each type of service;
(3) The amount of the fee he or she wants to charge for the services;
(4) The amount of fee the representative wants to request or charge for his or her services in the same matter before any State or Federal court;
(5) The amount of and a list of any expenses the representative incurred for which he or she has been paid or expects to be paid;
(6) A description of the special qualifications which enabled the representative, if he or she is not an attorney, to give valuable help to you in connection with your claim; and
(7) A statement showing that the representative sent a copy of the request for approval of a fee to you.
(b)
Evaluating a request for approval of a fee.
(1) When we evaluate a representative's request for approval of a fee, we consider the purpose of the supplemental security income program, which is to assure a minimum level of income for the beneficiaries of the program, together with—
(i) The extent and type of services the representative performed;
(ii) The complexity of the case;
(iii) The level of skill and competence required of the representative in giving the services;
(iv) The amount of time the representative spent on the case;
(v) The results the representative achieved;
(vi) The level of review to which the claim was taken and the level of the review at which the representative became your representative; and
(vii) The amount of fee the representative requests for his or her services, including any amount authorized or requested before, but not including the amount of any expenses he or she incurred.
(2) Although we consider the amount of benefits, if any, that are payable, we do not base the amount of fee we authorize on the amount of the benefit alone, but on a consideration of all the factors listed in this section. The benefits payable in any claim are determined by specific provisions of law and are unrelated to the efforts of the representative. We may authorize a fee even if no benefits are payable.
§ 416.1528
Proceedings before a State or Federal court.
(a)
Representation of a party in court proceedings.
We shall not consider any service the representative gave you in
any proceeding before a State or Federal court to be services as a representative in dealings with us. However, if the representative also has given service to you in the same connection in any dealings with us, he or she must specify what, if any, portion of the fee he or she wants to charge is for services performed in dealings with us. If the representative charges any fee for those services, he or she must file the request and furnish all of the information required by § 416.1525.
(b)
Attorney fee allowed by a Federal court.
If a Federal court in any proceeding under title XVI of the Act makes a judgment in favor of the claimant who was represented before the court by an attorney, and the court, under section 1631(d)(2) of the Act, allows to the attorney as part of its judgment a fee not in excess of 25 percent of the total of past-due benefits to which the claimant is eligible by reason of the judgment, we may pay the attorney the amount of the fee out of, but not in addition to, the amount of the past-due benefits payable. We will not pay directly any other fee your representative may request.
[72 FR 16725, Apr. 5, 2007]
§ 416.1530
Payment of fees.
(a)
Fees allowed by a Federal court.
We will pay an attorney representative out of your past-due benefits the amount of the fee allowed by a Federal court in a proceeding under title XVI of the Act. The payment we make to the attorney is subject to the limitations described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(b)
Fees we may pay
—(1)
Attorneys and eligible non-attorneys.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if we make a determination or decision in your favor and you were represented by an attorney or an eligible non-attorney (see § 416.1517), and as a result of the determination or decision you have past-due benefits;
(i) We will pay your representative out of the past-due benefits the smallest of the amounts in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) through (v) of this section, less the amount of the assessment described in paragraph (d) of this section, unless the representative files a waiver of the fee or direct payment of the fee; and
(ii) If there is a valid assignment (see paragraph (e) of this section), we will pay the representative's fee (see paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) to an entity.
(iii) Twenty-five percent of the total of the past-due benefits, as determined before any payment to a State (or political subdivision) to reimburse the State (or political subdivision) for interim assistance furnished you, as described in § 416.525 of this part, and reduced by the amount of any reduction in benefits under this title or title II pursuant to section 1127 of the Act;
(iv) The amount of past-due benefits remaining after we pay to a State (or political subdivision) an amount sufficient to reimburse the State (or political subdivision) for interim assistance furnished you, as described in § 416.525 of this part, and after any applicable reductions under section 1127 of the Act; or
(v) The amount of the fee that we set.
(2)
Non-attorneys ineligible for direct payment.
If the representative is a non-attorney who is ineligible to receive direct payment of his or her fee, we assume no responsibility for the payment of any fee that we authorized. We will not deduct the fee from your past-due benefits.
(c)
Time limit for filing request for approval of fee to obtain direct payment.
(1) To receive direct fee payment from your past-due benefits, a representative who is an attorney or an eligible non-attorney should file a request for approval of a fee, or written notice of the intent to file a request, at one of our offices, or electronically at the times and in the manner that we prescribe if we give notice that such a method is available, within 60 days of the date we mail the notice of the favorable determination or decision.
(2)(i) If no request is filed within 60 days of the date the notice of the favorable determination is mailed, we will mail a written notice to you and your representative at your last known addresses. The notice will inform you and the representative that unless the representative files, within 20 days from the date of the notice, a written request for approval of a fee under § 416.1525, or a written request for an
extension of time, we will pay all the past-due benefits to you.
(ii) The representative must send you a copy of any request made to us for an extension of time. If the request is not filed within 20 days of the date of the notice, or by the last day of any extension we approved, we will pay to you all past-due benefits remaining after we reimburse the State for any interim assistance you received. We must approve any fee the representative charges after that time, but the collection of any approved fee is a matter between you and the representative.
(d)
Assessment when we pay a fee directly to a representative.
(1) Whenever we pay a fee directly to a representative from past-due benefits, we impose an assessment on the representative.
(2) The amount of the assessment is equal to the lesser of:
(i) The product we obtain by multiplying the amount of the fee we are paying to the representative by the percentage rate the Commissioner of Social Security determines is necessary to achieve full recovery of the costs of determining and paying fees directly to representatives, but not in excess of 6.3 percent; and
(ii) The maximum assessment amount. The maximum assessment amount was initially set at $75, but by law is adjusted annually to reflect the increase in the cost of living. (See §§ 404.270 through 404.277 for an explanation of how the cost-of-living adjustment is computed.) If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $1, we round down the amount to the next lower $1, but the amount will not be less than $75. We will announce any increase in the maximum assessment amount, and explain how that increase was determined in the
Federal Register.
(3) We collect the assessment by subtracting it from the amount of the fee to be paid to the representative. The representative who is subject to an assessment may not, directly or indirectly, request or otherwise obtain reimbursement of the assessment from you.
(e)
Assignment of direct payment of a fee to designated entity.
(1) A representative may assign direct payment of the fee we authorize to an eligible entity if the representative:
(i) Is eligible for direct payment;
(ii) Has not waived the fee or direct payment;
(iii) Assigns direct payment of the entire fee we authorize to one entity in the manner we prescribe;
(iv) Makes the assignment before the date on which we notify you of our first favorable determination or decision; and
(v) Affiliates with the entity through registration.
(2) A representative may rescind an assignment in the manner we prescribe before the date on which we notify you of our first favorable determination or decision.
(3) A representative may not assign direct payment of a fee to an entity that is ineligible to receive direct payment.
(4) A representative may not waive a fee or direct payment of a fee if the representative previously assigned direct payment of a fee in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section and did not timely rescind that assignment in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(f)
Effective dates for extension of direct payment of fee to attorneys.
The provisions of this subpart authorizing the direct payment of fees to attorneys and the withholding of title XVI benefits for that purpose, apply in claims for benefits with respect to which the agreement for representation is entered into before March 1, 2010.

(vii) Any other factors showing how the claimant's impairment(s) affects his or her ability to work. In §§ 416.960 through 416.969a, we discuss in more detail the evidence we need when we consider vocational factors.
(3) Conduct his or her dealings in a manner that furthers the efficient, fair, and orderly conduct of the administrative decision-making process, including duties to:
(i) Provide competent representation to a claimant. Competent representation requires the knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. A representative must know the significant issue(s) in a claim, have reasonable and adequate familiarity with the evidence in the case, and have a working knowledge of the applicable provisions of the Social Security Act, as amended, the regulations, the Social Security Rulings, and any other applicable provisions of law.
(ii) Act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a claimant. This includes providing prompt and responsive answers to our requests for information pertinent to processing of the claim.
(iii) When requested, provide us, in a manner we specify, potential dates and times that the representative will be available for a hearing. We will inform the representative how many potential dates and times we require to coordinate the hearing schedule.
(iv) Only withdraw representation at a time and in a manner that does not disrupt the processing or adjudication of a claim and that provides the claimant adequate time to find new representation, if desired. A representative should not withdraw after we set the time and place for the hearing (see § 416.1436) unless the representative can show that a withdrawal is necessary due to extraordinary circumstances, as we determine on a case-by-case basis.
(v) Maintain prompt and timely communication with the claimant, which
includes, but is not limited to, reasonably informing the claimant of all matters concerning the representation, consulting with the claimant on an ongoing basis during the entire representational period, and promptly responding to a claimant's reasonable requests for information. When we evaluate whether a representative has maintained prompt and timely communication with the claimant, we will consider the difficulty the representative has in locating a particular claimant (e.g., because the claimant is homeless) and the representative's efforts to keep that claimant informed.
(4) Conduct business with us electronically at the times and in the manner we prescribe on matters for which the representative requests direct fee payment. (
See
§ 416.1513).
(5) Disclose in writing, at the time a medical or vocational opinion is submitted to us or as soon as the representative is aware of the submission to us, if:
(i) The representative's employee or any individual contracting with the representative drafted, prepared, or issued the medical or vocational opinion; or
(ii) The representative referred or suggested that the claimant seek an examination from, treatment by, or the assistance of, the individual providing opinion evidence.
(6) Disclose to us immediately if the representative discovers that his or her services are or were used by the claimant to commit fraud against us.
(7) Disclose to us whether the representative is or has been disbarred or suspended from any bar or court to which he or she was previously admitted to practice, including instances in which a bar or court took administrative action to disbar or suspend the representative in lieu of disciplinary proceedings (e.g., acceptance of voluntary resignation pending disciplinary action). If the disbarment or suspension occurs after the appointment of the representative, the representative will immediately disclose the disbarment or suspension to us.
(8) Disclose to us whether the representative is or has been disqualified from participating in or appearing before any Federal program or agency, including instances in which a Federal program or agency took administrative action to disqualify the representative in lieu of disciplinary proceedings (e.g., acceptance of voluntary resignation pending disciplinary action). If the disqualification occurs after the appointment of the representative, the representative will immediately disclose the disqualification to us.
(9) Disclose to us whether the representative has been removed from practice or suspended by a professional licensing authority for reasons that reflect on the person's character, integrity, judgment, reliability, or fitness to serve as a fiduciary. If the removal or suspension occurs after the appointment of the representative, the representative will immediately disclose the removal or suspension to us.
(10) Ensure that all of the representative's employees, assistants, partners, contractors, or any person assisting the representative on claims for which the representative has been appointed, comply with these rules of conduct and standards of responsibility for representatives, when the representative has managerial or supervisory authority over these individuals or otherwise has responsibility to oversee their work. This includes a duty to take remedial action when:
(i) The representative's employees, assistants, partners, contractors or other individuals' conduct violates these rules of conduct and standards of responsibility; and
(ii) The representative has reason to believe a violation of these rules of conduct and standards of responsibility occurred or will occur.
(c)
Prohibited actions.
A representative must not:
(1) In any manner or by any means threaten, coerce, intimidate, deceive or knowingly mislead a claimant, or prospective claimant or beneficiary, regarding benefits or other rights under the Act. This prohibition includes misleading a claimant, or prospective claimant or beneficiary, about the representative's services and qualifications.
(2) Knowingly charge, collect or retain, or make any arrangement to charge, collect or retain, from any source, directly or indirectly, any fee
for representational services in violation of applicable law or regulation. This prohibition includes soliciting any gift or any other item of value, other than what is authorized by law.
(3) Make or present, or participate in the making or presentation of, false or misleading oral or written statements, evidence, assertions, or representations about a material fact or law concerning a matter within our jurisdiction, in matters where the representative knows or should have known that those statements, evidence, assertions or representations are false or misleading.
(4) Through his or her own actions or omissions, unreasonably delay or cause to be delayed, without good cause (see § 416.1411(b)), the processing of a claim at any stage of the administrative decision-making process.
(5) Divulge, without the claimant's consent, except as may be authorized by regulations prescribed by us or as otherwise provided by Federal law, any information we furnish or disclose about a claim or prospective claim.
(6) Attempt to influence, directly or indirectly, the outcome of a decision, determination, or other administrative action by any means prohibited by law, or offering or granting a loan, gift, entertainment, or anything of value to a presiding official, agency employee, or witness who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the administrative decision-making process, except as reimbursement for legitimately incurred expenses or lawful compensation for the services of an expert witness retained on a non-contingency basis to provide evidence.
(7) Engage in actions or behavior prejudicial to the fair and orderly conduct of administrative proceedings, including but not limited to:
(i) Repeated absences from or persistent tardiness at scheduled proceedings without good cause (see § 416.1411(b));
(ii) Behavior that has the effect of improperly disrupting proceedings or obstructing the adjudicative process, including but not limited to:
(A) Directing threatening or intimidating language, gestures, or actions at a presiding official, witness, contractor, or agency employee;
(B) Providing misleading information or misrepresenting facts that affect how we process a claim, including, but not limited to, information relating to the claimant's work activity or the claimant's place of residence or mailing address in matters where the representative knows or should have known that the information was misleading and the facts would constitute a misrepresentation; and
(C) Communicating with agency staff or adjudicators outside the normal course of business or other prescribed procedures in an attempt to inappropriately influence the processing or outcome of a claim(s).
(8) Violate any section of the Act for which a criminal or civil monetary penalty is prescribed.
(9) Refuse to comply with any of our rules or regulations.
(10) Suggest, assist, or direct another person to violate our rules or regulations.
(11) Advise any claimant or beneficiary not to comply with any of our rules or regulations.
(12) Knowingly assist a person whom we suspended or disqualified to provide representational services in a proceeding under title XVI of the Act, or to exercise the authority of a representative described in § 416.1510.
(13) Fail to comply with our sanction(s) decision.
(14) Fail to oversee the representative's employees, assistants, partners, contractors, or any other person assisting the representative on claims for which the representative has been appointed when the representative has managerial or supervisory authority over these individuals or otherwise has responsibility to oversee their work.
(15) While serving as a point of contact for an entity, violate applicable affirmative duties, engage in prohibited actions, or conduct dealings with us in a manner that is untruthful or does not further the efficient and prompt correction of a fee error.

§ 416.1545
Violations of our requirements, rules, or standards.
When we have evidence that a representative fails to meet our qualification requirements or has violated the rules governing dealings with us, we may begin proceedings to suspend or disqualify that individual from acting in a representational capacity before us.

(c) Has been convicted of a violation under section 1631(d) of the Act;

(f) Who, as a non-attorney, has been removed from practice or suspended by a professional licensing authority for reasons that reflect on the person's character, integrity, judgment, reliability, or fitness to serve as a fiduciary.

(a) The General Counsel or other delegated official will prepare a notice containing a statement of charges that constitutes the basis for the proceeding against the representative.
(b) We will send this notice to the representative either by certified or registered mail, to his or her last known address, or by personal delivery.
(c) We will advise the representative to file an answer, within 14 business days from the date of the notice, or from the date the notice was delivered personally, stating why he or she should not be suspended or disqualified from acting as a representative in dealings with us.
(d) The General Counsel or other delegated official may extend the 14-day period specified in paragraph (c) of this section for good cause in accordance with § 416.1411.

§ 416.1555
Withdrawing charges against a representative.
The General Counsel or other delegated official may withdraw charges against a representative. We will withdraw charges if the representative files an answer, or we obtain evidence, that satisfies us that we should not suspend or disqualify the representative from acting as a representative. When we consider withdrawing charges brought under § 416.1545(d) through (f) based on the representative's assertion that, before or after our filing of charges, the representative has been reinstated to practice by the court, bar, or Federal program or Federal agency that suspended, disbarred, or disqualified the representative, the General Counsel or other delegated official will determine whether such reinstatement occurred, whether it remains in effect, and whether he or she is reasonably satisfied that the representative will in the future act in accordance with the provisions of section 206(a) of the Act and our rules and regulations. If the representative proves that reinstatement occurred and remains in effect and the General Counsel or other delegated official is so satisfied, the General Counsel or other delegated official will
withdraw those charges. The action of the General Counsel or other delegated official regarding withdrawal of charges is solely that of the General Counsel or other delegated official and is not reviewable, or subject to consideration in decisions made under §§ 416.1570 and 416.1590. If we withdraw the charges, we will notify the representative by mail at the representative's last known address.
[83 FR 30859, July 2, 2018]
§ 416.1565
Hearing on charges.
(a)
Holding the hearing.
If the General Counsel or other delegated official does not take action to withdraw the charges within 15 days after the date on which the representative filed an answer, we will hold a hearing and make a decision on the charges.
(b)
Hearing officer.
(1) The Deputy Commissioner for the Office of Hearings Operations or other delegated official will assign an administrative law judge, designated to act as a hearing officer, to hold a hearing on the charges.
(2) No hearing officer shall hold a hearing in a case in which he or she is prejudiced or partial about any party, or has any interest in the matter.
(3) If the representative or any party to the hearing objects to the hearing officer who has been named to hold the hearing, we must be notified at the earliest opportunity. The hearing officer shall consider the objection(s) and either proceed with the hearing or withdraw from it.
(4) If the hearing officer withdraws from the hearing, another one will be named.
(5) If the hearing officer does not withdraw, the representative or any other person objecting may, after the hearing, present his or her objections to the Appeals Council explaining why he or she believes the hearing officer's decision should be revised or a new hearing held by another administrative law judge designated to act as a hearing officer.
(c)
Time and place of hearing.
The hearing officer shall mail the parties a written notice of the hearing at their last known addresses, at least 14 calendar days before the date set for the hearing. The notice will inform the parties whether the appearance of the parties or any witnesses will be in person, by video teleconferencing, or by telephone. The notice will also include requirements and instructions for filing motions, requesting witnesses, and entering exhibits.
(d)
Change of time and place for hearing.
(1) The hearing officer may change the time and place for the hearing, either on his or her own initiative, or at the request of the representative or the other party to the hearing. The hearing officer will not consider objections to the manner of appearance of parties or witnesses, unless the party shows good cause not to appear in the prescribed manner. To determine whether good cause exists for extending the deadline, we use the standards explained in § 416.1411.
(2) The hearing officer may adjourn or postpone the hearing.
(3) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the hearing officer may reopen the hearing for the receipt of additional evidence at any time before mailing notice of the decision.

(f)
Subpoenas.
(1) The representative or the other party to the hearing may request the hearing officer to issue a subpoena for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and for the production of books, records, correspondence, papers, or other documents that are material to any matter being considered at the hearing. The hearing officer may, on his or her own, initiative, issue subpoenas for the same purposes when the action is reasonably necessary for the full presentation of the facts.
(2) The representative or the other party who wants a subpoena issued shall file a written request with the hearing officer. This must be done at least 5 days before the date set for the
hearing. The request must name the documents to be produced, and describe the address or location in enough detail to permit the witnesses or documents to be found.
(3) The representative or the other party who wants a subpoena issued shall state in the request for a subpoena the material facts that he or she expects to establish by the witness or document, and why the facts could not be established by the use of other evidence which could be obtained without use of a subpoena.
(4) We will pay the cost of the issuance and the fees and mileage of any witness subpoenaed, as provided in section 205(d) of the Act.
(g)
Conduct of the hearing.

The hearing officer will give the representative and the other party a reasonable amount of time to submit any evidence and to file briefs or other written statements as to fact and law prior to deciding the motion. If the hearing officer concludes that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a decision as a matter of law, the hearing officer may grant the motion and issue a decision in accordance with the provisions of § 416.1570.
(2) If the representative did not file an answer to the charges, he or she has no right to present evidence at the hearing. The hearing officer may make or recommend a decision on the basis of the record, or permit the representative to present a statement about the sufficiency of the evidence or the validity of the proceedings upon which the suspension or disqualification, if it occurred, would be based.
(3) The hearing officer will make the hearing open to the representative, to the other party, and to any persons the hearing officer or the parties consider necessary or proper. The hearing officer will inquire fully into the matters being considered, hear the testimony of witnesses, and accept any documents that are material.
(4) The hearing officer has the right to decide the order in which the evidence and the allegations will be presented and the conduct of the hearing.
(h)
Evidence.
The hearing officer may accept evidence at the hearing, even though it is not admissible under the rules of evidence that apply to Federal court procedure.
(i)
Witnesses.
Witnesses who testify at the hearing shall do so under oath or affirmation. Either the representative or a person representing him or her may question the witnesses. The other party and that party's representative must also be allowed to question the witnesses. The hearing officer may also ask questions as considered necessary, and shall rule upon any objection made by either party about whether any question is proper.
(j)
Oral and written summation.

(m)
Failure to appear.
If the representative or the other party to the hearing fails to appear after being notified of the time and place, the hearing officer may hold the hearing anyway so that the party present may offer evidence to sustain or rebut the charges. The hearing officer shall give the party who failed to appear an opportunity to show good cause for failure to appear. If the party fails to show good cause, he or she is considered to have waived the right to be present at the hearing. If the party shows good cause, the hearing officer may hold a supplemental hearing.

The hearing officer may dismiss the charges in the event of the death of the representative.

§ 416.1570
Decision by hearing officer.
(a)
General.
(1) After the close of the hearing, the hearing officer will issue a decision or certify the case to the Appeals Council. The decision must be in writing, will contain findings of fact and conclusions of law, and be based upon the evidence of record.
(2) In deciding whether a person has been, by reason of misconduct, disbarred or suspended by a court or bar, or disqualified from participating in or appearing before any Federal program or Federal agency, the hearing officer will consider the reasons for the disbarment, suspension, or disqualification action. If the action was taken for solely administrative reasons (e.g., failure to pay dues or to complete continuing legal education requirements), that will not disqualify the person from acting as a representative before us. However, this exception to disqualification does not apply if the administrative action was taken in lieu of disciplinary proceedings (e.g., acceptance of a voluntary resignation pending disciplinary action). Although the hearing officer will consider whether the disbarment, suspension, or disqualification action is based on misconduct when deciding whether a person should be disqualified from acting as a representative before us, the hearing officer will not re-examine or revise the factual or legal conclusions that led to the disbarment, suspension, or disqualification. For purposes of determining whether a person has been, by reason of misconduct, disqualified from participating in or appearing before any Federal program or Federal agency, disqualified refers to any action that prohibits a person from participating in or appearing before any Federal program or Federal agency, regardless of how long the prohibition lasts or the specific terminology used.
(3) If the hearing officer finds that the charges against the representative have been sustained, he or she will either—
(i) Suspend the representative for a specified period of not less than 1 year, nor more than 5 years, from the date of the decision; or
(ii) Disqualify the representative from acting as a representative in dealings with us until he or she may be reinstated under § 416.1599. Disqualification is the sole sanction available if the charges have been sustained because the representative has been disbarred or suspended from any court or bar to which the representative was previously admitted to practice or disqualified from participating in or appearing before any Federal program or Federal agency, or because the representative has collected or received, and retains, a fee for representational services in excess of the amount authorized.
(4) The hearing officer shall mail a copy of the decision to the parties at their last known addresses. The notice will inform the parties of the right to request the Appeals Council to review the decision.
(b)
Effect of hearing officer's decision.
(1) The hearing officer's decision is final and binding unless reversed or modified by the Appeals Council upon review.
(2) If the final decision is that a person is disqualified from being a representative in dealings with us, he or she will not be permitted to represent anyone in dealings with us until authorized to do so under the provisions of § 416.1599.
(3) If the final decision is that a person is suspended for a specified period of time from being a representative in dealings with us, he or she will not be
permitted to represent anyone in dealings with us during the period of suspension unless authorized to do so under the provisions of § 416.1599.

§ 416.1575
Requesting review of the hearing officer's decision.
(a)
General.
After the hearing officer issues a decision, either the representative or the other party to the hearing may ask the Appeals Council to review the decision.
(b)
Time and place of filing request for review.
The party requesting review will file the request for review in writing with the Appeals Council within 14 business days from the date the hearing officer mailed the notice. The party requesting review will certify that a copy of the request for review and of any documents that are submitted have been mailed to the opposing party.

§ 416.1576
Assignment of request for review of the hearing officer's decision.
Upon receipt of a request for review of the hearing officer's decision, the matter will be assigned to a panel consisting of three members of the Appeals Council none of whom shall be the Chair of the Appeals Council. The panel shall jointly consider and rule by majority opinion on the request for review of the hearing officer's decision, including a determination to dismiss the request for review. Matters other than a final disposition of the request for review may be disposed of by the member designated chair of the panel.
[56 FR 24132, May 29, 1991]
§ 416.1580
Appeals Council's review of hearing officer's decision.
(a) Upon request, the Appeals Council will give the parties a reasonable time to file briefs or other written statements as to fact and law, and to request to appear before the Appeals Council to present oral argument. When oral argument is requested within the time designated by the Appeals Council, the Appeals Council will grant the request for oral argument and determine whether the parties will appear at the oral argument in person, by video teleconferencing, or by telephone. If oral argument is not requested within the time designated by the Appeals Council, the Appeals Council may deny the request.
(b) If a party files a brief or other written statement with the Appeals Council, he or she shall send a copy to the opposing party and certify that the copy has been sent.

§ 416.1585
Evidence permitted on review.
(a)
General.
Generally, the Appeals Council will not consider evidence in addition to that introduced at the hearing. However, if the Appeals Council finds the evidence offered is material to an issue it is considering, it may consider that evidence, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Individual charged filed an answer.
(1) When the Appeals Council finds that additional evidence material to the charges is available, and the individual charged filed an answer to the charges, the Appeals Council will allow the party with the information to submit the additional evidence.
(2) Before the Appeals Council admits additional evidence into the record, it will mail a notice to the parties, informing them that evidence about certain issues was submitted. The Appeals Council will give each party a reasonable opportunity to comment on the evidence and to present other evidence that is material to an issue it is considering.
(3) The Appeals Council will determine whether the additional evidence warrants a new review by a hearing officer or whether the Appeals Council will consider the additional evidence as part of its review of the case.
(c)
Individual charged did not file an answer.
If the representative did not file an answer to the charges, the representative may not introduce evidence that was not considered at the hearing.
[83 FR 30859, July 2, 2018]
§ 416.1590
Appeals Council's decision.
(a) The Appeals Council will base its decision upon the evidence in the hearing record and any other evidence it may permit on review. The Appeals Council will affirm the hearing officer's decision if the action, findings, and conclusions are supported by substantial evidence. If the hearing officer's decision is not supported by substantial evidence, the Appeals Council will either:
(1) Reverse or modify the hearing officer's decision; or
(2) Return a case to the hearing officer for further proceedings.
(b) The Appeals Council, in changing a hearing officer's decision to suspend a representative for a specified period, shall in no event reduce the period of suspension to less than 1 year. In modifying a hearing officer's decision to disqualify a representative, the Appeals Council shall in no event impose a period of suspension of less than 1 year. Further, the Appeals Council shall in no event impose a suspension when disqualification is the sole sanction available in accordance with § 416.1570(a)(3)(ii).
(c) If the Appeals Council affirms or changes a hearing officer's decision, the period of suspension or the disqualification is effective from the date of the Appeals Council's decision.
(d) If the hearing officer did not impose a period of suspension or a disqualification, and the Appeals Council decides to impose one or the other, the suspension or disqualification is effective from the date of the Appeals Council's decision.
(e) The Appeals Council shall make its decision in writing and shall mail a copy of the decision to the parties at their last known addresses.
(f) The Appeals Council may designate and publish certain final decisions as precedent for other actions brought under its representative conduct provisions. Prior to making a decision public, we will remove or redact personally identifiable information from the decision.

§ 416.1618
When you are considered permanently residing in the United States under color of law.
(a)
General.
We will consider you to be permanently residing in the United States under color of law and you may be eligible for SSI benefits if you are an alien residing in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and that agency does not contemplate enforcing your departure. The Immigration and Naturalization Service does not contemplate enforcing your departure if it is the policy or practice of that agency not to enforce the departure of aliens in the same category or if from all the facts and circumstances in your case it appears that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is otherwise permitting you to reside in the United States indefinitely. We make these decisions by verifying your status with the Immigration and Naturalization Service following the rules contained in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
(b)
Categories of aliens who are permanently residing in the United States under color of law.
Aliens who are permanently residing in the United States under color of law are listed below. None of the categories includes applicants for an Immigration and Naturalization status other than those applicants listed in paragraph (b)(6) of this section or those covered under paragraph (b)(17) of this section. None of the categories allows SSI eligibility for nonimmigrants; for example, students or visitors. Also listed are the most common documents that the Immigration and Naturalization Service provides to aliens in these categories:

212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. For Cuban/Haitian Entrants, we ask for INS Form I-94 stamped “Cuban/Haitian Entrant (Status Pending) reviewable January 15, 1981.

We ask for INS Form I-94 or a letter from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, or copy of a court order establishing the alien's status;
(8) Aliens granted asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1158). We ask for INS Form I-94 and a letter establishing this status;
(9) Aliens admitted as refugees pursuant to section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1157) or section 203(a)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)(7)). We ask for INS Form I-94 properly endorsed;
(10) Aliens granted voluntary departure pursuant to section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(b)) or 8 CFR 242.5 whose departure the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not contemplate enforcing. We ask for INS Form I-94 or I-210 bearing a departure date;
(11) Aliens granted deferred action status pursuant to Immigration and Naturalization Service Operations Instruction 103.1(a)(ii) prior to June 15, 1984 or 242.1(a)(22) issued June 15, 1984 and later. We ask for INS Form I-210 or a letter showing that departure has been deferred;

(c)
How to prove you are in a category listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
You must give us proof that you are in one of the categories in paragraph (b) of this section. You may give us—
(1) Any of the documents listed in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(2) Other information which shows that you are in one of the categories listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
We must contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
(1) We must contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service to verify the information you give us to prove you are permanently residing in the United States under color of law.
(2) If you give us any of the documents listed in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), (9), (11), (12), (13), (15), or (16) of this section, we will pay you benefits if you meet all other eligibility requirements. We will contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service to verify that the document you give us is currently valid.
(3) If you give us any of the documents listed in paragraphs (b) (5), (6), (7), (10), or (14) of this section, or documents that indicate that you meet paragraph (b)(17) of this section, or any other information to prove you are permanently residing in the United States under color of law, we will contact the Immigration and Naturalization Service to verify that the document or other information is currently valid. We must also get information from the Immigration and Naturalization Service as to whether that agency contemplates enforcing your departure. We will apply the following rules:
(i) If you have a document that shows that you have an Immigration and Naturalization Service status that is valid for an indefinite period we will assume that the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not contemplate enforcing your departure. Therefore, we will pay you benefits if you meet all other eligibility requirements. If, based on the information we get from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, we find that your document is currently valid, we will consider this sufficient proof that the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not contemplate enforcing your departure. We will continue your benefits. However, if we find that your document is not currently valid, we will suspend your benefits under § 416.1320.
(ii) If you have a document that appears currently valid and shows you have an Immigration and Naturalization Service status for at least 1 year, or that shows the Immigration and Naturalization Service is allowing you to remain in the United States for a specified period due to conditions in your home country, we will assume that the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not contemplate enforcing your departure. Therefore, we will pay you benefits if you meet all other eligibility requirements. If, based on the information we get from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, we learn that your document is currently valid and that agency does not contemplate enforcing your departure, we will continue your benefits. However, if we learn that your document is not currently valid or that the Immigration and Naturalization Service does contemplate enforcing your departure, we will suspend your benefits under § 416.1320.
(iii) If you have a document that shows you have an Immigration and Naturalization Service status valid for less than 1 year, or if your document has no expiration date, or if you have no document, we will not pay you benefits until the Immigration and Naturalization Service confirms that your document is currently valid and we get information from that agency that indicates whether it contemplates enforcing your departure. If that agency does not contemplate enforcing your departure, we will pay you benefits if you meet all other eligibility requirements.
(iv) If at any time after you begin receiving benefits we receive information
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service which indicates that the Immigration and Naturalization Service contemplates enforcing your departure, we will suspend your benefits under § 416.1320 and any benefits you have received after the date that the Immigration and Naturalization Service began contemplating enforcing departure will be overpayments under subpart E of this part.
(e)
What “United States” means.
We use the term
United States
in this section to mean the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

§ 416.1619

# Who Is Considered Your Spouse
§ 416.1802
Effects of marriage on eligibility and amount of benefits.
(a)
If you have an ineligible spouse
—(1)
Counting income.
If you apply for or receive SSI benefits, and you are married to someone who is not eligible for SSI benefits and are living in the same household as that person, we may count part of that person's income as yours. Counting part of that person's income as yours may reduce the amount of your benefits or even make you ineligible. Section 416.410 discusses the amount of benefits and § 416.1163 explains how we count income for an individual with an ineligible spouse.
(2)
Counting resources.
If you are married to someone who is not eligible for SSI benefits and are living in the same household as that person, we will count
the value of that person's resources (money and property), minus certain exclusions, as yours when we determine your eligibility. Section 416.1202(a) gives a more detailed statement of how we count resources and § 416.1205(a) gives the limit of resources allowed for eligibility of a person with an ineligible spouse.
(b)
If you have an eligible spouse
—(1)
Counting income.
If you apply for or receive SSI benefits and have an eligible spouse as defined in § 416.1801(c), we will count your combined income and calculated the benefit amount for you as a couple. Section 416.412 gives a detailed statement of the amount of benefits and subpart K of this part explains how we count income for an eligible couple.
(2)
Counting resources.
If you have an eligible spouse as defined in § 416.1801(c), we will count the value of your combined resources (money and property), minus certain exclusions, and use the couple's resource limit when we determine your eligibility. Section 416.1205(b) gives a detailed statement of the resource limit for an eligible couple.
(c)
If you are married, we do not consider you a child.
The rules for counting income and resources are different for children than for adults. (Section 416.1851 discusses the effects of being considered a child on eligibility and amount of benefits.) Regardless of your age, if you are married we do not consider you to be a child.
(d)(1)
General rule:
Benefits depend on whether you are married or not married at the beginning of each month. If you get married, even on the first day of a month we will treat you as single until the next month. If your marriage ends, even on the first day of a month, we will treat you as married until the next month.
(2)
Exception: If you both meet eligibility requirements after your date of marriage or after your marriage ends.
If, in the month that you marry, each of you first meets all eligibility requirements after the date of your marriage, we will treat you as an eligible couple for that month. If, in the month that your marriage ends, each of you first meets all eligibility requirements after the date your marriage ends, we will treat you as eligible individuals. (See subparts D and E regarding how your benefits will be prorated.)

§ 416.1806
Whether you are married and who is your spouse.
(a) We will consider someone to be your spouse (and therefore consider you to be married) for SSI purposes if—
(1) You are legally married under the laws of the State where your and his or her permanent home is (or was when you lived together);
(2) We have decided that either of you is entitled to husband's or wife's Social Security insurance benefits as the spouse of the other (this decision will not affect your SSI benefits for any month before it is made); or
(3) You and an unrelated person of the opposite sex are living together in the same household at or after the time you apply for SSI benefits, and you both lead people to believe that you are husband and wife.
(b) if more than one person would qualify as your husband or wife under paragraph (a) of this section, we will consider the person you are presently living with to be your spouse for SSI purposes.
[60 FR 16376, Mar. 30, 1995]
§ 416.1816
Information we need concerning marriage when you apply for SSI.
When you apply for SSI benefits, we will ask whether you are married. If you are married, we will ask whether you are living with your spouse. If you are unmarried or you are married but not living with your spouse, we will ask whether you are living in the same household with anyone of the opposite sex who is not related to you. If you are, we will ask whether you and that person lead other people to believe that you are husband and wife.
§ 416.1821
Showing that you are married when you apply for SSI.
(a)
General rule: Proof is unnecessary.
If you tell us you are married we will consider you married unless we have information to the contrary. We will also consider you married, on the basis
of your statement, if you say you are living with an unrelated person of the opposite sex and you both lead people to believe you are married. However, if we have information contrary to what you tell us, we will ask for evidence as described in paragraph (c).
(b)
Exception: If you are a child to whom parental deeming rules apply.
If you are a child to whom the parental deeming rules apply and we receive information from you or others that you are married, we will ask for evidence of your marriage. The rules on deeming parental income are in §§ 416.1165 and 416.1166. The rules on deeming of parental resources are in § 416.1202.
(c)
Evidence of marriage.
If paragraph (a) or (b) of this section indicates that you must show us evidence that you are married, you must show us your marriage certificate (which can be the original certificate, a certified copy of the public record of marriage, or a certified copy of the church record) if you can. If you cannot, you must tell us why not and give us whatever evidence you can.
[45 FR 71795, Oct. 30, 1980. Redesignated at 46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981; 46 FR 42063, Aug. 19, 1981, and amended at 52 FR 8889, Mar. 20, 1987]
§ 416.1826
Showing that you are not married when you apply for SSI.
(a)
General rule: Proof is unnecessary.
If you do not live with an unrelated person of the opposite sex and you say that you are not married, we will generally accept your statement unless we have information to the contrary.
(b)
Exception: If you are under age 22 and have been married.
If you are under age 22 and have been married, to prove that your marriage has ended you must show us the decree of divorce or annulment or the death certificate if you can. If you cannot, you must tell us why not and give us whatever evidence you can.
(c)
Exception: If you are living with an unrelated person of the opposite sex.
(1) If you are living with an unrelated person of the opposite sex, you and the person you are living with must explain to us what your relationship is and answer questions such as the following:
(i) What names are the two of you known by?
(ii) Do you introduce yourselves as husband and wife? If not, how are you introduced?
(iii) What names are used on mail for each of you?
(iv) Who owns or rents the place where you live?
(v) Do any deeds, leases, time payment papers, tax papers, or any other papers show you as husband and wife?
(2) We will consider you married to the person you live with unless the information we have, including the answers to the questions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, all considered together, show that the two of you do not lead people to believe that you are each other's husband and wife.
§ 416.1830
When we stop considering you and your spouse an eligible couple.
We will stop considering you and your spouse an eligible couple, even if you both remain eligible, at the beginning of whichever of these months comes first—
(a) The calendar month after the month you stopped living with your eligible spouse, or
(b) The calendar month after the month in which your marriage ends.

We consider your marriage ended when—
(a) Your spouse dies;
(b) Your divorce or annulment becomes final;

Information we need about separation or end of marriage after you become eligible for SSI.

(1) When did you stop living together?
(2) Do you expect to live together again?
(3) If so, when?
(4) Where is your husband or wife living?
(5) Is either of you living with someone else as husband and wife?
(b)
Evidence of end of marriage
—(1)
Death.

(2)
Divorce or annulment.
If your marriage ends by divorce or annulment, you must show us the decree of divorce or annulment if you can. If you cannot, you must tell us why not and give us whatever evidence you can.
(3)
Other reason.
If your marriage ends for reasons other than death, divorce, or annulment, you must give us any information we ask you to give us about the end of the marriage. If you cannot, you must explain why you cannot. We will consider all of the relevant information to decide if and when your marriage ends.

# Who Is Considered a Child
§ 416.1851
Effects of being considered a child.
If we consider you to be a child for SSI purposes, the rules in this section apply when we determine your eligibility for SSI and the amount of your SSI benefits.
(a) If we consider you to be a student, we will not count all of your earned income when we determine your SSI eligibility and benefit amount. Section 416.1110 tells what we mean by earned income. Section 416.1112(c)(2) tells how much of your earned income we will not count.
(b) If you have a parent who does not live with you but who pays money to help support you, we will not count one-third of that money when we count your income. Section 416.1124(c)(9) discusses this rule.
(c) If you are under age 18 and live with your parent(s) who is not eligible for SSI benefits, we consider (deem) part of his or her income and resources to be your own. If you are under age 18 and live with both your parent and your parent's spouse (stepparent) and neither is eligible for SSI benefits, we consider (deem) part of their income and resources to be your own. Sections 416.1165 and 416.1166 explain the rules and the exception to the rules on deeming your parent's income to be yours, and § 416.1202 explains the rules and the exception to the rules on deeming your parent's resources to be yours.
[45 FR 71795, Oct. 30, 1980. Redesignated at 46 FR 29211, May 29, 1981; 46 FR 42063, Aug. 19, 1981, and amended at 52 FR 8889, Mar. 20, 1987; 73 FR 28036, May 15, 2008]
§ 416.1856
Who is considered a child.
We consider you to be a child if—
(a)(1) You are under 18 years old; or
(2) You are under 22 years old and you are a student regularly attending school or college or training that is designed to prepare you for a paying job;
(b) You are not married; and
(c) You are not the head of a household.
§ 416.1861
Deciding whether you are a child: Are you a student?
(a)
Are you a student?
You are a student regularly attending school or college or training that is designed to prepare you for a paying job if you are enrolled for one or more courses of study and you attend class—
(1) In a college or university for at least 8 hours a week under a semester or quarter system;
(2) In grades 7-12 for at least 12 hours a week;
(3) In a course of training to prepare you for a paying job, and you are attending that training for at least 15 hours a week if the training involves shop practice or 12 hours a week if it does not involve shop practice (this kind of training includes anti-poverty programs, such as the Job Corps, and government-supported courses in self-improvement); or
(4) Less than the amount of time given in paragraph (a) (1), (2), or (3) of this section for reasons you cannot control, such as illness, if the circumstances justify your reduced credit load or attendance.
(b)
If you are instructed at home.
You may be a student regularly attending school if you are instructed at home in grades 7-12 in accordance with a home school law of the State or other jurisdiction in which you reside and for at least 12 hours a week.
(c)
If you have to stay home.
You may be a student regularly attending school, college, or training to prepare you for a paying job if—
(1) You have to stay home because of your disability;
(2) You are studying at home a course or courses given by a school (grades 7-12), college, university, or government agency; and
(3) A home visitor or tutor directs your study or training.
(d)
When you are not in school
—(1)
When school is out.
We will consider you to be a student regularly attending school, college, or training to prepare you for a paying job even when classes are out if you actually attend regularly just before the time classes are out and you—
(i) Tell us that you intend to resume attending regularly when school opens again; or
(ii) Actually do resume attending regularly when school opens again.
(2)
Other times.
Your counselor or teacher may believe you need to stay out of class for a short time during the course or between courses to enable you to continue your study or training. That will not stop us from considering you to be a student regularly attending school, college, or training to prepare you for a paying job if you are in—
(i) A course designed to prepare disabled people for work; or
(ii) A course to prepare you for a job that is specially set up for people who cannot work at ordinary jobs.
(e)
Last month of school.
We will consider you to be a student regularly attending school, college, or training to prepare you for a paying job for the month in which you complete or stop your course of study or training.
(f)
When we need evidence that you are a student.
We need evidence that you are a student if you are 18 years old or older but under age 22, because we will not consider you to be a child unless we consider you to be a student.
(g)
What evidence we need.
If we need evidence that you are a student, you must—
(1) Show us any paper you have that shows you are a student in a school, college, or training program, such as a student identification card or tuition receipt; and
(2) Tell us—
(i) What courses you are taking;
(ii) How many hours a week you spend in classes;
(iii) The name and address of the school or college you attend or the agency training you; and
(iv) The name and telephone number of someone at the school, college, or agency who can tell us more about your courses, in case we need information you cannot give us.

§ 416.1866
Deciding whether you are a child: Are you the head of a household?
(a)
Meaning of head of household.
You are the head of a household if you have left your parental home on a permanent basis and you are responsible for the day-to-day decisions on the operation of your own household. If you live with your parent(s) or stepparents, we will ordinarily assume you are not the head of a household. However, we will consider you to be the head of a household if for some reason (such as your parent's illness) you are the one who makes the day-to-day decisions. You need not have someone living with you to be the head of a household.
(b)
If you share decision-making equally.
If you live with one or more people
and everyone has an equal voice in the decision-making (for example, a group of students who share off-campus housing), that group is not a household. Each person who has left the parental home on a permanent basis is the head of his or her own household.

# Who Is Considered a Student for Purposes of the Student Earned Income Exclusion
§ 416.1870
Effect of being considered a student.
If we consider you to be a student, we will not count all of your earned income when we determine your SSI eligibility and benefit amount. If you are an ineligible spouse or ineligible parent for deeming purposes and we consider you to be a student, we will not count all of your income when we determine how much of your income to deem. Section 416.1110 explains what we mean by earned income. Section 416.1112(c)(3) explains how much of your earned income we will not count. Section 416.1161(a)(27) explains how the student earned income exclusion applies to deemors.
[71 FR 66867, Nov. 17, 2006]
§ 416.1872
Who is considered a student.
We consider you to be a student if you are under 22 years old and you regularly attend school or college or training that is designed to prepare you for a paying job as described in § 416.1861(a) through (e).
[71 FR 66867, Nov. 17, 2006]
§ 416.1874
When we need evidence that you are a student.
We need evidence that you are a student if you are under age 22 and you expect to earn over $65 in any month. Section 416.1861(g) explains what evidence we need.
[71 FR 66867, Nov. 17, 2006]

# Who Is Considered Your Parent
§ 416.1876
Effects a parent (or parents) can have on the child's benefits.
Section 416.1851 (b) and (c) tells what effects a parent's income and resources can have on his or her child's benefits.
§ 416.1881
Deciding whether someone is your parent or stepparent.
(a) We consider your parent to be—
(1) Your natural mother or father; or
(2) A person who legally adopted you.
(b) We consider your stepparent to be the present husband or wife of your natural or adoptive parent. A person is not your stepparent if your natural or adoptive parent, to whom your stepparent was married, has died, or if your parent and stepparent have been divorced or their marriage has been annulled.
(c)
Necessary evidence.
We will accept your statement on whether or not someone is your parent or stepparent unless we have information to the contrary. If we have contrary information, you must show us, if you can, one or more of the following kinds of evidence that would help to prove whether or not the person is your parent or stepparent: Certificate of birth, baptism, marriage, or death, or decree of adoption, divorce, or annulment. If you cannot, you must tell us why not and show us any other evidence that would help to show whether or not the person is your parent or stepparent.

# Introduction
§ 416.1901
Scope of subpart S.
(a)
General.
This subpart explains that we may withhold your SSI benefit and/or State supplementary payments and send them to the State (or a political subdivision of the State) as repayment for interim assistance it gave you while your application for SSI was pending, or while your SSI benefits were suspended or terminated if you are subsequently found to have been eligible for such benefits. Before we will do this, the State must have entered into an interim assistance agreement with us authorizing such reimbursement, and you must have given written
authorization for us to repay the State (or a political subdivision of the State).
(b)
Organization of this subpart.
We have organized this subpart as follows:
(1)
Definitions.
Section 416.1902 contains definitions of terms used in this subpart.
(2)
Authorizations.
Sections 416.1904 through 416.1908 give the rules that apply to your written authorization.
(3)
Interim assistance agreements.
Section 416.1910 gives the requirements for interim assistance agreements between us and the State.

§ 416.1902
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart—
Authorization
means your written permission, in a form legally acceptable to us and to the State from which you received interim assistance, for us to withhold the appropriate SSI benefit payment and send it to the State.
Interim assistance
means assistance the State gives you, including payments made on your behalf to providers of goods or services, to meet your basic needs, beginning with the first month for which you are eligible for payment of SSI benefits and ending with, and including, the month your SSI payments begin, or assistance the State gives you beginning with the day for which your eligibility for SSI benefits is reinstated after a period of suspension or termination and ending with, and including, the month the Commissioner makes the first payment of benefits following the suspension or termination if it is determined subsequently that you were eligible for benefits during that period. It does not include assistance the State gives to or for any other person. If the State has prepared and cannot stop delivery of its last assistance payment to you when it receives your SSI benefit payment from us, that assistance payment is included as interim assistance to be reimbursed. Interim assistance does not include assistance payments financed wholly or partly with Federal funds.
SSI benefit payment
means your Federal benefit and any State supplementary payment made by us to you on behalf of a State (see subpart T of this part) which is due you at the time we make the first payment of benefits or when your benefits are reinstated after suspension or termination. Advance payment, as defined in § 416.520, payment based upon presumptive disability or presumptive blindness, as defined in § 416.931, or certain payments made under the administrative immediate payment procedure, are not considered SSI benefit payments for interim assistance purposes.
State
for purposes of an interim assistance agreement, means a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Northern Mariana Islands. For all other purposes (for example, payment, appeals, notices)
State
also means a political subdivision of any of these.
We, Us,
or
Our
means the Social Security Administration.
You
or
Your
means someone who has applied for or is already receiving SSI benefits.

# Authorizations
§ 416.1904
Authorization to withhold SSI benefits.

(a) We have an interim assistance agreement with the State at the time your authorization goes into effect; and
(b) Your authorization is in effect at the time we make the SSI benefit payment.
§ 416.1906
When your authorization is in effect.
Your authorization for us to withhold your SSI benefit payment, to repay the State for interim assistance the State gives you, is effective when we receive it, or (if our agreement with the State allows) when we receive notice from
the State that it has received your authorization. It remains in effect until—
(a) We make the first SSI benefit payment on your initial application for benefits or, in the case of an authorization effective for a period of suspense or termination, until the initial payment following the termination or suspension of your benefits.
(b) We make a final determination on your claim (if your SSI claim is denied, the denial is the final determination, unless you file a timely appeal as described in subpart N of this part);
(c) You and the State agree to terminate your authorization; or
(d) If earlier than the event in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the date (if any) specified in your authorization.
[46 FR 47449, Sept. 27, 1981, as amended at 56 FR 19262, Apr. 26, 1991]
§ 416.1908
When we need another authorization.
Once an event described in § 416.1906 occurs, your authorization is no longer effective. If you reapply for SSI benefits, or the authorization has expired, the State must obtain a new authorization from you in order for us to repay the State for interim assistance it gives you.

# Interim Assistance Agreements
§ 416.1910
Requirements for interim assistance agreement.
An interim assistance agreement must be in effect between us and the State if we are to repay the State for interim assistance. The following requirements must be part of the agreement:
(a)
SSA to repay the State.
We must agree to repay the State for interim assistance it gives you. Repayment to the State takes priority over any underpayments due you (see §§ 416.525 and 416.542).
(b)
State to pay any excess repayment to you.
The State must agree that, if we repay it an amount greater than the amount of interim assistance it gave to you, the State will—
(1) Pay the excess amount to you no later than 10 working days from the date the State receives repayment from us; or
(2) Refund the excess amount to us for disposition under the rules in subpart E of the this part on payment of benefits if the State cannot pay it to you (for example, you die or you move and the State cannot locate you).
(c)
State to notify you.
The State must agree to give you written notice explaining—
(1) How much we have repaid the State for interim assistance it gave you;
(2) The excess amount, if any, due you; and
(3) That it will give you an opportunity for a hearing if you disagree with State's actions regarding repayment of interim assistance.
(d)
Duration of the agreement.
We and the State must agree to the length of time that the agreement will remain in effect.
(e)
State to comply with other regulations.
The State must agree to comply with any other regulations that we find necessary to administer the interim assistance provisions.

# Appeals
§ 416.1920
Your appeal rights in the State.
Under its interim assistance agreement with us, the State must agree to give you an opportunity for a hearing if you disagree with the State's actions regarding repayment of interim assistance. For example, you are entitled to a hearing by the State if you disagree with the State regarding the amount of the repayment the State keeps or the amount of any excess the State pays to you. You are not entitled to a Federal hearing on the State's actions regarding repayment of interim assistance.
§ 416.1922
Your appeal rights in SSA.
If you disagree with the total amount of money we have withheld and sent to the State for the interim assistance it gave to you, you have a right to appeal to us, as described in subpart N of this part.

(1) In supplementation of the Federal supplemental security income benefits;
i.e.
, as a complement to the Federal benefit amount, thereby increasing the amount of income available to the recipient to meet his needs; and

Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, any State may enter into an agreement with SSA under which the State will provide both mandatory and optional State supplementary payments and elect Federal administration of such State supplementary payment programs. If SSA agrees to administer such State's optional supplementary payments, the State must also have SSA administer its mandatory minimum supplementary payments unless the State is able to provide sufficient justification for exemption from this requirement.
(c)
Administration—combination.
Any State may enter into an agreement with SSA under which the State will provide mandatory minimum supplementary payments and elect Federal administration of such payments while
providing optional State supplementary payments which it shall administer itself. If the State chooses to administer such payment itself, it may establish its own criteria for determining eligibility requirements as well as the amounts.
(d)
Conditions of administration agreement.
The State and SSA may, subject to the provisions of this subpart, enter into a written agreement, in such form and containing such provisions not inconsistent with this part as are found necessary by SSA, under which SSA will administer the State supplementary payments on behalf of a State (or political subdivision). Under such an agreement between SSA and a State, specific Federal and State responsibilities for administration and fiscal responsibilities will be stipulated. The regulations in effect for the supplemental security income program shall be applicable in the Federal administration of State supplementary payments except as may otherwise be provided in this subpart as found by SSA to be necessary for the effective and efficient administration of both the basic Federal benefit and the State supplementary payment. If the State elects options available under this subpart (specified in §§ 416.2015-416.2035), such options must be specified in the administration agreement.

§ 416.2010
Essentials of the administration agreements.
(a)
Payments.
Any agreement between SSA and a State made pursuant to § 416.2005 must provide that, if for optional supplementation, such State supplementary payments are made to all individuals and/or couples who are:
(1) Receiving (or at the option of the State would, but for the amount of their income, be eligible to receive) supplemental security income benefits under title XVI of the Social Security Act, and
(2) Within the variations and categories (as defined in § 416.2030) for which the State (or political subdivision) wishes to provide a supplementary payment, and
(3) Residing, subject to the provisions of § 416.2035(a), in such State (or political subdivision thereof).
(b)
Administrative costs.
(1) SSA shall assess each State that had elected Federal administration of optional and/or mandatory State supplementary payments an administration fee for administering those payments. The administration fee is assessed and paid monthly and is derived by multiplying the number of State supplementary payments made by SSA on behalf of a State for any month in a fiscal year by the applicable dollar rate for the fiscal year. The number of supplementary payments made by SSA in a month is the total number of checks issued, and direct deposits made, to recipients in that month, that are composed in whole or in part of State supplementary funds. The dollar rates are as follows:
(i) For fiscal year 1994, $1.67;
(ii) For fiscal year 1995, $3.33;
(iii) For fiscal year 1996, $5.00;
(iv) For fiscal year 1997, $5.00;
(v) For fiscal year 1998, $6.20;
(vi) For fiscal year 1999, $7.60;
(vii) For fiscal year 2000, $7.80;
(viii) For fiscal year 2001, $8.10;
(ix) For fiscal year 2002, $8.50; and
(x) For fiscal year 2003 and each succeeding fiscal year—
(A) The applicable rate in the preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year of the increase exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the calendar year of the increase, and rounded to the nearest whole cent; or
(B) Such different rate as the Commissioner determines is appropriate for the State taking into account the complexity of administering the State's supplementary payment program.
(2) SSA shall charge a State an additional services fee if, at the request of the State, SSA agrees to provide the State with additional services beyond the level customarily provided in the administration of State supplementary payments. The additional services fee shall be in an amount that SSA determines is necessary to cover all costs, including indirect costs, incurred by
the Federal Government in furnishing the additional services. SSA is not required to perform any additional services requested by a State and may, at its sole discretion, refuse to perform those additional services. An additional services fee charged a State may be a one-time charge or, if the furnished services result in ongoing costs to the Federal Government, a monthly or less frequent charge to the State for providing such services.
(c)
Agreement period.
The agreement period for a State which has elected Federal administration of its supplementary payments will extend for one year from the date the agreement was signed unless otherwise designated. The agreement will be automatically renewed for a period of one year unless either the State or SSA gives written notice not to renew, at least 90 days before the beginning of the new period. For a State to elect Federal administration, it must notify SSA of its intent to enter into an agreement, furnishing the necessary payment specifications, at least 120 days before the first day of the month for which it wishes Federal administration to begin, and have executed such agreement at least 30 days before such day.
(d)
Modification or termination.
The agreement may be modified at any time by mutual consent. The State or SSA may terminate the agreement upon 90 days written notice to the other party, provided the effective date of the termination is the last day of a quarter. However, the State may terminate the agreement upon 45 days written notice to SSA where: (1) The State does not wish to comply with a regulation promulgated by SSA subsequent to the execution of the agreement; and (2) the State provides such written notice within 30 days of the effective date of the regulation. The Secretary is not precluded from terminating the agreement in less than 90 days where he finds that a State has failed to materially comply with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section or § 416.2090.
(e)
Mandatory minimum State supplementation.
Any administration agreement between SSA and a State under which SSA will make such State's mandatory minimum State supplementary payments shall provide that the State will:
(1)
Certify income and payment amount.
Certify to SSA the names of each individual who, for December 1973 was eligible for and a recipient of aid or assistance in the form of money payments under a plan of such State approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act (§ 416.121), together with the amount of such aid or assistance payable to each such individual and the amount of such individual's other income (as defined in § 416.2050(b)(2)), and
(2)
Additional data.
Provide SSA with such additional data at such times as SSA may reasonably require in order to properly, economically, and efficiently carry out such administration agreement. This shall include required information on changes in countable income as well as changes in special needs and circumstances that would result in a decrease in the mandatory income level being maintained by the State, unless the State has specified in the agreement that the minimum income level shall not be lowered by such changes.
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 62 FR 313, Jan. 3, 1997; 63 FR 33849, June 22, 1998]
§ 416.2015
Establishing eligibility.
(a)
Applications.
Any person who meets the application requirements of subpart C of this part is deemed to have filed an application for any federally administered State supplementation for which he may be eligible unless supplementation has been waived pursuant to § 416.2047. However, a supplemental statement will be required where additional information is necessary to establish eligibility or to determine the correct payment amount.
(b)
Evidentiary requirements.
The evidentiary requirements and developmental procedures of this part are applicable with respect to federally administered State supplementary payments.
(c)
Determination.
Where not inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart, eligibility for and the amount of the State supplementary payment will be determined pursuant to the provisions of subparts A through Q of this part.
(d)
Categories; aged, blind, disabled.
An applicant will be deemed to have filed for the State supplementary payment amount provided for the category under which his application for a Federal supplemental security income benefit is filed. As in the Federal supplemental security income program, an individual who establishes eligibility as a blind or disabled individual, and continually remains on the rolls, will continue to be considered blind or disabled after he attains age 65.
(e)
Concurrent categories.
(1) In States where the supplementary payment provided for the aged category is higher than for the blind or disabled category aged individuals will be paid the State supplement on the basis of age.
(2) If the administration agreement pursuant to § 416.2005(b) provides for higher supplementary payments to the blind or disabled than to the aged category, then, at the option of the State, the agreement may provide that individuals who are age 65 or over at time of application and who are blind or disabled may elect to receive such higher supplementary payments.
§ 416.2020
Federally administered supplementary payments.
(a)
Payment procedures.
A federally administered State supplementary payment will be made on a monthly basis and will be included in the same check as a Federal benefit that is payable. A State supplementary payment shall be for the same month as the Federal benefit.
(b)
Maximum amount.
There is no restriction on the amount of a State supplementary payment that the Federal Government will administer on behalf of a State.
(c)
Minimum amount.
The Federal Government will not administer optional State supplementary payments in amounts less than $1 per month. Hence, optional supplementary payment amounts of less than $1 will be raised to a dollar.
(d)
Optional supplementation: nine categories possible.
A State may elect Federal administration of its supplementary payments for up to nine categories, depending on the assistance titles in effect in that State in January 1972 (
i.e.
, title I, X, XIV, or XVI). It can have no more than two categories (one for individuals and one for couples) for each title in effect for January 1972:
(1) Since a State with a title XVI program had just the one title in effect, it can supplement only to two categories, the individual (aged, blind, or disabled), the couple (both of whom are aged, blind, or disabled).
(2) Other States could supplement up to nine categories, depending on the plans they had in effect. Six of these categories would be for:
(i) Aged Individual,
(ii) Aged Couple,
(iii) Blind Individual,
(iv) Blind Couple,
(v) Disabled Individual,
(vi) Disabled Couple.
(3) In addition to those enumerated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, there are three additional couple categories for which a State may elect to provide a federally administered supplement. These categories are created when one individual in the couple is:
(i) Aged and the other blind, or
(ii) Aged and the other disabled, or
(iii) Blind and the other disabled.
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 50 FR 48579, Nov. 26, 1985]
§ 416.2025
Optional supplementation: Countable income.
(a)
Earned and unearned income.
No less than the amounts of earned or unearned income which were excluded in determining eligibility for or amount of a title XVI supplemental security income benefit must be excludable by a State in the Federal-State agreement for purposes of determining eligibility for or amount of the State supplementary payment.
(b)
Effect of countable income on payment amounts. Countable income
of an eligible individual or eligible couple is determined in the same manner as such income is determined under the title XVI supplemental security income program. Countable income will affect the amount of the State supplementary payments as follows:
(1) As provided in § 416.420, countable income will first be deducted from the Federal benefit rate applicable to an eligible individual or eligible couple. In the case of an eligible individual living with an ineligible spouse with income
(the deeming provisions of § 416.1163 apply), the Federal benefit rate from which countable income will be deducted is the Federal benefit rate applicable to an eligible couple, except that an eligible individual's payment amount may not exceed the amount he or she would have received if he or she were not subject to the deeming provisions (§ 416.1163(e)(2)).
(2) If countable income is equal to or less than the amount of the Federal benefit rate, the full amount of the State supplementary payment as specified in the Federal agreement will be made.
(3) If countable income exceeds the amount of the Federal benefit rate, the State supplementary benefit will be reduced by the amount of such excess. In the case of an eligible individual living with an ineligible spouse with income (the deeming methodology of § 416.1163 applies), the State supplementary payment rate from which the excess income will be deducted is the higher of the State supplementary rates for an eligible couple or an eligible individual, except that an eligible individual's payment amount may not exceed the amount he or she would have received if he or she were not subject to the deeming provisions (see § 416.1163(e)(2)). For purposes of determining the State supplementary couple rate, the ineligible spouse is considered to be in the same category as the eligible individual.
(4) No State supplementary payment will be made where countable income is equal to or exceeds the sum of the Federal benefit rate and the State supplementary payment rate.
(c)
Effect of additional income exclusions on payment amounts.
A State has the option of excluding amounts of earned and unearned income in addition to the amounts it is required to exclude under paragraph (a) of this section in determining a person's eligibility for State supplementary payments. Such additional income exclusions affect the amount of the State supplementary payments as follows:
(1) Countable income (as determined under the Federal eligibility rules) will first be deducted from the Federal benefit rate applicable to an eligible individual or eligible couple.
(2) Such countable income is then reduced by the amount of the additional income exclusion specified by the State.
(3) If the remaining countable income is equal to or less than the amount of the Federal benefit rate, the full amount of the State supplementary payment will be made.
(4) If the remaining countable income exceeds the amount of the Federal benefit rate, the State supplementary payment will be reduced by the amount of such excess.
(Secs. 1102, 1614(f), 1616(a), 1631, Social Security Act, as amended, 49 Stat. 647, as amended, 86 Stat. 1473, 1474(a), and 1475 (42 U.S.C. 1302, 1382c(f), 1382e(a), 1383))
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 43 FR 39570, Sept. 6, 1978; 53 FR 25151, July 5, 1988]
§ 416.2030
Optional supplementation: Variations in payments.
(a)
Payment level.
The level of State supplementary payments may vary for each category the State elects to include in its federally administered supplement. These categorical variations of payment levels must be specified in the agreement between the Commissioner and the State. If any State has in effect for July 1974 an agreement which provides for variations in addition to those specified in this section, the State may, at its option, continue such variations but only for periods ending before July 1, 1976.
(1)
Geographical variations.
A State may elect to include two different geographical variations. A third may be elected if adequate justification, e.g., substantial differences in living costs, can be demonstrated. All such variations must be readily identifiable by county or ZIP code or other readily identifiable factor.
(2)
Living arrangements.
In addition, a State may elect up to six variations in recognition of the different needs which result from various living arrangements. If a State elects six payment level variations based on differences in living arrangements, one of these six variations must apply only to individuals in Medicaid facilities, that is, facilities receiving title XIX payments with respect to such persons for the cost of their care (see
§ 416.211(b)(1)). In any event, States are limited to one payment level variation for residents of Medicaid facilities. Types of other living arrangements for which payment variations may be allowed include arrangements such as:
(i) Living alone;
(ii) Living with an ineligible spouse;
(iii) Personal care facility; or,
(iv) Domiciliary or congregate care facility.
(b)
Relationship to actual cost differences.
Under the agreement, variations in State supplementary payment levels will be permitted for each living arrangement the State elects. These differences must be based on rational distinctions between both the types of living arrangements and the costs of those arrangements.
(c)
Effective month of State supplementary payment category.
The State supplementary payment category which applies in the current month will be used to determine the State payment level in that month. This rule applies even if the countable income in a prior month is used to determine the amount of State supplementary payment.
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 50 FR 48579, Nov. 26, 1985; 56 FR 41455, Aug. 21, 1991; 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]
§ 416.2035
Optional supplementation: Additional State options.
(a)
Residency requirement.
A State or political subdivision may impose, as a condition of eligibility, a residency requirement which excludes from eligibility for State supplementary payment any individual who has resided in such State (or political subdivision thereof) for less than a minimum period prescribed by the State. Any such residency requirement will be specified in the agreement.
(b)
Lien and relative responsibility.
A State which elects Federal administration of its supplementary payments may place a lien upon property of an individual as a consequence of the receipt of such payments or may require that a relative of the individual contribute to a reasonable extent to the support of the individual, providing it is stated in the agreement that:
(1) The Commissioner has determined that the specific State laws and their enforcement are consistent with the supplemental security income program purpose of providing unencumbered cash payments to recipients; and
(2) The Federal Government is not involved in the administration of such laws and will not vary the State supplementary payment amount it makes to comply with such laws; and
(3) Neither the basic Federal benefit nor any part of the State supplementary payment financed by Federal funds will be subject to the liens or encumbrances of such laws.
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]
§ 416.2040
Limitations on eligibility.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the eligibility of an individual (or couple) for optional State supplementary payments administered by the Federal Government in accordance with this subpart shall be limited as follows:
(a)
Inmate of public institution.
A person who is a resident in a public institution for a month, is ineligible for a Federal benefit for that month under the provision of § 416.211(a), and does not meet the requirements for any of the exceptions in § 416.211 (b), (c), or (d), or § 416.212, also shall be ineligible for a federally administered State supplementary payment for that month.
(b)
Ineligible persons.
No person who is ineligible for a Federal benefit for any month under sections 1611(e)(1)(A), (2), (3), or (f) of the Act (failure to file; refuses treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism; outside the United States) or other reasons (other than the amount of income) shall be eligible for such State supplementation for such month.
(c)
Recipient eligible for benefits under § 416.212.
A recipient who is institutionalized and is eligible for either benefit payable under § 416.212 for a month or months may also receive federally administered State supplementation for that month. Additionally, a recipient who would be eligible for benefits under § 416.212 but for countable income which reduces his or her Federal SSI benefit to zero, may still be eligible to
receive federally administered State supplementation.
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 56 FR 41455, Aug. 21, 1991; 61 FR 10280, Mar. 13, 1996; 68 FR 40124, July 7, 2003]
§ 416.2045
Overpayments and underpayments; federally administered supplementation.
(a)
Overpayments.
Upon determination that an overpayment has been made, adjustments will be made against future federally administered State supplementary payments for which the person is entitled. Rules and requirements (see §§ 416.550 through 416.586) in effect for recovery (or waiver) of supplemental security income benefit overpayments shall also apply to the recovery (or waiver) of federally administered State supplementary overpaid amounts. If the overpaid person's entitlement to the State supplementary payments is terminated prior to recoupment of the overpaid State supplementary payment amount, and the overpayment cannot be recovered from a Federal benefit payable under this part, the person's record will be annotated (specifying the amount of the overpayment) to permit recoupment if the person becomes reentitled to supplementary payments of such State or to a Federal benefit under this part.
(b)
Underpayments.
Upon determination that an underpayment of State supplementary payments is due and payable, the underpaid amount shall be paid to the underpaid claimant directly, or his representative. If the underpaid person dies before receiving the underpaid amount of State supplementary payment the underpaid amount shall be paid to the claimant's eligible spouse. If the deceased claimant has no eligible spouse, no payment of the underpaid amount shall be made. (See §§ 416.538 through 416.543.)
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 65 FR 16815, Mar. 30, 2000]
§ 416.2047
Waiver of State supplementary payments.
(a)
Waiver request in writing.
Any person who is eligible to receive State supplementary payments or who would be eligible to receive such State supplementary payments may waive his right to receive such payments if such person makes a written request for waiver of State supplementary payments. Any such request made at time of application for the Federal benefit shall be effective immediately. Any such request filed after the application is filed shall be effective the month the request is received in a social security office, or earlier if the recipient refunds to the Social Security Administration the amount of any supplementary payment(s) made to him for the subject period.
(b)
Revocation of waiver.
Any individual who has waived State supplementary payments may revoke such waiver at any time by making a written request to any social security office. The revocation will be effective the month in which it is filed. The date such request is received in a social security office or the postmarked date, if the written request was mailed, will be the filing date, whichever is earlier.
§ 416.2050
Mandatory minimum State supplementation.
(a)
Determining the amount.
The amount of a mandatory State supplementary payment in the case of any eligible individual or couple for any month is equal to:
(1) The amount by which such individual or couple's December 1973 income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) exceeds the amount of such individual or couple's title XVI benefit plus other income which would have been used by such State in computing the assistance payable under the State's approved plan for such month; or
(2) Such greater amount as the State may specify.
(b)
December 1973 income.
“December 1973 income” means an amount equal to the aggregate of:
(1)
Money payments.
The amount of the aid or assistance in the form of money payments (as defined in 45 CFR 234.11(a)) which an individual would have received (including any part of such amount which is attributable to meeting special needs or special circumstances) under a State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan relating to
eligibility for and amount of such aid or assistance payable thereunder which were in effect for the month of June 1973 together with the bonus value of food stamps for January 1972 if for such month such individual resides in a State which SSA has determined provides supplementary payments the level of which has been found by SSA pursuant to section 8 of Pub. L. 93-233 (87 Stat. 956) to have been specifically increased so as to include the bonus value of food stamps, and
(2)
Income.
The amount of the income of such individual other than aid or assistance, received by such individual in December 1973, remaining after application of all appropriate income exclusions and used in computation of the amount of aid or assistance, minus any such income which did not result, but which if properly reported, would have resulted in a reduction in the amount of such aid or assistance. Income, which because a State paid less than 100% of its standard of need, did not cause a reduction in the amount of aid or assistance is included.
(c)
Special needs or circumstances.
Special needs or circumstances include needs of essential persons (as defined in § 416.222), special allowances for housing, and such other situations for which money payments to or for an eligible individual were made under a State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act as in effect for June 1973.
(d)
Optional supplement payable.
A recipient meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section who would otherwise qualify for a payment under a State's program of optional State supplementation (provided for by § 416.2010) which is greater than the amount required by paragraph (a) of this section, shall be paid such greater amount.
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 51 FR 10616, Mar. 14, 1986; 62 FR 313, Jan. 3, 1997]
§ 416.2055
Mandatory minimum supplementation reduced.
If for any month after December 1973 there is a change with respect to any special need or special circumstance which, if such change had existed in December 1973, would have caused a reduction in the amount of such individual's aid or assistance payment, then, for such month and for each month thereafter, the amount of the mandatory minimum supplement payable to such individual may, at the option of the State, be reduced in accordance with the terms and conditions of the State's plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act in effect for the month of June 1973.
§ 416.2060
Mandatory minimum supplementary payments not applicable.
An individual eligible for mandatory minimum supplementary payments from a State beginning in January 1974 shall not be eligible for such payments:
(a)
Month after the month of death.
Beginning with the month after the month in which the individual dies; or
(b)
Not aged, blind, or disabled.
Beginning with the first month after the month in which such individual ceases to be an aged, blind, or disabled individual (as defined in § 416.202); or
(c)
Not entitled to a Federal payment.
During any month in which such individual was ineligible to receive supplemental income benefits under title XVI of the Social Security Act by reason of the provisions of section 1611(e) (1)(A), (2) or (3), 1611(f), or 1615(c) of such Act; or
(d)
Month of change in residence.
During any full month such individual is not a resident of such State.
§ 416.2065
Mandatory minimum State supplementation: Agreement deemed.
A State shall be deemed to have entered into an agreement with the Commissioner under which such State shall provide mandatory minimum supplementary payments if such State has entered into an agreement with the Commissioner under section 1616 of the Act under which:
(a)
Other eligible individuals.
Supplementary payments are made to individuals other than those aged, blind, and disabled individuals who were eligible to receive aid or assistance in the form of money payments for the month of December 1973 under a State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act, under terms and conditions of such plan in effect for June 1973, and
(b)
Minimum requirements.
Supplementary payments which meet the mandatory minimum requirements of this subpart are payable to all aged, blind, or disabled individuals who were eligible to receive aid or assistance in the form of money payments for the month of December 1973 under a State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act, under terms and conditions of such plan in effect for June 1973.
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]
§ 416.2070
Mandatory supplementation: State compliance not applicable.
The requirement that a State must have in effect an agreement with the Commissioner whereby such State shall provide individual aged, blind, and disabled recipients residing in the State mandatory minimum supplementary payments beginning in January 1974 shall not be applicable in the case of any State where:
(a)
State constitution.
The State constitution limits expenditures that may be paid as public assistance to, or on behalf of, any needy person to an amount that does not exceed the amount of State public assistance payments that are matched by Federal funds under title I, IV, X, XIV, XVI or XIX of the Social Security Act making it impossible for such State to enter into and commence carrying out (on January 1, 1974) such agreement with the Commissioner, and
(b)
Attorney General decision.
The Attorney General (or other appropriate State official) has, prior to July 1, 1973, made a finding that the State constitution of such State contains limitations which prevent such State from making supplementary payments of the type described in section 1616 of the Act.

§ 416.2075
Monitoring of mandatory minimum supplementary payments.
(a)
Access to records.
Any State entering into an agreement with the Commissioner whereby such State will provide mandatory minimum supplementary payments in accordance with § 416.2001(c) shall agree that the Commissioner shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the State involving transactions related to this agreement.
(b)
Additional data.
Any State entering into an agreement in accordance with § 416.2005 shall provide the Commissioner with such additional data at such times as the Commissioner may reasonably require in order to properly, economically, and efficiently be assessed of such State's compliance with such State agreements.
[40 FR 7640, Feb. 21, 1975, as amended at 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]
§ 416.2090
State funds transferred for supplementary payments.
(a)
Payment transfer and adjustment.
(1) Any State which has entered into an agreement with SSA which provides for Federal administration of such State's supplementary payments shall transfer to SSA:
(i) An amount of funds equal to SSA's estimate of State supplementary payments for any month which shall be made by SSA on behalf of such State; and
(ii) An amount of funds equal to SSA's estimate of administration fees for any such month determined in the manner described in § 416.2010(b)(1); and
(iii) If applicable, an amount of funds equal to SSA's determination of the costs incurred by the Federal government in furnishing additional services for the State as described in § 416.2010(b)(2).
(2) In order for SSA to make State supplementary payments on behalf of a State for any month as provided by the agreement, the estimated amount of State funds referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, necessary to make those payments for the month, together with the estimated amount of administration fees referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, for that month, must be on deposit with SSA on the State supplementary payment transfer date, which is the fifth Federal business day following the day in the month that the regularly recurring monthly supplemental security income payments are issued. The additional services fee referred to in paragraph
(a)(1)(iii) of this section shall be on deposit with SSA on the date specified by SSA. The amount of State funds paid to SSA for State supplementary payments and the amount paid for administration fees will be adjusted as necessary to maintain the balance with State supplementary payments paid out by SSA on behalf of the State, and administration fees owed to SSA, respectively.
(b)
Accounting of State funds.
(1) As soon as feasible, after the end of each calendar month, SSA will provide the State with a statement showing, cumulatively, the total amounts paid by SSA on behalf of the State during the current Federal fiscal year; the fees charged by SSA to administer such supplementary payments; any additional services fees charged the State; the State's total liability therefore; and the end-of-month balance of the State's cash on deposit with SSA.
(2) SSA shall provide an accounting of State funds received as State supplementary payments, administration fees, and additional services fees, within three calendar months following the termination of an agreement under § 416.2005.
(3) Adjustments will be made because of State funds due and payable or amounts of State funds recovered for calendar months for which the agreement was in effect. Interest will be incurred by SSA and the States with respect to the adjustment and accounting of State supplementary payments funds in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of the United States Department of the Treasury.
(c)
State audit.
Any State entering into an agreement with SSA which provides for Federal administration of the State's supplementary payments has the right to an audit (at State expense) of the payments made by SSA on behalf of such State. The Secretary and the State shall mutually agree upon a satisfactory audit arrangement to verify that supplementary payments paid by SSA on behalf of the State were made in accordance with the terms of the administration agreement under § 416.2005. Resolution of audit findings shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the State's agreement with SSA.
(d)
Advance payment and adjustment not applicable.
The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply with respect to any State supplementary payment for which reimbursement is available from the Social and Rehabilitation Service pursuant to the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975 (Pub. L. 94-23; 89 Stat. 87), as amended, since such amounts are not considered to be State supplementary payments.

§ 416.2095
Pass-along of Federal benefit increases.
(a)
General.
This section and the four sections that follow describe the rules for passing along increases in the Federal SSI benefit to recipients of State supplementary payments.
(1) Section 416.2095(b) indicates when the pass-along rules apply to State supplementary payments.
(2) Section 416.2096 describes the basic pass-along rules. The States must have an agreement to “pass-along” increases in Federal SSI benefits. A State passes along an increase when it maintains (rather than decreases) the levels of all its supplementary payments after a Federal benefit increase has occurred. Generally, a pass-along of the increase permits recipients to receive an additional amount in combined benefits equal to the Federal benefit increase. Except for the supplementary payment level made to residents of Medicaid facilities (see § 416.2096(d)), a State can decrease one or more of its payment levels if it meets an annual total expenditures test.
(3) Section 416.2097 explains the required combined supplementary/SSI payment level.
(4) Section 416.2098 explains how to compute the March 1983, December 1981, and December 1976 supplementary payment levels.
(5) Section 416.2099 discusses what information a State must provide to the Commissioner concerning its supplementation programs so that the Commissioner can determine whether the State is in compliance. That section also discusses the basis for findings of noncompliance and what will
occur if a State is found out of compliance.
(b)
When the pass-along provisions apply.
(1) The pass-along requirements apply to all States (and the District of Columbia) that make supplementary payments on or after June 30, 1977, and wish to participate in the Medicaid program.
(2) The pass-along requirements apply to both optional State supplementary payments of the type described in § 416.2001(a) and mandatory minimum State supplementary payments as described in § 416.2001(c), whether or not these State supplementary payments are Federally administered.
(3) The requirements apply to State supplementary payments both for recipients who receive Federal SSI benefits and those who, because of countable income, receive only a State supplementary payment.
(4) The requirements apply to State supplementary payments for recipients eligible for a State supplementary payment on or after June 30, 1977.
(5) Supplementary payments made by a State include payments made by a political subdivision (including Indian tribes) where—
(i) The payment levels are set by the State; and
(ii) The payments are funded in whole or in part by the State.
[52 FR 36241, Sept. 28, 1987, as amended at 54 FR 19165, May 4, 1989; 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997]
§ 416.2096
Basic pass-along rules.
(a)
State agreements to maintain supplementary payment levels.
(1) In order to be eligible to receive Medicaid reimbursement, any State that makes supplementary payments, other than payments to residents of Medicaid facilities where Medicaid pays more than 50 percent of the cost of their care (see paragraph (d) of this section for definition of Medicaid facility and § 416.414 for discussion of the reduced SSI benefit amount payable to residents of Medicaid facilities), on or after June 30, 1977, must have in effect an agreement with the Commissioner. In this agreement—
(i) The State must agree to continue to make the supplementary payments;
(ii) For months from July 1977 through March 1983, the State must agree to maintain the supplementary payments at levels at least equal to the December 1976 levels (or, if a State first makes supplementary payments after December 1976, the levels for the first month the State makes supplementary payments). For months in the period July 1, 1982 through March 31, 1983, a State may elect to maintain the levels described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and
(iii) For months after March 1983, the State must agree to maintain supplementary payments at least sufficient to maintain the combined supplementary/SSI payment levels in effect in March 1983, increased by any subsequent SSI benefit increases, except as provided in § 416.2097(b) and § 416.2097(c).
(2) We will find that the State has met the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the State has the appropriate agreement in effect and complies with the conditions in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. We will consider a State to have made supplementary payments on or after June 30, 1977, unless the State furnishes us satisfactory evidence to the contrary.
(b)
Meeting the pass-along requirements—supplementary payment levels.
The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the supplementary payment level for residents of Medicaid facilities (see paragraph (d) of this section).
(1) We will consider a State to have met the requirements for maintaining its supplementary payment levels (described in § 416.2098) for a particular month or months after March 1983 if the combined supplementary/SSI payment levels have not been reduced below the levels in effect in March 1983 (or if a State first made supplementary payments after March 1983, the combined supplementary/SSI payment levels in effect the first month the State made supplementary payments), increased by any subsequent Federal SSI benefit increases, except as provided in § 416.2097(b) and § 416.2097(c). We will consider a State to have met the requirements for maintaining its supplementary payment levels for a particular month or months between June
1977 and April 1983 if the supplementary payment levels have not been reduced below the levels in effect in December 1976 (or if a State first made supplementary payments after December 1976, the levels in effect the first month the State made supplementary payments, or in certain cases described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the levels in effect in December 1981.)
(2) We will also consider a State to have met the requirements for maintaining its supplementary payment levels for a particular month or months in the period July 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, if the State had met the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section for a particular month or months in the 12-month period July 1, 1981 through June 30, 1982, and, with respect to any month in the period July 1, 1982 through March 31, 1983, the State maintained the payment levels in effect in December 1981.
(3) If a State reduced any of its supplementary payment levels for a month or months within any 12-month period beginning with the effective date of a Federal benefit increase, we will consider the State to have met the requirement to maintain its supplementary payment levels if—
(i) Within 12 months after the relevant 12-month period, the State restores the levels retroactively; and
(ii) The State makes a single retroactive benefit payment to each of the beneficiaries eligible for the retroactive payment.
(c)
Meeting the passalong requirement—total expenditures. Exception—
The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the supplementary payment level for residents of Medicaid facilities (see paragraph (d) of this section).
(1) If a State does not meet the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section, we will consider a State to have met the requirement for maintaining supplementary payment levels for a particular month or months if total State expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period within which the month or months fall, beginning on the effective date of a Federal SSI benefit increase, are at least equal to the total State expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period immediately before the Federal SSI benefit increase provided that the State was in compliance for such preceding 12-month period. The combined Federal/State payment level for those persons receiving a mandatory minimum State supplementary payment can be no lower than the recipient's total income for December 1973 as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of Pub. L. 93-66.
(2) If total State expenditures in the relevant 12-month period are less than the total expenditures in the preceding 12-month period (a “shortfall”), we also will consider a State to have met the requirement for maintaining supplementary payment levels for the relevant 12-month period if in the following 12-month period the State increases the total expenditures required for that period by an amount at least equal to the amount of the shortfall in the relevant 12-month period. The increased amount up to the amount needed to correct the shortfall shall be deemed to be an expenditure in the relevant 12-month period, for pass-along purposes only. (See paragraph (c)(5) of this section.)
(3)(i) Exception for the 6-month period from July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983: We will consider the State to have met the total-expenditures requirement for the 6-month period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, if—
(A) Total expenditures for State supplementary payments for the period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, equal or exceed the total of such expenditures for the period July l, 1982 through December 31, 1982;
(B) Total expenditures for State supplementary payments for the period January 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, equal or exceed the total of such expenditures for the period January 1, 1982 through December 31, 1982; or
(C) Total expenditures for State supplementary payments for the period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983 equal or exceed one-half of the total of such expenditures for the period July 1, 1982 through June 30, 1983. The provisions of paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section and of § 416.2099 (b), (c), and (d) shall apply to this 6-month period in the same manner as they apply to the 12-month periods referred to therein.
(ii) Exception for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1981: If a State did not meet the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section, we will consider a State to have met the maintenance-of-supplementary-payment-levels requirement for this 12-month period if the State's expenditures for supplementary payments in that period were at least equal to its expenditures for such payments for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1977 (or, if the State made no supplementary payments in that period, the expenditures for the first 12-month period ending June 30 in which the State made such payments); if a State made additional State supplementary payments during the period July 1, 1981 through June 30, 1982, in order to make up a shortfall in the 12-month period ending June 30, 1981 (determined by a comparison with the preceding 12-month period) which later resulted in an excess payment (determined by comparison with the 12-month period July 1, 1976 through June 30, 1977) we will credit the State with the amount of the excess payments if the State so requests. This credit will be applied to any shortfall(s) in total expenditures (should one exist) in any period(s) ending on or before December 31, 1986.
(4) Total State expenditures for supplementary payments are the State's total payments for both mandatory minimum and optional State supplementary payments in the appropriate 12-month period less any amounts deemed to be expenditures for another 12-month period under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, less the amount of any payments recovered and other adjustments made in that period. Total State expenditures do not include State administrative expenses, interim assistance payments, vendor payments, or payments made under other Federal programs, such as titles IV, XIX, or XX of the Social Security Act.
(5) Adjustments in total State supplementary payments made after the expiration of the relevant 12-month period for purposes of meeting total State expenditures under paragraph (c) of this section shall be considered a State expenditure in the relevant 12-month period only for purposes of the pass-along requirement. For purposes of § 416.2090 of this part, which discusses the rules for limitation on fiscal liability of States (hold harmless), these retroactive adjustments are State expenditures when made and shall be counted as a State expenditure in the fiscal year in which the adjustments are made.
(6) To determine whether a State's expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of any increase in the level of SSI benefits are not less than the State's expenditures for the payments in the preceding 12-month period, in computing the State's expenditures, we disregard, pursuant to a one-time election of the State, all expenditures by the State for the retroactive supplementary payments that are required to be made under the
Sullivan
v.
Zebley,
493 U.S. 521 (1990) class action.
(d)
Payments to residents to Medicaid facilities.
A Medicaid facility is a medical care facility where Medicaid pays more than 50 percent of the cost of a person's care. In order to be eligible to receive Medicaid reimbursement, any State that has a supplementary payment level for residents of Medicaid facilities on or after October 1, 1987, must have in effect an agreement with the Commissioner to maintain such supplementary payment level at least equal to the October 1987 level (or if a State first makes such supplementary payments after October 1, 1987, but before July 1, 1988, the level for the first month the State makes such supplementary payments).
[52 FR 36241, Sept. 28, 1987, as amended at 54 FR 19165, May 4, 1989; 56 FR 55453, Oct. 28, 1991; 62 FR 30984, June 6, 1997; 62 FR 38455, July 18, 1997; 65 FR 16815, Mar. 30, 2000]
§ 416.2097
Combined supplementary/SSI payment levels.
(a) Other than the level for residents of Medicaid facilities (see paragraph (d) of this section), the combined supplementary/SSI payment level for each payment category that must be provided in any month after March 1983 (or if a State first made supplementary payments after March 1983, the combined supplementary SSI payment levels in effect the first month the State made supplementary payments) in
order for a State to meet the requirement of the first sentence of § 416.2096(b) is the sum of—
(1) The SSI Federal benefit rate (FBR) for March 1983 for a recipient with no countable income;
(2) That portion of the July 1983 benefit increase computed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;
(3) The full amount of all SSI benefit increases after July 1983; and
(4) The State supplementary payment level for March 1983 as determined under § 416.2098.
(b) The monthly FBR's were increased in July 1983 by $20 for an eligible individual and $30 for an eligible couple, and the monthly increment for essential persons was increased by $10 in lieu of the expected cost-of-living adjustment which was delayed until January 1984. However, in computing the required combined supplementary/SSI payment levels for the purpose of determining pass-along compliance, we use only the amounts by which the FBR's and the essential person increment would have increased had there been a cost-of-living adjustment in July 1983 (a 3.5 percent increase would have occurred). These amounts are $9.70 for an eligible individual, $14.60 for an eligible couple and $4.50 for an essential person.
(c) For the 24-month period January 1, 1984, through December 31, 1985, a State will not be found out of compliance with respect to its payment levels if in the period January 1, 1986, through December 31, 1986, its supplementary payment levels are not less than its supplementary payment levels in effect in December 1976 increased by the percentage by which the FBR has increased after December 1976 and before February 1986. The FBR for an individual in December 1976 was $167.80. The FBR for an individual in effect on January 31, 1986, was $336.00, an increase of 100.24 percent over the December 1976 FBR. In order for a State to take advantage of this provision for the 24-month period January 1, 1984, through December 31, 1985, the State supplementary payment levels in effect for calendar year 1986 must be at least 100.24 percent higher than the State supplementary payment levels in effect in December 1976. This provision does not apply to State supplementary payments to recipients in Federal living arrangement “D” (residents of a medical facility where title XIX pays more than 50 percent of the costs).
(d) The combined supplementary/SSI payment level which must be maintained for residents of Medicaid facilities is the State supplement payable on October 1, 1987, or if no such payments were made on October 1, 1987, the supplementary payment amount made in the first month that a supplementary payment was made after October 1987 but before July 1, 1988, plus the Federal benefit rate in effect in October 1987 increased by $5 for an individual/$10 for a couple effective July 1, 1988.
[52 FR 36242, Sept. 28, 1987, as amended at 54 FR 19165, May 4, 1989; 54 FR 23018, May 30, 1989]
§ 416.2098
Supplementary payment levels.
(a)
General.
For the purpose of determining the combined supplementary/SSI payment levels described in § 416.2097(a) (
i.e.
, the levels that must be provided in any month after March 1983), the supplementary payment level, except for the level for residents of Medicaid facilities (see § 416.2097(d)), for each payment category must be no less than the total State payment for March 1983 for that payment category that a State provided an eligible individual (or couple) with no countable income in excess of the FBR for March 1983. For States that did not make supplementary payments in March 1983, the supplementary payment level for each payment category must be no less than the total State payment for the first month after March 1983 in which a State makes supplementary payments.
(b)
Calculation of the required mandatory minimum State supplementary payment level.
(1) Except for States described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the mandatory minimum State supplementary payment level for March 1983 is a recipient's December 1973 income, as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of Pub. L. 93-66, plus any State increases prior to April 1983, less any reductions made at any time after December 1973 due to changes in special needs or circumstances, less the
March 1983 FBR. The amount determined under the previous sentence shall continue for April, May, and June 1983. For July 1983 and later the amount calculated in the first sentence shall continue except that it may be reduced by the amount of the July 1983 Federal increase that was not related to the cost of living (
i.e.
, $10.30), so long as that reduction does not cause the mandatory minimum State supplementary level to fall below that required by section 212(a)(3)(A) of Pub. L. 93-66.
(2) Section 1618(c) of the Act permitted any State that had satisfied the requirements of section 1618 of the Act by the total-expenditures method for the 12-month period July 1, 1981, through June 30, 1982, and that elected to change and meet the section 1618 requirements by the maintenance-of-payment-levels method for the period July 1, 1982, through June 30, 1983, to do so by paying benefits at levels no lower than the levels of such payments in effect for December 1981. However, a recipient's December 1981 total income (December 1981 mandatory minimum State supplement plus the FBR) could not be less than the recipient's total income for December 1973 as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of Pub. L. 93-66. For a State that elected the option in the preceding two sentences, the mandatory minimum State supplementary payment level for March 1983 is a recipient's December 1981 total income (but not less than the total income for December 1973 as defined by section 212(a)(3)(B) of Pub. L. 93-66) plus any State increases after December 1981 and prior to April 1983, less any reductions made at any time after December 1981 due to changes in special needs or circumstances, less the March 1983 FBR. The amount determined under the previous sentence shall continue for April, May, and June 1983. For July 1983 and later, the amount calculated under the preceding sentence defining the required March 1983 mandatory minimum State supplementary payment level would continue except that it may be reduced by the amount of the July 1983 Federal increase that was not related to the cost of living (
i.e.
, $10.30), so long as that reduction does not cause the mandatory minimum State supplementary level to fall below that required by section 212(a)(3)(A) of Pub. L. 93-66.
(c)
Calculation of the required optional State supplementary payment level for flat grant amounts.
The optional State supplementary payment level for March 1983 for flat grant amounts is the total amount that an eligible individual (or couple) with no countable income received for March 1983 in excess of the FBR for March 1983. The amount determined under the previous sentence shall continue for April, May, and June 1983. For July 1983 and later the amount calculated in the first sentence shall continue except that it may be reduced by the amount of the July 1983 Federal increase that was not related to the cost of living (
i.e.
, $10.30). If the State varied its payment levels for different groups of recipients (e.g., paid recipients different amounts based on eligibility categories, geographic areas, living arrangements, or marital status), each variation represents a separate supplementary payment level.
(d)
Calculation of the required optional State supplementary payment level for individually budgeted grant amounts.
The optional State supplementary payment level for individually budgeted grant amounts for March 1983 is the amount that the State budgeted for March 1983 in excess of the March 1983 FBR for an eligible individual (or couple) having the same needs and no countable income. The amount determined under the previous sentence shall continue for April, May, and June 1983. For July 1983 and later the amount calculated in the first sentence shall continue except that it may be reduced by the amount of the July 1983 Federal increase that was not related to the cost of living (
i.e.
, $10.30).
(e)
Optional State supplementary payment level for per diem based grant amounts.
(1) The optional State supplementary payment level for March 1983 for per diem grant amounts is the total dollar amount that the State paid to an eligible individual (or couple) with no countable income at rates in effect for March 1983 (number of days in the calendar month multiplied by the March 1983 per diem rate plus any March 1983 personal needs allowance) in excess of the March 1983 FBR.

# Example:

−284.30
March 1983 FBR.
235.10
State supplementary payment level.
(2) The optional State supplementary payment level for months subsequent to March 1983 for per diem grant amounts is the total dollar amount that the State paid to an individual (or couple) with no countable income at rates in effect in March 1983 (number of days in the calendar month multiplied by the March 1983 per diem rate plus any March 1983 personal needs allowance) in excess of the March 1983 FBR for an individual (or couple) with no countable income increased by all FBR increases subsequent to March 1983 with the exception of the July 1, 1983 increase. For the July 1, 1983 increase to the FBR, a State need pass-along only that portion of the increase which represented the increase in the cost of living adjustment (3.5 percent).

# Example:
Note:
Example assumes the State passed along only $9.70 of the $20.00 increase in the FBR effective July 1, 1983.
The March 1983 combined supplementary/SSI payment level for a 31-day month was $519.40.

The required July 1983 combined supplementary/SSI payment level for a 31-day month was $529.10. This amount is equal to the March 1983 combined payment amount for a 31-day month plus the July 1983 COLA-equivalent ($519.40 + $9.70).
(f)
Required optional State supplementary payment level for months prior to April 1983.
In determining pass-along compliance under the maintenance-of-payment-levels test for months from July 1977 through March 1983, we used December 1976 (or December 1981 under the circumstances described in paragraph (g) of this section) as the standard month for determining the required State supplementary payment level. To determine the December 1976 State supplementary payment levels for categories described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section substitute “December 1976” for “March 1983” and “January 1977” for “April 1983” whenever they appear in these paragraphs only.
(g)
Alternative required optional State supplementary payment level for July 1982 through March 1983.
States which were in compliance solely under the total-expenditures test for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1982, had the option of substituting December 1981 for December 1976 and switching to the maintenance-of-payment-levels test for July 1982 through March 1983 (see § 416.2096(b)(2)). If this situation applies, determine the December 1981 State supplementary payment levels for categories described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section by substituting “December 1981” for “March 1983” and “January 1982” for “April 1983” whenever they appear in these paragraphs only.

§ 416.2099
Compliance with pass-along.
(a)
Information regarding compliance.
Any State required to enter into a pass-along agreement with the Commissioner shall provide appropriate and timely information to demonstrate to the Commissioner's satisfaction that the State is meeting the pass-along requirements. The information shall include, where relevant—
(1) The State's December 1976 supplementary payment levels, any subsequent supplementary payment levels,
and any change in State eligibility requirements. If the State made no supplementary payments in December 1976, it shall provide such information about the first month in which it makes supplementary payments;
(2) The State's March 1983 supplementary payment levels, any subsequent supplementary payment levels, and any changes in State eligibility requirements;
(3) The total State expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period beginning July 1976 through June 1977, in each subsequent 12-month period, and in any other 12-month period beginning on the effective date of a Federal SSI benefit increase. The State shall also submit advance estimates of its total supplementary payments in each 12-month period covered by the agreement;
(4) The total State expenditures for supplementary payments in the 6-month periods July 1, 1982 through December 31, 1982 and July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983; and
(5) The State supplementary payment level payable to residents of Medicaid facilities (see § 416.2096(d)) on October 1, 1987 (or, if a State first makes such supplementary payments after October 1, 1987, but before July 1, 1988, the level for the month the State first makes such supplementary payments). The State shall also report all changes in such payment levels.
(b)
Records.
Except where the Commissioner administers the State supplementary payments, the State shall maintain records about its supplementary payment levels and total 12-month (or 6-month where applicable) expenditures for supplementary payments and permit inspection and audit by the Commissioner or someone designated by the Commissioner.
(c)
Noncompliance by the States.
Any State that makes supplementary payments on or after June 30, 1977, and does not have a pass-along agreement with the Commissioner in effect, shall be determined by the Commissioner to be ineligible for payments under title XIX of the Act. A State does not have an agreement in effect if it has not entered into an agreement or has not complied with the terms of the agreement. Ineligibility shall apply to total expenditures for any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 1977, for which a State has not entered into an agreement. A State that enters into an agreement but does not maintain its payment levels or meet the total-expenditures test in a particular 12-month or transitional 6-month period, shall be determined by the Commissioner not to have an agreement in effect for any month that the State did not meet the pass-along requirements during that particular period. The State shall then be ineligible for title XIX payments for any calendar quarter containing a month for which an agreement was not in effect. If a State first makes supplementary payments beginning with a month after June 1977, ineligibility shall apply to any calendar quarter beginning after the calendar quarter in which the State first makes payments.
(d)
Notices to States about potential noncompliance.
Within 90 days after the end of the relevant 12-month period, the Commissioner shall send a notice to any State that has not maintained its supplementary payment levels and that appears not to have maintained its total expenditures during the period. The notice will advise the State of the available methods of compliance and the time within which corrective action must be taken (see §§ 416.2096(b)(3) and 416.2096(c)(2)) in order to avoid a determination of noncompliance. If the State fails to take the corrective action, the Commissioner shall make a timely determination of noncompliance.

§ 416.2101
Introduction.
(a)
What is in this subpart.
This subpart describes the agreements we make with States under which we determine the Medicaid eligibility of individuals who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. It includes a general description of the services we will provide under these agreements and the costs to the States for the services.
(b)
Related regulations.
The comprehensive regulations on eligibility for the Medicaid program, administered by the Health Care Financing Administration, are in part 435 of title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
(c)
Definitions.
In this subpart—
SSI benefits
means Federal SSI benefits, including special SSI cash benefits under section 1619(a) of the Social Security Act. In addition, we consider a person who has special SSI eligibility status under section 1619(b) of the Social Security Act to be receiving SSI benefits.
State Medicaid Plan
means a State's medical assistance plan which the Secretary has approved under title XIX of the Act for Federal payment of a share of the State's medical assistance expenses.
State supplementary payments
means supplementary payments we administer for a State under subpart T of this part.
We, us,
or
our
refers to the Social Security Administration.
§ 416.2111
Conditions for our agreeing to make Medicaid eligibility determinations.
We will agree to make Medicaid eligibility determinations for a State only if the State's Medicaid eligibility requirements for recipients of SSI benefits and for recipients of State supplementary payments are the same as the requirements for receiving SSI benefits and the requirements for receiving State supplementary payments, respectively. Exceptions: We may agree to make Medicaid eligibility determinations—
(a) For one, two, or all of the three categories of people (
i.e.
, aged, blind, and disabled) who receive SSI benefits or State supplementary payments; or
(b) Even though the State's Medicaid eligibility requirements for recipients of SSI benefits or of State supplementary payments, or both, differ from the requirements for SSI or State supplementary payments, or both, in ways mandated by Federal law.
§ 416.2116
Medicaid eligibility determinations.
If a State requests, we may agree, under the conditions in this subpart, to make Medicaid eligibility determinations on behalf of the State. Under these agreements, we make the Medicaid determinations when determinations or redeterminations are necessary for SSI purposes. Our determinations may include non-SSI requirements that are mandated by Federal law. When we determine that a person is eligible for Medicaid in accordance with § 416.2111 or that we are not making the determination, we notify the State of that fact.
§ 416.2130
Effect of the agreement and responsibilities of States.
(a) An agreement under this subpart does not change—
(1) The provisions of a State's Medicaid plan;
(2) The conditions under which the Secretary will approve a State's Medicaid plan; or
(3) A State's responsibilities under the State Medicaid plan.
(b) Following are examples of functions we will not agree to carry out for the State:
(1) Stationing of our employees at hospitals or nursing homes to take Medicaid applications;
(2) Determining whether a person is eligible for Medicaid for any period before he or she applied for SSI benefits;
(3) Giving approval for emergency medical care under Medicaid before a determination has been made on whether a person is eligible for SSI benefits;
(4) Setting up or running a State's system for requiring a person to pay part of the cost of services he or she receives under Medicaid; or
(5) Giving identification cards to people to show that they are eligible for Medicaid.
§ 416.2140
Liability for erroneous Medicaid eligibility determinations.
If the State suffers any financial loss, directly or indirectly, through using any information we provide under an agreement described in this subpart, we will not be responsible for that loss. However, if we erroneously tell a State that a person is eligible for Medicaid and the State therefore makes erroneous Medicaid payments, the State will be paid the Federal share of those payments under the Medicaid program as if they were correct.
§ 416.2145
Services other than Medicaid determinations.
We will agree under authority of section 1106 of the Act and 31 U.S.C. 6505 to provide services other than Medicaid determinations to help the State administer its Medicaid program. We will do this only if we determine it is the most efficient and economical way to accomplish the State's purpose and does not interfere with administration of the SSI program. The services can be part of a Medicaid eligibility determination agreement or a separate agreement. Under either agreement we will—
(a) Give the State basic information relevant to Medicaid eligibility from individuals' applications for SSI benefits;
(b) Give the State answers to certain purely Medicaid-related questions (in addition to any that may be necessary under § 416.2111(b)), such as whether the SSI applicant has any unpaid medical expenses for the current month or the previous 3 calendar months;
(c) Conduct statistical or other studies for the State; and
(d) Provide other services the State and we agree on.
§ 416.2161
Charges to States.
(a)
States with Medicaid eligibility determination agreement.
A State with which we have an agreement to make Medicaid eligibility determinations is charged in the following manner:
(1) If making Medicaid determinations and providing basic SSI application information for a State causes us additional cost, the State must pay half of that additional cost. “Additional cost” in this section means cost in addition to costs we would have had anyway in administering the SSI program.
(2) The State must pay half our additional cost caused by providing any information that we collect for Medicaid purposes and by any other services directly related to making Medicaid eligibility determinations.
(3) The State must pay our full additional cost for statistical or other studies and any other services that are not directly related to making Medicaid eligibility determinations.
(b)
States without Medicaid eligibility determination agreement.
A State with which we do not have an agreement to make Medicaid eligibility determinations is charged in the following manner:
(1) If providing basic SSI application information causes us additional cost, the State must pay our full additional cost.
(2) The State must pay our full additional cost caused by providing any information that we collect for Medicaid purposes and for statistical or other studies and any other services.
§ 416.2166
Changing the agreement.
The State and we can agree in writing to change the agreement at any time.
§ 416.2171
Duration of agreement.
An agreement under this subpart is automatically renewed for 1 year at the end of the term stated in the agreement and again at the end of each 1-year renewal term, unless—
(a) The State and we agree in writing to end it at any time;
(b) Either the State or we end it at any time without the other's consent by giving written notice at least 90 days before the end of a term, or 120 days before any other ending date selected by whoever wants to end the agreement; or
(c)(1) The State fails to pay our costs as agreed;
(2) We notify the State in writing, at least 30 days before the ending date we select, why we intend to end the agreement; and
(3) The State does not give a good reason for keeping the agreement in
force beyond the ending date we selected. If the State does provide a good reason, the termination will be postponed or the agreement will be kept in force until the end of the term.
§ 416.2176
Disagreements between a State and us.
(a) If a State with which we have an agreement under this subpart and we are unable to agree about any question of performance under the agreement, the State may appeal the question to the Commissioner of Social Security. The Commissioner or his or her designee will, within 90 days after receiving the State's appeal, give the State either a written decision or a written explanation of why a decision cannot be made within 90 days, what is needed before a decision can be made, and when a decision is expected to be made.
(b) The Commissioner's decision will be the final decision of the Social Security Administration.

# Authority:
Secs. 702(a)(5), 1615, 1631(d)(1) and (e), and 1633(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 902(a)(5), 1382d, 1383(d)(1) and (e), and 1383b(a)).

# General Provisions
§ 416.2201
General.
In general, sections 1615(d) and (e) of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorize payment from the general fund for the reasonable and necessary costs of vocational rehabilitation (VR) services provided certain disabled or blind individuals who are eligible for supplemental security income (SSI) benefits, special SSI eligibility status, or federally administered State supplementary payments. In this subpart, such benefits, status, or payments are referred to as disability or blindness benefits (see § 416.2203). Subject to the provisions of this subpart, payment may be made for VR services provided an individual during a month(s) for which the individual is eligible for disability or blindness benefits, including the continuation of such benefits under section 1631(a)(6) of the Act, or for which the individual's disability or blindness benefits are suspended (see § 416.2215). Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section describe the cases in which the State VR agencies can be paid for the VR services provided such an individual under this subpart. The purpose of sections 1615(d) and (e) of the Act is to make VR services more readily available to disabled or blind individuals and ensure that savings accrue to the general fund. Payment will be made for VR services provided on behalf of such an individual in cases where—
(a) The furnishing of the VR services results in the individual's completion of a continuous 9-month period of substantial gainful activity (SGA) as specified in §§ 416.2210 through 416.2211; or
(b) The individual continues to receive disability or blindness benefits, even though his or her disability or blindness has ceased, under section 1631(a)(6) of the Act because of his or her continued participation in an approved VR program which we have determined will increase the likelihood that he or she will not return to the disability or blindness rolls (
see
§ 416.2212).

§ 416.2204
Participation by State VR agencies.
(a)
General.
In order to participate in the payment program under this subpart through its VR agency(ies), a State must have a plan which meets the requirements of title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.
(b)
Participation by States.
(1) The opportunity to participate through its VR agency(ies) with respect to disabled or blind recipients in the State will be offered first to the State in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, unless the State has notified us in advance under paragraph (e)(1) of this section of its decision not to participate or to limit such participation.
(2) A State with one or more approved VR agencies may choose to limit participation of those agencies to a certain class(es) of disabled or blind recipients. For example, a State with separate VR agencies for the blind and disabled may choose to limit participation to the VR agency for the blind. In such a case, we would give the State, through its VR agency for the blind, the opportunity to participate with respect to blind recipients in the State in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. A State that chooses to limit participation of its VR agency(ies) must notify us in advance under paragraph (e)(1) of this section of its decision to limit such participation.
(c)
Opportunity for participation through State VR agencies.
(1) Unless a State has decided not to participate or to limit participation, we will give the State the opportunity to participate through its VR agency(ies) with respect to disabled or blind recipients in the State by referring such recipients first to the State VR agency(ies) for necessary VR services. A State, through its VR agency(ies), may participate with respect to any recipient so referred by accepting the recipient as a client for VR services or placing the recipient into an extended evaluation process and notifying us under paragraph (c)(2) of this section of such acceptance or placement.
(2)(i) In order for the State to participate with respect to a disabled or blind recipient whom we referred to a State VR agency, the State VR agency must notify the appropriate Regional Commissioner (SSA) in writing or through electronic notification of its decision either to accept the recipient as a client for VR services or to place the recipient into an extended evaluation process. The notice must be received by the appropriate Regional Commissioner (SSA) no later than the close of the fourth month following the month in which we referred the recipient to the State VR agency.
(ii) In any case in which a State VR agency notifies the appropriate Regional Commissioner (SSA) in writing within the stated time period under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section of its decision to place the recipient into an extended evaluation process, the State VR agency also must notify that Regional Commissioner in writing upon completion of the evaluation of its decision whether or not to accept the recipient as a client for VR services. If we receive a notice of a decision by the State VR agency to accept the recipient as a client for VR services following the completion of the extended evaluation, the State may continue to participate with respect to such recipient.
(d)
Opportunity for limited participation through State VR agencies.
If a State has decided under paragraph (e)(1) of this section to limit participation of its VR agency(ies) to a certain class(es) of disabled or blind recipients in the State, we will give the State the opportunity to participate with respect to such class(es) of disabled or blind recipients by referring such recipients first to the State VR agency(ies) for necessary VR services. The State, through its VR agency(ies), may participate with respect to any recipient so referred by accepting the recipient as a client for VR services or placing the recipient into an extended evaluation process and notifying us under paragraph (c)(2) of this section of such acceptance or placement.
(e)
Decision of a State not to participate or to limit participation.
(1) A State may choose not to participate through its VR agency(ies) with respect to any disabled or blind recipients in the State, or it may choose to limit participation of its VR agency(ies) to a certain class(es) of disabled or blind recipients in the State. A State which decides not
to participate or to limit participation must provide advance written notice of that decision to the appropriate Regional Commissioner (SSA). Unless a State specifies a later month, a decision not to participate or to limit participation will be effective beginning with the third month following the month in which the notice of the decision is received by the appropriate Regional Commissioner (SSA). The notice of the State decision must be submitted by an official authorized to act for the State for this purpose. A State must provide to the appropriate Regional Commissioner (SSA) an opinion from the State's Attorney General, verifying the authority of the official who sent the notice to act for the State. This opinion will not be necessary if the notice is signed by the Governor of the State.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) A State which has decided not to participate or to limit participation may participate later through its VR agency(ies) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. A State that decides to resume participation under paragraph (c) of this section must provide advance written notice of that decision to the appropriate Regional Commissioner (SSA). A decision of a State to resume participation under paragraph (c) of this section will be effective beginning with the third month following the month in which the notice of the decision is received by the appropriate Regional Commissioner (SSA) or, if later, with a month specified by the State. The notice of the State decision must be submitted by an official authorized to act for the State as explained in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

§ 416.2209
Responsibility for making payment decisions.
The Commissioner will decide:
(a) Whether a continuous period of 9 months of SGA has been completed;
(b) Whether a disability or blindness recipient whose disability or blindness has ceased should continue to receive benefits under section 1631(a)(6) of the Social Security Act for a month after October 1984 or, in the case of a blindness recipient, for a month after March 1988, based on his or her continued participation in a VR program;
(c) If and when medical recovery has occurred;
(d) Whether documentation of VR services and expenditures is adequate;
(e) If payment is to be based on completion of a continuous 9-month period
of SGA, whether the VR services contributed to the continuous period of SGA;
(f) Whether a VR service is a service described in § 416.2214; and
(g) What VR costs were reasonable and necessary and will be paid.
[55 FR 8456, Mar. 8, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 11918, Mar. 15, 1994; 61 FR 31026, June 19, 1996; 68 FR 40125, July 7, 2003]
§ 416.2210
What we mean by “SGA” and by “a continuous period of 9 months”.
(a)
What we mean by “SGA”.
In determining whether an individual's work is SGA, we will follow the rules in §§ 416.972 through 416.975. We will follow these same rules for individuals who are statutorily blind, but we will evaluate the earnings in accordance with the rules in § 404.1584(d) of this chapter.
(b)
What we mean by “a continuous period of 9 months”.
A continuous period of 9 months ordinarily means a period of 9 consecutive calendar months. Exception: When an individual does not perform SGA in 9 consecutive calendar months, he or she will be considered to have done so if—
(1) The individual performs 9 months of SGA within 10 consecutive months and has monthly earnings that meet or exceed the guidelines in § 416.974(b)(2), or § 404.1584(d) of this chapter if the individual is statutorily blind, or
(2) The individual performs at least 9 months of SGA within 12 consecutive months, and the reason for not performing SGA in 2 or 3 of those months was due to circumstances beyond his or her control and unrelated to the impairment (e.g., the employer closed down for 3 months).
(c)
What work we consider.
In determining if a continuous period of SGA has been completed, all of an individual's work activity may be evaluated for purposes of this section, including work performed before October 1, 1981, during a trial work period, and after eligibility for disability or blindness payments ended. We will ordinarily consider only the first 9 months of SGA that occurs. The exception will be if an individual who completed 9 months of SGA later stops performing SGA, received VR services and then performs SGA for a 9-month period. See § 416.2215 for the use of the continuous period in determining payment for VR services.
[48 FR 6297, Feb. 10, 1983, as amended at 55 FR 8457, Mar. 8, 1990]
§ 416.2211
Criteria for determining when VR services will be considered to have contributed to a continuous period of 9 months.
The State VR agency may be paid for VR services if such services contribute to the individual's performance of a continuous 9-month period of SGA. The following criteria apply to individuals who received more than just evaluation services. If a State VR agency claims payment for services to an individual who received only evaluation services, it must establish that the individual's continuous period or medical recovery (if medical recovery occurred before completion of a continuous period) would not have occurred without the services provided. In applying the criteria below, we will consider services described in § 416.2214 that were initiated, coordinated or provided, including services before October 1, 1981.
(a)
Continuous period without medical recovery.
If an individual who has completed a “continuous period” of SGA has not medically recovered as of the date of completion of the period, the determination as to whether VR services contributed will depend on whether the continuous period began one year or less after VR services ended or more than one year after VR services ended.
(1)
One year or less.
Any VR services which significantly motivated or assisted the individual in returning to, or continuing in, SGA will be considered to have contributed to the continuous period.
(2)
More than one year.
(i) If the continuous period was preceded by transitional work activity (employment or self-employment which gradually evolved, with or without periodic interruption, into SGA), and that work activity began less than a year after VR services ended, any VR services which significantly motivated or assisted the individual in returning to, or continuing in, SGA will be considered to have contributed to the continuous period.
(ii) If the continuous period was not preceded by transitional work activity that began less than a year after VR services ended, VR services will be considered to have contributed to the continuous period only if it is reasonable to conclude that the work activity which constitutes a continuous period could not have occurred without the VR services (e.g., training).
(b)
Continuous period with medical recovery occurring before completion.
(1) If an individual medically recovers before a continuous period has been completed, VR services under paragraph (a) of this section will not be payable unless some VR services contributed to the medical recovery. VR services will be considered to have contributed to the medical recovery if—
(i) The individualized written rehabilitation program (IWRP), included medical services; and
(ii) The medical recovery occurred, at least in part, because of these medical services. (For example, the individual's medical recovery was based on improvement in a back condition which, at least in part, stemmed from surgery initiated, coordinated or provided under an IWRP).
(2) In some instances, the State VR agency will not have provided, initiated, or coordinated medical services. If this happens, payment for VR services may still be possible under paragraph (a) of this section if:
(i) The medical recovery was not expected by us; and
(ii) The individual's impairment is determined by us to be of such a nature that any medical services provided would not ordinarily have resulted in, or contributed to, the medical cessation.

§ 416.2212
Payment for VR services in a case where an individual continues to receive disability or blindness benefits based on participation in an approved VR program.
Section 1631(a)(6) of the Act contains the criteria we will use in determining if an individual whose disability or blindness has ceased should continue to receive disability or blindness benefits because of his or her continued participation in an approved VR program. A VR agency can be paid for the cost of VR services provided to an individual if the individual was receiving benefits based on this provision in a month(s) after October 1984 or, in the case of a blindness recipient, in a month(s) after March 1988. If this requirement is met, a VR agency can be paid for the costs of VR services provided within the period specified in § 416.2215, subject to the other payment and administrative provisions of this subpart.
[83 FR 62461, Dec. 4, 2018]
§ 416.2214
Services for which payment may be made.
(a)
General.
Payment may be made for VR services provided by a State VR agency in accordance with title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, subject to the limitations and conditions in this subpart. VR services for which payment may be made under this subpart include only those services described in paragraph (b) of this section which are—
(1) Necessary to determine an individual's eligibility for VR services or the nature and scope of the services to be provided; or
(2) Provided by a State VR agency under an IWRP, but only if the services could reasonably be expected to motivate or assist the individual in returning to, or continuing in, SGA.
(b)
Specific services.
Payment may be made under this subpart only for the following VR services:
(1) An assessment for determining an individual's eligibility for VR services and vocational rehabilitation needs by qualified personnel, including, if appropriate, an assessment by personnel skilled in rehabilitation technology, and which includes determining—
(i) The nature and extent of the physical or mental impairment(s) and the resultant impact on the individual's employability;
(ii) The likelihood that an individual will benefit from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of employability; and
(iii) An employment goal consistent with the capacities of the individual and employment opportunities;
(2) Counseling and guidance, including personal adjustment counseling, and those referrals and other services necessary to help an individual secure needed services from other agencies;

(4) Vocational and other training services, including personal and vocational adjustment, books, tools, and other training materials, except that training or training services in institutions of higher education will be covered under this section only if maximum efforts have been made by the State VR agency to secure grant assistance in whole or in part from other sources;
(5) Maintenance expenses that are extra living expenses over and above the individual's normal living expenses and that are incurred solely because of and while the individual is participating in the VR program and that are necessary in order for the individual to benefit from other necessary VR services;
(6) Travel and related expenses necessary to transport an individual for purpose of enabling the individual's participation in other necessary VR services;
(7) Services to family members of a disabled or blind individual only if necessary to the successful vocational rehabilitation of that individual;

[59 FR 11919, Mar. 15, 1994, as amended at 83 FR 62461, Dec. 4, 2018]
§ 416.2215
When services must have been provided.
(a) In order for the VR agency to be paid, the services must have been provided—
(1) After September 30, 1981;
(2) During a month(s) for which—
(i) The individual is eligible for disability or blindness benefits or continues to receive such benefits under section 1631(a)(6) of the Act (see § 416.2212); or
(ii) The disability or blindness benefits of the individual are suspended due to his or her ineligibility for the benefits (see subpart M of this part concerning suspension for ineligibility); and
(3) Before completion of a continuous 9-month period of SGA or termination of disability or blindness benefits, whichever occurs first (see subpart M of this part concerning termination of benefits).
(b) If an individual who is receiving disability or blindness benefits under this part, or whose benefits under this part are suspended, also is entitled to disability benefits under part 404 of this chapter, the determination as to when services must have been provided may be made under this section or § 404.2115 of this chapter, whichever is advantageous to the State VR agency that is participating in both VR programs.
[61 FR 31026, June 19, 1996, as amended at 83 FR 62461, Dec. 4, 2018]
§ 416.2216
When claims for payment for VR services must be made (filing deadlines).
The State VR agency must file a claim for payment in each individual case within the following time periods:
(a) A claim for payment for VR services based on the completion of a continuous 9-month period of SGA must be
filed within 12 months after the month in which the continuous 9-month period of SGA is completed.
(b) A claim for payment for VR services provided to an individual whose disability or blindness benefits were continued after disability or blindness has ceased because of that individual's continued participation in a VR program must be filed as follows:
(1) If a written notice requesting that a claim be filed was sent to the State VR agency, a claim must be filed within 90 days following the month in which VR services end, or if later, within 90 days after receipt of the notice.
(2) If no written notice was sent to the State VR agency, a claim must be filed within 12 months after the month in which VR services end.
[55 FR 8457, Mar. 8, 1990, as amended at 61 FR 31026, June 19, 1996; 68 FR 40125, July 7, 2003; 83 FR 62461, Dec. 4, 2018]
§ 416.2217
What costs will be paid.
In accordance with section 1615(d) and (e) of the Social Security Act, the Commissioner will pay the State VR agency for the VR services described in § 416.2214 which were provided during the period described in § 416.2215 and which meet the criteria in § 416.2211 or § 416.2212, but subject to the following limitations:
(a) The cost must have been incurred by the State VR agency;
(b) The cost must not have been paid or be payable from some other source. For this purpose, State VR agencies will be required to seek payment or services from other sources in accordance with the “similar benefit” provisions under 34 CFR part 361, including making maximum efforts to secure grant assistance in whole or part from other sources for training or training services in institutions of higher education.
(c)(1) The cost must be reasonable and necessary, in that it complies with the written cost-containment policies of the State VR agency. A cost which complies with these policies will be considered necessary only if the cost is for a VR service described in § 416.2214. The State VR agency must maintain and use these cost-containment policies, including any reasonable and appropriate fee schedules, to govern the costs incurred for all VR services, including the rates of payment for all purchased services, for which payment will be requested under this subpart. For the purpose of this subpart, the written cost-containment policies must provide guidelines designed to ensure—
(i) The lowest reasonable cost for such services; and
(ii) Sufficient flexibility so as to allow for an individual's needs.
(2) The State VR agency shall submit to us before the end of the first calendar quarter of each year a written statement certifying that cost-containment policies are in effect and are adhered to in procuring and providing goods and services for which the State VR agency requests payment under this subpart. Such certification must be signed by the State's chief financial official or the head of the VR agency. Each certification must specify the basis upon which it is made, e.g., a recent audit by an authorized State, Federal or private auditor (or other independent compliance review) and the date of such audit (or compliance review). We may request the State VR agency to submit to us a copy(ies) of its specific written cost-containment policies and procedures (e.g., any guidelines and fee schedules for a given year), if we determine that such additional information is necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subpart. The State VR agency shall provide such information when requested by us.
(d) The total payment in each case, including any prior payments related to earlier continuous 9-month periods of SGA made under this subpart, must not be so high as to preclude a “net saving” to the general funds (a “net saving” is the difference between the estimated savings to the general fund, if payments for disability or blindness remain reduced or eventually terminate, and the total amount we pay to the State VR agency);
(e) Any payment to the State VR agency for either direct or indirect VR expenses must be consistent with the cost principles described in OMB Circular No. A-87, as revised;
(f) Payment for VR services or costs may be made under more than one of
the VR payment provisions described in §§ 416.2211 and 416.2212 of this subpart and similar provisions in §§ 404.2111 and 404.2112 of subpart V of part 404. However, payment will not be made more than once for the same VR service or cost; and
(g) Payment will be made for administrative costs and for counseling and placement costs. This payment may be on a formula basis, or on an actual cost basis, whichever the State VR agency prefers. The formula will be negotiated. The payment will also be subject to the preceding limitations.

# Administrative Provisions
§ 416.2218
[Reserved]
§ 416.2219
Method of payment.
Payment to the State VR agencies pursuant to this subpart will be made either by advancement of funds or by payment for services provided (with necessary adjustments for any overpayments and underpayments), as decided by the Commissioner.
[83 FR 62462, Dec. 4, 2018]
§ 416.2220
Audits.
(a)
General.
The State shall permit us and the Comptroller General of the United States (including duly authorized representatives) access to and the right to examine records relating to the services and costs for which payment was requested or made under these regulations. These records shall be retained by the State for the periods of time specified for retention of records in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR part 4, subpart 4.7).
(b)
Audit basis.
Auditing will be based on cost principles and written guidelines in effect at the time services were provided and costs were incurred. The State VR agency will be informed and given a full explanation of any questioned items. They will be given a reasonable time to explain questioned items. Any explanation furnished by the State VR agency will be given full consideration before a final determination is made on questioned items in the audit report.
(c)
Appeal of audit determinations.
The appropriate SSA Regional Commissioner will notify the State VR agency in writing of his or her final determination on the audit report. If the State VR agency disagrees with that determination, it may request reconsideration in writing within 60 days after receiving the Regional Commissioner's notice of the determination. The Commissioner will make a determination and notify the State VR agency of that decision in writing, usually, no later than 45 days from the date of the appeal. The decision by the Commissioner will be final and conclusive unless the State VR agency appeals that decision in writing in accordance with 45 CFR part 16 to the Department of Health and Human Services' Departmental Appeals Board within 30 days after receiving it.
[83 FR 62462, Dec. 4, 2018]
§ 416.2221
Validation reviews.
(a)
General.
We will conduct a validation review of a sample of the claims for payment filed by each State VR agency. We will conduct some of these reviews on a prepayment basis and some on a postpayment basis. We may review a specific claim, a sample of the claims, or all the claims filed by any State VR agency, if we determine that such review is necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subpart. For each claim selected for review, the State VR agency must submit such records of the VR services and costs for which payment has been requested or made under this subpart, or copies of such records, as we may require to ensure that the services and costs meet the requirements for payment. For claims for cases described in § 416.2201(a), a clear explanation or existing documentation which demonstrates how the service contributed to the individual's performance of a continuous 9-month period of SGA must be provided. For claims for cases described in § 416.2201(b) or (c), a clear explanation or existing documentation which demonstrates how the service was reasonably expected to motivate or assist the individual to return to or
continue in SGA must be provided. If we find in any prepayment validation review that the scope or content of the information is inadequate, we will request additional information and will withhold payment until adequate information has been provided. The State VR agency shall permit us (including duly authorized representatives) access to, and the right to examine, any records relating to such services and costs. Any review performed under this section will not be considered an audit for purposes of this subpart.
(b)
Purpose.
The primary purpose of these reviews is—
(1) To ensure that the VR services and costs meet the requirements for payment under this subpart;
(2) To assess the validity of our documentation requirements; and
(3) To assess the need for additional validation reviews or additional documentation requirements for any State VR agency to ensure compliance with the requirements under this subpart.
(c)
Determinations.
In any validation review, we will determine whether the VR services and costs meet the requirements for payment and determine the amount of payment. We will notify in writing the State VR agency of our determination. If we find in any postpayment validation review that more or less than the correct amount of payment was made for a claim, we will determine that an overpayment or underpayment has occurred and will notify the State VR agency that we will make the appropriate adjustment.
(d)
Appeals.
If the State VR agency disagrees with our determination under this section, it may appeal that determination in accordance with § 416.2227. For purposes of this section, an appeal must be filed within 60 days after receiving the notice of our determination.
[59 FR 11920, Mar. 15, 1994, as amended at 62462, Dec. 4, 2018]
§ 416.2222
Confidentiality of information and records.
The State shall comply with the provisions for confidentiality of information, including the security of systems, and records requirements described in 20 CFR part 401 and pertinent written guidelines (see § 416.2223).
[83 FR 62462, Dec. 4, 2018]
§ 416.2223
Other Federal laws and regulations.
Each State VR agency shall comply with the provisions of other Federal laws and regulations that directly affect its responsibilities in carrying out the vocational rehabilitation function.
[83 FR 62462, Dec. 4, 2018]
§ 416.2227
Resolution of disputes.
(a)
Disputes on the amount to be paid.
The appropriate SSA official will notify the State VR agency in writing of his or her determination concerning the amount to be paid. If the State VR agency disagrees with that determination, the State VR agency may request reconsideration in writing within 60 days after receiving the notice of determination. The Commissioner will make a determination and notify the State VR agency of that decision in writing, usually, no later than 45 days from the date of the State VR agency's appeal. The decision by the Commissioner will be final and conclusive upon the State VR agency unless the State VR agency appeals that decision in writing in accordance with 45 CFR part 16 to the Department of Health and Human Services' Departmental Appeals Board within 30 days after receiving the Commissioner's decision.
(b)
Disputes on whether there was a continuous period of SGA and whether VR services contributed to a continuous period of SGA.
The rules in paragraph (a) of this section will apply, except that the Commissioner's decision will be final and conclusive. There is no right of appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board.
(c)
Disputes on determinations made by the Commissioner which affect a disabled or blind beneficiary's rights to benefits.
Determinations made by the Commissioner which affect an individual's right to benefits (e.g., determinations that disability or blindness benefits should be terminated, denied, suspended, continued or begun at a different date than alleged) cannot be appealed by a State VR agency. Because these determinations are an integral
part of the disability or blindness benefits claims process, they can only be appealed by the beneficiary or applicant whose rights are affected or by his or her authorized representative. However, if an appeal of an unfavorable determination is made by the individual and is successful, the new determination would also apply for purposes of this subpart. While a VR agency cannot appeal a determination made by the Commissioner which affects a beneficiary's or applicant's rights, the VR agency can furnish any evidence it may have which would support a revision of a determination.

# Introduction, General Provisions, and Definitions
§ 418.1001
What is this subpart about?
This subpart relates to section 1839(i) of the Social Security Act (the Act), as amended. Section 1839(i) establishes an income-related monthly adjustment to the Medicare Part B premium. Beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part B who have modified adjusted gross income over a threshold amount established in the statute will pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount in addition to the Medicare Part B standard monthly premium and any applicable premium increases as described in 42 CFR 408.20. The regulations in this subpart explain how we decide whether you are required to pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount, and if you are, the amount of your adjustment. The rules are divided into the following groups of sections:
(a) Sections 418.1001 through 418.1010 contain the introduction, a statement of the general purpose of the income-related monthly adjustment amount, general provisions that apply to the income-related monthly adjustment amount, and definitions of terms that we use in this subpart.
(b) Sections 418.1101 through 418.1150 describe what information about your modified adjusted gross income we will use to determine if you are required to pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount. In these sections, we also describe how the income-related monthly adjustment amount will affect your total Medicare Part B premium.
(c) Sections 418.1201 through 418.1270 contain an explanation of the standards that you must meet for us to grant your request to use modified adjusted gross income information that you provide for a more recent tax year rather than the information described in paragraph (b) of this section. These sections explain when we may consider such a request, and the evidence that you will be required to provide. These sections also explain when income-related monthly adjustment amount determinations based on information you provide will be effective, and how long they will remain in effect. Additionally, these sections describe how retroactive adjustments of the income-related monthly adjustment amount will be made based on information you provide, updated information you provide, and information we later receive from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
(d) Sections 418.1301 through 418.1355 contain the rules that we will apply when you disagree with our determination regarding your income-related monthly adjustment amount. These sections explain your appeal rights and the circumstances under which you may request that we make a new initial determination of your income-related monthly adjustment amount.
[71 FR 62931, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 78 FR 57259, Sept. 18, 2013; 83 FR 55628, Nov. 7, 2018]
§ 418.1005
Purpose and administration.
(a) The purpose of the income-related monthly adjustment amount is to reduce the Federal subsidy of the Medicare Part B program for beneficiaries with modified adjusted gross income above an established threshold. These beneficiaries will pay a greater share of actual program costs. Medicare Part B premiums paid by beneficiaries cover approximately 25 percent of total Medicare Part B program costs and the remaining 75 percent of program costs are subsidized by the Federal Government's contributions to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The reduction in the Medicare Part B premium subsidy results in an increase in the total amount that affected beneficiaries pay for Medicare Part B coverage. A beneficiary with modified adjusted gross income above the threshold amount will pay:
(1) The Medicare Part B standard monthly premium; plus
(2) Any applicable increase in the standard monthly premium for late enrollment or reenrollment; plus
(3) An income-related monthly adjustment amount.
(b) The Centers for Medicare
Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) publishes the Medicare Part B standard monthly premium each year. CMS also establishes rules for entitlement to a nonstandard premium, as well as premium penalties for late enrollment or reenrollment (42 CFR 408.20 through 408.27).
(c) We use information that we get from IRS to determine if beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare Part B are required to pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount. We also change income-related monthly adjustment amount determinations using information provided by a beneficiary under certain circumstances. In addition, we notify beneficiaries when the social security benefit amounts they receive will change based on our income-related monthly adjustment amount determination.

# Determination of the Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount
§ 418.1101
What is the income-related monthly adjustment amount?
(a) The income-related monthly adjustment amount is an amount that you will pay in addition to the Medicare Part B standard monthly premium plus any applicable increase in that premium as described in 42 CFR 408.22 for your Medicare Part B coverage when your modified adjusted gross income is above the threshold described in § 418.1105.
(b) Your income-related monthly adjustment amount is based on your applicable modified adjusted gross income as described in § 418.1115 and your tax filing status.
(c) We will determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount using the method described in § 418.1120.
[71 FR 62931, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 78 FR 57259, Sept. 18, 2013]
§ 418.1105
What is the threshold?
(a) The threshold is a level of modified adjusted gross income above which the beneficiary will have to pay the income-related monthly adjustment amount.
(b) From January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019, the modified adjusted gross income threshold is $170,000 for individuals with a Federal income tax filing status of married filing jointly. The threshold is $85,000 for individuals with any other filing status.
(c) Starting on January 1, 2020, the threshold amounts will resume adjustment for inflation as required by section 1839(i)(5) of the Act. In each year thereafter, CMS will set all modified adjusted gross income threshold
amounts for the following year by increasing the preceding year's threshold amounts by any percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index rounded to the nearest $1,000. CMS will publish the amounts in the
Federal Register
in September of each year. Published threshold amounts will be effective January 1 of the next calendar year, for the full calendar year.
[71 FR 62931, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 78 FR 57259, Sept. 18, 2013]
§ 418.1110
What is the effective date of our initial determination about your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
(a) Generally, an income-related monthly adjustment amount will be effective for all months that you are enrolled in Medicare Part B during the year for which we determine you must pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount. We will follow the rules in 42 CFR part 408, subpart C, regarding premium collections to withhold your income-related monthly adjustment amount from a benefit payment or to determine if you will be billed directly.
(b) When we have used modified adjusted gross income information from IRS for the tax year 3 years prior to the effective year to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount and modified adjusted gross income information for the tax year 2 years prior later becomes available from IRS, we will review the new information to determine if we should revise our initial determination. If we revise our initial determination, the effective date of the new initial determination will be January 1 of the effective year, or the first month you were enrolled or re-enrolled in Medicare Part B if later than January.
(c) When we use your amended tax return, as described in § 418.1150, the effective date will be January 1 of the year(s) that is affected, or the first month in that year that you were enrolled or reenrolled in Medicare Part B if later than January.

# Example:
You are enrolled in Medicare Part B throughout 2011. We use your 2009 modified adjusted gross income as reported to us by IRS to determine your 2011 income-related monthly adjustment amount. In 2012 you submit to us a copy of your 2009 amended tax return that you filed with IRS. The modified adjusted gross income reported on your 2009 amended tax return is significantly less than originally reported to IRS. We use the modified adjusted gross income that was reported on your 2009 amended tax return to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount. That income-related monthly adjustment amount is effective January 1, 2011. We will retroactively adjust for any differences between the amount paid in 2011 and the amount that should have been paid based on the amended tax return.
(d) When we use evidence that you provide which proves that the IRS modified adjusted gross income information we used is incorrect, as described in § 418.1335, the effective date will be January of the year(s) that is affected or the first month in that year that you were enrolled or reenrolled in Medicare Part B if later than January.
(e) When we use information from a more recent tax year that you provide due to a major life-changing event, as described in § 418.1201, the effective date is described in § 418.1230.
§ 418.1115

§ 418.1120
How do we determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
(a) We will determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount by using your tax filing status and modified adjusted gross income.
(b)
Tables of applicable percentage.
The tables in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section contain the modified adjusted gross income ranges for calendar years 2011 through and including 2017, 2018, and beginning in 2019 in the column on the left in each table. The middle column in each table shows the percentage of the unsubsidized Medicare Part B premium that will be paid by individuals with modified adjusted gross income that falls within
each of the ranges. The column on the right in each table shows the percentage of the Medicare Part B premium that will be subsidized by contributions from the Federal Government. We use your tax filing status and your modified adjusted gross income for the tax year to determine which income-related monthly adjustment amount to apply to you. The dollar amount of income-related monthly adjustment for each range will be set annually for each year after 2019 as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The modified adjusted gross income ranges will be adjusted annually after 2019 as described in § 418.1115(e).
(1)
General tables of applicable percentages.
If, for the tax year, we use your filing status for your Federal income taxes for the tax year is single; head of household; qualifying widow(er) with dependent child; or married filing separately and you lived apart from your spouse for the entire tax year, we will use the general tables of applicable percentages. When your modified adjusted gross income for the year we use is in the range listed in the left column in the following tables, then the Federal Government's Part B premium subsidy of 75 percent is reduced to the percentage listed in the right column. You will pay an amount based on the percentage listed in the center column.

§ 418.1125
How will the income-related monthly adjustment amount affect your total Medicare Part B premium?
(a) If you must pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount, your total Medicare Part B premium will be the sum of:
(1) The Medicare Part B standard monthly premium, determined using the rules in 42 CFR 408.20; plus
(2) Any applicable increase in the Medicare Part B standard monthly premium as described in 42 CFR 408.22; plus
(3) Your income-related monthly adjustment amount.
(b) The nonstandard Medicare Part B premium amount described in 42 CFR 408.20 does not apply to individuals who must pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount. Such individuals must pay the full Medicare Part B standard monthly premium plus any applicable penalties for late enrollment or reenrollment plus the income-related adjustment.

§ 418.1130
[Reserved]
§ 418.1135
What modified adjusted gross income information will we use to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
(a) In general, we will use your modified adjusted gross income provided by IRS for the tax year 2 years prior to the effective year of the income-related monthly adjustment amount determination. Modified adjusted gross income is based on information you provide to IRS when you file your Federal income tax return.
(b) We will use your modified adjusted gross income for the tax year 3 years prior to the effective year of the income-related monthly adjustment amount determination when IRS does not provide the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section. If IRS can provide modified adjusted gross income for the tax year 3 years prior to the income-related monthly adjustment amount effective year, we will temporarily use that information to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount and make adjustments as described in § 418.1110(b) to all affected income-related monthly adjustment amounts when information for the year specified in paragraph (a) of this section is provided by IRS.
(c) When we have used the information in paragraph (b) of this section, you may provide us with evidence of your modified adjusted gross income for the year in paragraph (a) of this section. You must provide a retained copy of your signed Federal income tax return for that year, if available. If you filed a return for that year, but did not retain a copy, you must request a transcript or a copy of your return from IRS and provide it to us. When we use this evidence, we will later confirm this information with IRS records.
(d) When you meet the conditions specified in § 418.1150 because you have amended your Federal income tax return, or when you believe we have used information provided by IRS which is incorrect, as described in § 418.1335, we will use information that you provide directly to us regarding your modified adjusted gross income.
(e) We may use information that you give us about your modified adjusted gross income for a more recent tax year than those discussed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section as described in §§ 418.1201 through 418.1270.
(f) If you fail to file an income tax return for any year after 2004 and IRS informs us that you had modified adjusted gross income above the threshold applicable 2 years after the tax year when you failed to file an income tax return, we will impose the highest income-related adjustment percentage applicable to your income filing status for the effective year. If we later determine that the amount of the income-related monthly adjustment amount imposed was inconsistent with your modified adjusted gross income, we will correct it. The rules in 42 CFR 408.40 through 408.92 will apply to the collection of any retroactive premiums due.
§ 418.1140
What will happen if the modified adjusted gross income information from IRS is different from the modified adjusted gross income information we used to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
In general, we will use modified adjusted gross income information from IRS to determine your income-related monthly adjustment. We will make retroactive adjustments to your income-related monthly adjustment amount as described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section.
(a) When we have used modified adjusted gross income from the tax year 3 years prior to the effective year as described in § 418.1135(b), and IRS provides modified adjusted gross income information from the tax year 2 years prior to the effective year, we will use the new information to make an initial determination for the effective year. We will make retroactive adjustments back to January 1 of the effective year, or the first month you were enrolled or reenrolled in Medicare Part B if later than January.
(b) When we have used the modified adjusted gross income information that you provided for the tax year 2 years prior to the effective year and the modified adjusted gross income information we receive from IRS for that same year is different from the information you provided, we will use the modified adjusted gross income information provided to us by IRS to make a new initial determination. We will make retroactive adjustments back to January 1 of the effective year, or the first month you were enrolled or reenrolled in Medicare Part B if later than January.
(c) When we have used information from your amended Federal tax return that you provide, as explained in § 418.1150, or you provide proof that the information IRS provided to us is incorrect as described in § 418.1335, we will not make any adjustments to your income-related monthly adjustment amount for the effective year or years based on IRS information we receive later from IRS.
(d) When we use modified adjusted gross income information that you provided due to a qualifying life-changing event and we receive different information from IRS, we will use the IRS information to make retroactive corrections to all months in the effective year(s) during which you were enrolled in Medicare Part B, except when paragraph (c) of this section applies.
(e) When we used the table in § 418.1120(b)(3) to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount, and you lived apart from your spouse throughout that year, we will ask you for a signed statement or attestation that you lived apart from your spouse throughout that year. We will also ask you to provide information about the addresses of you and your spouse during that year. If you provide a signed statement or attestation that you lived apart from your spouse throughout that year, and information about your respective addresses that year, we will use the table in § 418.1120(b)(1) to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount.
§ 418.1145
How do we determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount if IRS does not provide information about your modified adjusted gross income?
In general, if we do not receive any information for you from IRS showing that you had modified adjusted gross income above the threshold in the tax year we request, we will not make an income-related monthly adjustment amount determination.
§ 418.1150
When will we use your amended tax return filed with IRS?
You may provide your amended tax return for a tax year we used within 3 calendar years following the close of the tax year for which you filed the amended tax return. You must provide us with your retained copy of your amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return on the required IRS form and a copy of the IRS letter confirming the amended tax return was filed or a transcript from IRS if they did not send a letter. If you cannot provide your retained copy of the amended tax return, you must obtain a copy of the return from IRS. We will then make any necessary retroactive corrections as defined in § 418.1110(c) to your income-related monthly adjustment amount.

# Determinations Using a More Recent Tax Year's Modified Adjusted Gross Income
§ 418.1201
When will we determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount based on the modified adjusted gross income information that you provide for a more recent tax year?
We will use a more recent tax year than the years described in § 418.1135(a) or (b) to reduce or eliminate your income-related monthly adjustment amount when all of the following occur:
(a) You experience a major life-changing event as defined in § 418.1205; and
(b) That major life-changing event results in a significant reduction in your modified adjusted gross income for the year which you request we use and the next year, if applicable. For purposes of this section, a significant reduction in your modified adjusted gross income is one that results in the decrease or elimination of your income-related monthly adjustment amount; and
(c) You request that we use a more recent tax year's modified adjusted gross income; and
(d) You provide evidence as described in §§ 418.1255 and 418.1265.
§ 418.1205
What is a major life-changing event?
For the purposes of this subpart, we will consider the following to be major life-changing events:
(a) Your spouse dies;
(b) You marry;
(c) Your marriage ends through divorce or annulment;
(d) You or your spouse stop working or reduce the hours you work;
(e) You or your spouse experiences a loss of income-producing property, provided the loss is not at the direction of you or your spouse (e.g., due to the sale or transfer of the property) and is not a result of the ordinary risk of investment. Examples of the type of property loss include, but are not limited to: Loss of real property within a Presidentially or Gubernatorially-declared disaster area, destruction of livestock or crops by natural disaster or disease, loss from real property due to arson, or loss of investment property as a result of fraud or theft due to a criminal act by a third party;
(f) You or your spouse experiences a scheduled cessation, termination, or reorganization of an employer's pension plan;
(g) You or your spouse receives a settlement from an employer or former employer because of the employer's closure, bankruptcy, or reorganization.
[71 FR 62931, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 41086, July 15, 2010]
§ 418.1210
What is not a major life-changing event?
We will not consider events other than those described in § 418.1205 to be major life-changing events. Certain types of events are not considered major life-changing events for the purposes of this subpart, such as:
(a) Events that affect your expenses, but not your income; or
(b) Events that result in the loss of dividend income because of the ordinary risk of investment.
[71 FR 62931, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 41086, July 15, 2010]
§ 418.1215
What is a significant reduction in your income?
For purposes of this subpart, we will consider a reduction in your income to be significant if your modified adjusted gross income decreases; and
(a) The decrease reduces the percentage of the income-related monthly adjustment amount you must pay according to the Table of Applicable Percentages in § 418.1120; or
(b) The decrease reduces your modified adjusted gross income to an amount below the threshold described in § 418.1105 and eliminates any income-related monthly adjustment amount you must pay.
§ 418.1220
What is not a significant reduction in your income?
For purposes of this subpart, we will not consider a reduction in your income to be significant unless the reduction affects the amount of income-related monthly adjustment you must pay.
§ 418.1225
Which more recent tax year will we use?
We will consider evidence of your modified adjusted gross income that you provide for a tax year that is more recent than the year described in § 418.1135 (a) or (b) when you meet all of the requirements described in § 418.1201. We will always ask you for your retained copy of your filed Federal income tax return for the more recent year you request that we use and will use that information to make an initial determination. If you have not filed your Federal income tax return for the more recent year you request that we use, you must provide us with evidence that is equivalent to a copy of a filed Federal income tax return. Evidence that is equivalent to a copy of a filed Federal income tax return is defined in § 418.1265(c).
§ 418.1230
What is the effective date of an income-related monthly adjustment amount initial determination that is based on a more recent tax year?
(a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, when your modified adjusted gross income for the more recent tax year is significantly reduced as a result of a major life-changing event, our initial determination is generally effective on January 1 of the year in which you make your request. If your first month of enrollment or reenrollment in Medicare Part B is after January of the year for which you make your request, our initial determination is effective on the first day of your Medicare Part B enrollment or reenrollment.
(b) We will make a determination about your income-related monthly adjustment amount for the year preceding the year that you make your request in the limited circumstances explained in § 418.1310(a)(4). When we make a determination for the preceding year, our initial determination is generally effective on January 1 of that year. If your first month of enrollment or reenrollment in Medicare Part B is after January of that year, our initial determination is effective on the first day of your Medicare Part B enrollment or reenrollment.
(c) Our initial determination will be effective January 1 of the year following the year you make your request, when your modified adjusted gross income will not be significantly reduced as a result of one or more of the events described in § 418.1205(a) through (g) until the year following the year you make your request.
[71 FR 62931, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 41086, July 15, 2010; 78 FR 57260, Sept. 28, 2013]
§ 418.1235
When will we stop using your more recent tax year's modified adjusted gross income to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
We will use your more recent tax year's modified adjusted gross income to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount effective with the month and year described in § 418.1230 and for each year thereafter until one of the following occurs:
(a) We receive your modified adjusted gross income from IRS for the more recent tax year we used or a later tax year;
(b) Your more recent tax year modified adjusted gross income that we used is for a tax year more than 3 years prior to the income-related monthly adjustment amount effective year;
(c) You request we use a more recent tax year based on another major life-changing event as described in § 418.1201; or
(d) You notify us of a change in your modified adjusted gross income for the more recent tax year we used as described in § 418.1240.
§ 418.1240
Should you notify us if the information you gave us about your modified adjusted gross income for the more recent tax year changes?
If you know that the information you provided to us about the more recent tax year that we used has changed, you should tell us so that we can determine if your income-related monthly adjustment amount should be eliminated or adjusted. We will accept new modified adjusted gross income information at any time after your request until the end of the calendar year following the more recent tax year(s) that we used.
For us to make a new initial determination using your new modified adjusted gross income information, you must provide evidence as described in § 418.1265 to support the reduction or increase in your modified adjusted gross income. If you amend your Federal income tax return for the more recent tax year we used, we will use the rules in § 418.1150.
§ 418.1245
What will happen if you notify us that your modified adjusted gross income for the more recent tax year changes?
(a) If you notify us that your modified adjusted gross income for the more recent tax year has changed from what is in our records, we may make a new initial determination for each effective year involved. To make a new initial determination(s) we will take into account:
(1) The new modified adjusted gross income information for the more recent tax year you provide; and
(2) Any modified adjusted gross income information from IRS, as described in § 418.1135, that we have available for each effective year; and
(3) Any modified adjusted gross income information from you, as described in § 418.1135, that we have available for each effective year.
(b) For each new initial determination that results in a change in your income-related monthly adjustment amount, we will make retroactive adjustments that will apply to all enrolled months of the effective year.
(c) We will continue to use a new initial determination described in paragraph (a) of this section to determine additional yearly income-related monthly adjustment amount(s) until an event described in § 418.1235 occurs.
(d) We will make a new determination about your income-related monthly adjustment amount when we receive modified adjusted gross income for the effective year from IRS, as described in § 418.1140(d).
§ 418.1250
What evidence will you need to support your request that we use a more recent tax year?
When you request that we use a more recent tax year to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount, we will ask for evidence of the major life-changing event and how the event significantly reduced your modified adjusted gross income as described in §§ 418.1255 and 418.1265. Unless we have information in our records that raises a doubt about the evidence, additional evidence documenting the major life-changing event(s) will not be needed.
§ 418.1255
What kind of major life-changing event evidence will you need to support your request for us to use a more recent tax year?
(a) If your spouse died and we do not have evidence of the death in our records, we will require proof of death as described in § 404.720(b) or (c) or § 404.721 of this chapter.
(b) If you marry and we do not have evidence of the marriage in our records, we will require proof of marriage as described in §§ 404.725 through 404.727 of this chapter.
(c) If your marriage ends and we do not have evidence that the marriage has ended in our records, we will require proof that the marriage has ended as described in § 404.728(b) or (c) of this chapter.
(d) If you or your spouse stop working or reduce your work hours, we will require evidence documenting the change in work activity. Examples of acceptable documentation include, but are not limited to, documents we can corroborate such as a signed statement from your employer, proof of the transfer of your business, or your signed statement under penalty of perjury, describing your work separation or a reduction in hours.
(e) If you or your spouse experiences a loss of income-producing property, we will require evidence documenting the loss. Examples of acceptable evidence include, but are not limited to, insurance claims or an insurance adjuster's statement. If the claim of loss is due to criminal fraud or theft by a third party, we will also require proof of conviction for the fraud or theft, such as a court document.
(f) If you or your spouse experiences a scheduled cessation, termination, or reorganization of an employer's pension plan, we will require evidence documenting the change in or loss of the
pension. An example of acceptable evidence includes, but is not limited to, a statement from your pension fund administrator explaining the reduction or termination of your benefits.
(g) If you or your spouse receives a settlement from an employer or former employer because of the employer's closure, bankruptcy, or reorganization, we will require evidence documenting the settlement and the reason(s) for the settlement. An example of acceptable evidence includes, but is not limited to, a letter from the former employer stating the settlement terms and how they affect you or your spouse.
[71 FR 62931, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 41086, July 15, 2010]
§ 418.1260
What major life-changing event evidence will we not accept?
(a) We will not accept evidence of death that fails to meet the requirements in §§ 404.720 through 404.721 of this chapter.
(b) We will not accept evidence of marriage that fails to meet the requirements in §§ 404.725 through 404.727 of this chapter.
(c) We will not accept evidence that your marriage has ended if the evidence fails to meet the requirements in § 404.728 of this chapter.
(d) We will not accept documents supporting loss of income from income-producing property, or failure of or loss from a defined benefit pension plan unless the documents are original documents or copies from the original source.
(e) We will not accept evidence of work reduction or work stoppage that cannot be substantiated.
§ 418.1265
What kind of significant modified adjusted gross income reduction evidence will you need to support your request?
(a) You must provide evidence that one or more of the major life-changing events described in § 418.1205 resulted in a significant reduction in your modified adjusted gross income for the tax year you request we use.
(b) The preferred evidence is your retained copy of your filed Federal income tax return, your retained copy of your amended tax return with an IRS letter of receipt of the amended tax return, your copy of proof of a correction of the IRS information we used or a copy of your return or amended or proof of a correction of tax return information that you obtain from IRS for the more recent tax year you request we use.
(c) When a copy of your filed Federal income tax return is not available for the more recent tax year in which your modified adjusted gross income was significantly reduced, we will accept equivalent evidence. Equivalent evidence is the appropriate proof(s) in paragraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, plus your signed statement under penalty of perjury that the information you provide is true and correct. When the major life-changing event changes your tax filing status, or the income-related monthly adjustment amount determination could be affected by your tax filing status, you will also be required to sign a statement regarding your intended income tax filing status for the tax year you request we use.
(1) If you experience one or more of the events described in § 418.1205(a), (b), or (c), you must provide evidence as to how the event(s) significantly reduced your modified adjusted gross income. Examples of the type of evidence include, but are not limited to, evidence of your spouse's modified adjusted gross income and/or your modified adjusted gross income for the tax year we use.
(2) If you experience one or more of the events described in § 418.1205(d), (e), (f), or (g), you must provide evidence of how the event(s) significantly reduced your modified adjusted gross income, such as a statement explaining any modified adjusted gross income changes for the tax year we used and a copy of your filed Federal income tax return (if you have filed one).
(3) If your spouse experiences one or more of the events described in § 418.1205(d), (e), (f), or (g), you must provide evidence of the resulting significant reduction in your modified adjusted gross income. The evidence requirements are described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(d) When we use information described in paragraph (c) of this section, we will request that you provide your
retained copy of your Federal income tax return for the year we used when you file your taxes. We will use that information to make timely adjustments to your Medicare premium, if necessary. We will later verify the information you provide when we receive information about that tax year from IRS, as described in § 418.1140(d).
[71 FR 62931, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 41087, July 15, 2010]
§ 418.1270
What modified adjusted gross income evidence will we not accept?
We will not accept a correction or amendment of your income tax return without a letter from IRS acknowledging the change. We will also not accept illegible or unsigned copies of income tax returns or attestations or other statements of income unless they are provided under penalty of perjury.

# Determinations and the Administrative Review Process
§ 418.1301
What is an initial determination regarding your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
An initial determination is the determination we make about your income-related monthly adjustment amount that is subject to administrative review. For the purposes of administering the income-related monthly adjustment amount, initial determinations include but are not limited to determinations about:
(a) The amount of your income-related monthly adjustment amount based on information provided by IRS; and
(b) Any change in your income-related monthly adjustment amount based on one of the circumstances listed in § 418.1310(a)(1) through (a)(4).
§ 418.1305
What is not an initial determination regarding your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
Administrative actions that are not initial determinations may be reviewed by us, but they are not subject to the administrative review process as provided by §§ 418.1320 through 418.1325 and §§ 418.1340 through 418.1355, and they are not subject to judicial review. These actions include, but are not limited to, our dismissal of a request for reconsideration as described in § 418.1330 and our dismissal of a request for a new initial determination as described in § 418.1310(d).
§ 418.1310
When may you request that we make a new initial determination?
(a) You may request that we make a new initial determination in the following circumstances:
(1) You provide a copy of your filed Federal income tax return for the tax year 2 years prior to the effective year when IRS has provided information for the tax year 3 years prior to the effective year. You may request a new initial determination beginning with the date you receive a notice from us regarding your income-related monthly adjustment amount until the end of the effective year, with one exception. If you receive the notice during the last 3 months of a calendar year, you may request a new initial determination beginning with the date you receive the notice until March 31 of the following year. We will follow the rules and procedures in §§ 418.1110(b) and 418.1140(b) to make a new initial determination and any necessary retroactive adjustments back to January 1 of the effective year, or the first month you were enrolled in Medicare Part B in the effective year if later than January.
(2) You provide a copy of an amended tax return filed with IRS, as defined in § 418.1010(b)(1). We will use your amended tax return for the same tax year as the year used to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount. You must request the new initial determination within the timeframe described in § 418.1150.
(3) You provide proof that the tax return information about your modified adjusted gross income or tax filing status IRS gave us is incorrect. We will use proof that you obtain from IRS of a correction of your tax return information for the same tax year instead of the information that was provided to us by IRS, as explained in § 418.1335(a). You may request a new initial determination at any time after you receive a notice from us regarding your income-related monthly adjustment
amount if you have such proof. We will use the rules and procedures in § 418.1335.
(4) You have a major life-changing event. You may request a new initial determination based on a major life-changing event when you meet all the requirements described in § 418.1201. You may make such a request at any time during the calendar year in which you experience a significant reduction in your modified adjusted gross income caused by a major life-changing event. When you have a major life-changing event that occurs in the last 3 months of a calendar year and your modified adjusted gross income for that year is significantly reduced as a result of the event, you may request that we make a new initial determination based on your major life-changing event from the date of the event until March 31 of the next year. We will follow the rules in § 418.1230 when we make a new initial determination based on your major life-changing event.
(b) If a request for a new initial determination based on any of the circumstances in paragraph (a) of this section is made after the time frame provided for each type of listed circumstance, we will review the request under the rules in § 404.911 of this chapter to determine if there is good cause for a late request.
(c) We will notify you of the new initial determination as described in § 418.1315.
(d) We will dismiss your request to make a new initial determination if it does not meet one of the circumstances specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section. Our dismissal of your request for a new initial determination is not an initial determination subject to further administrative or judicial review.
§ 418.1315
How will we notify you and what information will we provide about our initial determination?
(a) We will mail a written notice of all initial determinations to you. The notice of the initial determination will state the important facts and give the reasons for our conclusions. Generally, we will not send a notice if your income-related monthly adjustment amount stops because of your death.
(b) The written notice that we send will tell you:
(1) What our initial determination is;
(2) What modified adjusted gross income information we used to make our determination;
(3) The reason for our determination;
(4) The effect of the initial determination; and
(5) Your right to a reconsideration or a new initial determination.
§ 418.1320
What is the effect of an initial determination?
An initial determination is binding unless you request a reconsideration within the time period described in §§ 404.909 and 404.911 of this chapter or we revise the initial determination or issue a new initial determination.
§ 418.1322
How will a Medicare prescription drug coverage income-related monthly adjustment amount determination for the effective year affect your Medicare Part B?
If we make an income-related monthly adjustment amount determination for you for the effective year under subpart C of this part (Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount), we will apply that income-related monthly adjustment amount determination under this subpart to determine your Part D income-related monthly adjustment amount for the same effective year. Therefore, if you become enrolled in Medicare Part B in the effective year after we make an income-related monthly adjustment amount determination about your Medicare prescription drug coverage, the income-related monthly adjustment amount determination for your Medicare prescription drug coverage will also be used to determine your Medicare Part B income-related monthly adjustment amount. Any change in your net benefit due will be accompanied by a letter explaining the change in your net benefit and your right to appeal the change.
[75 FR 75890, Dec. 7, 2010]
§ 418.1325
When may you request a reconsideration?
If you are dissatisfied with our initial determination about your income-related monthly adjustment amount, you may request that we reconsider it. In addition, a person who shows that his or her rights may be adversely affected by the initial determination may request a reconsideration. We may accept requests for reconsideration that are filed by electronic or other means that we determine to be appropriate. Subject to the provisions of this section and § 418.1330, when you request a reconsideration, we will use the rules in §§ 404.907 through 404.922 of this chapter.
§ 418.1330
Can you request a reconsideration when you believe that the IRS information we used is incorrect?
If you request a reconsideration solely because you believe that the information that IRS gave us is incorrect, we will dismiss your request for a reconsideration and notify you to obtain proof of a correction from IRS and request a new initial determination (§ 418.1335). Our dismissal of your request for reconsideration is not an initial determination subject to further administrative or judicial review.
§ 418.1335
What should you do if our initial determination is based on modified adjusted gross income information you believe to be incorrect?
If you believe that IRS or you provided incorrect modified adjusted gross income information to us that we used to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount, you can request information from us on how to contact IRS regarding the information we used.
(a) If IRS determines that the information it provided is not correct, IRS will provide you with documentation of the error, such as a copy of your Federal income tax return. If you would like us to use the revised or corrected information to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount, you will need to request that we use that information and provide us with the IRS documentation confirming the error. We will make any necessary retroactive corrections as described in § 418.1110(d) to your income-related monthly adjustment amount.
(b) If you provided information to us about your modified adjusted gross income that we used to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount, and that information is not correct, you may provide revised or corrected information. We will use the revised or corrected information if it reduces or eliminates your income-related monthly adjustment amount. We will make any necessary retroactive corrections as described in § 418.1110 to your income-related monthly adjustment amount. If you are providing corrected information about a more recent tax year's modified adjusted gross income that we used due to your major life-changing event, as described in § 418.1240, we will use the rules in § 418.1245 to determine how it will affect your income-related monthly adjustment amount.
§ 418.1340
What are the rules for our administrative review process?
To the extent that they are not inconsistent with the rules in this subpart for making initial determinations and reconsidered determinations, we will use the same rules for the administrative review process that we use for determinations and decisions about your rights regarding non-medical issues under title II of the Act, as described in subpart J of part 404 of this chapter.

# Introduction, General Provisions, and Definitions
§ 418.2001
What is this subpart about?
This subpart implements sections 1860D-13(a)(7) and 1860D-13(c)(4) of the Social Security Act (the Act), as added by section 3308 of the Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148). Section 3308(a) establishes an income-related monthly adjustment to Medicare prescription drug coverage premiums. Persons enrolled in Medicare prescription drug plans, Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug coverage, Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly plans, and cost plans offering prescription drug coverage who have modified adjusted gross income over a threshold amount established in the statute will pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount in addition to their Medicare prescription drug coverage plan's monthly premium and any applicable premium increases as described in 42 CFR 423.286. The regulations in this subpart explain how we determine whether you are required to pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount, and if you are, the amount of your adjustment. We have divided the rules into the following groups of sections:
(a) Sections 418.2001 through 418.2010 contain the introduction, a statement of the general purpose of the income-related monthly adjustment amount, general provisions that apply to the income-related monthly adjustment amount, and definitions of terms that we use in this subpart.
(b) Sections 418.2101 through 418.2150 describe what information about your modified adjusted gross income we will use to determine if you are required to pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount. In these sections, we also describe how the income-related monthly adjustment amount will affect your total Medicare prescription drug coverage premium.
(c) Sections 418.2201 through 418.2270 contain an explanation of the standards that you must meet for us to grant your request to use modified adjusted gross income information that you provide for a more recent tax year rather than the information described in paragraph (b) of this section. These sections explain when we may consider such a request, and the evidence that you will be required to provide. These sections also explain when an income-related monthly adjustment amount determination based on information you provide will be effective, and how long it will remain in effect. Additionally, these sections describe how we make retroactive adjustments of the income-related monthly adjustment amount based on information you provide, updated information you provide,
and information we later receive from the Internal Revenue Service.
(d) Sections 418.2301 through 418.2355 explain how we will notify you of our determination regarding your income-related monthly adjustment amount and contain the rules that we will apply when you disagree with our determination. These sections explain your appeal rights and the circumstances under which you may request that we make a new initial determination of your income-related monthly adjustment amount.
§ 418.2005
Purpose and administration.
(a) The purpose of the income-related monthly adjustment amount is for beneficiaries who have modified adjusted gross income above an established threshold to reimburse the Federal Government for a portion of the Federal subsidy of the Medicare prescription drug coverage. Persons who have modified adjusted gross income above the thresholds described in § 418.2105 will pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount in addition to the premium for their prescription drug coverage. The income-related monthly adjustment amount due will be determined based on the base beneficiary premium amount that represents 25.5 percent of the cost of the basic Medicare prescription drug coverage. The application of an income-related monthly adjustment amount results in an increase in the total amount that those who are affected pay for Medicare prescription drug coverage plans. A person who has modified adjusted gross income above the threshold amount will pay:
(1) The Medicare prescription drug coverage plan monthly premium; plus
(2) Any applicable increase for late enrollment or reenrollment;
(3) An income-related monthly adjustment amount; and
(b) The Centers for Medicare
Medicaid Services in the Department of Health and Human Services establishes rules for eligibility for Medicare prescription drug coverage and enrollment in Medicare prescription drug coverage plans, as well as premium penalties for late enrollment or reenrollment (42 CFR 423.30 through 423.56).
(c) We use information from CMS about enrollment in Medicare prescription drug coverage plans to determine the records that we must send to the IRS.
(d) We use information that we get from the IRS to determine if persons enrolled in Medicare prescription drug coverage plans are required to pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount. We also change income-related monthly adjustment amount determinations using information you provide under certain circumstances. In addition, we notify beneficiaries when the social security benefit amounts they receive will change based on our income-related monthly adjustment amount determination.

# Determination of the Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount
§ 418.2101
What is the income-related monthly adjustment amount?
(a) The income-related monthly adjustment amount is an amount that you will pay in addition to the Medicare prescription drug coverage plan monthly premium, plus any applicable increase in that premium as described in 42 CFR 423.286, for your Medicare prescription drug coverage plan when your modified adjusted gross income is
above the threshold described in § 418.2105.
(b) Your income-related monthly adjustment amount is based on your applicable modified adjusted gross income as described in § 418.2115 and your tax filing status.
(c) We will determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount using the method described in § 418.2120.
§ 418.2105
What is the threshold?
(a) The threshold is a level of modified adjusted gross income above which you will have to pay the income-related monthly adjustment amount.
(b) For calendar years 2011 through and including 2019, the modified adjusted gross income threshold is $85,000 for individuals with a Federal income tax filing status of single, married filing separately, head of household, and qualifying widow(er) with dependent child. The threshold is $170,000 for individuals with a Federal income tax filing status of married filing jointly.
(c) Starting at the end of calendar year 2019 and for each calendar year thereafter, CMS will set the threshold amounts for the following year. CMS will publish the threshold amounts annually in the
Federal Register.
Published threshold amounts will be effective January 1 of the next calendar year, and remain unchanged for the full calendar year.
§ 418.2110
What is the effective date of our initial determination about your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
(a) Generally, an income-related monthly adjustment amount determination will be effective for all months that you are enrolled in a prescription drug coverage plan during the year for which we determine you must pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount.
(b) When we have used modified adjusted gross income information from the IRS for the tax year 3 years prior to the effective year to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount, and modified adjusted gross income information for the tax year 2 years prior later becomes available from the IRS, we will review the new information to determine if we should revise our initial determination concerning the income-related monthly adjustment amount. If we revise our initial determination, the effective date of the new initial determination will be January 1 of the effective year, or the first month your enrollment or re-enrollment in a Medicare prescription drug coverage plan became effective if later than January.
(c) When we use your amended tax return, as described in § 418.2150, the effective date will be January 1 of the year(s) that is affected, or the first month in that year that your enrollment or re-enrollment in a Medicare prescription drug coverage plan became effective if later than January.

# Example:
You are enrolled in Medicare prescription drug coverage throughout 2011. We use your 2009 modified adjusted gross income as reported to us by the IRS to determine your 2011 income-related monthly adjustment amount. In 2012, you submit to us a copy of your 2009 amended tax return that you filed with the IRS. The modified adjusted gross income reported on your 2009 amended tax return is significantly less than originally reported to the IRS. We use the modified adjusted gross income reported on your 2009 amended tax return to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount. That income-related monthly adjustment amount is effective January 1, 2011. We will retroactively correct any differences between the amount paid in 2011 and the amount you should have paid based on the amended tax return.
(d) When we use evidence that you provide to proves the IRS modified adjusted gross income information we used was incorrect, as described in § 418.2335, the effective date will be January of the year(s) that is affected or the first month in that year that your enrollment or re-enrollment in a Medicare prescription drug coverage plan became effective if later than January.
(e) When we use information from a more recent tax year that you provide due to a major life-changing event, as described in § 418.2201, the effective date is described in § 418.2230.
§ 418.2112
Paying your income-related monthly adjustment amount.
(a) We will deduct the income-related monthly adjustment amount from your Social Security benefits if they are sufficient to cover the amount owed. If
the amount of your Social Security benefits is not sufficient to pay the full amount of your income-related monthly adjustment amount, CMS will bill you for the full amount owed.
(b) If you do not receive Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board benefits, but you receive benefits from the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Personnel Management will deduct the income-related monthly adjustment amount from your benefits if they are sufficient to cover the amount owed. If the amount of your Office of Personnel Management benefits is not sufficient to pay the full amount of your income-related monthly adjustment amount, CMS will bill you for the full amount owed.
(c) If you do not receive Social Security, Railroad Retirement Board, or Office of Personnel Management benefits, CMS will bill you for your income-related monthly adjustment amount.
§ 418.2115
What are the modified adjusted gross income ranges?
(a) We list the modified adjusted gross income ranges for the calendar years 2011 through and including 2017, 2018, and beginning in 2019 for each Federal tax filing category in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section. We will use your modified adjusted gross income amount together with your tax filing status to determine the amount of your income-related monthly adjustment for these calendar years.
(b) The modified adjusted gross income ranges for individuals with a Federal tax filing status of single, head of household, qualifying widow(er) with dependent child, and married filing separately when the individual has lived apart from his/her spouse for the entire tax year for the year we use to make our income-related monthly adjustment amount determination are as follows:

§ 418.2120
How do we determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount?
(a) We will determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount by using your tax filing status and modified adjusted gross income.
(b)
Tables of applicable percentage.
The tables in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section contain the modified adjusted gross income ranges for calendar years 2011 through and including 2017, 2018, and 2019, and the corresponding percentage of the cost of basic Medicare prescription drug coverage that individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes that fall within each of the ranges will pay. The monthly dollar amounts will be determined by CMS using the formula in section 1860D-13(a)(7)(B) of the Act. Based on your tax filing status for the tax year we use to make a determination about your income-related monthly adjustment amount, we will determine which table is applicable to you. We will use your modified adjusted gross income to determine which income-related monthly adjustment amount to apply to you. The dollar amounts used for each of the ranges of income-related monthly adjustment will be set annually after 2019 as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The modified adjusted gross income ranges will be adjusted annually after 2019 as described in § 418.2115(e).
(1)
General tables of applicable percentages.
If your filing status for your Federal income taxes for the tax year we use is single; head of household; qualifying widow(er) with dependent child; or married filing separately and you lived apart from your spouse for the entire tax year, we will use the general tables of applicable percentages. When your modified adjusted gross income for the year we use is in the range listed in the left column in the following tables, you will pay an amount based on the percentage listed in the right column, which represents a percentage of the cost of basic Medicare prescription drug coverage.

Section 1860D-14, codified into the Act by section 101, includes a provision for subsidies of prescription drug premiums and of Part D cost-sharing requirements for Medicare beneficiaries whose income and resources do not exceed certain levels. The regulations in this subpart explain how we decide whether you are eligible for a Part D premium subsidy as defined in 42 CFR 423.780 and cost-sharing subsidy as defined in 42 CFR 423.782. The rules are divided into the following groups of sections according to subject content:

(b) Sections 418.3101 through 418.3125 contain the general requirements that you must meet in order to be eligible for a subsidy. These sections set forth the subsidy eligibility requirements of being a Medicare beneficiary, of having income and resources below certain levels, and of filing an application. These sections also explain when we will redetermine your eligibility for a subsidy and the period covered by a redetermination.

(f) Sections 418.3501 through 418.3515 contain the rules that explain when we will adjust or when we will terminate your eligibility for a subsidy.
(g) Sections 418.3601 through 418.3680 contain the rules that we apply when you appeal our determination regarding your subsidy eligibility or our determination of whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy. They also contain the rules that explain that our decision is binding unless you file an action in Federal district court seeking review of our final decision and what happens if your case is remanded by a Federal court

# Eligibility for a Medicare Prescription Drug Subsidy
§ 418.3101
How do you become eligible for a subsidy?
Unless you are deemed eligible as explained in § 418.3105 and 42 CFR 423.773(c), you are eligible for a Medicare Part D prescription drug subsidy if you meet all of the following requirements:
(a) You are entitled to or enrolled in Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) or enrolled in Medicare Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) or both under title XVIII of the Act.
(b) You are enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage. We can also determine your eligibility for a subsidy before you enroll in one of the above programs. However, as explained in § 418.3225(b), if we
determine that you would be eligible for a subsidy before you have enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage, you must enroll in one of these plans to actually receive a subsidy.
(c) You reside in the United States as defined in § 418.3010.
(d) You (and your spouse, if applicable) meet the income requirements as explained in §§ 418.3301 through 418.3350 and 42 CFR 423.773.
(e) You (and your spouse, if applicable) meet the resources requirements as explained in §§ 418.3401 through 418.3425 and 42 CFR 423.773.
(f) You or your personal representative file an application for a subsidy as explained in §§ 418.3201 through 418.3230.
§ 418.3105
Who does not need to file an application for a subsidy?
Regulations in 42 CFR 423.773(c) explain who is deemed eligible and does not need to file an application for a subsidy to be eligible for this assistance. Full-benefit dual eligible beneficiaries are in this category. If beneficiaries have deemed eligibility status because they receive Medicaid coverage, are enrolled in a Medicare Savings Program within their State, or receive SSI and have Medicare, then their subsidy is effective with the first month they have deemed eligibility status.
§ 418.3110
What happens when you apply for a subsidy?
(a) When you or your personal representative apply for a subsidy, we will ask for information that we need to determine if you meet all the requirements for a subsidy. You must give us complete information. If, based on the information you present to us, you do not meet all the requirements for eligibility listed in § 418.3101, or if one of the events listed in § 418.3115 exists, or you fail to submit information we request, we will deny your claim.
(b) If you meet all the requirements for eligibility listed in § 418.3101, or you meet all the requirements except for enrollment in a Medicare Part D plan or Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage, we will send you a notice telling you the following:
(1) You are eligible for a full or partial subsidy for a period not to exceed 1 year;
(2) What information we used to make this determination including how we calculated your income and resources;
(3) What you may do if your circumstances change as described in § 418.3120; and
(4) Your appeal rights.
(c) If you are not already enrolled with a Medicare prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage, you must enroll in order to receive your subsidy.
(d) If you do not meet all the requirements for eligibility listed in § 418.3101 or if § 418.3115 applies to you except for enrollment in a Medicare Part D plan or Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage as described in § 418.3225, we will send you a notice telling you the following:
(1) You are not eligible for a subsidy;
(2) The information we used to make this determination including how we calculated your income or resources;
(3) You may reapply if your situation changes; and
(4) Your appeal rights.
§ 418.3115
What events will make you ineligible for a subsidy?
Generally, even if you meet the other requirements in §§ 418.3101 through 418.3125, we will deny your claim or you will lose your subsidy if any of the following apply to you:
(a) You lose entitlement to or are not enrolled in Medicare Part A and are not enrolled in Medicare Part B.
(b) You do not enroll or lose your enrollment in a Medicare Part D plan or Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage.
(c) You do not give us information we need to determine your eligibility and if eligible, whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy; or you do not give us information we need to determine whether you continue to be eligible for a subsidy and if eligible, whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy.
(d) You knowingly give us false or misleading information.
§ 418.3120
What happens if your circumstances change after we determine you are eligible for a subsidy?
(a) After we determine that you are eligible for a subsidy, your subsidy eligibility could change if:
(1) You marry.
(2) You and your spouse, who lives with you, divorce.
(3) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, your spouse, who lives with you, dies.
(4) You and your spouse separate (
i.e.
, you or your spouse move out of the household and you are no longer living with your spouse) unless the separation is a temporary absence as described in § 404.347 of this chapter.
(5) You and your spouse resume living together after having been separated.
(6) You and your spouse, who lives with you, have your marriage annulled.
(7) You (or your spouse, who lives with you, if applicable) expect your estimated annual income to increase or decrease in the next calendar year.
(8) You (or your spouse, who lives with you, if applicable) expect your resources to increase or decrease in the next calendar year.

(10) You become eligible for one of the programs listed in 42 CFR 423.773(c).
(b)(1) When you report one of the events listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section, or we receive such a report from another source (e.g., a data exchange of reports of death), we will send you a redetermination form upon receipt of the report. You must return the completed form within 90 days of the date of the form.
(2) When you report one of the events listed in paragraphs (a)(7) through (a)(9) of this section or we receive such a report from another source (e.g., a data exchange involving income records), we will send you a redetermination form between August and December to evaluate the change. You must return the completed form to us within 30 days of the date of the form.
(3) If we increase, decrease, or terminate your subsidy as a result of the redetermination, we will send you a notice telling you:
(i) Whether you can receive a full or partial subsidy as described in 42 CFR 423.780 and 423.782.
(ii) How we calculated your income and resources;
(iii) When the change in your subsidy is effective;
(iv) Your appeal rights;
(v) What to do if your situation changes.
(4) If your spouse who lives with you dies, your spouse's death may result in changes in your income or resources that could decrease or eliminate your subsidy. If we are informed of the death of your spouse and the death would cause a decrease in or elimination of your subsidy, we will notify you that we will not immediately change your subsidy because of your spouse's death. We will defer your redetermination for 1 year from the month following the month we are notified of the death of your spouse, unless we receive a report of another event specified in 418.3120(a) that would affect your eligibility for a subsidy.
(c) If you become eligible for one of the programs listed in 42 CFR 423.773(c), CMS will notify you of any change in your subsidy.
[70 FR 77675, Dec. 30, 2005, as amended at 75 FR 81845, Dec. 29, 2010]
§ 418.3123

(b) If we redetermine your subsidy as described in § 418.3120(b)(2), any change in your subsidy will be effective in January of the next year.
(c) If you do not return the redetermination form described in § 418.3120(b)(1), we will terminate your subsidy effective with the month following the expiration of the 90-day period described in § 418.3120(b)(1).
(d) If you do not return the redetermination forms described in § 418.3120(b)(2), we will terminate your
subsidy effective in January of the next year.
(e)
Special rule for widows and widowers.
If your spouse who lives with you dies and the changes in your income or resources resulting from your spouse's death would decrease or eliminate your subsidy, we will defer your next redetermination for 1 year from the month following the month we are notified of the death of your spouse, unless we receive a report of another event specified in 418.3120(a) that would affect your eligibility for a subsidy.
[70 FR 77675, Dec. 30, 2005, as amended at 75 FR 81845, Dec. 29, 2010]
§ 418.3125
What are redeterminations?
(a)
Redeterminations defined.
A redetermination is a periodic review of your eligibility to make sure that you are still eligible for a subsidy and if so, to determine whether you should continue to receive a full or partial subsidy. This review deals with evaluating your income and resources (and those of your spouse, who lives with you) and will not affect past months of eligibility. It will be used to determine your future subsidy eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy for future months. We will redetermine your eligibility if we made the initial determination of your eligibility or if you are deemed eligible because you receive SSI benefits. Rules regarding redeterminations of initial eligibility determinations made by a State are described in 42 CFR 423.774.
(b)
When we make redeterminations.
(1) We will redetermine your subsidy eligibility within one year after we determine that you are eligible for the subsidy.
(2) After the first redetermination, we will redetermine your subsidy eligibility at intervals determined by the Commissioner. The length of time between redeterminations varies depending on the likelihood that your situation may change in a way that affects your eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy.
(3) We may also redetermine your eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy when you tell us of a change in your circumstances described in § 418.3120.
(4) We may redetermine your eligibility when we receive information from you or from data exchanges with Federal and State agencies that may affect whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy or your eligibility for the subsidy.
(5) We will also redetermine eligibility on a random sample of cases for quality assurance purposes. For each collection of sample cases, all factors affecting eligibility and/or whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy may be verified by contact with primary repositories of information relevant to each individual factor (e.g., we may contact employers to verify wage information). Consequently, we may contact a variety of other sources, in addition to recontacting you, to verify the completeness and accuracy of our information.

# Filing of Application

(b) Assure that you can receive the subsidy for any months that you are eligible and are enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan or Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage; and
(c) Give you the right to appeal if you disagree with our determination.

§ 418.3220
When is your application considered filed?
(a)
General rule.
We consider an application for a subsidy as described in § 418.3210 to be filed with us on the day it is received by either one of our employees at one of our offices or by one of our employees who is authorized to receive it at a place other than one of our offices or it is considered filed on the day it is submitted electronically through our Internet Web site. If a State Medicaid agency forwards to us a subsidy application that you gave to it, we will consider the date you submitted that application to the State Medicaid agency as the filing date. (See 42 CFR 423.774 for applications filed with a State Medicaid agency.)
(b)
Exceptions.
(1) When we receive an application that is mailed, we will assume that we received it 5 days earlier (unless you can show us that you did not receive it within the 5 days) and use the earlier date as the application filing date if it would result in another month of subsidy eligibility.
(2) We may consider an application to be filed on the date a written or oral inquiry about your subsidy eligibility is made, or the date we receive a partially completed Internet subsidy application from our Internet Web site where the requirements set forth in § 418.3230 are met.
§ 418.3225
How long will your application remain in effect?
(a) Your application will remain in effect until our determination or decision has become final and binding under § 418.3620. If you appeal our initial determination, the determination does not become final until we issue a decision on any appeal you have filed under § 418.3655 (see § 418.3675) or dismiss the request for a hearing under § 418.3670.
(b) If, at the time your application is filed or before our determination or decision becomes final and binding, you meet all the requirements for a subsidy as described in 42 CFR 423.773 except for enrollment in a Medicare Part D plan or Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage, we will send you a notice advising you of your eligibility for the subsidy and the requirement to enroll in such a plan.
(c) If you are not entitled to Medicare Part A and/or enrolled in Medicare Part B at the time your subsidy application is filed but you appear to be in an enrollment period, we will send you a notice advising you that we will not make a determination on your application until you become entitled to Medicare Part A and/or enrolled in Medicare Part B. If you are not entitled to Medicare Part A and/or enrolled in Medicare Part B at the time your application is filed and you do not appear to be in an enrollment period, we will send you a notice advising you that you are not eligible for the subsidy because you are not entitled to Medicare Part A and/or enrolled in Medicare Part B and explain your appeal rights.
§ 418.3230
When will we use your subsidy inquiry as your filing date?
If you or your personal representative (as defined in 42 CFR 423.772) make an oral or written inquiry about the subsidy, or partially complete an Internet subsidy application on our Web site, we will use the date of the inquiry or the date the partial Internet application was started as your filing date if the following requirements are met:
(a) The written or oral inquiry indicates your intent to file for the subsidy, or you submit a partially completed Internet application to us;
(b) The inquiry, whether in person, by telephone, or in writing, is directed to an office or an official described in § 418.3220, or a partially completed Internet subsidy application is received by us;
(c) You or your personal representative (as defined in 42 CFR 423.772) file an application (as defined in § 418.3210) within 60 days after the date of the notice we will send in response to the inquiry. The notice will say that we will make an initial determination of your eligibility for a subsidy, if an application is filed within 60 days after the date of the notice. We will send the notice to you. Where you are a minor or adjudged legally incompetent and your personal representative made the inquiry, we will send the notice to your personal representative; and
(d) You are alive on the first day of the month in which the application is filed.

# Income
§ 418.3301
What is income?
Income is anything you and your spouse, who lives with you, receive in cash or in-kind that you can use to meet your needs for food and shelter. Income can be earned income or unearned income.
§ 418.3305
What is not income?
Some things you receive are not considered income because you cannot use them to meet your needs for food or shelter. The things that are not income for purposes of determining eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy are described in § 416.1103 of this chapter.
§ 418.3310
Whose income do we count?
(a) We count your income. If you are married and live with your spouse in the month you file for a subsidy, or when we redetermine your eligibility for a subsidy as described in § 418.3125, we count your income and your spouse's income regardless of whether one or both of you apply or are eligible for the subsidy.
(b) We will determine your eligibility based on your income alone if you are not married or if you are married but you are separated from your spouse (
i.e.
, you or your spouse move out of the household and you are no longer living with your spouse) at the time you apply for a subsidy or when we redetermine your eligibility for a subsidy as described in § 418.3125.
(c) If your subsidy is based on your income and your spouse's income and we redetermine your subsidy as described in § 418.3120(b)(1), we will stop counting the income of your spouse in the month following the month that we receive a report that your marriage ended due to death, divorce, or annulment; or a report that you and your spouse stopped living together.
(d) If your subsidy is based on your income and your spouse's income, we will continue counting the income of both you and your spouse if one of you is temporarily away from home as described in § 404.347 of this chapter.
§ 418.3315
What is earned income?
Earned income is defined in § 416.1110 of this chapter and may be in cash or in kind. We may count more of your earned income than you actually receive. We count gross income, which is more than you actually receive, if amounts are withheld from earned income because of a garnishment, or to pay a debt or other legal obligation such as taxes, or to make any other similar payments.
§ 418.3320
How do we count your earned income?
(a)
Wages.
We count your wages at the earliest of the following points: when you receive them, when they are credited to you, or when they are set aside for your use.
(b)
Net earnings from self-employment.
We count net earnings from self-employment on a taxable year basis. If you have net losses from self-employment, we deduct them from your other earned income. We do not deduct the net losses from your unearned income.
(c)
Payments for services performed in a sheltered workshop or work activities center.
We count payments you receive for services performed in a sheltered workshop or work activities center when
you receive them or when they are set aside for your use.
(d)
In-kind earned income.
We count the current market value of in-kind earned income. For purposes of this part, we use the definition of current market value in § 416.1101 of this chapter. If you receive an item that is not fully paid for and you are responsible for the unpaid balance, only the paid-up value is income to you (see example in § 416.1123(c) of this chapter).
(e)
Certain honoraria and royalties.
We count honoraria for services rendered and royalty payments that you receive in connection with any publication of your work. We will consider these payments as available to you when you receive them, when they are credited to your account, or when they are set aside for your use, whichever is earliest.
(f)
Period for which earned income is counted.
For purposes of determining subsidy eligibility and, if eligible, whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy, we consider all of the countable earned income you receive (or expect to receive) during the year for which we are determining your eligibility for this subsidy. However, in the first year that you or your spouse apply for the subsidy, we consider all of the countable earned income you and your living-with spouse receive (or expect to receive) starting in the month for which we determine your eligibility based on your application for a subsidy through the end of the year for which we are determining your eligibility. If we count your income for only a portion of the year, the income limit for subsidy eligibility will be adjusted accordingly. For example, if we count your income for 6 consecutive months of the year (July through December), the income limit for subsidy eligibility will be half of the income limit applicable for the full year.
§ 418.3325
What earned income do we not count?
(a) While we must know the source and amount of all of your earned income, we do not count all of it to determine your subsidy eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy. We apply these income exclusions in the order listed in paragraph (b) of this section to your income. We never reduce your earned income below zero or apply any unused earned income exclusion to unearned income.
(b) For the year or partial year that we are determining your eligibility for the subsidy, we do not count as earned income:
(1) Any refund of Federal income taxes you or your living-with spouse receive under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to the earned income tax credit) and payment you receive from an employer under section 3507 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to advance payments of earned income tax credit);
(2) Earned income which is received infrequently or irregularly as explained in § 416.1112(c)(2) of this chapter;
(3) Any portion of the $20 per month exclusion described in § 416.1124(c)(12) of this chapter which has not been excluded from your combined unearned income (or the combined unearned income of you and your living-with spouse);
(4) $65 per month of your earned income (or the combined earned income you and your living-with spouse receive in that same year);
(5) Earned income you use to pay impairment-related work expenses described in § 416.976 of this chapter, if you are receiving a social security disability insurance benefit, your disabling condition(s) does not include blindness and you are under age 65. We consider that you attain age 65 on the day before your 65th birthday. In lieu of determining the actual amount of these expenses, we will assume that the value of these work expenses is equal to a standard percentage of your total earned income per month if you tell us that you have impairment-related work expenses. The amount we exclude will be equal to the average percentage of gross earnings excluded for SSI recipients who have such expenses. Initially, the exclusion for impairment-related work expenses will be 16.3 percent of the gross earnings. We may adjust the percentages if the average percentage of gross earnings excluded for supplemental security income (SSI) recipients changes. If we make such a change
we will publish a notice in the
Federal Register.
If excluding impairment-related work expenses greater than the standard percentage of your earned income would affect your eligibility or subsidy amount, you may establish that your actual expenses are greater than the standard percentage of your total earned income. You may do so by contacting us and providing evidence of your actual expenses. The exclusion of impairment-related work expenses also applies to the earnings of your living-with spouse if he or she is receiving a social security disability insurance benefit, the disabling condition(s) does not include blindness and he or she is under age 65;
(6) One-half of your remaining earned income (or combined earned income of you and your living-with spouse); and
(7) Earned income as described in § 416.1112(c)(8) of this chapter that you use to meet any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of the income if you receive a social security disability insurance benefit based on blindness and you are under age 65. We consider that you attain age 65 on the day before your 65th birthday. In lieu of determining the actual amount of these expenses, we will assume that the value of these expenses is equal to a standard percentage of your total earned income per month. The amount we exclude will be equal to the average percentage of gross earnings excluded for SSI recipients who have such expenses. Initially, the exclusion for blind work expenses will be 25 percent of the gross earnings. We may adjust the percentages if the average percentage of gross earnings excluded for SSI recipients changes. If we make such a change we will publish a notice in the
Federal Register.
If excluding work expenses greater than the standard percentage of your earned income would affect your eligibility or subsidy amount, you may establish that your actual expenses are greater than the standard percentage of your earned income. You may do so by contacting us and providing evidence of your actual expenses. The exclusion of work expenses also applies to the earnings of your living-with spouse if he or she receives a social security disability insurance benefit based on blindness and is under age 65.
§ 418.3330
What is unearned income?
Unearned income is all income that is not earned income. We describe some of the types of unearned income we count in § 418.3335.
§ 418.3335
What types of unearned income do we count?
(a) Some of the types of unearned income we count are described in § 416.1121(a) through (g) of this chapter.
(b) For claims filed before January 1, 2010, and redeterminations that are effective before January 1, 2010, we also count in-kind support and maintenance as unearned income. In-kind support and maintenance is any food and shelter given to you or that you receive because someone else pays for it.
[70 FR 77675, Dec. 30, 2005, as amended at 75 FR 81845, Dec. 29, 2010]
§ 418.3340
How do we count your unearned income?
(a)
When income is received.
We count unearned income as available to you at the earliest of the following points: when you receive it, when it is credited to your account, or when it is set aside for your use.
(b)
When income is counted.
For purposes of determining eligibility and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy, we consider all of the countable unearned income you and your living-with spouse receive (or expect to receive) during the year for which we are determining your eligibility for this benefit. However, in the first year you or your spouse apply for the subsidy, we consider all of the countable unearned income both you and your living-with spouse receive (or expect to receive) starting in the month for which we determine eligibility for you or your living-with spouse based on an application for the subsidy. If we count your income for only a portion of the year, the income limits for subsidy eligibility will be adjusted accordingly. For example, if we count your income for 6 consecutive months of the year (July through December), the income limit for subsidy eligibility will be half of the income limit applicable for the full year.
(c)
Amount considered as income.
We may include more or less of your income than you actually receive.
(1) We include more than you actually receive where another benefit payment (such as a social security benefit) has been reduced to recover an overpayment. In such a situation, you are repaying a legal obligation through the withholding of portions of your benefit amount, and the amount of this withholding is part of your unearned income.
(2) We also include more than you actually receive if amounts are withheld from unearned income because of a garnishment, or to pay a debt or other legal obligation, or to make any other payment such as payment of your Medicare premiums.
(3) We include less than you actually receive if part of the payment is for an expense you had in getting the payment. For example, if you are paid for damages you receive in an accident, we subtract from the amount of the payment your medical, legal, or other expenses connected with the accident. If you receive a retroactive check from a benefit program, we subtract legal fees connected with the claim. We do not subtract from any taxable unearned income the part you have to use to pay personal income taxes. The payment of taxes is not an expense you have in getting income.
(d)
Retroactive benefits.
We count retroactive monthly benefits such as social security benefits as unearned income in the year you receive the retroactive benefits.
(e)
Certain veterans benefits.
If you receive a veterans benefit that includes an amount paid to you because of a dependent, we do not count as your unearned income the amount paid to you because of the dependent. If you are a dependent of an individual who receives a veterans benefit and a portion of the benefit is attributable to you as a dependent, we count the amount attributable to you as your unearned income if you reside with the veteran or you receive your own separate payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
(f)
Social Security cost-of-living adjustment.
We will not count as income the amount of the cost-of-living adjustment for social security benefits for any month through the month following the month in which the annual revision of the Federal poverty guidelines is published.
§ 418.3350
What types of unearned income do we not count?
(a) For claims filed on or after January 1, 2010 and redeterminations that are effective on or after January 1, 2010, we do not count as income in-kind support and maintenance.
(b) While we must know the source and amount of all of your unearned income, we do not count all of it to determine your eligibility for the subsidy. We apply to your unearned income the exclusions in § 418.3350(c) in the order listed. However, we do not reduce your unearned income below zero, and we do not apply any unused unearned income exclusion to earned income except for the $20 per month exclusion described in § 416.1124(c)(12) of this chapter. For purposes of determining eligibility for a subsidy and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy, we treat the $20 per month exclusion as a $240 per year exclusion.
(c) We do not count as income the unearned income described in § 416.1124(b) and (c) of this chapter, except for paragraph (c)(13).
(d) We do not count as income any dividends or interest earned on resources you or your spouse owns.
[75 FR 81846, Dec. 29, 2010]

# Resources
§ 418.3401
What are resources?
For purposes of this subpart, resources are cash or other assets that an individual owns and could convert to cash to be used for his or her support and maintenance.
§ 418.3405
What types of resources do we count?
(a) We count liquid resources. Liquid resources are cash, financial accounts, and other financial instruments that can be converted to cash within 20 workdays, excluding certain non-workdays as explained in § 416.120(d) of this chapter. Examples of resources that are ordinarily liquid include: stocks,
bonds, mutual fund shares, promissory notes, mortgages, life insurance policies (for claims filed before January 1, 2010, and redeterminations that are effective before January 1, 2010), financial institution accounts (including savings, checking, and time deposits, also known as certificates of deposit), retirement accounts (such as individual retirement accounts or 401(k) accounts), revocable trusts, funds in an irrevocable trust if the trust beneficiary can direct the use of the funds, and similar items. We will presume that these types of resources can be converted to cash within 20 workdays and are countable as resources for subsidy determinations. However, if you establish that a particular resource cannot be converted to cash within 20 workdays, we will not count it as a resource.
(b) We count the equity value of real property as a resource regardless of whether it can be sold within 20 workdays. However, we do not count the home that is your principal place of residence and the land on which it is situated as a resource as defined in § 418.3425(a).
[70 FR 77675, Dec. 30, 2005, as amended at 75 FR 81846, Dec. 29, 2010]
§ 418.3410
Whose resources do we count?
(a) We count your resources. We count the resources of both you and your spouse regardless of whether one or both of you apply or are eligible for the subsidy if you are married and live with your spouse as of the month for which we determine your eligibility based on an application for a subsidy, as of the month for which we redetermine your eligibility for a subsidy as described in § 418.3125, or as of the month for which we determine your eligibility due to a change you reported as described in § 418.3120.
(b) We will determine your eligibility based on your resources alone if you are not married or if you are married but you are separated from your spouse at the time you apply for a subsidy or at the time we redetermine your eligibility for a subsidy as described in § 418.3125.
(c) If your subsidy is based on the resources of you and your spouse and we redetermine your subsidy as described in § 418.3120(b)(1), we will stop counting the resources of your spouse in the month following the month that we receive a report that your marriage ended due to death, divorce, or annulment; or a report that you and your spouse stopped living together.
(d) If your subsidy is based on the resources of you and your spouse, we will continue counting the resources of both you and your spouse if one of you is temporarily away from home as described in § 404.347 of this chapter.
§ 418.3415
How do we determine countable resources?
(a)
General rule.
Your countable resources are determined as of the first moment of the month for which we determine your eligibility based on your application for a subsidy or for which we redetermine your eligibility for a subsidy. A resource determination is based on what assets you (and your living-with spouse, if any) have, what their values are, and whether they are excluded as of the first moment of the month. We will use this amount as your countable resources at the point when we determine your eligibility for the subsidy unless you report to us that the value of your resources has changed as described in § 418.3120.
(b)
Equity value.
Resources, other than cash, are evaluated according to your (and your spouse's, if any) equity in the resources. For purposes of this subpart, the equity value of an item is defined as the price for which that item, minus any encumbrances, can reasonably be expected to sell on the open market in the particular geographic area involved.
(c)
Relationship of income to resources.
Cash you receive during a month is evaluated under the rules for counting income during the month of receipt. If you retain the cash until the first moment of the following month, the cash is countable as a resource unless it is otherwise excludable.
§ 418.3420
How are funds held in financial institution accounts counted?
(a)
Owner of the account.
Funds held in a financial institution account (including savings, checking, and time deposits also known as certificates of deposit) are considered your resources if you own the account and can use the funds for your support and maintenance. We determine whether you own the account and can use the funds by looking at how the account is held.
(b)
Individually-held account.
If you are designated as the sole owner by the account title and you can withdraw and use funds from that account for your support and maintenance, all of that account's funds are your resource regardless of the source. For as long as these conditions are met, we presume that you own 100 percent of the funds in the account. This presumption is not rebuttable.
(c)
Jointly-held account.
(1) If you are the only subsidy claimant or subsidy recipient who is an account holder on a jointly held account, we presume that all of the funds in the account belong to you. If more than one subsidy claimant or subsidy recipient are account holders, we presume that the funds in the account belong to those individuals in equal shares.
(2) If you disagree with the ownership presumption as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you may rebut the presumption. Rebuttal is a procedure which permits you to furnish evidence and establish that some or all of the funds in a jointly-held account do not belong to you.
§ 418.3425
What resources do we exclude from counting?
In determining your resources (and the resources of your spouse, if any) the following items shall be excluded:
(a)
Your home.
For purposes of this exclusion, a home is any property in which you (and your spouse, if any) have an ownership interest and which serves as your principal place of residence. This property includes the shelter in which an individual resides, the land on which the shelter is located, and outbuildings;
(b)
Non-liquid resources, other than nonhome real property.
Non-liquid resources are resources that are not liquid resources as defined in § 418.3405. Irrevocable burial trusts and the irrevocable portion of prepaid burial contracts are considered non-liquid resources;
(c) Property of a trade or business which is essential to the means of self-support as provided in § 416.1222 of this chapter;
(d) Nonbusiness property which is essential to the means of self-support as provided in § 416.1224 of this chapter;
(e) Stock in regional or village corporations held by natives of Alaska during the twenty-year period in which the stock is inalienable pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (see § 416.1228 of this chapter);
(f) For claims filed on or after January 1, 2010, and redeterminations that are effective on or after January 1, 2010, life insurance owned by an individual (and spouse, if any);
(g) Restricted allotted Indian lands as provided in § 416.1234 of this chapter;
(h) Payments or benefits provided under a Federal statute where exclusion is required by such statute;
(i) Disaster relief assistance as provided in § 416.1237 of this chapter;
(j) Funds up to $1,500 for the individual and $1,500 for the spouse who lives with the individual if these funds are expected to be used for burial expenses of the individual and spouse;
(k) Burial spaces, as provided in § 416.1231(a) of this chapter;
(l) Title XVI or title II retroactive payments as provided in § 416.1233 of this chapter;
(m) Housing assistance as provided in § 416.1238 of this chapter;
(n) Refunds of Federal income taxes and advances made by an employer relating to an earned income tax credit, as provided in § 416.1235 of this chapter;
(o) Payments received as compensation incurred or losses suffered as a result of a crime, as provided in § 416.1229 of this chapter;
(p) Relocation assistance from a State or local government, as provided in § 416.1239 of this chapter;
(q) Dedicated financial institution accounts as provided in § 416.1247 of this chapter;
(r) A gift to, or for the benefit of, an individual who has not attained 18
years of age and who has a life-threatening condition, from an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code. The resource exclusion applies to any in-kind gift that is not converted to cash, or to a cash gift that does not exceed $2,000; and
(s) Funds received and conserved to pay for medical and/or social services as provided in § 416.1103 of this chapter.
[70 FR 77675, Dec. 30, 2005, as amended at 75 FR 81846, Dec. 29, 2010]

# Adjustments and Terminations
§ 418.3501
What could cause us to increase or reduce your subsidy or terminate your subsidy eligibility?
(a) Certain changes in your circumstances could cause us to increase or reduce your subsidy or terminate your subsidy eligibility. These changes include (but are not limited to) changes to:
(1) Your income;
(2) Your spouse's income if you are married and living with your spouse;
(3) Your resources;
(4) Your spouse's resources if you are married and living with your spouse; and
(5) Your family size.
(b) We will periodically review your circumstances (as described in § 418.3125) to make sure you are still eligible for a subsidy and, if eligible, whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy.
(c) If you report that your circumstances have changed or we receive other notice of such a change after we determine that you are eligible, we will review your circumstances as described in § 418.3120 to determine if you are still eligible.
§ 418.3505
How would an increase, reduction or termination affect you?
(a) An
increase
in your subsidy means that you would be able to pay a lower premium to participate in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. An increased subsidy may also result in a reduction in any deductible or copayments for which you are responsible.
(b) A
reduction
in your subsidy means that you would have to begin to pay a premium or a higher premium to participate in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. You may also have to begin to pay a deductible and higher copayments or increase the amounts of these payments.
(c) A
termination
means that you would no longer be eligible for a subsidy under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program.
§ 418.3510
When would an increase, reduction or termination start?
We are required to give you a written notice of our proposed action before increasing, reducing, or terminating your subsidy. We will not give this advance notice where we have factual information confirming your death, such as through a report by your surviving spouse, a legal guardian, a close relative, or a landlord. The notice will tell you the first month that we plan to make the change. The notice will also give you appeal rights which are explained in detail in §§ 418.3601 through 418.3670. Your appeal rights for a reduction or termination will include the right to continue to receive your subsidy at the previously established level until there is a decision on your appeal request if your appeal is filed within 10 days after you receive our notice. You will not be required to pay back any subsidy you received while your appeal was pending.
§ 418.3515
How could you qualify for a subsidy again?
Unless you subsequently qualify as a deemed eligible person (per 42 CFR 423.773(c)), you must file a new application for a subsidy and meet all the requirements in § 418.3101.

# Determinations and the Administrative Review Process
§ 418.3601
When do you have the right to administrative review?
You have the right to an administrative review of the initial determination we make about your eligibility and about your continuing eligibility for a subsidy and any other matter that gives you the right to further review as
discussed in § 418.3605. If you are married and living with your spouse and your spouse's eligibility for a subsidy may be adversely affected by our decision upon review, we will notify your spouse before our review and give him or her the opportunity to present additional information for us to consider.
§ 418.3605
What is an initial determination?
Initial determinations are the determinations we make that are subject to administrative and judicial review. The initial determination will state the relevant facts and will give the reasons for our conclusions. Examples of initial determinations that are subject to administrative and judicial review include but are not limited to:
(a) The initial calculation of your income and/or resources;
(b) The determination about whether or not you are eligible for a subsidy and if so, whether you receive a full or partial subsidy;
(c) The determination to reduce your subsidy; and
(d) The determination to terminate your subsidy.
§ 418.3610
Is there administrative or judicial review for administrative actions that are not initial determinations?
Administrative actions that are not initial determinations may be reviewed by us, but they are not subject to the administrative or judicial review process as provided by these sections. For example, changes in your prescription drug program or voluntary disenrollment in the Part D program are not initial determinations that are subject to the administrative review process.
§ 418.3615
Will we mail you a notice of the initial determination?
(a) We will mail a written notice of the initial determination to you at your last known address. Generally, we will not send a notice if your premium subsidy stops because of your death or if the initial determination is a redetermination that your eligibility for a subsidy and the amount of your subsidy has not changed.
(b) The written notice that we send will tell you:
(1) What our initial determination is;
(2) The reasons for our determination; and
(3) The effect of our determination on your right to further review.
(c) We will mail you a written notice before increasing, reducing, or terminating your subsidy. The notice will tell you the first month that we plan to make the change and give you appeal rights. Your appeal rights for a reduction or termination will include the right to continue to receive your subsidy at the previously established level until there is a decision on your appeal request if your appeal is filed within 10 days after you receive our notice.
§ 418.3620
What is the effect of an initial determination?
An initial determination is binding unless you request an appeal within the time period stated in § 418.3630(a) or we revise it as provided in § 418.3678.
§ 418.3625
What is the process for administrative review?
The process for administrative review of initial determinations is either a hearing conducted by telephone or a case review. We will provide you with a hearing by telephone when you appeal the initial determination made on your claim, unless you choose not to participate in a telephone hearing. If you choose not to participate in a telephone hearing, the review will consist of a case review. The hearing will be conducted by an individual who was not involved in making the initial determination. The individual who conducts the hearing will make the final decision after the hearing. If you are dissatisfied after we have made a final decision, you may file an action in Federal district court.
(a)
Notice scheduling the telephone hearing.
Once you request a telephone hearing, we will schedule the hearing and send you a notice of the date and time of the hearing at least 20 days before the hearing. The notice will contain a statement of the specific issues to be decided and tell you that you may designate a personal representative (as defined in 42 CFR 423.772) to represent you during the proceedings.
The notice will explain the opportunity and procedure for reviewing your file and for submitting additional evidence prior to the hearing. It also will provide a brief explanation of the proceedings, of the right and process to subpoena witnesses and documents, of the procedures for requesting a change in the time or date of your hearing, and of the procedure for requesting interpreter services.
(b)
Opportunity to review your file.
Prior to the telephone hearing, you will be able to review the information that was used to make an initial determination in your case. You can provide us with additional information you wish to have considered at the hearing.
(c)
Hearing waived, rescheduled, or missed.
If you decide you do not want a hearing by telephone or if you are not available at the time of the scheduled hearing, the decision in your case will be made by a case review. This means that the decision will be based on the information in your file and any additional information you provide. You may ask for a change in the time and date of the telephone hearing; this should be done at the earliest possible opportunity prior to the hearing. Your request must state your reason(s) for needing the change in time or date and state the new time and date you want the hearing to be held. We will change the time and date, but not necessarily to your preferred time or date, of the telephone hearing if you have good cause. If you miss the scheduled hearing and the decision in your case is decided by a case review, we will provide a hearing, at your written request, if we decide you had good cause for missing the scheduled hearing. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) You have attempted to obtain a representative but need additional time;
(2) Your representative was appointed within 30 days of the scheduled hearing and needs additional time to prepare for the hearing;
(3) Your representative has a prior commitment to be in court or at another administrative hearing on the date scheduled for your hearing;
(4) A witness who will testify to facts material to your case would be unavailable to participate in the scheduled hearing and the evidence cannot be obtained any other way;
(5) You are unrepresented, and you are unable to respond to the notice of hearing because of any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) that you may have; or
(6) You did not receive notice of the hearing appointment.
(d)
Witnesses at hearing.
When we determine that it is reasonably necessary for the full presentation of a case, we may issue a subpoena to compel the production of certain evidence or testimony.
§ 418.3630
How do you request administrative review?
(a)
Time period for requesting review.
You must request administrative review within 60 days after the date you receive notice of the initial determination (or within the extended time period if we extend the time as provided in paragraph (c) of this section). You can request administrative review in person, by phone, fax, or mail. If you miss the time frame for requesting administrative review, you may ask us for more time to request a review. The process for requesting an extension is explained further in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Where to file your request.
You can request administrative review by mailing or faxing a request or calling or visiting any Social Security office.
(c)
When we will extend the time period to request administrative review.
If you want a review of the initial determination but do not request one within 60 days after the date you receive notice of the initial determination, you may ask us for more time to request a review. Your request for an extension must explain why it was not filed within the stated time period. If you show us that you had good cause for missing the deadline, we will extend the time period. To determine whether good cause exists, we use the standards explained in § 418.3640.
§ 418.3635
Can anyone request administrative review on your behalf?
Your personal representative (as defined in 42 CFR 423.772) may request administrative review on your behalf. That person can send additional information to us on your behalf and participate in the hearing.
§ 418.3640
How do we determine if you had good cause for missing the deadline to request administrative review?
(a) In determining whether you have shown that you have good cause for missing a deadline to request review we consider:
(1) What circumstances kept you from making the request on time;
(2) Whether our action misled you;
(3) Whether you did not understand the requirements of the Act resulting from amendments to the Act, other legislation, or court decisions; and
(4) Whether you had any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) which prevented you from filing a timely request or from understanding or knowing about the need to file a timely request for review.
(b) Examples of circumstances where good cause may exist include, but are not limited to, the following situations:
(1) You were seriously ill and were prevented from contacting us in person, in writing, or through a friend, relative, or other person.
(2) There was a death or serious illness in your immediate family.
(3) Important records were destroyed or damaged by fire or other accidental cause.
(4) You were trying very hard to find necessary information to support your claim but did not find the information within the stated time periods.
(5) You asked us for additional information explaining our action within the time limit, and within 60 days of receiving the explanation you requested a review.
(6) We gave you incorrect or incomplete information about when and how to request administrative review.
(7) You did not receive notice of the initial determination.
(8) You sent the request to another Government agency in good faith within the time limit and the request did not reach us until after the time period had expired.
(9) Unusual or unavoidable circumstances exist, including the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, which show that you could not have known the need to file timely, or which prevented you from filing timely.
§ 418.3645
Can you request that the decision-maker be disqualified?
The person designated to conduct your hearing will not conduct the hearing if he or she is prejudiced or partial with respect to any party or has any interest in the matter pending for decision. If you object to the person who will be conducting your hearing, you must notify us at your earliest opportunity. The Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee will decide whether to appoint another person to conduct your hearing.
§ 418.3650
How do we make our decision upon review?
After you request review of our initial determination, we will review the information that we considered in making the initial determination and any other information we receive. We will make our decision based on this information. The issues that we will review are the issues with which you disagree. We may consider other issues, but we will provide you with advance notice of these other issues as explained in § 418.3625. If you are dissatisfied with our final decision, you may file an action in Federal district court.
§ 418.3655
How will we notify you of our decision after our review?
We will mail a written notice of our decision on the issue(s) you appealed to you at your last known address. Generally, we will not send a notice if your subsidy stops because of your death. The written notice that we send will tell you:
(a) What our decision is;
(b) The reasons for our decision;
(c) The effect of our decision; and
(d) Your right to judicial review of the decision.
§ 418.3665
Can your request for a hearing or case review be dismissed?
We will dismiss your request for a hearing or case review under any of the following conditions:
(a) At any time before notice of the decision is mailed, you ask that your request for administrative review be withdrawn; or
(b) You failed to request administrative review timely and did not have good cause for missing the deadline for requesting review.
§ 418.3670
How will you be notified of the dismissal?
We will mail a written notice of the dismissal of your request for administrative review to you at your last known address. The dismissal is not subject to judicial review and is binding on you unless we vacate it. The decision-maker may vacate any dismissal of your request for administrative review if, within 60 days after the date you receive the dismissal notice, you request that the dismissal be vacated and show good cause why the request should not be dismissed. The decision-maker shall advise you in writing of any action he or she takes.
§ 418.3675
How does our decision affect you?
Our decision is binding unless you file an action in Federal district court seeking review of our final decision or we revise it as provided in § 418.3678. You may file an action in Federal district court within 60 days after the date you receive notice of the decision. You may request that the time for filing an action in Federal district court be extended. The request must be in writing and it must give the reasons why the action was not filed within the stated time period. The request must be filed with the decision-maker who issued the final decision in your case. If you show that you had good cause for missing the deadline, we will extend the deadline. We will use the standards in § 418.3640 to decide if you had good cause to miss the deadline.
§ 418.3678
What is the process for correcting Agency clerical errors?
If we become aware within 60 days of the date of our initial determination or our decision following a case review or telephone hearing, that a clerical error was made in determining whether or not you are eligible for a subsidy (either in whole or in part), we may issue a revised initial determination which would be effective back to the date you originally filed your application or the effective date of a subsidy changing event, provided you meet the requirements in § 418.3101. We may revise an initial determination or decision regardless of whether such revised determination or decision is favorable or unfavorable to you. If the revised determination or decision (which is a new initial determination) is not favorable to you, you will not be responsible for paying back any subsidy received prior to the revised determination or decision. We will mail you a notice of the revised determination which will explain to you that we have made a revised determination and that this determination replaces an earlier determination, how this determination affects your subsidy eligibility, and your right to request a hearing.
§ 418.3680
What happens if your case is remanded by a Federal court?
When a Federal court remands a case to the Commissioner for further consideration, the decision-maker (as described in § 418.3625) acting on behalf of the Commissioner, may make a decision. That component will follow the procedures in § 418.3625, unless we decide that we can make a decision that is fully favorable to you without another hearing. Any issues relating to your subsidy may be considered by the decision-maker whether or not they were raised in the administrative proceedings leading to the final decision in your case.

§ 422.1
Organization and functions.
(a)
General.
A complete description of the organization and functions of the Social Security Administration (pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a), as amended by Pub. L. 90-23, the Public Information Act) was published in the
Federal Register
of July 15, 1967 (32 FR 10458), and was subsequently revised on April 16, 1968 (33 FR 5828), and amended on July 18, 1968 (33 FR 10292). Further amendments to or revisions of the description will be published in the
Federal Register
when and if required by changes in the organization or functions of the Social Security Administration. Such description (referred to as the SSA Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority) is printed and kept up to date in the Social Security Administration Organizational Manual, a copy of which is maintained in each district office and branch office of the Social Security Administration and is available for inspection and copying.
(b)
Information included in description.
This description includes information about the organization and functions of each component of the Social Security Administration. It also includes a listing of all district offices and branch offices within the organization of the Bureau of District Office Operations, and a listing of field offices within the organization of the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals where the public may secure information, make submittals or requests, or obtain decisions.
[34 FR 435, Jan. 11, 1969, as amended at 62 FR 38456, July 18, 1997]
§ 422.5
District offices and branch offices.
There are over 700 social security district offices and branch offices located in the principal cities and other urban areas or towns of the United States. In addition, there are over 3,300 contact stations, located in population and
trading centers, which are visited on a regularly, recurring, preannounced basis. A schedule of these visits can be obtained from the nearest district office or branch office. The address of the nearest district office or branch office can be obtained from the local telephone directory or from the post office. Each district office and branch office has a list of all district offices and branch offices throughout the country and their addresses. The principal officer in each district office is the manager. The principal officer in each branch office is the officer-in-charge. Each district office and branch office also has a list of field offices of the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals and their addresses. The administrative hearing examiner is the principal officer in each field office. For procedures relating to claims see § 422.130, subpart J of part 404 of this chapter, and § 404.1520 of this chapter (the latter relating to disability determinations). For procedures on request for hearing by an Administrative Law Judge and review by the Appeals Council see subpart C of this part 422.

# Subpart B—General Procedures

# Authority:
42 U.S.C. 405, 432, 902(a)(5), 1320b-1, 1320b-13, and 1320e-3, and sec. 7213(a)(1)(A) of Pub. L. 108-458.
§ 422.101
Material included in this subpart.
This subpart describes the procedures relating to applications for and assignment of social security numbers, maintenance of earnings records of individuals by the Social Security Administration, requests for statements of earnings or for revision of earnings records, and general claims procedures, including filing of applications, submission of evidence, determinations, and reconsideration of initial determinations.
§ 422.103
Social security numbers.
(a)
General.
The Social Security Administration (SSA) maintains a record of the earnings reported for each individual assigned a social security number. The individual's name and social security number identify the record so that the wages or self-employment income reported for or by the individual can be properly posted to the individual's record. Additional procedures concerning social security numbers may be found in Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury regulation 26 CFR 31.6011(b)-2.
(b)
Applying for a number
—(1)
Application.
An individual needing a Social Security number may apply for one by completing a prescribed application and submitting the required evidence. An individual outside the United States (U.S.) may apply for a Social Security number card at the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office, Manila, Philippines, at any U.S. Foreign Service post, or at a U.S. military post outside the United States. (See § 422.106 for special procedures for filing applications with other government agencies.) Additionally, a U.S. resident may apply for a Social Security number for a nonresident dependent when the number is necessary for U.S. tax purposes or some other valid reason, the evidence requirements of § 422.107 are met, and we determine that a personal interview with the dependent is not required.
(2)
Birth registration document.
We may enter into an agreement with officials of a State, including, for this purpose, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and New York City, to establish, as part of the official birth registration process, a procedure to assist us in assigning Social Security numbers to newborn children. Where an agreement is in effect, a parent, as part of the official birth registration process, need not complete a prescribed application and may request that we assign a Social Security number to the newborn child.
(3)
Immigration form.
We may enter into an agreement with the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assist us by collecting enumeration data as part of the immigration process. Where an agreement is in effect, an alien need not complete a prescribed application and may request, through DOS or DHS, as part of the immigration process, that we assign a Social Security number and issue a Social Security number card to him or her. An
alien will request the assignment of a Social Security number through this process in the manner provided by DOS and DHS.
(c)
How numbers are assigned
—(1)
Application.
If you complete a prescribed application, we will require you to furnish evidence, as necessary, to assist us in establishing your age, U.S. citizenship or alien status, true identity, and previously assigned Social Security number(s), if any. (See § 422.107 for evidence requirements.) We may require you to undergo a personal interview before we assign a Social Security number. If you request evidence to show that you have filed a prescribed application for a Social Security number card, we may furnish you with a receipt or equivalent document. We will electronically screen the data from the prescribed application against our files. If we find that you have not been assigned a Social Security number previously, we will assign one to you and issue a Social Security number card. However, if we find that you have been assigned a Social Security number previously, we will issue a replacement Social Security number card.
(2)
Request on birth registration document.
Where a parent has requested a social security number for a newborn child as part of an official birth registration process described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State vital statistics office will electronically transmit the request to SSA's central office in Baltimore, MD, along with the child's name, date and place of birth, sex, mother's maiden name, father's name (if shown on the birth registration), address of the mother, and birth certificate number. This birth registration information received by SSA from the State vital statistics office will be used to establish the age, identity, and U.S. citizenship of the newborn child. Using this information, SSA will assign a number to the child and send the social security number card to the child at the mother's address.
(3)
Request on immigration document.
Where an alien has requested a social security number as part of the immigration process described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, Department of Homeland Security will electronically transmit to SSA's central office in Baltimore, MD, the data elements collected for immigration purposes, by both Department of Homeland Security and DOS, that SSA needs to assign the alien a social security number along with other data elements as agreed upon by SSA and DOS or Department of Homeland Security. The data elements received by SSA will be used to establish the age, identity, and lawful alien status or authority to work of the alien. Using this data, SSA will assign a social security number to the alien and send the social security number card to him/her at the address the alien provides to DOS or Department of Homeland Security (or to the sponsoring agency of a refugee, if no personal mailing address is available).
(d)
Social security number cards.
A person who is assigned a social security number will receive a social security number card from SSA within a reasonable time after the number has been assigned. (See § 422.104 regarding the assignment of social security number cards to aliens.) Social security number cards are the property of SSA and must be returned upon request.
(e)
Replacement of social security number card
— (1)
When we may issue you a replacement card.
We may issue you a replacement Social Security number card, subject to the limitations in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. You must complete a prescribed application to receive a replacement Social Security number card. We follow the evidence requirements in § 422.107 when we issue you a replacement Social Security number card.
(2)
Limits on the number of replacement cards.
There are limits on the number of replacement social security number cards we will issue to you. You may receive no more than three replacement social security number cards in a year and ten replacement social security number cards per lifetime. We may allow for reasonable exceptions to these limits on a case-by-case basis in compelling circumstances. We also will consider name changes (
i.e.
, verified legal changes to the first name and/or surname) and changes in alien status which result in a necessary change to a restrictive legend on the SSN card (see paragraph (e)(3) of this section) to be
compelling circumstances, and will not include either of these changes when determining the yearly or lifetime limits. We may grant an exception if you provide evidence establishing that you would experience significant hardship if the card were not issued. An example of significant hardship includes, but is not limited to, providing SSA with a referral letter from a governmental social services agency indicating that the social security number card must be shown in order to obtain benefits or services.
(3)
Restrictive legend change defined.
Based on a person's immigration status, a restrictive legend may appear on the face of an SSN card to indicate that work is either not authorized or that work may be performed only with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authorization. This restrictive legend appears on the card above the individual's name and SSN. Individuals without work authorization in the U.S. receive SSN cards showing the restrictive legend, “Not Valid for Employment;” and SSN cards for those individuals who have temporary work authorization in the U.S. show the restrictive legend, “Valid For Work Only With DHS Authorization.” U.S. citizens and individuals who are permanent residents receive SSN cards without a restrictive legend. For the purpose of determining a change in restrictive legend, the individual must have a change in immigration status or citizenship which results in a change to or the removal of a restrictive legend when compared to the prior SSN card data. An SSN card request based upon a change in immigration status or citizenship which does not affect the restrictive legend will count toward the yearly and lifetime limits, as in the case of Permanent Resident Aliens who attain U.S. citizenship.

Persons eligible for SSN assignment.
We can assign you a social security number if you meet the evidence requirements in § 422.107 and you are:
(1) A United States citizen; or
(2) An alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence or under other authority of law permitting you to work in the United States (§ 422.105 describes how we determine if a nonimmigrant alien is permitted to work in the United States); or
(3) An alien who cannot provide evidence of alien status showing lawful admission to the U.S., or an alien with evidence of lawful admission but without authority to work in the U.S., if the evidence described in § 422.107(e) does not exist, but only for a valid nonwork reason. We consider you to have a valid nonwork reason if:
(i) You need a social security number to satisfy a Federal statute or regulation that requires you to have a social security number in order to receive a Federally-funded benefit to which you have otherwise established entitlement and you reside either in or outside the U.S.; or
(ii) You need a social security number to satisfy a State or local law that requires you to have a social security number in order to receive public assistance benefits to which you have otherwise established entitlement, and you are legally in the United States.
(b)
Annotation for a nonwork purpose.
If we assign you a social security number as an alien for a nonwork purpose, we will indicate in our records that you are not authorized to work. We will also mark your social security card with a legend such as “NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT.” If earnings are reported to us on your number, we will inform the Department of Homeland Security of the reported earnings.

§ 422.105
Presumption of authority of nonimmigrant alien to engage in employment.
(a)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if you are a nonimmigrant alien, we will presume that you have permission to engage in employment if you present a Form I-94 issued by the Department of Homeland Security that reflects a classification permitting work. (
See
8 CFR 274a.12 for Form I-94 classifications.) If you have not been issued a Form I-94, or if your
Form I-94 does not reflect a classification permitting work, you must submit a current document authorized by the Department of Homeland Security that verifies authorization to work has been granted e.g., an employment authorization document, to enable SSA to issue an SSN card that is valid for work. (
See
8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3).)
(b)
Exception to presumption for foreign academic students in immigration classification F-1.
If you are an F-1 student and do not have a separate DHS employment authorization document as described in paragraph (a) of this section
and
you are not authorized for curricular practical training (CPT) as shown on your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status, we will not presume you have authority to engage in employment without additional evidence. Before we will assign an SSN to you that is valid for work, you must give us proof (as explained in § 422.107(e)(2)) that:
(1) You have authorization from your school to engage in employment, and
(2) You are engaging in, or have secured, employment.

§ 422.106
Filing applications with other government agencies.
(a)
Agreements.
In carrying out its responsibilities to assign social security numbers, SSA enters into agreements with the United States Attorney General, other Federal officials, and State and local welfare agencies. An example of these agreements is discussed in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
States.
SSA and a State may enter into an agreement that authorizes employees of a State or one of its subdivisions to accept social security number card applications from some individuals who apply for or are receiving welfare benefits under a State-administered Federal program. Under such an agreement, a State employee is also authorized to certify the application to show that he or she has reviewed the required evidence of the applicant's age, identity, and U.S. citizenship. The employee is also authorized to obtain evidence to assist SSA in determining whether the applicant has previously been assigned a number. The employee will then send the application to SSA which will issue a social security number card.
[55 FR 46665, Nov. 6, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 56555, Oct. 22, 1998]
§ 422.107
Evidence requirements.
(a)
General.
To obtain an original Social Security number card, you must submit convincing evidence of your age, U.S. citizenship or alien status, and true identity, as described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. If you apply for a replacement Social Security number card, you must submit convincing evidence of your true identity, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, and you may also be required to submit convincing evidence of your age and U.S. citizenship or alien status, as described in paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section. If you apply for an original or replacement Social Security number card, you are also required to submit evidence to assist us in determining the existence and identity of any previously assigned Social Security number(s). We will not assign a Social Security number or issue an original or replacement card unless we determine that you meet all of the evidence requirements. We require an in-person interview if you are age 12 or older and are applying for an original Social Security number, unless you are an alien who requests a Social Security number as part of the immigration process described in § 422.103(b)(3). We may require an in-person interview of other applicants. All paper or other tangible documents submitted as evidence must be originals or copies of the original documents certified by the custodians of the original records and are subject to verification. We may also verify your eligibility factors, as described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, through other means, including but not limited to data matches or other agreements with government agencies or other entities that we determine can provide us with appropriate and secure verification of your eligibility factors.
(b)
Evidence of age.
An applicant for an original social security number is required to submit convincing evidence of age. An applicant for a replacement
social security number card may also be required to submit evidence of age. Examples of the types of evidence which may be submitted are a birth certificate, a religious record showing age or date of birth, a hospital record of birth, or a passport. (
See
§ 404.716.)
(c)
Evidence of identity.
(1) If you apply for an original Social Security number or a replacement Social Security number card, you are required to submit convincing evidence of your identity. Evidence of identity may consist of a driver's license, identification card, school record, medical record, marriage record, passport, Department of Homeland Security document, or other similar evidence serving to identify you. The evidence must contain sufficient information to identify you, including your name and:
(i) Your age, date of birth, or parents' names; or
(ii) Your photograph or physical description.
(2) A birth record is not sufficient evidence to establish identity for these purposes.
(d)
Evidence of U.S. citizenship.
Generally, an applicant for an original or replacement social security number card may prove that he or she is a U.S. citizen by birth by submitting a birth certificate or other evidence, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, that shows a U.S. place of birth. Where a foreign-born applicant claims U.S. citizenship, the applicant for a social security number or a replacement social security number card is required to present documentary evidence of U.S. citizenship. If required evidence is not available, a social security number card will not be issued until satisfactory evidence of U.S. citizenship is furnished. Any of the following is generally acceptable evidence of U.S. citizenship for a foreign-born applicant:
(1) Certificate of naturalization;
(2) Certificate of citizenship;
(3) U.S. passport;
(4) U.S. citizen identification card issued by the Department of Homeland Security;
(5) Consular report of birth (State Department form FS-240 or FS-545); or
(6) Other verification from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of State, or Federal or State court records confirming citizenship.
(e)
Evidence of alien status
—(1)
General evidence rules.
When a person who is not a U.S. citizen applies for an original social security number or a replacement social security number card, he or she is required to submit, as evidence of alien status, a current document issued by the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with that agency's regulations. The document must show that the applicant has been lawfully admitted to the United States, either for permanent residence or under authority of law permitting him or her to work in the United States, or that the applicant's alien status has changed so that it is lawful for him or her to work. If the applicant fails to submit such a document, a social security number card will not be issued. If the applicant submits an unexpired Department of Homeland Security document(s) which shows current authorization to work, a social security number will be assigned or verified and a card which can be used for work will be issued. If the authorization of the applicant to work is temporary or subject to termination by the Department of Homeland Security, the SSA records may be so annotated. If the document(s) does not provide authorization to work and the applicant wants a social security number for a work purpose, no social security number will be assigned. If the applicant requests the number for a nonwork purpose and provides evidence documenting that the number is needed for a valid nonwork purpose, the number may be assigned and the card issued will be annotated with a nonwork legend. The SSA record will be annotated to show that a number has been assigned and a card issued for a nonwork purpose. In that case, if earnings are later reported to SSA, the Department of Homeland Security will be notified of the report. SSA may also notify that agency if earnings are reported for a social security number that was valid for work when assigned but for which work authorization expired or was later terminated by the Department of Homeland Security SSA may also annotate the record with other remarks, if appropriate.
(2)
Additional evidence rules for F-1 students
—(i)
Evidence from your designated school official.
If you are an F-1 student and do not have a separate DHS employment authorization document as described in § 422.105(a)
and
you are not authorized for curricular practical training (CPT) as shown on your SEVIS Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status, you must give us documentation from your designated school official that you are authorized to engage in employment. You must submit your SEVIS Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status. You must also submit documentation from your designated school official that includes:
(A) The nature of the employment you are or will be engaged in, and
(B) The identification of the employer for whom you are or will be working.
(ii)
Evidence of your employment.
You must also provide us with documentation that you are engaging in, or have secured, employment; e.g., a statement from your employer.
(f)
Failure to submit evidence.
If the applicant does not comply with a request for the required evidence or other information within a reasonable time, SSA may attempt another contact with the applicant. If there is still no response, a social security number card will not be issued.
(g)
Inability to verify eligibility factors.
We will not issue an original or replacement Social Security number card when you present invalid or expired documents or when we are unable to verify the required evidence through other means, as described in paragraph (a) of this section. Invalid documents are either forged documents that supposedly were issued by the custodian of the record, or properly issued documents that were improperly changed after they were issued. An expired document is one that was valid for only a limited time and that time has passed.
[55 FR 46665, Nov. 6, 1990, as amended at 60 FR 32446, June 22, 1995; 62 FR 38456, July 18, 1997; 63 FR 56555, Oct. 22, 1998; 68 FR 55308, Sept. 25, 2003; 69 FR 55076, Sept. 13, 2004; 70 FR 74651, Dec. 16, 2005; 80 FR 47834, Aug. 10, 2015]
§ 422.108
Criminal penalties.
A person may be subject to criminal penalties for furnishing false information in connection with earnings records or for wrongful use or misrepresentation in connection with social security numbers, pursuant to section 208 of the Social Security Act and sections of title 18 U.S.C. (42 U.S.C. 408; 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 1546).
[39 FR 10242, Mar. 19, 1974]
§ 422.110
Individual's request for change in record.
(a)
Application.
If you wish to change the name or other personal identifying information you previously submitted in connection with an application for a Social Security number card, you must complete a prescribed application, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. You must prove your identity, and you may be required to provide other evidence. (See § 422.107 for evidence requirements.) You may complete a request for change in records in the manner we designate, including at any Social Security office, or, if you are outside the U.S., to the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office, Manila, Philippines, or to any U.S. Foreign Service post or U.S. military post. If your request is for a change of name on the card (that is, verified legal changes to the first name or surname, or both), we may issue you a replacement Social Security number card bearing the same number and the new name. We will grant an exception to the limitations specified in § 422.103(e)(2) for replacement Social Security number cards representing a change in name or, if you are an alien, a change to a restrictive legend shown on the card. (See § 422.103(e)(3) for the definition of a change to a restrictive legend.)
(b)
Assisting in enumeration.
We may enter into an agreement with officials of the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to assist us by collecting, as part of the immigration process, information to change the name or other personal identifying information you previously submitted in connection with an application or request for a social security number card. If your request is to
change a name on the card (
i.e.
, verified legal changes to the first name and/or surname) or to correct the restrictive legend on the card to reflect a change in alien status, we may issue you a replacement card bearing the same number and the new name or legend. We will grant an exception from the limitations specified in § 422.103(e)(2) for replacement social security number cards representing a change of name or, if you are an alien, a change to a restrictive legend shown on the card. (See § 422.103(e)(3) for the definition of a change to a restrictive legend.)
[71 FR 43056, July 31, 2006, as amended at 80 FR 47834, Aug. 10, 2015]
§ 422.112
Employer identification numbers.
(a)
General.
Most employers are required by section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code and by Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations at 26 CFR 31.6011(b)-1 to obtain an employer identification number (EIN) and to include it on wage reports filed with SSA. A sole proprietor who does not pay wages to one or more employees or who is not required to file any pension or excise tax return is not subject to this requirement. To apply for an EIN, employers file Form SS-4, “Application for Employer Identification Number,” with the IRS. For the convenience of employers, Form SS-4 is available at all SSA and IRS offices. Household employers, agricultural employers, and domestic corporations which elect social security coverage for employees of foreign subsidiaries who are citizens or residents of the U.S. may be assigned an EIN by IRS without filing an SS-4.
(b)
State and local governments.
When a State submits a modification to its agreement under section 218 of the Act, which extends coverage to periods prior to 1987, SSA will assign a special identification number to each political subdivision included in that modification. SSA will send the State a Form SSA-214-CD, “Notice of Identifying Number,” to inform the State of the special identification number(s). The special number will be used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. The special number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained and SSA will send a Form SSA-214-CD to the interstate instrumentality to notify it of the number assigned.
[60 FR 42433, Aug. 16, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 33016, June 21, 1999]
§ 422.114
Annual wage reporting process.
(a)
General.
Under the authority of section 232 of the Act, SSA and IRS have entered into an agreement that sets forth the manner by which SSA and IRS will ensure that the processing of employee wage reports is effective and efficient. Under this agreement, employers are instructed by IRS to file annual wage reports with SSA on paper Forms W-2, “Wage and Tax Statement,” and Forms W-3, “Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements,” or equivalent W-2 and W-3 magnetic media reports. Special versions of these forms for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are also filed with SSA. SSA processes all wage reporting forms for updating to SSA's earnings records and IRS tax records, identifies employer reporting errors and untimely filed forms for IRS penalty assessment action, and takes action to correct any reporting errors identified, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. SSA also processes Forms W-3c, “Transmittal of Corrected Income Tax Statements,” and W-2c, “Statement of Corrected Income and Tax Amounts” (and their magnetic media equivalents) that employers are required to file with SSA when certain previous reporting errors are discovered.
(b)
Magnetic media reporting requirements.
Under IRS regulations at 26 CFR 301.6011-2, employers who file 250 or more W-2 wage reports per year must file them on magnetic media in accordance with requirements provided in SSA publications, unless IRS grants the employer a waiver. Basic SSA requirements are set out in SSA's Technical Instruction Bulletin No. 4, “Magnetic Media Reporting.” Special filing requirements for U.S. territorial employers are set out in SSA Technical Instruction Bulletins No. 5 (Puerto Rico), No. 6 (Virgin Islands), and No. 7
(Guam and American Samoa). At the end of each year, SSA mails these technical instructions to employers (or third parties who file wage reports on their behalf) for their use in filing wage reports for that year.
(c)
Processing late and incorrect magnetic media wage transmittals.
If an employer's transmittal of magnetic media wage reports is received by SSA after the filing due date, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide whether to assess penalties for late filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. If reports do not meet SSA processing requirements (unprocessable reports) or are out of balance on critical money amounts, SSA will return them to the employer to correct and resubmit. In addition, beginning with wage reports filed for tax year 1993, if 90 percent or more of an employer's magnetic media wage reports have no social security numbers or incorrect employee names or social security numbers so that SSA is unable to credit their wages to its records, SSA will not attempt to correct the errors, but will instead return the reports to the employer to correct and resubmit (see also § 422.120(b)). An employer must correct and resubmit incorrect and unprocessable magnetic media wage reports to SSA within 45 days from the date of the letter sent with the returned report. Upon request, SSA may grant the employer a 15-day extension of the 45-day period. If an employer does not submit corrected reports to SSA within the 45-day (or, if extended by SSA, 60-day) period, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide whether to assess a penalty. If an employer timely resubmits the reports as corrected magnetic media reports, but they are unprocessable or out of balance on W-2 money totals, SSA will return the resubmitted reports for the second and last time for the employer to correct and return to SSA. SSA will enclose with the resubmitted and returned forms a letter informing the employer that he or she must correct and return the reports to SSA within 45 days or be subject to IRS penalties for late filing.
(d)
Paper form reporting requirements.
The format and wage reporting instructions for paper forms are determined jointly by IRS and SSA. Basic instructions on how to complete the forms and file them with SSA are provided in IRS forms materials available to the public. In addition, SSA provides standards for employers (or third parties who file wage reports for them) to follow in producing completed reporting forms from computer software; these standards appear in SSA publication, “Software Specifications and Edits for Annual Wage Reporting.” Requests for this publication should be sent to: Social Security Administration, Office of Financial Policy and Operations, Attention: AWR Software Standards Project, P.O. Box 17195, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(e)
Processing late and incorrect paper form reports.
If SSA receives paper form wage reports after the due date, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide whether to assess penalties for late filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. SSA will ask an employer to provide replacement forms for illegible, incomplete, or clearly erroneous paper reporting forms, or will ask the employer to provide information necessary to process the reports without having to resubmit corrected forms. (For wage reports where earnings are reported without a social security number or with an incorrect name or social security number, see § 422.120.) If an employer fails to provide legible, complete, and correct W-2 reports within 45 days, SSA may identify the employers to IRS for assessment of employer reporting penalties.
(f)
Reconciliation of wage reporting errors.
After SSA processes wage reports, it matches them with the information provided by employers to the IRS on Forms 941, “Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return,” for that tax year. Based upon this match, if the total social security or medicare wages reported to SSA for employees is less than the totals reported to IRS, SSA will write to the employer and request corrected reports or an explanation for the discrepancy. If the total social security or medicare wages reported to SSA for employees is more than the totals reported to IRS, IRS will resolve the difference with the employer. If the
employer fails to provide SSA with corrected reports or information that shows the wage reports filed with SSA are correct, SSA will ask IRS to investigate the employer's wage and tax reports to resolve the discrepancy and to assess any appropriate reporting penalties.
[60 FR 42433, Aug. 16, 1995]
§ 422.120
Earnings reported without a social security number or with an incorrect employee name or social security number.
(a)
Correcting an earnings report.
If an employer reports an employee's wages to SSA without the employee's social security number or with a different employee name or social security number than shown in SSA's records for him or her, SSA will write to the employee at the address shown on the wage report and request the missing or corrected information. If the wage report does not show the employee's address or shows an incomplete address, SSA will write to the employer and request the missing or corrected employee information. SSA notifies IRS of all wage reports filed without employee social security numbers so that IRS can decide whether to assess penalties for erroneous filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. If an individual reports self-employment income to IRS without a social security number or with a different name or social security number than shown in SSA's records, SSA will write to the individual and request the missing or corrected information. If the employer, employee, or self-employed individual does not provide the missing or corrected report information in response to SSA's request, the wages or self-employment income cannot be identified and credited to the proper individual's earnings records. In such cases, the information is maintained in a “Suspense File” of uncredited earnings. Subsequently, if identifying information is provided to SSA for an individual whose report is recorded in the Suspense File, the wages or self-employment income then may be credited to his or her earnings record.
(b)
Returning incorrect reports.
SSA may return to the filer, unprocessed, an employer's annual wage report submittal if 90 percent or more of the wage reports in that submittal are unidentified or incorrectly identified. In such instances, SSA will advise the filer to return corrected wage reports within 45 days to avoid any possible IRS penalty assessment for failing to file correct reports timely with SSA. (See also § 422.114(c).) Upon request, SSA may grant the employer a 15-day extension of the 45-day period.
[60 FR 42434, Aug. 16, 1995]
§ 422.122
Information on deferred vested pension benefits.
(a)
Claimants for benefits.
Each month, SSA checks the name and social security number of each new claimant for social security benefits or for hospital insurance coverage to see whether the claimant is listed in SSA's electronic pension benefit record. This record contains information received from IRS on individuals for whom private pension plan administrators have reported to IRS, as required by section 6057 of the Internal Revenue Code, as possibly having a right to future retirement benefits under the plan. SSA sends a notice to each new claimant for whom it has pension benefit information, as required by section 1131 of the Act. If the claimant filed for the lump-sum death payment on the social security account of a relative, SSA sends the claimant the pension information on the deceased individual. In either case, SSA sends the notice after it has made a decision on the claim for benefits. The notice shows the type, payment frequency, and amount of pension benefit, as well as the name and address of the plan administrator as reported to the IRS. This information can then be used by the claimant to claim any pension benefits still due from the pension plan.
(b)
Requesting deferred vested pension benefit information from SSA files.
Section 1131 of the Act also requires SSA to provide available pension benefit information on request. SSA will provide this pension benefit information only to the individual who has the pension coverage (or a legal guardian or parent, in the case of a minor, on the individual's behalf). However, if the individual is deceased, the information may be
provided to someone who would be eligible for any underpayment of benefits that might be due the individual under section 204(d) of the Act. All requests for such information must be in writing and should contain the following information: the individual's name, social security number, date of birth, and any information the requestor may have concerning the name of the pension plan involved and the month and year coverage under the plan ended; the name and address of the person to whom the information is to be sent; and the requester's signature under the following statement: “I am the individual to whom the information applies (or “I am related to the individual as his or her ______”). I know that if I make any representation which I know is false to obtain information from Social Security records, I could be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both.” Such requests should be sent to: Social Security Administration, Office of Central Records Operations, P.O. Box 17055, Baltimore, Maryland 21235.
[60 FR 42434, Aug. 16, 1995]
§ 422.125
Statements of earnings; resolving earnings discrepancies.
(a)
Obtaining a statement of earnings and estimated benefits.
An individual may obtain a statement of the earnings on his earnings record and an estimate of social security benefits potentially payable on his record either by writing, calling, or visiting any social security office, or by waiting until we send him one under the procedure described in § 404.812 of this chapter. An individual may request this statement by completing the proper form or by otherwise providing the information the Social Security Administration requires, as explained in § 404.810(b) of this chapter.
(b)
Statement of earnings and estimated benefits.
Upon receipt of such a request or as required by section 1143(c) of the Social Security Act, the Social Security Administration will provide the individual, without charge, a statement of earnings and benefit estimates or an earnings statement. See §§ 404.811 through 404.812 of this chapter concerning the information contained in these statements.
(c)
Detailed earnings statements.
A more detailed earnings statement will be furnished upon request, generally without charge, where the request is program related under § 402.170 of this part. If the request for a more detailed statement is not program related under § 402.170 of this part, a charge will be imposed according to the guidelines set out in § 402.175 of this part.
(d)
Request for revision of earnings records.
If an individual disagrees with a statement of earnings credited to his social security account, he may request a revision by writing to the Bureau of Data Processing and Accounts, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, MD 21235, or by calling at or writing to any social security district office or branch office or, if the individual is in the Philippines, by calling at or writing to the Veterans' Administration Regional Office, Manila, Philippines. Upon receipt of a request for revision, the Social Security Administration will initiate an investigation of the individual's record of earnings. Form OAR-7008, “Statement of Employment for Wages and Self-Employment,” is used by the Social Security Administration for obtaining information from the individual requesting a revision to aid the Administration in the investigation. These forms are available at any of the sources listed in this paragraph. If an individual receives a Form OAR-7008 from the Bureau of Data Processing and Accounts, the completed form should be returned to that office. In the course of the investigation the district office or branch office, where appropriate, contacts the employer and the employee or the self-employed individual, whichever is applicable, for the purpose of obtaining the information and evidence necessary to reconcile any discrepancy between the allegations of the individual and the records of the Administration. See subpart I of part 404 of this chapter for requirements for filing requests for revision, and for limitation on the revision of records of earnings.
(e)
Notice to individual of determination.
After the investigation has been completed and a determination affecting the individual's earnings record has been made, the Social Security Administration will notify the individual in writing of the status of his earnings record and inform him at the same
time of the determination made in his case and of his right to a reconsideration if he is dissatisfied with such determination (see § 422.140).
(f)
Notice to individual of adverse adjustment of his account.
Written notice is given to an individual or his survivor in any case where the Social Security Administration adversely adjusts the individual's self-employment income. Where, subsequent to the issuance of a statement of earnings to an individual, an adverse adjustment is made of an amount of wages included in the statement, written notice of the adverse adjustment is given to the individual or his survivor. Written notice of the adverse adjustment is also given to the survivor if the statement of earnings had been given to such survivor. The individual or his survivor is requested to notify the Social Security Administration promptly if he disagrees, and he is informed that the adjustment will become final unless he notifies the Administration of his disagreement (if any) within 6 months from the date of the letter, or within 3 years, 3 months, and 15 days after the year to which the adjustment relates, whichever is later.

§ 422.130
Claim procedure.
(a)
General.
The Social Security Administration provides facilities for the public to file claims and to obtain assistance in completing them. An appropriate application form and related forms for use in filing a claim for monthly benefits, the establishment of a period of disability, a lump-sum death payment, or entitlement to hospital insurance benefits or supplementary medical insurance benefits can be obtained from any district office, branch office, contact station, or resident station of the Social Security Administration, from the Division of Foreign Claims, Post Office Box 1756, Baltimore, MD 21203, or from the Veteran's Administration Regional Office, Manila, Philippines. See § 404.614 of this chapter for offices at which applications may be filed. See 42 CFR part 405, subpart A, for conditions of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits and 42 CFR part 405, subpart B, for information relating to enrollment under the supplementary medical insurance benefits program.
(b)
Submission of evidence.
An individual who files an application for monthly benefits, the establishment of a period of disability, a lump-sum death payment, or entitlement to hospital insurance benefits or supplementary medical insurance benefits, either on his own behalf or on behalf of another, must establish by satisfactory evidence the material allegations in his application, except as to earnings shown in the Social Security Administration's records (
see
subpart H of part 404 of this chapter for evidence requirements in nondisability cases and subpart P of part 404 of this chapter for evidence requirements in disability cases). Instructions, report forms, and forms for the various proofs necessary are available to the public in district offices, branch offices, contact stations, and resident stations of the Social Security Administration, and the Veteran's Administration Regional Office, Manila, Philippines. These offices assist individuals in preparing their applications and in obtaining the proofs required in support of their applications.
(c)
Determinations and notice to individuals.
In the case of an application for benefits, the establishment of a period of disability, a lump-sum death payment, a recomputation of a primary insurance amount, or entitlement to hospital insurance benefits or supplementary medical insurance benefits, after obtaining the necessary evidence, we will determine, based on the preponderance of the evidence (see §§ 404.901 and 416.1401 of this chapter) as to the entitlement of the individual claiming or for whom is claimed such benefits, and will notify the applicant of the determination and of his right to appeal. Section 404.1503 of this chapter has a discussion of the respective roles of State agencies and the Administration in the making of disability determinations and information regarding initial determinations as to entitlement or termination of entitlement in disability claims. See section 1869(a) of
the Social Security Act for determinations under the health insurance for the aged program and sections 1816 and 1842 of the Act for the role of intermediaries, carriers, and State agencies in performing certain functions under such program, e.g., payment of claims pursuant to an agreement with the Social Security Administration.
