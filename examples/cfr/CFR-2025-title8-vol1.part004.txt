(i) To witnesses or potential witnesses in conjunction with a complaint or preliminary inquiry;
(ii) To other governmental agencies responsible for the enforcement of civil or criminal laws;
(iii) To agencies and other jurisdictions responsible for disciplinary or regulatory investigations and proceedings;
(iv) To the complainant or a lawful designee;
(v) To the practitioner or recognized organization who is the subject of the complaint or preliminary inquiry or the practitioner's or recognized organization's counsel of record.
(3)
Disclosure of information for the purpose of recognition of organizations and accreditation of representatives.
The EOIR disciplinary counsel, in the exercise of discretion, may disclose information concerning complaints or preliminary inquiries regarding applicants for recognition and accreditation, recognized organizations or their authorized officers, or accredited representatives to the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) for any purpose related to the recognition of organizations and accreditation of representatives.
(b)
Resolutions reached prior to the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Discipline.
Resolutions reached prior to the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Discipline, such as warning letters, admonitions, and agreements in lieu of discipline are confidential, except that resolutions that pertain to an accredited representative may be disclosed to the accredited representative's organization and the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate). However, all such resolutions may become part of the public record if the practitioner becomes subject to a subsequent Notice of Intent to Discipline.
(c)
Notices of Intent to Discipline and action subsequent thereto.
Notices of Intent to Discipline and any action that takes place subsequent to their issuance, except for the imposition of private censures, may be disclosed to the public, except that private censures

§ 1003.109
Discipline of government attorneys.
Complaints regarding the conduct or behavior of Department attorneys, Immigration Judges, or Board Members shall be directed to the Office of Professional Responsibility, United States Department of Justice. If disciplinary action is warranted, it shall be administered pursuant to the Department's attorney discipline procedures.
§ 1003.110
Sanction of recognized organizations.
(a)
Authority to sanction.
(1) An adjudicating official or the Board may impose disciplinary sanctions against a recognized organization if it is in the public interest to do so. It will be in the public interest to impose disciplinary sanctions if a recognized organization has engaged in the conduct described in paragraph (b) of this section. In accordance with the disciplinary proceedings set forth in this subpart, an adjudicating official or the Board may impose the following sanctions:
(i) Revocation, which removes the organization and its accredited representatives from the recognition and accreditation roster and permanently bars the organization from future recognition;
(ii) Termination, which removes the organization and its accredited representatives from the recognition and accreditation roster but does not bar the organization from future recognition. In terminating recognition under this section, the adjudicating official or the Board may preclude the organization from submitting a new request for recognition under 8 CFR 1292.13 before a specified date; or
(iii) Such other disciplinary sanctions, except a suspension, as the adjudicating official or the Board deems appropriate.
(2) The administrative termination of an organization's recognition under 8 CFR 1292.17 after the issuance of Notice of Intent to Discipline pursuant to § 1003.105(a)(1) shall not preclude the continuation of disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of sanctions, unless counsel for the government moves to dismiss the Notice of Intent to Discipline and the adjudicating official or the Board grants the motion.
(3) The imposition of disciplinary sanctions against a recognized organization does not result in disciplinary sanctions against that organization's accredited representatives; disciplinary sanctions, if any, against an organization's accredited representatives must be imposed separately from disciplinary sanctions against the organization. Termination or revocation of an organization's recognition has the effect of terminating the accreditation of representatives of that organization, but such individuals may retain or seek accreditation through another recognized organization.
(b)
Grounds.
It shall be deemed to be in the public interest for an adjudicating official or the Board to impose disciplinary sanctions against any recognized organization that violates one or more of the grounds specified in this paragraph, except that these grounds do not constitute the exclusive grounds for which disciplinary sanctions may be imposed in the public interest. A recognized organization may be subject to disciplinary sanctions if it:
(1) Knowingly or with reckless disregard provides a false statement or misleading information in applying for recognition or accreditation of its representatives;
(2) Knowingly or with reckless disregard provides false or misleading information to clients or prospective clients regarding the scope of authority of, or the services provided by, the organization or its accredited representatives;
(3) Fails to adequately supervise accredited representatives;
(4) Employs, receives services from, or affiliates with an individual who performs an activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law or immigration fraud; or
(5) Engages in the practice of law through staff when it does not have an attorney or accredited representative.
(c)
Joint disciplinary proceedings.
The EOIR disciplinary counsel or DHS disciplinary counsel may file a Notice of Intent to Discipline against a recognized organization and one or more of its accredited representatives pursuant to § 1003.101
et seq.
Disciplinary proceedings conducted on such notices, if they are filed jointly with the Board, shall be joined and referred to the same adjudicating official pursuant to § 1003.106. An adjudicating official may join related disciplinary proceedings after the filing of a Notice of Intent to Discipline.
[81 FR 92365, Dec. 19, 2016]
§ 1003.111
Interim suspension.
(a)
Petition for interim suspension
—(1)
EOIR Petition.
In conjunction with the filing of a Notice of Intent to Discipline or at any time thereafter during disciplinary proceedings before an adjudicating official, the EOIR disciplinary counsel may file a petition for an interim suspension of an accredited representative. Such suspension, if issued, precludes the representative from practicing before the Board and the Immigration Courts during the pendency of disciplinary proceedings and continues until the issuance of a final order in the disciplinary proceedings.
(2)
DHS Petition.
In conjunction with the filing of a Notice of Intent to Discipline or at any time thereafter during disciplinary proceedings before an adjudicating official, the DHS disciplinary counsel may file a petition for an interim suspension of an accredited representative. Such suspension, if issued, precludes the representative from practicing before DHS during the pendency of disciplinary proceedings and continues until the issuance of a final order in the disciplinary proceedings.
(3)
Contents of the petition.
In the petition, counsel for the government must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the accredited representative poses a substantial threat of irreparable harm to clients or prospective clients. An accredited representative poses a substantial threat of irreparable harm to clients or prospective clients if the representative committed three or more acts in violation of the grounds of discipline described at § 1003.102, when actual harm or threatened harm is demonstrated, or engages in any other conduct that, if continued, will likely cause irreparable harm to clients or prospective clients. Counsel for the government must serve the petition on the accredited representative, as provided in § 1003.105, and send a copy of the petition to the authorized officer of the recognized organization at the address of the organization through which the representative is accredited.
(4)
Requests to broaden scope.
The EOIR disciplinary counsel or DHS disciplinary counsel may submit a request to broaden the scope of any interim suspension order such that an accredited representative would be precluded from practice before the Board, the Immigration Courts, and DHS.
(b)
Response.
The accredited representative may file a written response to the petition for interim suspension within 30 days of service of the petition.
(c)
Adjudication.
Upon the expiration of the time to respond to the petition for an interim suspension, the adjudicating official will consider the petition for an interim suspension, the accredited representative's response, if any, and any other evidence presented by the parties before determining whether to issue an interim suspension. If the adjudicating official imposes an interim suspension on the representative, the adjudicating official may require that notice of the interim suspension be posted at the Board and the Immigration Courts, or DHS, or all three authorities. Upon good cause shown, the adjudicating official may set aside an order of interim suspension when it appears in the interest of justice to do so. If a final order in the disciplinary proceedings includes the imposition of a period of suspension against an accredited representative, time spent by the representative under
an interim suspension pursuant to this section may be credited toward the period of suspension imposed under the final order.

[32 FR 9622, July 4, 1967]
§ 1101.3
Creation of record of lawful permanent resident status for person born under diplomatic status in the United States.
(a)
Person born to foreign diplomat
—(1)
Status of person.
A person born in the United States to a foreign diplomatic officer accredited to the United States, as a matter of international law, is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. That person is not a
United States citizen under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Such a person may be considered a lawful permanent resident at birth.
(2)
Definition of foreign diplomatic officer. Foreign diplomatic officer
means a person listed in the State Department Diplomatic List, also known as the Blue List. It includes ambassadors, ministers, chargés d'affaires, counselors, secretaries and attachés of embassies and legations as well as members of the Delegation of the Commission of the European Communities. The term also includes individuals with comparable diplomatic status and immunities who are accredited to the United Nations or to the Organization of American States, and other individuals who are also accorded comparable diplomatic status.
(b)
Child born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
A child born in the United States is born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and is a United States citizen if the parent is not a “foreign diplomatic officer” as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. This includes, for example, a child born in the United States to one of the following foreign government officials or employees:
(1) Employees of foreign diplomatic missions whose names appear in the State Department list entitled “Employees of Diplomatic Missions Not Printed in the Diplomatic List,” also known as the White List; employees of foreign diplomatic missions accredited to the United Nations or the Organization of American States; or foreign diplomats accredited to other foreign states. The majority of these individuals enjoy certain diplomatic immunities, but they are not “foreign diplomatic officers” as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The immunities, if any, of their family members are derived from the status of the employees or diplomats.
(2) Foreign government employees with limited or no diplomatic immunity such as consular officials named on the State Department list entitled “Foreign Consular Officers in the United States” and their staffs.
(c)
Voluntary registration as lawful permanent resident of person born to foreign diplomat.
Since a person born in the United States to a foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, his/her registration as a lawful permanent resident of the United States is voluntary. The provisions of section 262 of the Act do not apply to such a person unless and until that person ceases to have the rights, privileges, exemptions, or immunities which may be claimed by a foreign diplomatic officer.
(d)
Retention of lawful permanent residence.
To be eligible for lawful permanent resident status under paragraph (a) of this section, an alien must establish that he/she has not abandoned his/her residence in the United States. One of the tests for retention of lawful permanent resident status is continuous residence, not continuous physical presence, in the United States. Such a person will not be considered to have abandoned his/her residence in the United States solely by having been admitted to the United States in a nonimmigrant classification under paragraph (15)(A) or (15)(G) of section 101(a) of the Act after a temporary stay in a foreign country or countries on one or several occasions.
(Secs. 101(a)(20), 103, 262, 264 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended; 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20), 1103, 1302, 1304)
[47 FR 940, Jan. 8, 1982]
§ 1101.4
Registration procedure.
The procedure for an application for creation of a record of lawful permanent residence and a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-551, for a person eligible for presumption of lawful admission for permanent residence under § 1101.1 or § 1101.2 or for lawful permanent residence as a person born in the United States to a foreign diplomatic officer under § 1101.3 is described in § 264.2 of 8 CFR chapter 1.
(Secs. 101(a)(20), 103, 262, 264 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended; 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20), 1103, 1302, 1304)
[47 FR 941, Jan. 8, 1982, as amended at 63 FR 70315, Dec. 21, 1998; 68 FR 10351, Mar. 5, 2003]
§ 1101.5
Special immigrant status for certain G-4 nonimmigrants.
(a)
Application.
An application for adjustment to special immigrant status under section 101(a)(27)(I) of the INA
shall be made on Form I-485. The application date of the I-485 shall be the date of acceptance by the Service as properly filed. If the application date is other than the fee receipt date it must be noted and initialed by a Service officer. The date of application for adjustment of status is the closing date for computing the residence and physical presence requirement. The applicant must have complied with all requirements as of the date of application.
(b)
Documentation.
All documents must be submitted in accordance with § 103.2(b) of this chapter. The application shall be accompanied by documentary evidence establishing the aggregate residence and physical presence required. Documentary evidence may include official employment verification, records of official or personnel transactions or recordings of events occurring during the period of claimed residence and physical presence. Affidavits of credible witnesses may also be accepted. Persons unable to furnish evidence in their own names may furnish evidence in the names of parents or other persons with whom they have been living, if affidavits of the parents or other persons are submitted attesting to the claimed residence and physical presence. The claimed family relationship to the principle G-4 international organization officer or employee must be substantiated by the submission of verifiable civil documents.
(c)
Residence and physical presence requirements.
All applicants applying under sections 101(a)(27)(I) (i), (ii), and (iii) of the INA must have resided and been physically present in the United States for a designated period of time.
For purposes of this section only, an absence from the United States to conduct official business on behalf of the employing organization, or approved customary leave shall not be subtracted from the aggregated period of required residence or physical presence for the current or former G-4 officer or employee or the accompanying spouse and unmarried sons or daughters of such officer or employee, provided residence in the United States is maintained during such absences, and the duty station of the principle G-4 nonimmigrant continues to be in the United States. Absence from the United States by the G-4 spouse or unmarried son or daughter without the principle ­G-4 shall not be subtracted from the aggregate period of residence and physical presence if on customary leave as recognized by the international organization employer. Absence by the unmarried son or daughter while enrolled in a school outside the United States will not be counted toward the physical presence requirement.
(d)
Maintenance of nonimmigrant status.
Section 101(a)(27)(I) (i), and (ii) requires the applicant to accrue the required period of residence and physical presence in the United States while maintaining status as a G-4 or N nonimmigrant. Section 101(a)(27)(I)(iii) requires such time accrued only in G-4 nonimmigrant status.
Maintaining G-4 status for this purpose is defined as maintaining qualified employment with a “G” international organization or maintaining the qualifying family relationship with the G-4 international organization officer or employee. Maintaining status as an N nonimmigrant for this purpose requires the qualifying family relationship to remain in effect. Unauthorized employment will not remove an otherwise eligible alien from G-4 status for residence and physical presence requirements, provided the qualifying G-4 status is maintained.

§ 1205.1
Automatic revocation.
(a)
Reasons for automatic revocation.
The approval of a petition or self-petition made under section 204 of the Act and in accordance with part 204 of 8 CFR chapter I is revoked as of the date of approval:
(1) If the Secretary of State shall terminate the registration of the beneficiary pursuant to the provisions of section 203(e) of the Act before October 1, 1991, or section 203(g) of the Act on or after October 1, 1994;
(2) If the filing fee and associated service charge are not paid within 14 days of the notification to the remitter that his or her check or other financial instrument used to pay the filing fee has been returned as not payable; or
(3) If any of the following circumstances occur before the beneficiary's or self-petitioner's journey to the United States commences or, if the beneficiary or self-petitioner is an applicant for adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident, before the decision on his or her adjustment application becomes final:
(i)
Immediate relative and family-sponsored petitions, other than Amerasian petitions.
(A) Upon written notice of withdrawal filed by the petitioner or self-petitioner with any officer of the Service who is authorized to grant or deny petitions.
(B) Upon the death of the beneficiary or the self-petitioner.
(C) Upon the death of the petitioner, except as provided for in 8 CFR 205.1(a)(3)(i)(C).
(D) Upon the legal termination of the marriage when a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States has petitioned to accord his or her spouse immediate relative or family-sponsored preference immigrant classification under section 201(b) or section 203(a)(2) of the Act. The approval of a spousal self-petition based on the relationship to an abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States filed under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) or 204(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, however, will not be revoked solely because of the termination of the marriage to the abuser.
(E) Upon the remarriage of the spouse of an abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States when the spouse has self-petitioned under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) or 204(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act for immediate relative classification under section 201(b) of the Act or for preference classification under section 203(a)(2) of the Act.
(F) Upon a child reaching the age of 21, when he or she has been accorded immediate relative status under section 201(b) of the Act. A petition filed on behalf of a child under section 204(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Act or a self-petition filed by a child of an abusive United States citizen under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the Act, however, will remain valid for the duration of the relationship to accord preference status under section 203(a)(1) of the Act if the
beneficiary remains unmarried, or to accord preference status under section 203(a)(3) of the Act if he or she marries.
(G) Upon the marriage of a child, when he or she has been accorded immediate relative status under section 201(b) of the Act. A petition filed on behalf of the child under section 204(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Act or a self-petition filed by a child of an abusive United States citizen under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the Act, however, will remain valid for the duration of the relationship to accord preference status under section 203(a)(3) of the Act if he or she marries.
(H) Upon the marriage of a person accorded preference status as a son or daughter of a United States citizen under section 203(a)(1) of the Act. A petition filed on behalf of the son or daughter, however, will remain valid for the duration of the relationship to accord preference status under section 203(a)(3) of the Act.
(I) Upon the marriage of a person accorded status as a son or daughter of a lawful permanent resident alien under section 203(a)(2) of the Act.
(J) Upon legal termination of the petitioner's status as an alien admitted for lawful permanent residence in the United States unless the petitioner became a United States citizen. The provisions of 8 CFR 204.2(i)(3) shall apply if the petitioner became a United States citizen.
(ii)
Petition for Pub. L. 97-359 Amerasian.
(A) Upon formal notice of withdrawal filed by the petitioner with the officer who approved the petition.
(B) Upon the death of the beneficiary.
(C) Upon the death or bankruptcy of the sponsor who executed Form I-361, Affidavit of Financial Support and Intent to Petition for Legal Custody for Pub. L. 97-359 Amerasian. In that event, a new petition may be filed in the beneficiary's behalf with the documentary evidence relating to sponsorship and, in the case of a beneficiary under 18 years of age, placement. If the new petition is approved, it will be given the priority date of the previously approved petition.
(D) Upon the death or substitution of the petitioner if other than the beneficiary or sponsor. However, if the petitioner dies or no longer desires or is able to proceed with the petition, and another person 18 years of age or older, an emancipated minor, or a corporation incorporated in the United States desires to be substituted for the deceased or original petitioner, a written request may be submitted to the Service or American consular office where the petition is located to reinstate the petition and restore the original priority date.
(E) Upon the beneficiary's reaching the age of 21 when the beneficiary has been accorded classification under section 201(b) of the Act. Provided that all requirements of section 204(f) of the Act continue to be met, however, the petition is to be considered valid for purposes of according the beneficiary preference classification under section 203(a)(1) of the Act if the beneficiary remains unmarried or under section 203(a)(3) if the beneficiary marries.
(F) Upon the beneficiary's marriage when the beneficiary has been accorded classification under section 201(b) or section 203(a)(1) of the Act. Provided that all requirements of section 204(f) of the Act continue to be met, however, the petition is to be considered valid for purposes of according the beneficiary preference classification under section 203(a)(3) of the Act.
(iii)
Petitions under section 203(b), other than special immigrant juvenile petitions.
(A) Upon invalidation pursuant to 20 CFR Part 656 of the labor certification in support of the petition.

(iv)
Special immigrant juvenile petitions.
Unless the beneficiary met all of the eligibility requirements as of November 29, 1990, and the petition requirements as of November 29, 1990, and the petition for classification as a special immigrant juvenile was filed before June 1, 1994, or unless the change in circumstances resulted from the
beneficiary's adoption or placement in a guardianship situation:
(A) Upon the beneficiary reaching the age of 21;
(B) Upon the marriage of the beneficiary;
(C) Upon the termination of the beneficiary's dependency upon the juvenile court;
(D) Upon the termination of the beneficiary's eligibility for long-term foster care; or
(E) Upon the determination in administrative or judicial proceedings that it is in the beneficiary's best interest to be returned to the country of nationality or last habitual residence of the beneficiary or of his or her parent or parents.
(b)
Notice.
When it shall appear to the director that the approval of a petition has been automatically revoked, he or she shall cause a notice of such revocation to be sent promptly to the consular office having jurisdiction over the visa application and a copy of such notice to be mailed to the petitioner's last known address.

(c)
Notification of revocation.

# Subpart A—Asylum and Withholding of Removal
§ 1208.1
General.
(a)
Applicability
—(1)
In general.
Unless otherwise provided in this chapter V, this subpart A shall apply to all applications for asylum under section 208 of the Act or for withholding of deportation or withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, or under the Convention Against Torture, whether before an asylum officer or an immigration judge, regardless of the date of filing. For purposes of this chapter V, withholding of removal shall also mean withholding of deportation under section 243(h) of the Act, as it appeared prior to April 1, 1997, except as provided in § 1208.16(d). Such applications are hereinafter referred to as “asylum applications.” The provisions of this part shall not affect the finality or validity of any decision made by a district director, an immigration judge, or the Board of Immigration Appeals in any such case prior to April 1, 1997. No asylum application that was filed with a district director, asylum officer, or immigration judge prior to
April 1, 1997, may be reopened or otherwise reconsidered under the provisions of this part except by motion granted in the exercise of discretion by the Board of Immigration Appeals, an immigration judge, or an asylum officer for proper cause shown. Motions to reopen or reconsider must meet the requirements of sections 240(c)(6) and (c)(7) of the Act, and 8 CFR parts 1003 and 1103, where applicable.
(2)
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
The provisions of this subpart A shall not apply prior to January 1, 2030, to an alien physically present in or arriving in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands seeking to apply for asylum. No application for asylum may be filed prior to January 1, 2030, pursuant to section 208 of the Act by an alien physically present in or arriving in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Effective on the transition program effective date, the provisions of this subpart A shall apply to aliens physically present in or arriving in the CNMI with respect to withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act and withholding and deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture.
(b)
Training of asylum officers.
The Director of International Affairs shall ensure that asylum officers receive special training in international human rights law, nonadversarial interview techniques, and other relevant national and international refugee laws and principles. The Director of International Affairs shall also, in cooperation with the Department of State and other appropriate sources, compile and disseminate to asylum officers information concerning the persecution of persons in other countries on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, torture of persons in other countries, and other information relevant to asylum determinations, and shall maintain a documentation center with information on human rights conditions.
(c)
Particular social group.
For purposes of adjudicating an application for asylum under section 208 of the Act or an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, a particular social group is one that is based on an immutable or fundamental characteristic, is defined with particularity, and is recognized as socially distinct in the society at question. Such a particular social group cannot be defined exclusively by the alleged persecutory acts or harm and must also have existed independently of the alleged persecutory acts or harm that forms the basis of the claim. The Attorney General, in general, will not favorably adjudicate claims of aliens who claim a fear of persecution on account of membership in a particular social group consisting of or defined by the following circumstances: past or present criminal activity or association (including gang membership); presence in a country with generalized violence or a high crime rate; being the subject of a recruitment effort by criminal, terrorist, or persecutory groups; the targeting of the applicant for criminal activity for financial gain based on perceptions of wealth or affluence; interpersonal disputes of which governmental authorities were unaware or uninvolved; private criminal acts of which governmental authorities were unaware or uninvolved; past or present terrorist activity or association; past or present persecutory activity or association; or, status as an alien returning from the United States. This list is nonexhaustive, and the substance of the alleged particular social group, rather than the precise form of its delineation, shall be considered in determining whether the group falls within one of the categories on the list. No alien shall be found to be a refugee or have it decided that the alien's life or freedom would be threatened based on membership in a particular social group in any case unless that person first articulates on the record, or provides a basis on the record for determining, the definition and boundaries of the alleged particular social group. A failure to define, or provide a basis for defining, a formulation of a particular social group before an immigration judge shall waive any such claim for all purposes under the Act, including on appeal. Any waived claim on this basis shall not serve as the basis for any motion to reopen or reconsider for any reason, including a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel unless
the alien complies with the procedural requirements for such a motion and demonstrates that counsel's failure to define, or provide a basis for defining, a formulation of a particular social group was both not a strategic choice and constituted egregious conduct.
(d)
Political opinion.
For purposes of adjudicating an application for asylum under section 208 of the Act or an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, a political opinion is one expressed by or imputed to an applicant in which the applicant possesses an ideal or conviction in support of the furtherance of a discrete cause related to political control of a State or a unit thereof. The Attorney General, in general, will not favorably adjudicate claims of aliens who claim a fear of persecution on account of a political opinion defined solely by generalized disapproval of, disagreement with, or opposition to criminal, terrorist, gang, guerilla, or other non-state organizations absent expressive behavior in furtherance of a cause against such organizations related to efforts by the State to control such organizations or behavior that is antithetical to or otherwise opposes the ruling legal entity of the State or a legal sub-unit of the State. A person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well-founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
(e)
Persecution.
For purposes of adjudicating an application for asylum under section 208 of the Act or an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, persecution requires an intent to target a belief or characteristic, a severe level of harm, and the infliction of a severe level of harm by the government of a country or by persons or an organization that the government was unable or unwilling to control. For purposes of evaluating the severity of the level of harm, persecution is an extreme concept involving a severe level of harm that includes actions so severe that they constitute an exigent threat. Persecution does not encompass the generalized harm that arises out of civil, criminal, or military strife in a country, nor does it encompass all treatment that the United States regards as unfair, offensive, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional. It does not include intermittent harassment, including brief detentions; threats with no actual effort to carry out the threats, except that particularized threats of a severe harm of immediate and menacing nature made by an identified entity may constitute persecution; or, non-severe economic harm or property damage, though this list is nonexhaustive. The existence of government laws or policies that are unenforced or infrequently enforced do not, by themselves, constitute persecution, unless there is credible evidence that those laws or policies have been or would be applied to an applicant personally.
(f)
Nexus.
For purposes of adjudicating an application for asylum under section 208 of the Act or an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, the Attorney General, in general, will not favorably adjudicate the claims of aliens who claim persecution based on the following list of nonexhaustive circumstances:
(1) Interpersonal animus or retribution;
(2) Interpersonal animus in which the alleged persecutor has not targeted, or manifested an animus against, other members of an alleged particular social group in addition to the member who has raised the claim at issue;
(3) Generalized disapproval of, disagreement with, or opposition to criminal, terrorist, gang, guerilla, or other non-state organizations absent expressive behavior in furtherance of a discrete cause against such organizations related to control of a State or expressive behavior that is antithetical to the State or a legal unit of the State;
(4) Resistance to recruitment or coercion by guerilla, criminal, gang, terrorist or other non-state organizations;
(5) The targeting of the applicant for criminal activity for financial gain based on wealth or affluence or perceptions of wealth or affluence;
(6) Criminal activity;
(7) Perceived, past or present, gang affiliation; or,
(8) Gender.
(g)
Evidence based on stereotypes.
For purposes of adjudicating an application for asylum under section 208 of the Act or an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, evidence offered in support of such an application which promotes cultural stereotypes about a country, its inhabitants, or an alleged persecutor, including stereotypes based on race, religion, nationality, or gender, shall not be admissible in adjudicating that application, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting the submission of evidence that an alleged persecutor holds stereotypical views of the applicant.

Interviews to further consider applications for asylum under this paragraph (a)(1)(ii) are governed by the procedures provided for under 8 CFR 208.9. Further consideration of an asylum application filed by a stowaway who has received a positive credible fear determination will be under the jurisdiction of an immigration judge pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

(i) An alien who is the subject of a reinstated removal order pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Act; or
(ii) An alien who has been issued an administrative removal order pursuant to section 238 of the Act as an alien convicted of committing an aggravated felony.
(3)
Rules of procedure
—(i)
General.
Except as provided in this section, proceedings falling under the jurisdiction of the immigration judge pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section shall be conducted in accordance with the same rules of procedure as proceedings conducted under 8 CFR part 1240, subpart A. The scope of review in proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be limited to a determination of whether the alien is eligible for asylum or withholding or deferral of removal, and whether asylum shall be granted in the exercise of discretion. The scope of review in proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be limited to a determination of whether the alien is eligible for withholding or deferral of removal. During such proceedings, all parties are prohibited from raising or considering any other issues, including but not limited to issues of admissibility, deportability, eligibility for waivers, and eligibility for any other form of relief.
(ii)
Notice of hearing procedures and in-absentia decisions.
The alien will be provided with notice of the time and place of the proceeding. The request for asylum and withholding of removal submitted by an alien who fails to appear for the hearing shall be denied. The denial of asylum and withholding of removal for failure to appear may be reopened only upon a motion filed with
the immigration judge with jurisdiction over the case. Only one motion to reopen may be filed, and it must be filed within 90 days, unless the alien establishes that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing date or was in Federal or State custody on the date directed to appear. The motion must include documentary evidence, which demonstrates that:
(A) The alien did not receive the notice;
(B) The alien was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien; or
(C) “Exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, caused the failure to appear.
(iii)
Relief.
The filing of a motion to reopen shall not stay removal of the alien unless the immigration judge issues an order granting a stay pending disposition of the motion. An alien who fails to appear for a proceeding under this section shall not be eligible for relief under section 240A, 240B, 245, 248, or 249 of the Act for a period of 10 years after the date of the denial, unless the applicant can show exceptional circumstances resulted in his or her failure to appear.
[65 FR 76130, Dec. 6, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 55741, Oct. 28, 2009; 85 FR 23904, Apr. 30, 2020; 85 FR 80395, Dec. 11, 2020; 87 FR 18221, Mar. 29, 2022]
§ 1208.3
Form of application.
(a)(1) Except for applicants described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an asylum applicant must file Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, together with any additional supporting evidence in accordance with the instructions on the form. The applicant's spouse and children shall be listed on the application and may be included in the request for asylum if they are in the United States. One additional copy of the principal applicant's Form I-589 must be submitted for each dependent included in the principal's application.
(2) In proceedings under § 1240.17 of this chapter, the written record of a positive credible fear determination issued in accordance with 8 CFR 208.30(f), and §§ 1003.42 of this chapter and 1208.30, shall be construed as the asylum application and satisfies the application filing requirements and § 1208.4(b). The written record of the positive credible fear determination shall be considered a complete asylum application for purposes of § 1208.4(a), with the date of service of the positive credible fear determination on the alien considered the date of filing and receipt, and shall be subject to the conditions and consequences provided for in paragraph (c) of this section following the applicant's signature at the asylum merits interview before the USCIS asylum officer. The applicant's spouse and children may be included in the request for asylum only if they were included in the credible fear determination pursuant to 8 CFR 208.30(c), or also presently have an application for asylum pending adjudication with USCIS pursuant to 8 CFR 208.2(a)(1)(ii). If USCIS does not grant the applicant's asylum application after an interview conducted in accordance with 8 CFR 208.9 and if a spouse or child who was included in the request for asylum does not separately file an asylum application that is adjudicated by USCIS, the application will be deemed to satisfy the application filing requirements of § 1208.4(b) for a spouse or child who was included in the request for asylum. The asylum applicant may subsequently seek to amend, correct, or supplement the record of proceedings created before the asylum officer or during the credible fear review process as set forth in § 1240.17(g) of this chapter concerning the consideration of documentary evidence and witness testimony.
(b) An asylum application shall be deemed to constitute at the same time an application for withholding of removal, unless adjudicated in deportation or exclusion proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997. In such instances, the asylum application shall be deemed to constitute an application for withholding of deportation under section 243(h) of the Act, as that section existed prior to April 1, 1997. Where a determination is made that an applicant is ineligible to apply for asylum under section 208(a)(2) of the Act, an asylum application shall be construed as an application for withholding of removal.
(c) Form I-589 shall be filed under the following conditions and shall have the following consequences:
(1) If the application was filed on or after January 4, 1995, information provided in the application may be used as a basis for the initiation of removal proceedings, or to satisfy any burden of proof in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings;
(2) The applicant and anyone other than a spouse, parent, son, or daughter of the applicant who assists the applicant in preparing the application must sign the application under penalty of perjury. The applicant's signature establishes a presumption that the applicant is aware of the contents of the application. A person other than a relative specified in this paragraph who assists the applicant in preparing the application also must provide his or her full mailing address;
(3) An asylum application under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be properly filed in accordance with the form instructions and with §§ 1003.24, 1003.31(b), and 1103.7(a)(3) of this chapter, including payment of a fee, if any, as explained in the instructions to the application. For purposes of filing with an immigration court, an asylum application is incomplete if it does not include a response to each of the required questions contained in the form, is unsigned, is unaccompanied by the required materials specified in paragraph (a) of this section, is not completed and submitted in accordance with the form instructions, or is unaccompanied by any required fee receipt or other proof of payment as provided in § 1208.4(d)(3). The filing of an incomplete application shall not commence the period after which the applicant may file an application for employment authorization. An application that is incomplete shall be rejected by the immigration court. If an applicant wishes to have his or her application for asylum considered, he or she shall correct the deficiencies in the incomplete application and refile it within 30 days of rejection. Failure to correct the deficiencies in an incomplete application or failure to timely refile the application with the deficiencies corrected, absent exceptional circumstances as defined in § 1003.10(b) of this chapter, shall result in a finding that the alien has abandoned that application and waived the opportunity to file such an application;
(4) Knowing placement of false information on the application may subject the person placing that information on the application to criminal penalties under title 18 of the United States Code and to civil or criminal penalties under section 274C of the Act; and
(5) Knowingly filing a frivolous application on or after April 1, 1997, so long as the applicant has received the notice required by section 208(d)(4) of the Act, shall render the applicant permanently ineligible for any benefits under the Act pursuant to § 1208.20.
[62 FR 10337, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 76131, Dec. 6, 2000; 85 FR 81750, Dec. 16, 2020; 87 FR 18221, Mar. 29, 2022]
§ 1208.4
Filing the application.
Except as prohibited in paragraph (a) of this section, asylum applications shall be filed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(a)
Prohibitions on filing.
Section 208(a)(2) of the Act prohibits certain aliens from filing for asylum on or after April 1, 1997, unless the alien can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that one of the exceptions in section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act applies. Such prohibition applies only to asylum applications under section 208 of the Act and not to applications for withholding of removal under § 1208.16. If an applicant files an asylum application and it appears that one or more of the prohibitions contained in section 208(a)(2) of the Act apply, an asylum officer, in an interview, or an immigration judge, in a hearing, shall review the application and give the applicant the opportunity to present any relevant and useful information bearing on any prohibitions on filing to determine if the application should be rejected. For the purpose of making determinations under section 208(a)(2) of the Act, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Authority.
Only an asylum officer, an immigration judge, or the Board of Immigration Appeals is authorized to make determinations regarding the prohibitions contained in section 208(a)(2)(B) or (C) of the Act.
(2)
One-year filing deadline.
(i) For purposes of section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act, an applicant has the burden of proving:
(A) By clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year of the date of the alien's arrival in the United States, or
(B) To the satisfaction of the asylum officer, the immigration judge, or the Board that he or she qualifies for an exception to the 1-year deadline.
(ii) The 1-year period shall be calculated from the date of the alien's last arrival in the United States or April 1, 1997, whichever is later. When the last day of the period so computed falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period shall run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For the purpose of making determinations under section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act only, an application is considered to have been filed on the date it is received by the Service, pursuant to § 103.2(a)(7) of 8 CFR chapter I. In a case in which the application has not been received by the Service within 1 year from the applicant's date of entry into the United States, but the applicant provides clear and convincing documentary evidence of mailing the application within the 1-year period, the mailing date shall be considered the filing date. For cases before the immigration court, the application is considered to have been filed on the date it is received by the immigration court. For cases before the Board of Immigration Appeals, the application is considered to have been filed on the date it is received by the Board. In the case of an application that appears to have been filed more than a year after the applicant arrived in the United States, the asylum officer, the immigration judge, or the Board will determine whether the applicant qualifies for an exception to the deadline. The failure to have provided required biometrics and other biographical information does not prevent the “filing” of an asylum application for purposes of the one-year filing rule of section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act.
See
8 CFR 1003.47. For aliens present in or arriving in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the 1-year period shall be calculated from January 1, 2030, or from the date of the alien's last arrival in the United States (including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), whichever is later. No period of physical presence in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands prior to January 1, 2030, shall count toward the 1-year period. After November 28, 2009, any travel to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands from any other State shall not re-start the calculation of the 1-year period.
(3)
Prior denial of application.
For purposes of section 208(a)(2)(C) of the Act, an asylum application has not been denied unless denied by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals.
(4)
Changed circumstances.
(i) The term “changed circumstances” in section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act shall refer to circumstances materially affecting the applicant's eligibility for asylum. They may include, but are not limited to:
(A) Changes in conditions in the applicant's country of nationality or, if the applicant is stateless, country of last habitual residence;
(B) Changes in the applicant's circumstances that materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum, including changes in applicable U.S. law and activities the applicant becomes involved in outside the country of feared persecution that place the applicant at risk; or
(C) In the case of an alien who had previously been included as a dependent in another alien's pending asylum application, the loss of the spousal or parent-child relationship to the principal applicant through marriage, divorce, death, or attainment of age 21.
(ii) The applicant shall file an asylum application within a reasonable period given those “changed circumstances.” If the applicant can establish that he or she did not become aware of the changed circumstances until after they occurred, such delayed awareness shall be taken into account in determining what constitutes a “reasonable period.”
(5) The term “extraordinary circumstances” in section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act shall refer to events or factors directly related to the failure to meet
the 1-year deadline. Such circumstances may excuse the failure to file within the 1-year period as long as the alien filed the application within a reasonable period given those circumstances. The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish to the satisfaction of the asylum officer, the immigration judge, or the Board of Immigration Appeals that the circumstances were not intentionally created by the alien through his or her own action or inaction, that those circumstances were directly related to the alien's failure to file the application within the 1-year period, and that the delay was reasonable under the circumstances. Those circumstances may include but are not limited to:
(i) Serious illness or mental or physical disability, including any effects of persecution or violent harm suffered in the past, during the 1-year period after arrival;
(ii) Legal disability (e.g., the applicant was an unaccompanied minor or suffered from a mental impairment) during the 1-year period after arrival;
(iii) Ineffective assistance of counsel, provided that:
(A) The alien files an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard;
(B) The counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned has been informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and given an opportunity to respond; and
(C) The alien indicates whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel's ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not;
(iv) The applicant maintained Temporary Protected Status, lawful immigrant or nonimmigrant status, or was given parole, until a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application;
(v) The applicant filed an asylum application prior to the expiration of the 1-year deadline, but that application was rejected by the Service as not properly filed, was returned to the applicant for corrections, and was refiled within a reasonable period thereafter; and
(vi) The death or serious illness or incapacity of the applicant's legal representative or a member of the applicant's immediate family.
(6)
Asylum cooperative agreements.
Immigration judges have authority to consider issues under section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act, relating to the determination of whether an alien is ineligible to apply for asylum and should be removed to a third country pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement, only with respect to aliens whom DHS has chosen to place in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, as provided in 8 CFR 1240.11(g) and (h). For DHS regulations relating to determinations by immigration officers on this subject, see 8 CFR 208.30(e)(6) and (7).
(b)
Filing location
—(1)
With the service center by mail.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section, asylum applications shall be filed directly by mail with the service center servicing the asylum office with jurisdiction over the place of the applicant's residence or, in the case of an alien without a United States residence, the applicant's current lodging or the land border port-of-entry through which the alien seeks admission to the United States.
(2)
With the asylum office.
An asylum application shall be filed directly with the asylum office having jurisdiction over the matter in the case of an alien who:
(i) Has received the express consent of the asylum office director or the Director of Asylum to do so, or
(ii) Previously was included in a spouse's or parent's pending application but is no longer eligible to be included as a derivative. In such cases, the derivative should include a cover letter referencing the previous application and explaining that he or she is now independently filing for asylum.
(3)
With the Immigration Court.
Asylum applications shall be filed directly with the Immigration Court having jurisdiction over the case in the following circumstances:
(i) During exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, with the Immigration Court having jurisdiction over the underlying proceeding except that an alien in proceedings under § 1240.17 of this chapter is not required to file the Form I-589.
(ii) After completion of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, and in conjunction with a motion to reopen pursuant to 8 CFR part 1003 where applicable, with the Immigration Court having jurisdiction over the prior proceeding. Any such motion must reasonably explain the failure to request asylum prior to the completion of the proceedings.
(iii) In asylum proceedings pursuant to § 1208.2(c)(1) and after the Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, has been served on the alien and filed with the Immigration Court having jurisdiction over the case.
(4)
With the Board of Immigration Appeals.
In conjunction with a motion to remand or reopen pursuant to §§ 1003.2 and 1003.8 of this chapter where applicable, an initial asylum application shall be filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals if jurisdiction over the proceedings is vested in the Board of Immigration Appeals under 8 CFR part 1003. Any such motion must reasonably explain the failure to request asylum prior to the completion of the proceedings.
(5)
With the district director.
In the case of any alien described in § 1208.2(c)(1) and prior to the service on the alien of Form I-863, any asylum application shall be submitted to the district director having jurisdiction pursuant to 8 CFR part 103. If the district director elects to issue the Form I-863, the district director shall forward such asylum application to the appropriate Immigration Court with the Form
(c)
Amending an application after filing.
Upon request of the alien and as a matter of discretion, the asylum officer or immigration judge having jurisdiction may permit an asylum applicant to amend or supplement the application, but any delay caused by such request shall extend the period within which the applicant may not apply for employment authorization in accordance with § 1208.7(a).
(d)
Filing deadline.
(1) For any alien in asylum-and-withholding-only proceedings pursuant to § 1208.2(c)(1) and paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the immigration judge shall comply with the requirements of § 1240.11(c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this chapter and shall set a deadline of fifteen days from the date of the alien's first hearing before an immigration judge by which the alien must file an asylum application, which includes an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act and protection under §§ 1208.16 through 1208.18. The immigration judge may extend the deadline for good cause. If the alien does not file an asylum application by the deadline set by the immigration judge, the immigration judge shall deem the opportunity to file such an application waived, and the case shall be returned to the Department of Homeland Security. For any alien in proceedings pursuant to § 1208.2(c)(2), the immigration judge shall comply with the requirements of § 1240.11(c)(1)(i) through (iii) and shall set a deadline of fifteen days from the date of the alien's first hearing before an immigration judge by which the alien must file an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, which includes an application for protection under §§ 1208.16 through 1208.18. The immigration judge may extend the deadline for good cause. If the alien does not file an application by the deadline set by the immigration judge, the immigration judge shall deem the opportunity to file such an application waived, and the case shall be returned to the Department of Homeland Security.
(2) If the alien must pay a fee for submission of the asylum application, the alien must submit the DHS-issued fee receipt together with the application by the deadline set by the immigration judge in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3) If the alien has paid any required fee but has not received the fee receipt from DHS by the deadline set by the immigration judge, the alien must instead provide to the immigration court a copy of proof of the payment to DHS with the asylum application. The alien
must then submit a copy of the fee receipt by a new deadline set by the immigration judge. If the immigration judge does not set a deadline, the alien must submit the fee receipt no later than 45 days after the date of filing of the application.

§ 1208.5
Special duties toward aliens in custody of DHS.
(a)
General.
When an alien in the custody of DHS requests asylum or withholding of removal, or expresses a fear of persecution or harm upon return to his or her country of origin or to agents thereof, DHS shall make available the appropriate application forms and shall provide the applicant with the information required by section 208(d)(4) of the Act, including in the case of an alien who is in custody with a positive credible fear determination under 8 CFR 208.30 or a reasonable fear determination pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, and except in the case of an alien who is in custody pending a credible fear determination under 8 CFR 208.30 or a reasonable fear determination pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31. Although DHS does not have a duty in the case of an alien who is in custody pending a credible fear or reasonable fear determination under either 8 CFR 1208.30 or 8 CFR 1208.31, DHS may provide the appropriate forms, upon request. Where possible, expedited consideration shall be given to applications of detained aliens. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, such alien shall not be excluded, deported, or removed before a decision is rendered on his or her asylum application. Furthermore, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an alien physically present in or arriving in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall not be excluded, deported, or removed before a decision is rendered on his or her application for withholding of removal pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture. No application for asylum may be filed prior to January 1, 2030, pursuant to section 208 of the Act by an alien physically present in or arriving in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
(b)
Certain aliens aboard vessels.
(1) If an alien crewmember or alien stowaway on board a vessel or other conveyance alleges, claims, or otherwise makes known to an immigration inspector or other official making an examination on the conveyance that he or she is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality or last habitual residence (if not a national of any country) because of persecution or a fear of persecution in that country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or if the alien expresses a fear of torture upon return to that country, the alien shall be promptly removed from the conveyance. If the alien makes such fear known to an official while off such conveyance, the alien shall not be returned to the conveyance but shall be retained in or transferred to the custody of the Service.
(i) An alien stowaway will be referred to an asylum officer for a credible fear determination under § 1208.30.
(ii) An alien crewmember shall be provided the appropriate application forms and information required by section 208(d)(4) of the Act and may then have 10 days within which to submit an asylum application to the district director having jurisdiction over the port-of-entry. The district director may extend the 10-day filing period for good cause. Once the application has been filed, the district director, pursuant to § 1208.4(b), shall serve Form I-863 on the alien and immediately forward any such application to the appropriate Immigration Court with a copy of the Form I-863 being filed with that court.
(iii) An alien crewmember physically present in or arriving in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands can request withholding of removal pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture. However,
such an alien crewmember is not eligible to request asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Act prior to January 1, 2030.
(2) Pending adjudication of the application, and, in the case of a stowaway the credible fear determination and any review thereof, the alien may be detained by the Service or otherwise paroled in accordance with 8 CFR 212.5. However, pending the credible fear determination, parole of an alien stowaway may be permitted only when the Attorney General determines, in the exercise of discretion, that parole is required to meet a medical emergency or is necessary for a legitimate law enforcement objective.
(c)
Exception to prohibition on removal.
A motion to reopen or an order to remand accompanied by an asylum application pursuant to § 1208.4(b)(3)(iii) shall not stay execution of a final exclusion, deportation, or removal order unless such stay is specifically granted by the Board of Immigration Appeals or the immigration judge having jurisdiction over the motion.

Reliance on information compiled by other sources.
(a) In deciding an asylum application, which includes an application for withholding of removal under 241(b)(3) of the Act and protection under §§ 1208.16 through 1208.18, or in deciding whether the alien has a credible fear of persecution or torture pursuant to § 1208.30, or a reasonable fear of persecution or torture pursuant to § 1208.31, an immigration judge may rely on material provided by the Department of State, other Department of Justice offices, the Department of Homeland Security, or other U.S. Government agencies, and may rely on foreign government and non-governmental sources if those sources are determined by the judge to be credible and the material is probative. On his or her own authority, an immigration judge may submit relevant evidence into the record, if the source is credible and the evidence is probative, and may consider it in deciding an asylum application, which includes an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act and protection under §§ 1208.16 through 1208.18, provided that a copy of the evidence has been provided to both parties and both parties have had an opportunity to comment on or object to the evidence prior to the issuance of the immigration judge's decision.

§ 1208.13
Establishing asylum eligibility.
(a)
Burden of proof.
The burden of proof is on the applicant for asylum to establish that he or she is a refugee as defined in section 101(a)(42) of the Act. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration. The fact that the applicant previously established a credible fear of persecution for purposes of section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act does not relieve the alien of the additional burden of establishing eligibility for asylum.
(b)
Eligibility.
The applicant may qualify as a refugee either because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.
(1)
Past persecution.
An applicant shall be found to be a refugee on the basis of past persecution if the applicant can establish that he or she has suffered persecution in the past in the applicant's country of nationality or, if stateless, in his or her country of last habitual residence, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, and is unable or unwilling to return to, or avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country owing to such persecution. An applicant who has been found to have established
such past persecution shall also be presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of the original claim. That presumption may be rebutted if an asylum officer or immigration judge makes one of the findings described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. If the applicant's fear of future persecution is unrelated to the past persecution, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that the fear is well-founded.
(i)
Discretionary referral or denial.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, an asylum officer shall, in the exercise of his or her discretion, refer or deny, or an immigration judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, shall deny the asylum application of an alien found to be a refugee on the basis of past persecution if any of the following is found by a preponderance of the evidence:
(A) There has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in the applicant's country of nationality or, if stateless, in the applicant's country of last habitual residence, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or
(B) The applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant's country of nationality or, if stateless, another part of the applicant's country of last habitual residence, and under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.
(ii)
Burden of proof.
In cases in which an applicant has demonstrated past persecution under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Service shall bear the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.
(iii)
Grant in the absence of well-founded fear of persecution.
An applicant described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section who is not barred from a grant of asylum under paragraph (c) of this section, may be granted asylum, in the exercise of the decision-maker's discretion, if:
(A) The applicant has demonstrated compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution; or
(B) The applicant has established that there is a reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country.
(2)
Well-founded fear of persecution.
(i) An applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution if:
(A) The applicant has a fear of persecution in his or her country of nationality or, if stateless, in his or her country of last habitual residence, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion;
(B) There is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country; and
(C) He or she is unable or unwilling to return to, or avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of such fear.
(ii) An applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant's country of nationality or, if stateless, another part of the applicant's country of last habitual residence, if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.
(iii) In evaluating whether the applicant has sustained the burden of proving that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution, the asylum officer or immigration judge shall not require the applicant to provide evidence that there is a reasonable possibility he or she would be singled out individually for persecution if:
(A) The applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality or, if stateless, in his or her country of last habitual residence, of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; and
(B) The applicant establishes his or her own inclusion in, and identification with, such group of persons such that his or her fear of persecution upon return is reasonable.
(3)
Reasonableness of internal relocation.
For purposes of determinations
under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) and (b)(2) of this section, adjudicators should consider the totality of the relevant circumstances regarding an applicant's prospects for relocation, including the size of the country of nationality or last habitual residence, the geographic locus of the alleged persecution, the size, numerosity, and reach of the alleged persecutor, and the applicant's demonstrated ability to relocate to the United States in order to apply for asylum.
(i) In cases in which the applicant has not established past persecution, the applicant shall bear the burden of establishing that it would not be reasonable for him or her to relocate, unless the persecution is by a government or is government-sponsored.
(ii) In cases in which the persecutor is a government or is government-sponsored, it shall be presumed that internal relocation would not be reasonable, unless the Department of Homeland Security establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate.
(iii) Regardless of whether an applicant has established persecution in the past, in cases in which the persecutor is not the government or a government-sponsored actor, or otherwise is a private actor, there shall be a presumption that internal relocation would be reasonable unless the applicant establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would be unreasonable to relocate.
(iv) For purposes of determinations under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, persecutors who are private actors—including persecutors who are gang members, officials acting outside their official capacity, family members who are not themselves government officials, or neighbors who are not themselves government officials—shall not be considered to be persecutors who are the government or government-sponsored absent evidence that the government sponsored the persecution.
(c)
Mandatory denials
—(1)
Applications filed on or after April 1, 1997.
For applications filed on or after April 1, 1997, an applicant shall not qualify for asylum if section 208(a)(2) or 208(b)(2) of the Act applies to the applicant. If the applicant is found to be ineligible for asylum under either section 208(a)(2) or 208(b)(2) of the Act, the applicant shall be considered for eligibility for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act. The applicant shall also be considered for eligibility for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture if the applicant requests such consideration or if the evidence presented by the alien indicates that the alien may be tortured in the country of removal.
(2)
Applications filed before April 1, 1997.
(i) An immigration judge or asylum officer shall not grant asylum to any applicant who filed his or her application before April 1, 1997, if the alien:
(A) Having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime in the United States, constitutes a danger to the community;
(B) Has been firmly resettled within the meaning of § 1208.15;
(C) Can reasonably be regarded as a danger to the security of the United States;
(D) Has been convicted of an aggravated felony, as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act; or
(E) Ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.
(F) Is described within section 212(a)(3)(B)(i)(I),(II), and (III) of the Act as it existed prior to April 1, 1997, and as amended by the Anti-terrorist and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), unless it is determined that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the individual is a danger to the security of the United States.
(ii) If the evidence indicates that one of the above grounds apply to the applicant, he or she shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she did not so act.
(3)-(5) [Reserved]
(6)
Additional limitations on eligibility for asylum.
For applications filed on or after November 20, 2020, an alien shall be found ineligible for asylum if:
(i) The alien has been convicted on or after such date of an offense arising
under sections 274(a)(1)(A), 274(a)(2), or 276 of the Act;
(ii) The alien has been convicted on or after such date of a Federal, State, tribal, or local crime that the immigration judge knows or has reason to believe was committed in support, promotion, or furtherance of the activity of a criminal street gang as that term is defined either under the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred or in section 521(a) of title 18;
(iii) The alien has been convicted on or after such date of an offense for driving while intoxicated or impaired as those terms are defined under the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred (including a conviction for driving while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs) without regard to whether the conviction is classified as a misdemeanor or felony under Federal, State, tribal, or local law, in which such impaired driving was a cause of serious bodily injury or death of another person;
(iv)(A) The alien has been convicted on or after such date of a second or subsequent offense for driving while intoxicated or impaired as those terms are defined under the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred (including a conviction for driving while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs) without regard to whether the conviction is classified as a misdemeanor or felony under Federal, State, tribal, or local law;
(B) A finding under paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(A) of this section does not require the immigration judge to find the first conviction for driving while intoxicated or impaired (including a conviction for driving while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs) as a predicate offense. The immigration judge need only make a factual determination that the alien was previously convicted for driving while intoxicated or impaired as those terms are defined under the jurisdiction where the convictions occurred (including a conviction for driving while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs).
(v)(A) The alien has been convicted on or after such date of a crime that involves conduct amounting to a crime of stalking; or a crime of child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment; or that involves conduct amounting to a domestic assault or battery offense, including a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, as described in section 922(g)(9) of title 18, a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as described in section 921(a)(33) of title 18, a crime of domestic violence as described in section 12291(a)(8) of title 34, or any crime based on conduct in which the alien harassed, coerced, intimidated, voluntarily or recklessly used (or threatened to use) force or violence against, or inflicted physical injury or physical pain, however slight, upon a person, and committed by:

1
) An alien who is a current or former spouse of the person;

(
4
) An alien similarly situated to a spouse of the person under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction where the offense occurs; or
(
5
) Any other alien against a person who is protected from that alien's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the United States or any State, tribal government, or unit of local government.
(B) In making a determination under paragraph (c)(6)(v)(A) of this section, including in determining the existence of a domestic relationship between the alien and the victim, the underlying conduct of the crime may be considered and the immigration judge is not limited to facts found by the criminal court or provided in the underlying record of conviction.
(C) An alien who was convicted of offenses described in paragraph (c)(6)(v)(A) of this section is not subject to ineligibility for asylum on that basis if the alien would be described in section 237(a)(7)(A) of the Act were the crimes or conduct considered grounds for deportability under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) through (ii) of the Act.
(vi) The alien has been convicted on or after such date of—

) The possession or use of an identification document, authentication feature, or false identification document without lawful authority, unless the alien can establish that the conviction resulted from circumstances showing that the document was presented before boarding a common carrier, that the document related to the alien's eligibility to enter the United States, that the alien used the document to depart a country in which the alien has claimed a fear of persecution, and that the alien claimed a fear of persecution without delay upon presenting himself or herself to an immigration officer upon arrival at a United States port of entry;

(vii) The immigration judge knows or has reason to believe that the alien has engaged on or after such date in acts of battery or extreme cruelty as defined in 8 CFR 204.2(c)(1)(vi), upon a person, and committed by:
(A) An alien who is a current or former spouse of the person;
(B) An alien with whom the person shares a child in common;
(C) An alien who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the person as a spouse;
(D) An alien similarly situated to a spouse of the person under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction where the offense occurs; or
(E) Any other alien against a person who is protected from that alien's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the United States or any State, tribal government, or unit of local government, even if the acts did not result in a criminal conviction;
(F) Except that an alien who was convicted of offenses or engaged in conduct described in paragraph (c)(6)(vii) of this section is not subject to ineligibility for asylum on that basis if the alien would be described in section 237(a)(7)(A) of the Act were the crimes or conduct considered grounds for deportability under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i)-(ii) of the Act.
(7) For purposes of paragraph (c)(6) of this section:
(i) The term “felony” means any crime defined as a felony by the relevant jurisdiction (Federal, State, tribal, or local) of conviction, or any crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment.
(ii) The term “misdemeanor” means any crime defined as a misdemeanor by the relevant jurisdiction (Federal, State, tribal, or local) of conviction, or any crime not punishable by more than one year of imprisonment.
(iii) Whether any activity or conviction also may constitute a basis for removability under the Act is immaterial to a determination of asylum eligibility.
(iv) All references to a criminal offense or criminal conviction shall be deemed to include any attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit the offense or any other inchoate form of the offense.
(v) No order vacating a conviction, modifying a sentence, clarifying a sentence, or otherwise altering a conviction or sentence, shall have any effect unless the immigration judge determines that—
(A) The court issuing the order had jurisdiction and authority to do so; and
(B) The order was not entered for rehabilitative purposes or for purposes of ameliorating the immigration consequences of the conviction or sentence.
(8) For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(v)(B) of this section, the order shall be presumed to be for the purpose of ameliorating immigration consequences if:
(i) The order was entered after the initiation of any proceeding to remove the alien from the United States; or
(ii) The alien moved for the order more than one year after the date of the original order of conviction or sentencing.
(9) An immigration judge is authorized to look beyond the face of any order purporting to vacate a conviction, modify a sentence, or clarify a sentence to determine whether the requirements of paragraph (c)(7)(v) of this section have been met in order to determine whether such order should be given any effect under this section.
(d)
Discretion.
Factors that fall short of grounds of mandatory denial of an asylum application may constitute discretionary considerations.
(1) The following are significant adverse discretionary factors that a decision-maker shall consider, if applicable, in determining whether an alien merits a grant of asylum in the exercise of discretion:
(i) An alien's unlawful entry or unlawful attempted entry into the United States unless such entry or attempted entry was made in immediate flight from persecution in a contiguous country or unless such entry or attempted entry was made by an alien under the age of 18 at the time the entry or attempted entry was made;

(iii) An alien's use of fraudulent documents to enter the United States, unless the alien arrived in the United States by air, sea, or land directly from the applicant's home country without transiting through any other country.
(2)(i) The Attorney General, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, will not favorably exercise discretion under section 208 of the Act for an alien who:
(A) Immediately prior to his arrival in the United States or en route to the United States from the alien's country of citizenship, nationality, or last lawful habitual residence, spent more than 14 days in any one country unless:
(
1
) The alien demonstrates that he or she applied for protection from persecution or torture in such country and the alien received a final judgment denying the alien protection in such country;
(
2
) The alien demonstrates that he or she satisfies the definition of “victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons” provided in 8 CFR 214.11; or
(

(
2
) The alien demonstrates that he or she satisfies the definition of “victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons” provided in 8 CFR 214.11; or

(G) Has withdrawn a prior asylum application with prejudice or been found to have abandoned a prior asylum application;
(H) Failed to attend an interview regarding his or her asylum application with DHS, unless the alien shows by a preponderance of the evidence that:
(
1
) Exceptional circumstances prevented the alien from attending the interview; or
(
2
) The interview notice was not mailed to the last address provided by the alien or the alien's representative and neither the alien nor the alien's representative received notice of the interview; or
(I) Was subject to a final order of removal, deportation, or exclusion and did not file a motion to reopen to seek asylum based on changed country conditions within one year of the changes in country conditions.
(ii) Where one or more of the adverse discretionary factors set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section are present, the Attorney General, in extraordinary circumstances, such as those involving national security or foreign policy considerations, or cases in which an alien, by clear and convincing evidence, demonstrates that the denial of the application for asylum would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien, may favorably exercise discretion under section 208 of the Act, notwithstanding the applicability of paragraph (d)(2)(i). Depending on the gravity of the circumstances underlying the application of paragraph (d)(2)(i), a showing of extraordinary circumstances might still be insufficient to warrant a favorable exercise of discretion under section 208 of the Act.
(e)
Prima facie eligibility.
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, upon oral or written motion by the Department of Homeland Security, an immigration judge shall, if warranted by the record, pretermit and deny any application for asylum, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, or protection under the regulations issued pursuant to the Convention Against Torture's implementing legislation if the alien has not established a prima facie claim for relief or protection under applicable law. An immigration judge need not conduct a hearing prior to pretermitting and denying an application under this paragraph (e)(1) but must consider any response to the motion before making a decision.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, upon his or her own authority, an immigration judge shall, if warranted by the record, pretermit and deny any application for asylum, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, or protection under the regulations issued pursuant to the Convention Against Torture's implementing legislation if the alien has not established a prima facie claim for relief or protection under applicable law, provided that the immigration judge shall give the parties at least 10 days' notice prior to entering such an order. An immigration judge need not conduct a hearing prior to pretermitting and denying an application under this paragraph (e)(2) but must consider any filings by the parties within the 10-day period before making a decision.
(f)
Lawful pathways condition.
For applications filed by aliens who entered the United States between May 11, 2023, and May 11, 2025, also refer to the provisions on asylum eligibility described in § 1208.33.
(g)

§ 1208.13
Establishing asylum eligibility.
(c) * * *
(10)(i)
Public health emergencies.
If a communicable disease has triggered an ongoing declaration of a public health emergency under Federal law, such as under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 247d, or section 564 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3, then an alien is ineligible for asylum under section 208 of the Act on the basis of there being reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States under section 208(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act if the alien—
(A) Exhibits symptoms indicating that he or she is afflicted with the disease, per guidance issued by the Secretary or the Attorney General, as appropriate, or
(B) Has come into contact with the disease within the number of days equivalent to the longest known incubation and contagion period for the disease, per guidance issued by the Secretary or the Attorney General, as appropriate.
(ii)
Danger to the public health caused by an epidemic outside of the United States.
If, regarding a communicable disease of public health significance as defined at 42 CFR 34.2(b), the Secretary and the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, have jointly—
(A) Determined that the physical presence in the United States of aliens who are coming from a country or countries (or one or more subdivisions or regions thereof), or have embarked at a place or places, where such disease is prevalent or epidemic (or had come from that country or countries (or one or more subdivisions or regions thereof), or had embarked at that place or places, during a period in which the disease was prevalent or epidemic there) would cause a danger to the public health in the United States, and
(B) Designated the foreign country or countries (or one or more subdivisions or regions thereof), or place or places, and the period of time or circumstances under which they jointly deem it necessary for the public health that aliens or classes of aliens described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section who are still within the number of days equivalent to the longest known incubation and contagion period for the disease be regarded as a danger to the security of the United States under section 208(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act, including any relevant exceptions as appropriate, then—
(C) An alien or class of aliens are ineligible for asylum under section 208 of the Act on the basis of there being reasonable grounds for regarding the alien or class of aliens as a danger to the security of the United States under section 208(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act if the alien or class of aliens are described in paragraph (c)(10)(ii)(A) of this section and are regarded as a danger to the security of the United States as provided for in paragraph (c)(10)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iii) The grounds for mandatory denial described in paragraphs (c)(10)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not apply to an alien who is applying for asylum or withholding of removal in the United States upon return from Canada to the United States and pursuant to the Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada
for Cooperation in the Examination of Refugee Status Claims from Nationals of Third Countries.
§ 1208.14
Approval, denial, referral, or dismissal of application.
(a)
By an immigration judge.
Unless otherwise prohibited in § 1208.13(c), an immigration judge may grant or deny asylum in the exercise of discretion to an applicant who qualifies as a refugee under section 101(a)(42) of the Act. In no case shall an immigration judge grant asylum without compliance with the requirements of § 1003.47 concerning identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations.
(b)
Approval by an asylum officer.
In any case within the jurisdiction of USCIS, unless otherwise prohibited in § 1208.13(c), an asylum officer, subject to review within USCIS, may grant, in the exercise of his or her distraction, asylum to an applicant who qualifies as a refugee under section 101(a)(42) of the Act, and whose identity has been checked pursuant to section 208(d)(5)(A)(i) of the Act.
(c)
Denial, referral, or dismissal by an asylum officer.
If the asylum officer, subject to review within USCIS, does not grant asylum to an applicant after an interview conducted in accordance with 8 CFR 208.9, or if, as provided in 8 CFR 208.10, the applicant is deemed to have waived the applicant's right to an interview or an adjudication by an asylum officer, the asylum officer shall deny, refer, or dismiss the application, as follows:
(1)
Inadmissible or deportable aliens.
Except for applicants described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section who have not already been subject to proceedings in accordance with 8 CFR 235.3, in the case of an applicant who appears to be inadmissible or deportable under section 212(a) or 237(a) of the Act, the asylum officer shall refer the application to an immigration judge, together with the appropriate charging document, for adjudication in removal proceedings (or, where charging documents may not be issued, shall dismiss the application).
(2)
Alien in valid status.
In the case of an applicant who is maintaining valid immigrant, nonimmigrant, or Temporary Protected Status at the time the application is decided, the asylum officer shall deny the application for asylum.
(3)
Alien with valid parole.
If an applicant has been paroled into the United States and the parole has not expired or been terminated by the Service, the asylum officer shall deny the application for asylum.
(4)
Alien paroled into the United States whose parole has expired or is terminated
—(i)
Alien paroled prior to April 1, 1997, or with advance authorization for parole.
In the case of an applicant who was paroled into the United States prior to April 1, 1997, or who, prior to departure from the United States, had received an advance authorization for parole, the asylum officer shall refer the application, together with the appropriate charging documents, to an immigration judge for adjudication in removal proceedings if the parole has expired, the Service has terminated parole, or the Service is terminating parole through issuance of the charging documents, pursuant to § 1212.5(d)(2)(i) of this chapter.
(ii)
Alien paroled on or after April 1, 1997, without advance authorization for parole.
In the case of an applicant who is an arriving alien or is otherwise subject to removal under § 235.3(b) of chapter I, and was paroled into the United States on or after April 1, 1997, without advance authorization for parole prior to departure from the United States, the asylum officer will take the following actions, if the parole has expired or been terminated:
(A)
Inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act.
If the applicant appears inadmissible to the United States under section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act and the asylum officer does not intend to lodge any additional charges of inadmissibility, the asylum officer shall proceed in accordance with § 235.3(b) of chapter I. If such applicant is found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture based on information elicited from the asylum interview, an asylum officer may refer the applicant directly to an immigration judge in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, without conducting a separate credible fear
interview pursuant to § 1208.30. If such applicant is not found to have a credible fear based on information elicited at the asylum interview, an asylum officer will conduct a credible fear interview and the applicant will be subject to the credible fear process specified at § 1208.30(b).
(B)
Inadmissible on other grounds.
In the case of an applicant who was paroled into the United States on or after April 1, 1997, and will be charged as inadmissible to the United States under provisions of the Act other than, or in addition to, sections 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7), the asylum officer shall refer the application to an immigration judge for adjudication in removal proceedings.
(d)
Applicability of § 103.2(b) of this chapter.
No application for asylum or withholding of deportation shall be subject to denial pursuant to § 103.2(b) of this chapter.
(e)
Duration.
If the applicant is granted asylum, the grant will be effective for an indefinite period, subject to termination as provided in § 1208.24.
(f)
Effect of denial of principal's application on separate applications by dependents.
The denial of an asylum application filed by a principal applicant for asylum shall also result in the denial of asylum status to any dependents of that principal applicant who are included in that same application. Such denial shall not preclude a grant of asylum for an otherwise eligible dependent who has filed a separate asylum application, nor shall such denial result in an otherwise eligible dependent becoming ineligible to apply for asylum due to the provisions of section 208(a)(2)(C) of the Act.
(g)
Applicants granted lawful permanent residence status.
If an asylum applicant is granted adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident, the Service may provide written notice to the applicant that his or her asylum application will be presumed abandoned and dismissed without prejudice, unless the applicant submits a written request within 30 days of the notice, that the asylum application be adjudicated. If an applicant does not respond within 30 days of the date the written notice was sent or served, the Service may presume the asylum application abandoned and dismiss it without prejudice.

§ 1208.15
Definition of “firm resettlement.”
(a) An alien is considered to be firmly resettled if, after the events giving rise to the alien's asylum claim:
(1) The alien resided in a country through which the alien transited prior to arriving in or entering the United States and—
(i) Received or was eligible for any permanent legal immigration status in that country;
(ii) Resided in such a country with any non-permanent but indefinitely renewable legal immigration status (including asylee, refugee, or similar status but excluding status such as of a tourist); or
(iii) Resided in such a country and could have applied for and obtained any non-permanent but indefinitely renewable legal immigration status in that country;
(2) The alien physically resided voluntarily, and without continuing to suffer persecution in any one country for one year or more after departing his country of nationality or last habitual residence and prior to arrival in or entry into the United States, provided that time spent in Mexico by an alien who is not a native or citizen of Mexico solely as a direct result of being returned to Mexico pursuant to section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Act or of being subject to metering would not be counted for purposes of this paragraph; or
(3)(i) The alien is a citizen of a country other than the one where the alien alleges a fear of persecution and the alien was present in that country after departing his country of nationality or last habitual residence and prior to arrival in or entry into the United States, or
(ii) the alien was a citizen of a country other than the one where the alien alleges a fear of persecution, the alien was present in that country after departing his country of nationality or
last habitual residence and prior to arrival in or entry into the United States, and the alien renounced that citizenship after arriving in the United States.
(b) The provisions of 8 CFR 1240.8(d) shall apply when the evidence of record indicates that the firm resettlement bar may apply. In such cases, the alien shall bear the burden of proving the bar does not apply. Either DHS or the immigration judge may raise the issue of the application of the firm resettlement bar based on the evidence of record. The firm resettlement of an alien's parent(s) shall be imputed to the alien if the resettlement occurred before the alien turned 18 and the alien resided with the alien's parents at the time of the firm resettlement unless he or she could not have derived any permanent legal immigration status or any non-permanent but indefinitely renewable legal immigration status (including asylee, refugee, or similar status but excluding status such as of a tourist) from the alien's parent.
[85 FR 80397, Dec. 11, 2020]
§ 1208.16
Withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture.
(a)
Consideration of application for withholding of removal.
Consideration of eligibility for statutory withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture by a DHS officer is as provided at 8 CFR 208.16. In exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, an immigration judge may adjudicate both an asylum claim and a request for withholding of removal whether or not asylum is granted.
(b)
Eligibility for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act; burden of proof.
The burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act to establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration. The evidence shall be evaluated as follows:
(1)
Past threat to life or freedom.
(i) If the applicant is determined to have suffered past persecution in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, it shall be presumed that the applicant's life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of the original claim. This presumption may be rebutted if an asylum officer or immigration judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence:
(A) There has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant's life or freedom would not be threatened on account of any of the five grounds mentioned in this paragraph upon the applicant's removal to that country; or
(B) The applicant could avoid a future threat to his or her life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal and, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.
(ii) In cases in which the applicant has established past persecution, the Service shall bear the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) or (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
(iii) If the applicant's fear of future threat to life or freedom is unrelated to the past persecution, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that he or she would suffer such harm.
(2)
Future threat to life or freedom.
An applicant who has not suffered past persecution may demonstrate that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the future in a country if he or she can establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion upon removal to that country. Such an applicant cannot demonstrate that his or her life or freedom would be threatened if the asylum officer or immigration judge finds that the applicant could avoid a future threat to his or her life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of
removal and, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the applicant's life or freedom would be threatened in a particular country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, the asylum officer or immigration judge shall not require the applicant to provide evidence that he or she would be singled out individually for such persecution if:
(i) The applicant establishes that in that country there is a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; and
(ii) The applicant establishes his or her own inclusion in and identification with such group of persons such that it is more likely than not that his or her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country.
(3)
Reasonableness of internal relocation.
For purposes of determinations under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, adjudicators should consider the totality of the relevant circumstances regarding an applicant's prospects for relocation, including the size of the country of nationality or last habitual residence, the geographic locus of the alleged persecution, the size, reach, or numerosity of the alleged persecutor, and the applicant's demonstrated ability to relocate to the United States in order to apply for withholding of removal.
(i) In cases in which the applicant has not established past persecution, the applicant shall bear the burden of establishing that it would not be reasonable for him or her to relocate, unless the persecutor is a government or is government-sponsored.
(ii) In cases in which the persecutor is a government or is government-sponsored, it shall be presumed that internal relocation would not be reasonable, unless the DHS establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate.
(iii) Regardless of whether an applicant has established persecution in the past, in cases in which the persecutor is not the government or a government-sponsored actor, or otherwise is a private actor, there shall be a presumption that internal relocation would be reasonable unless the applicant establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would be unreasonable to relocate.
(iv) For purposes of determinations under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, persecutors who are private actors, including persecutors who are gang members, public official who are not acting under color of law, or family members who are not themselves government officials or neighbors who are not themselves government officials, shall not be considered to be persecutors who are the government or government-sponsored absent evidence that the government sponsored the persecution.
(c)
Eligibility for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture.
(1) For purposes of regulations under Title II of the Act, “Convention Against Torture” shall refer to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, subject to any reservations, understandings, declarations, and provisos contained in the United States Senate resolution of ratification of the Convention, as implemented by section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Pub. L. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-821). The definition of torture contained in § 1208.18(a) of this part shall govern all decisions made under regulations under Title II of the Act about the applicability of Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture.
(2) The burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal under this paragraph to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.
(3) In assessing whether it is more likely than not that an applicant would be tortured in the proposed
country of removal, all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered, including, but not limited to:
(i) Evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant;
(ii) Evidence that the applicant could relocate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured;
(iii) Evidence of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal, where applicable; and
(iv) Other relevant information regarding conditions in the country of removal.
(4) In considering an application for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture, the immigration judge shall first determine whether the alien is more likely than not to be tortured in the country of removal. If the immigration judge determines that the alien is more likely than not to be tortured in the country of removal, the alien is entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture. Protection under the Convention Against Torture will be granted either in the form of withholding of removal or in the form of deferral of removal. An alien entitled to such protection shall be granted withholding of removal unless the alien is subject to mandatory denial of withholding of removal under paragraphs (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section. If an alien entitled to such protection is subject to mandatory denial of withholding of removal under paragraphs (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section, the alien's removal shall be deferred under § 1208.17(a).
(d)
Approval or denial of application
—(1)
General.
Subject to paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, an application for withholding of deportation or removal to a country of proposed removal shall be granted if the applicant's eligibility for withholding is established pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section.
(2)
Mandatory denials.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or under the Convention Against Torture shall be denied if the applicant falls within section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act or, for applications for withholding of deportation adjudicated in proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997, within section 243(h)(2) of the Act as it appeared prior to that date. For purposes of section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, or section 243(h)(2)(B) of the Act as it appeared prior to April 1, 1997, an alien who has been convicted of a particularly serious crime shall be considered to constitute a danger to the community. If the evidence indicates the applicability of one or more of the grounds for denial of withholding enumerated in the Act, the applicant shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.
(3)
Exception to the prohibition on withholding of deportation in certain cases.
Section 243(h)(3) of the Act, as added by section 413 of Pub. L. 104-132 (110 Stat. 1214), shall apply only to applications adjudicated in proceedings commenced before April 1, 1997, and in which final action had not been taken before April 24, 1996. The discretion permitted by that section to override section 243(h)(2) of the Act shall be exercised only in the case of an applicant convicted of an aggravated felony (or felonies) where he or she was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of less than 5 years and the immigration judge determines on an individual basis that the crime (or crimes) of which the applicant was convicted does not constitute a particularly serious crime. Nevertheless, it shall be presumed that an alien convicted of an aggravated felony has been convicted of a particularly serious crime. Except in the cases specified in this paragraph, the grounds for denial of withholding of deportation in section 243(h)(2) of the Act as it appeared prior to April 1, 1997, shall be deemed to comply with the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, T.I.A.S. No. 6577.
(e) [Reserved]
(f)
Removal to third country.
Nothing in this section or § 1208.17 shall prevent the Service from removing an alien to a third country other than the country
to which removal has been withheld or deferred.

If a communicable disease has triggered an ongoing declaration of a public health emergency under Federal law, such as under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 247d, or section 564 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3, then an alien is ineligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act and under the regulations issued pursuant to the legislation implementing the Convention Against Torture on the basis of there being reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States under section 241(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act if the alien—
(A) Exhibits symptoms indicating that he or she is afflicted with the disease, per guidance issued by the Secretary or the Attorney General, as appropriate; or
(B) Has come into contact with the disease within the number of days equivalent to the longest known incubation and contagion period for the disease, per guidance issued by the Secretary or the Attorney General, as appropriate.
(iii)
Danger to the public health caused by an epidemic outside of the United States.
If, regarding a communicable disease of public health significance as defined at 42 CFR 34.2(b), the Secretary and the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, have jointly—
(A) Determined that the physical presence in the United States of aliens who are coming from a country or countries (or one or more subdivisions or regions thereof), or have embarked at a place or places, where such disease is prevalent or epidemic (or had come from that country or countries (or one or more subdivisions or regions thereof), or had embarked at that place or places, during a period in which the disease was prevalent or epidemic there) would cause a danger to the public health in the United States; and
(B) Designated the foreign country or countries (or one or more subdivisions or regions thereof), or place or places, and the period of time or circumstances under which they jointly deem it necessary for the public health that aliens or classes of aliens described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section who are still within the number of days equivalent to the longest known incubation and contagion period for the disease be regarded as a danger to the security of the United States under section 241(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act, including any relevant exceptions as appropriate, then—
(C) An alien or class of aliens are ineligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act and under the regulations issued pursuant to the legislation implementing the Convention Against Torture on the basis of there being reasonable grounds for regarding the alien or class of aliens as a danger to the security of the United States under section 241(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act if the alien or class of aliens are described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section and are regarded as a danger to the security of the United States as provided for in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
(iv) The grounds for mandatory denial described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section shall not apply to an alien who is applying for asylum or withholding of removal in the United States upon return from Canada to the United States and pursuant to the Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of
Canada for Cooperation in the Examination of Refugee Status Claims from Nationals of Third Countries.
(f)
Removal to third country.
(1) Nothing in this section or § 1208.17 shall prevent the Department of Homeland Security from removing an alien requesting protection to a third country other than a country to which removal is currently withheld or deferred.
(2) If an alien requests withholding or deferral of removal to the applicable home country or another specific country, nothing in this section or § 1208.17 precludes the Department of Homeland Security from removing the alien to a third country prior to a determination or adjudication of the alien's initial request for withholding or deferral of removal if, after being notified of the identity of the prospective third country of removal and provided an opportunity to demonstrate that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured in that third country, the alien fails to establish that they are more likely than not to be tortured there. However, such a removal shall be executed only if the alien was:
(i) Advised at the time of requesting withholding or deferral of removal of the possibility of being removed to a third country prior to a determination or adjudication of the same under the conditions set forth in this paragraph, and
(ii) Provided, but did not accept, an opportunity to withdraw the request for withholding or deferral of removal in order to prevent such removal and, instead, proceed to removal pursuant to section 241(b) of the Act, as appropriate.
§ 1208.17
Deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture.
(a)
Grant of deferral of removal.
An alien who: has been ordered removed; has been found under § 1208.16(c)(3) to be entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture; and is subject to the provisions for mandatory denial of withholding of removal under § 1208.16(d)(2) or (d)(3), shall be granted deferral of removal to the country where he or she is more likely than not to be tortured.
(b)
Notice to alien.
(1) After an immigration judge orders an alien described in paragraph (a) of this section removed, the immigration judge shall inform the alien that his or her removal to the country where he or she is more likely than not to be tortured shall be deferred until such time as the deferral is terminated under this section. The immigration judge shall inform the alien that deferral of removal:
(i) Does not confer upon the alien any lawful or permanent immigration status in the United States;
(ii) Will not necessarily result in the alien being released from the custody of the Service if the alien is subject to such custody;
(iii) Is effective only until terminated; and
(iv) Is subject to review and termination if the immigration judge determines that it is not likely that the alien would be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred, or if the alien requests that deferral be terminated.
(2) The immigration judge shall also inform the alien that removal has been deferred only to the country in which it has been determined that the alien is likely to be tortured, and that the alien may be removed at any time to another country where he or she is not likely to be tortured.
(c)
Detention of an alien granted deferral of removal under this section.
Nothing in this section shall alter the authority of the Service to detain an alien whose removal has been deferred under this section and who is otherwise subject to detention. In the case of such an alien, decisions about the alien's release shall be made according to part 241 of this chapter.
(d)
Termination of deferral of removal.
(1) At any time while deferral of removal is in effect, the INS District Counsel for the District with jurisdiction over an alien whose removal has been deferred under paragraph (a) of this section may file a motion with the Immigration Court having administrative control pursuant to § 1003.11 of this chapter to schedule a hearing to consider whether deferral of removal should be terminated. The Service motion shall be granted if it is accompanied by evidence that is relevant to the possibility that the alien would be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred and that was not presented at the previous hearing. The Service motion shall not be subject to the requirements for reopening in §§ 3.2 and 3.23 of this chapter.
(2) The Immigration Court shall provide notice to the alien and the Service
of the time, place, and date of the termination hearing. Such notice shall inform the alien that the alien may supplement the information in his or her initial application for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture and shall provide that the alien must submit any such supplemental information within 10 calendar days of service of such notice (or 13 calendar days if service of such notice was by mail). At the expiration of this 10 or 13 day period, the Immigration Court shall forward a copy of the original application, and any supplemental information the alien or the Service has submitted, to the Department of State, together with notice to the Department of State of the time, place and date of the termination hearing. At its option, the Department of State may provide comments on the case, according to the provisions of § 1208.11 of this part.
(3) The immigration judge shall conduct a hearing and make a
de novo
determination, based on the record of proceeding and initial application in addition to any new evidence submitted by the Service or the alien, as to whether the alien is more likely than not to be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred. This determination shall be made under the standards for eligibility set out in § 1208.16(c). The burden is on the alien to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred.
(4) If the immigration judge determines that the alien is more likely than not to be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred, the order of deferral shall remain in place. If the immigration judge determines that the alien has not established that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred, the deferral of removal shall be terminated and the alien may be removed to that country. Appeal of the immigration judge's decision shall lie to the Board.
(e)
Termination at the request of the alien.
(1) At any time while deferral of removal is in effect, the alien may make a written request to the Immigration Court having administrative control pursuant to § 1003.11 of this chapter to terminate the deferral order. If satisfied on the basis of the written submission that the alien's request is knowing and voluntary, the immigration judge shall terminate the order of deferral and the alien may be removed.
(2) If necessary the immigration judge may calendar a hearing for the sole purpose of determining whether the alien's request is knowing and voluntary. If the immigration judge determines that the alien's request is knowing and voluntary, the order of deferral shall be terminated. If the immigration judge determines that the alien's request is not knowing and voluntary, the alien's request shall not serve as the basis for terminating the order of deferral.
(f)
Termination pursuant to § 1208.18(c).
At any time while deferral of removal is in effect, the Attorney General may determine whether deferral should be terminated based on diplomatic assurances forwarded by the Secretary of State pursuant to the procedures in § 1208.18(c).
[64 FR 8489, Feb. 19, 1999]
§ 1208.18
Implementation of the Convention Against Torture.
(a)
Definitions.
The definitions in this subsection incorporate the definition of torture contained in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture, subject to the reservations, understandings, declarations, and provisos contained in the United States Senate resolution of ratification of the Convention.
(1) Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official acting in an official capacity or other person acting in an official capacity. Pain
or suffering inflicted by a public official who is not acting under color of law shall not constitute pain or suffering inflicted by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official acting in an official capacity or other person acting in an official capacity, although a different public official acting in an official capacity or other person acting in an official capacity could instigate, consent to, or acquiesce in the pain or suffering inflicted by the public official who is not acting under color of law.
(2) Torture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.
(3) Torture does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. Lawful sanctions include judicially imposed sanctions and other enforcement actions authorized by law, including the death penalty, but do not include sanctions that defeat the object and purpose of the Convention Against Torture to prohibit torture.
(4) In order to constitute torture, mental pain or suffering must be prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from:
(i) The intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
(ii) The administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
(iii) The threat of imminent death; or
(iv) The threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the sense or personality.
(5) In order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering. An act that results in unanticipated or unintended severity of pain and suffering is not torture.
(6) In order to constitute torture an act must be directed against a person in the offender's custody or physical control.
(7) Acquiescence of a public official requires that the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity. Such awareness requires a finding of either actual knowledge or willful blindness. Willful blindness means that the public official acting in an official capacity or other person acting in an official capacity was aware of a high probability of activity constituting torture and deliberately avoided learning the truth; it is not enough that such public official acting in an official capacity or other person acting in an official capacity was mistaken, recklessly disregarded the truth, or negligently failed to inquire. In order for a public official to breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent activity constituting torture, the official must have been charged with preventing the activity as part of his or her duties and have failed to intervene. No person will be deemed to have breached a legal responsibility to intervene if such person is unable to intervene, or if the person intervenes but is unable to prevent the activity that constitutes torture.
(8) Noncompliance with applicable legal procedural standards does not
per se
constitute torture.
(b)
Applicability of §§ 1208.16(c) and 1208.17(a)
—(1)
Aliens in proceedings on or after March 22, 1999.
(i) An alien who is in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings on or after March 22, 1999, may apply for withholding of removal under § 1208.16(c), and, if applicable, may be considered for deferral of removal under § 1208.17(a).
(ii) In addition, an alien may apply for withholding of removal under 8 CFR 208.16(c), and, if applicable, may be considered for deferral of removal under 8 CFR 208.17(a), in the following situation: The alien is determined to be an applicant for admission under section 235(b)(1) of the Act, the alien is found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture, the alien's case is subsequently retained by or referred to USCIS pursuant to the jurisdiction
provided at 8 CFR 208.2(a)(1)(ii) to consider the application for asylum, and that application for asylum is not granted.
(2)
Aliens who were ordered removed, or whose removal orders became final, before March 22, 1999.
An alien under a final order of deportation, exclusion, or removal that became final prior to March 22, 1999 may move to reopen proceedings for the sole purpose of seeking protection under § 1208.16(c). Such motions shall be governed by §§ 1003.23 and 1003.2 of this chapter, except that the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen shall not apply and the alien shall not be required to demonstrate that the evidence sought to be offered was unavailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. The motion to reopen shall not be granted unless:
(i) The motion is filed within June 21, 1999; and
(ii) The evidence sought to be offered establishes a prima facie case that the applicant's removal must be withheld or deferred under §§ 1208.16(c) or 1208.17(a).
(3)
Aliens who, on March 22, 1999, have requests pending with the Service for protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture.
(i) Except as otherwise provided, after March 22, 1999, the Service will not:
(A) Consider, under its pre-regulatory administrative policy to ensure compliance with the Convention Against Torture, whether Article 3 of that Convention prohibits the removal of an alien to a particular country, or
(B) Stay the removal of an alien based on a request filed with the Service for protection under Article 3 of that Convention.
(ii) For each alien who, on or before March 22, 1999, filed a request with the Service for protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, and whose request has not been finally decided by the Service, the Service shall provide written notice that, after March 22, 1999, consideration for protection under Article 3 can be obtained only through the provisions of this rule.
(A) The notice shall inform an alien who is under an order of removal issued by EOIR that, in order to seek consideration of a claim under §§ 1208.16(c) or 1208.17(a), such an alien must file a motion to reopen with the immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals. This notice shall be accompanied by a stay of removal, effective until 30 days after service of the notice on the alien. A motion to reopen filed under this paragraph for the limited purpose of asserting a claim under §§ 1208.16(c) or 1208.17(a) shall not be subject to the requirements for reopening in §§ 1003.2 and 1003.23 of this chapter. Such a motion shall be granted if it is accompanied by a copy of the notice described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) or by other convincing evidence that the alien had a request pending with the Service for protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture on March 22, 1999. The filing of such a motion shall extend the stay of removal during the pendency of the adjudication of this motion.
(B) The notice shall inform an alien who is under an administrative order of removal issued by the Service under section 238(b) of the Act or an exclusion, deportation, or removal order reinstated by the Service under section 241(a)(5) of the Act that the alien's claim to withholding of removal under § 1208.16(c) or deferral of removal under § 1208.17(a) will be considered under § 1208.31.
(C) The notice shall inform an alien who is under an administrative order of removal issued by the Service under section 235(c) of the Act that the alien's claim to protection under the Convention Against Torture will be decided by the Service as provided in § 1208.18(d) and 1235.8(b)(4) and will not be considered under the provisions of this part relating to consideration or review by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or an asylum officer.
(4)
Aliens whose claims to protection under the Convention Against Torture were finally decided by the Service prior to March 22, 1999.
Sections 208.16(c) and 208.17 (a) and paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section do not apply to cases in which, prior to March 22, 1999, the Service has made a final administrative determination about the applicability of Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture to the case of an alien
who filed a request with the Service for protection under Article 3. If, prior to March 22, 1999, the Service determined that an applicant cannot be removed consistent with the Convention Against Torture, the alien shall be considered to have been granted withholding of removal under § 1208.16(c), unless the alien is subject to mandatory denial of withholding of removal under § 1208.16(d)(2) or (d)(3), in which case the alien will be considered to have been granted deferral of removal under 208.17(a). If, prior to March 22, 1999, the Service determined that an alien can be removed consistent with the Convention Against Torture, the alien will be considered to have been finally denied withholding of removal under § 1208.16(c) and deferral of removal under § 1208.17(a).
(c)
Diplomatic assurances against torture obtained by the Secretary of State.
(1) The Secretary of State may forward to the Attorney General assurances that the Secretary has obtained from the government of a specific country that an alien would not be tortured there if the alien were removed to that country.
(2) If the Secretary of State forwards assurances described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to the Attorney General for consideration by the Attorney General or her delegates under this paragraph, the Attorney General shall determine, in consultation with the Secretary of State, whether the assurances are sufficiently reliable to allow the alien's removal to that country consistent with Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. The Attorney General's authority under this paragraph may be exercised by the Deputy Attorney General or by the Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service, but may not be further delegated.
(3) Once assurances are provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the alien's claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture shall not be considered further by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or an asylum officer.
(d)
Cases involving aliens ordered removed under section 235(c) of the Act.
With respect to an alien terrorist or other alien subject to administrative removal under section 235(c) of the Act who requests protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, the Service will assess the applicability of Article 3 through the removal process to ensure that a removal order will not be executed under circumstances that would violate the obligations of the United States under Article 3. In such cases, the provisions of Part 208 relating to consideration or review by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or an asylum officer shall not apply.
(e)
Judicial review of claims for protection from removal under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture.
(1) Pursuant to the provisions of section 2242(d) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, there shall be no judicial appeal or review of any action, decision, or claim raised under the Convention or that section, except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section 242 of the Act; provided however, that any appeal or petition regarding an action, decision, or claim under the Convention or under section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 shall not be deemed to include or authorize the consideration of any administrative order or decision, or portion thereof, the appeal or review of which is restricted or prohibited by the Act.
(2) Except as otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a private right of action or to authorize the consideration or issuance of administrative or judicial relief.

§ 1208.19
[Reserved]
§ 1208.20
Determining if an asylum application is frivolous.
(a) For applications filed on or after April 1, 1997, and before January 11, 2021, an applicant is subject to the provisions of section 208(d)(6) of the Act only if the alien received the notice required by section 208(d)(4)(A) of the Act and a final order by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals specifically finds that the alien
knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application. An application is frivolous if:
(1) Any of the material elements in the asylum application is deliberately fabricated, and the immigration judge or the Board is satisfied that the applicant, during the course of the proceedings, has had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.
(2) Paragraphs (b) through (f) shall only apply to applications filed on or after January 11, 2021.
(b) For applications filed on or after January 11, 2021, an asylum officer may determine that the applicant knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application and may refer the applicant to an immigration judge on that basis, so long as the applicant has received the notice required by section 208(d)(4)(A) of the Act. For applications referred to an immigration judge, an asylum officer's determination that an application is frivolous will not render an applicant permanently ineligible for immigration benefits unless an immigration judge or the Board makes a finding of frivolousness as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) For applications filed on or after January 11, 2021, an asylum application is frivolous if it:
(1) Contains a fabricated material element;
(2) Is premised upon false or fabricated evidence unless the application would have been granted without the false or fabricated evidence;
(3) Is filed without regard to the merits of the claim; or
(4) Is clearly foreclosed by applicable law.
(d) If the alien has been provided the warning required by section 208(d)(4)(A) of the Act, he or she need not be given any additional or further opportunity to account for any issues with his or her claim prior to the entry of a frivolousness finding.
(e) An asylum application may be found frivolous even if it was untimely filed.
(f) A withdrawn asylum application may be found frivolous unless:
(1) The alien wholly disclaims the application and withdraws it with prejudice;
(2) The alien is eligible for and agrees to accept voluntary departure for a period of no more than 30 days pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Act;
(3) The alien withdraws any and all other applications for relief or protection with prejudice; and
(4) The alien waives his right to appeal and any rights to file, for any reason, a motion to reopen or reconsider.
(g) For purposes of this section, a finding that an alien filed a knowingly frivolous asylum application shall not preclude the alien from seeking withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or protection under the regulations issued pursuant to the Convention Against Torture's implementing legislation.
[85 FR 80398, Dec. 11, 2020]
§ 1208.21
Admission of the asylee's spouse and children.
(a)
Eligibility.
In accordance with section 208(b)(3) of the Act, a spouse, as defined in section 101(a)(35) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(35), or child, as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act, also may be granted asylum if accompanying, or following to join, the principal alien who was granted asylum, unless it is determined that the spouse or child is ineligible for asylum under section 208(b)(2)(A)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of the Act for applications filed on or after April 1, 1997, or under § 1208.13(c)(2)(i)(A), (C), (D), (E), or (F) for applications filed before April 1, 1997.
(b)
Relationship.
The relationship of spouse and child as defined in sections 101(a)(35) and 101(b)(1) of the Act must have existed at the time the principal alien's asylum application was approved and must continue to exist at the time of filing for accompanying or following-to-join benefits and at the time of the spouse or child's subsequent admission to the United States. If the asylee proves that the asylee is the parent of a child who was born after asylum was granted, but who was
in utero
on the date of the asylum grant, the child shall be eligible to accompany or follow-to-join the asylee. The child's mother, if not the principal asylee, shall not be eligible to accompany or follow-to-join the principal asylee unless the child's mother was
the principal asylee's spouse on the date the principal asylee was granted asylum.
(c)
Spouse or child in the United States.
When a spouse or child of an alien granted asylum is in the United States, but was not included in the asylee's application, the asylee may request accompanying or following-to-join benefits for his/her spouse or child by filing for each qualifying family member a separate Form I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition, and supporting evidence, with the designated Service office, regardless of the status of that spouse or child in the United States. A recent photograph of each derivative must accompany the Form I-730. The photograph must clearly identify the derivative, and will be made part of the derivative's immigration record for identification purposes. Additionally, a separate Form I-730 must be filed by the asylee for each qualifying family member before February 28, 2000, or within 2 years of the date in which he/she was granted asylum status, whichever is later, unless it is determined by the Service that this period should be extended for humanitarian reasons. Upon approval of the Form I-730, the Service will notify the asylee of such approval on Form I-797, Notice of Action. Employment will be authorized incident to status. To demonstrate employment authorization, the Service will issue a Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, which also reflects the derivative's current status as an asylee, or the derivative may apply under § 274a.12(a) of this chapter, using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and a copy of the Form I-797. The approval of the Form I-730 shall remain valid for the duration of the relationship to the asylee and, in the case of a child, while the child is under 21 years of age and unmarried, provided also that the principal's status has not been revoked. However, the approved Form I-730 will cease to confer immigration benefits after it has been used by the beneficiary for admission to the United States as a derivative of an asylee.
(d)
Spouse or child outside the United States.
When a spouse or child of an alien granted asylum is outside the United States, the asylee may request accompanying or following-to-join benefits for his/her spouse or child(ren) by filing a separate Form I-730 for each qualifying family member with the designated Service office, setting forth the full name, relationship, date and place of birth, and current location of each such person. A recent photograph of each derivative must accompany the Form I-730. The photograph must clearly identify the derivative, and will be made part of the derivative's immigration record for identification purposes. A separate Form I-730 for each qualifying family member must be filed before February 28, 2000, or within 2 years of the date in which the asylee was granted asylum status, whichever is later, unless the Service determines that the filing period should be extended for humanitarian reasons. When the Form I-730 is approved, the Service will notify the asylee of such approval on Form I-797. The approved Form I-730 shall be forwarded by the Service to the Department of State for delivery to the American Embassy or Consulate having jurisdiction over the area in which the asylee's spouse or child is located. The approval of the Form I-730 shall remain valid for the duration of the relationship to the asylee and, in the case of a child, while the child is under 21 years of age and unmarried, provided also that the principal's status has not been revoked. However, the approved Form I-730 will cease to confer immigration benefits after it has been used by the beneficiary for admission to the United States as a derivative of an asylee.
(e)
Denial.
If the spouse or child is found to be ineligible for the status accorded under section 208(c) of the Act, a written notice stating the basis for denial shall be forwarded to the principal alien. No appeal shall lie from this decision.
(f)
Burden of proof.
To establish the claimed relationship of spouse or child as defined in sections 101(a)(35) and 101(b)(1) of the Act, evidence must be submitted with the request as set forth in part 204 of this chapter. Where possible this will consist of the documents specified in § 204.2 (a)(1)(i)(B), (a)(1)(iii)(B), (a)(2), (d)(2), and (d)(5) of 8 CFR chapter I. The burden of proof is on the principal alien to establish by a
preponderance of the evidence that any person on whose behalf he or she is making a request under this section is an eligible spouse or child.
(g)
Duration.
The spouse or child qualifying under section 208(c) of the Act shall be granted asylum for an indefinite period unless the principal's status is revoked.

Effect on exclusion, deportation, and removal proceedings.
An alien who has been granted asylum may not be deported or removed unless asylum status is terminated pursuant to 8 CFR 208.24 or § 1208.24. An alien in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings who is granted withholding of removal or deportation, or deferral of removal, may not be deported or removed to the country to which his or her deportation or removal is ordered withheld or deferred unless the withholding order is terminated pursuant to 8 CFR 208.24 or § 1208.24 or deferral is terminated pursuant to 8 CFR 208.17 or § 1208.17(d) or (e).

§ 1208.24
Termination of asylum or withholding of removal or deportation.
(a)
Termination of asylum by the Service.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, an asylum officer may terminate a grant of asylum made under the jurisdiction of an asylum officer or a district director if following an interview, the asylum officer determines that:
(1) There is a showing of fraud in the alien's application such that he or she was not eligible for asylum at the time it was granted;
(2) As to applications filed on or after April 1, 1997, one or more of the conditions described in section 208(c)(2) of the Act exist; or
(3) As to applications filed before April 1, 1997, the alien no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution upon return due to a change of country conditions in the alien's country of nationality or habitual residence or the alien has committed any act that would have been grounds for denial of asylum under § 1208.13(c)(2).
(b)
Termination of withholding of deportation or removal by the Service.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, an asylum officer may terminate a grant of withholding of deportation or removal made under the jurisdiction of an asylum officer or a district director if the asylum officer determines, following an interview, that:
(1) The alien is no longer entitled to withholding of deportation or removal because, owing to a fundamental change in circumstances relating to the original claim, the alien's life or freedom no longer would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion in the country from which deportation or removal was withheld.
(2) There is a showing of fraud in the alien's application such that the alien was not eligible for withholding of removal at the time it was granted;
(3) The alien has committed any other act that would have been grounds for denial of withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act had it occurred prior to the grant of withholding of removal; or
(4) For applications filed in proceedings commenced before April 1, 1997, the alien has committed any act that would have been grounds for denial of withholding of deportation under section 243(h)(2) of the Act.
(c)
Procedure.
Prior to the termination of a grant of asylum or withholding of deportation or removal, the alien shall be given notice of intent to terminate, with the reasons therefor, at least 30 days prior to the interview specified in paragraph (a) of this section before an asylum officer. The alien
shall be provided the opportunity to present evidence showing that he or she is still eligible for asylum or withholding of deportation or removal. If the asylum officer determines that the alien is no longer eligible for asylum or withholding of deportation or removal, the alien shall be given written notice that asylum status or withholding of deportation or removal and any employment authorization issued pursuant thereto, are terminated.
(d)
Termination of derivative status.
The termination of asylum status for a person who was the principal applicant shall result in termination of the asylum status of a spouse or child whose status was based on the asylum application of the principal. Such termination shall not preclude the spouse or child of such alien from separately asserting an asylum or withholding of deportation or removal claim.
(e)
Removal proceedings.
When an alien's asylum status or withholding of removal or deportation is terminated under this section, the Service shall initiate removal proceedings, as appropriate, if the alien is not already in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings. Removal proceedings may take place in conjunction with a termination hearing scheduled under § 1208.24(f).
(f)
Termination of asylum, or withholding of deportation or removal, by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals.
An immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals may reopen a case pursuant to § 3.2 or § 3.23 of this chapter for the purpose of terminating a grant of asylum, or a withholding of deportation or removal. In such a reopened proceeding, the Service must establish, by a preponderance of evidence, one or more of the grounds set forth in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. In addition, an immigration judge may terminate a grant of asylum, or a withholding of deportation or removal, made under the jurisdiction of the Service at any time after the alien has been provided a notice of intent to terminate by the Service. Any termination under this paragraph may occur in conjunction with an exclusion, deportation, or removal proceeding.
(g)
Termination of asylum for arriving aliens.
If the Service determines that an applicant for admission who had previously been granted asylum in the United States falls within conditions set forth in § 1208.24 and is inadmissible, the Service shall issue a notice of intent to terminate asylum and initiate removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act. The alien shall present his or her response to the intent to terminate during proceedings before the immigration judge.

# Subpart B—Credible Fear of Persecution
§ 1208.30
Credible fear determinations involving stowaways and applicants for admission who are found inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act.
(a)
Jurisdiction.
The provisions of this subpart apply to aliens subject to sections 235(a)(2) and 235(b)(1) of the Act. Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act, DHS has exclusive jurisdiction to make the determinations described in this subpart. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section are the exclusive procedures applicable to stowaways and applicants for admission who are found inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act and who receive fear interviews, determinations, and reviews under section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act. Prior to January 1, 2030, an alien physically present in or arriving in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is ineligible to apply for asylum and
may only establish eligibility for withholding of removal pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding or deferral of removal under the regulations in §§ 1208.16(c) through (f), 1208.17, and 1208.18 issued pursuant to the Convention Against Torture's implementing legislation.
(b)
Treatment of dependents.
A spouse or child of an alien may be included in that alien's fear evaluation and determination, if such spouse or child:
(1) Arrived in the United States concurrently with the principal alien; and
(2)
Desires to be included in the principal alien's determination.
However, any alien may have his or her evaluation and determination made separately, if he or she expresses such a desire.
(c)-(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Determination.
For the standards and procedures for asylum officers in conducting credible fear interviews, and in making positive and negative credible fear determinations, see 8 CFR 208.30. The immigration judges will review such determinations as provided in paragraph (g) of this section and §§ 1003.42 and 1240.17 of this chapter.
(f) [Reserved]
(g)
Procedures for negative fear determinations.
(1) [Reserved]
(2)
Review by immigration judge of a negative credible fear finding.
(i) The asylum officer's negative decision regarding credible fear shall be subject to review by an immigration judge upon the applicant's request, or upon the applicant's refusal or failure either to request or to decline the review after being given such opportunity, in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III) of the Act. The immigration judge shall not have the authority to remand the case to the asylum officer.
(ii) The record of the negative credible fear determination, including copies of the Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, the asylum officer's notes, the summary of the material facts, and other materials upon which the determination was based shall be provided to the immigration judge with the negative determination.
(iii) A credible fear hearing will be closed to the public unless the alien states for the record or submits a written statement that the alien is waiving that requirement; in that event the hearing shall be open to the public, subject to the immigration judge's discretion as provided in § 1003.27 of this chapter.
(iv) Upon review of the asylum officer's negative credible fear determination:
(A) If the immigration judge concurs with the determination of the asylum officer that the alien does not have a credible fear of persecution or torture, the case shall be returned to DHS for removal of the alien. The immigration judge's decision is final and may not be appealed. USCIS may nevertheless reconsider a negative credible fear finding as provided at 8 CFR 208.30(g)(1)(i).
(B) If the immigration judge finds that the alien, other than an alien stowaway, possesses a credible fear of persecution or torture, the immigration judge shall vacate the Notice and Order of Expedited Removal and refer the case back to DHS for further proceedings consistent with § 1208.2(a)(1)(ii). Alternatively, DHS may commence removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, during which time the alien may file an application for asylum and withholding of removal in accordance with § 1208.4(b)(3)(i).
(C) If the immigration judge finds that an alien stowaway possesses a credible fear of persecution or torture, the alien shall be allowed to file an application for asylum and withholding of removal before the immigration judge in accordance with § 1208.4(b)(3)(iii). The immigration judge shall decide the application as provided in that section. Such decision may be appealed by either the stowaway or DHS to the Board of Immigration Appeals. If a denial of the application for asylum and for withholding of removal becomes final, the alien shall be removed from the United States in accordance with section 235(a)(2) of the Act. If an approval of the application
for asylum or for withholding of removal becomes final, DHS shall terminate removal proceedings under section 235(a)(2) of the Act.

# Effective Date Note:
At 85 FR 84197, Dec. 23, 2020, § 1208.30 was amended by revising paragraphs (e), (g)(1)(ii), (g)(2)(i), and (g)(2)(iv)(A) and (B), effective Jan. 22, 2021.

For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
§ 1208.30
Credible fear determinations of persecution, reasonable possibility of persecution, and reasonable possibility of torture determinations involving stowaways and applicants for admission who are found inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act, whose entry is limited or suspended under section 212(f) or 215(a)(1) of the Act, or who failed to apply for protection from persecution in a third country where potential relief is available while en route to the United States.
(e)
Determination.
For the standards and procedures for asylum officers in conducting credible fear of persecution, reasonable possibility of persecution, and reasonable possibility of torture interviews, and interviews to determine whether an alien has established that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured in the prospective country of removal, and in making positive and negative fear determinations, see 8 CFR 208.30. The immigration judges will review such determinations as provided in paragraph (g) of this section and 8 CFR 1003.42.
(g) * * *
(1) * * *
(ii) If the alien is determined to be an alien described as ineligible for asylum in 8 CFR 208.13(c)(4) or 8 CFR 1208.13(c)(4) and is determined to lack a reasonable possibility of persecution or torture under 8 CFR 208.30(e)(5)(iii), the immigration judge shall first review de novo the determination that the alien is described as ineligible for asylum in 8 CFR 208.13(c)(4) or 8 CFR 1208.13(c)(4). If the immigration judge finds that the alien is not described as ineligible for asylum in 8 CFR 208.13(c)(4) or 8 CFR 1208.13(c)(4), then, except as provided in 8 CFR 208.30(e)(iv), the immigration judge shall vacate the order of the asylum officer, and DHS may commence asylum-and-withholding-only proceedings under 8 CFR 1208.2(c)(1). If the immigration judge concurs with the determination that the alien is an alien described as ineligible for asylum in 8 CFR 208.13(c)(4) or 8 CFR 1208.13(c)(4), the immigration judge will then review the asylum officer's negative decision regarding reasonable possibility made under 8 CFR 208.30(e)(5) and regarding whether the alien has established that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured in the prospective country of removal, consistent with paragraph (g)(2) of this section, except that the immigration judge will review the fear of persecution or torture findings under the reasonable possibility standard, and the determination that the alien has not established that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured in the prospective country of removal under the more likely than not standard, instead of the credible fear of persecution standard described in paragraph (g)(2).
(2) * * *
(i) The asylum officer's negative decision regarding a credible fear of persecution, reasonable possibility of persecution, reasonable possibility of torture, and whether the alien has established that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured in the prospective country of removal shall be subject to review by an immigration judge upon the applicant's request, in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III) of the Act. If the alien refuses to make an indication, DHS will consider such a response as a decision to decline review.
(iv) * * *
(A) If the immigration judge concurs with the determination of the asylum officer that the alien has not established a credible fear of persecution, reasonable possibility of persecution, reasonable possibility of torture, or that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured in the prospective country of removal, except as provided in § 208.30(e)(5)(iii) and (iv), the case shall be returned to DHS for removal of the alien. The immigration judge's decision is final and may not be appealed.
(B) If the immigration judge finds that the alien, other than an alien stowaway, establishes a credible fear of persecution, reasonable possibility of persecution, reasonable possibility of torture, or that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured in the
prospective country of removal, the immigration judge shall, except as provided in § 208.30(e)(5)(iii) and (iv), vacate the Notice and Order of Expedited Removal and DHS may commence asylum-and-withholding-only proceedings under 8 CFR 1208.2(c)(1), during which time the alien may file an application for asylum and for withholding of removal in accordance with 8 CFR 1208.4(b)(3)(i). Such application shall be considered de novo in all respects by an immigration judge regardless of any determination made under this paragraph.
§ 1208.31
Reasonable fear of persecution or torture determinations involving noncitizens ordered removed under section 238(b) of the Act and noncitizens whose removal is reinstated under section 241(a)(5) of the Act.
(a)
Jurisdiction.
This section shall apply to any noncitizen ordered removed under section 238(b) of the Act or whose deportation, exclusion, or removal order is reinstated under section 241(a)(5) of the Act who, in the course of the administrative removal or reinstatement process, expresses a fear of returning to the country of removal. The Service has exclusive jurisdiction to make reasonable fear determinations, and EOIR has exclusive jurisdiction to review such determinations.
(b)-(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Referral to Immigration Judge.
If an asylum officer determines that a noncitizen described in this section has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, the officer shall so inform the noncitizen and issue a Form I-863, Notice of Referral to the Immigration Judge, for full consideration of the request for withholding of removal only. Such cases shall be adjudicated by the immigration judge in accordance with the provisions of § 1208.16. Appeal of the immigration judge's decision shall lie to the Board of Immigration Appeals.
(f)
Removal of noncitizens with no reasonable fear of persecution or torture.
If the asylum officer determines that the noncitizen has not established a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, the asylum officer shall inform the noncitizen in writing of the decision and shall inquire whether the noncitizen wishes to have an immigration judge review the negative decision, using the Record of Negative Reasonable Fear Finding and Request for Review by Immigration Judge, on which the noncitizen must indicate whether he or she desires such review. If the noncitizen refuses to make an indication, DHS shall consider such a response as a decision to decline review.
(g)
Review by immigration judge.
The asylum officer's negative decision regarding reasonable fear shall be subject to de novo review by an immigration judge upon the noncitizen's request. The immigration judge's review shall, where relevant, include review of the asylum officer's application of any bars to withholding of removal pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31(c). If the noncitizen requests review of the asylum officer's negative decision regarding reasonable fear, the asylum officer shall serve the noncitizen with a Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge. The record of determination, including copies of the Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, the asylum officer's notes, the summary of the material facts, and other materials upon which the determination was based shall be provided to the immigration judge with the negative determination. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, such review shall be conducted by the immigration judge within 10 days of the filing of the Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, and the complete record of determination with the immigration court. Upon review of the asylum officer's negative reasonable fear determination:
(1) If the immigration judge concurs with the asylum officer's determination that the noncitizen does not have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, the case shall be returned to DHS for removal of the noncitizen. No appeal shall lie from the immigration judge's decision.
(2) If the immigration judge finds that the noncitizen has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, the noncitizen may submit an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. Such application shall be considered de novo in all respects by an immigration judge regardless of any determination made under this paragraph.
(i) The immigration judge shall consider only the noncitizen's application for withholding of removal under 8 CFR 1208.16 and shall determine whether the noncitizen's removal to the country of removal must be withheld or deferred.
(ii) Appeal of the immigration judge's decision whether removal must be withheld or deferred lies with the Board of Immigration Appeals. If the noncitizen or DHS appeals the immigration judge's decision, the Board shall review only the immigration judge's decision regarding the noncitizen's eligibility for withholding or deferral of removal under 8 CFR 1208.16.

88 FR 31451, May 16, 2023, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1208.33
Lawful pathways condition on asylum eligibility.
Notwithstanding any contrary section of this part, including §§ 1208.2, 1208.13, and 1208.30—
(a)
Condition on eligibility
—(1)
Applicability.
A rebuttable presumption of ineligibility for asylum applies to a noncitizen who enters the United States from Mexico at the southwest land border or adjacent coastal borders without documents sufficient for lawful admission as described in section 212(a)(7) of the Act and whose entry was:
(i) Between May 11, 2023, and May 11, 2025,
(ii) Subsequent to the end of implementation of the Title 42 public health Order issued on August 2, 2021, and related prior orders issued pursuant to the authorities in sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 265, 268) and the implementing regulation at 42 CFR 71.40, and
(iii) After the noncitizen traveled through a country other than the noncitizen's country of citizenship, nationality, or, if stateless, last habitual residence, that is a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.
(2)
Exceptions to applicability of the rebuttable presumption.
The rebuttable presumption described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply if:
(i) The noncitizen was, at the time of entry, an unaccompanied child as defined in 8 CFR 1001.1(hh); or
(ii) The noncitizen, or a member of the noncitizen's family as described in § 208.30(c) with whom the noncitizen is traveling:
(A) Was provided appropriate authorization to travel to the United States to seek parole, pursuant to a DHS-approved parole process;
(B) Presented at a port of entry, pursuant to a pre-scheduled time and place, or presented at a port of entry without a pre-scheduled time and place, if the noncitizen demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that it was not possible to access or use the DHS scheduling system due to language barrier, illiteracy, significant technical failure, or other ongoing and serious obstacle; or
(C) Sought asylum or other protection in a country through which the noncitizen traveled and received a final decision denying that application. A final decision includes any denial by a foreign government of the applicant's claim for asylum or other protection through one or more of that government's pathways for that claim. A final decision does not include a determination by a foreign government that the noncitizen abandoned the claim.
(3)
Rebuttal of the presumption.
(i) The presumption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section can be rebutted if a noncitizen demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that exceptionally compelling circumstances exist, including if the noncitizen demonstrates that, at the time of entry, the noncitizen or a member of the noncitizen's family as described in § 208.30(c) with whom the noncitizen is traveling:
(A) Faced an acute medical emergency;
(B) Faced an imminent and extreme threat to life or safety, such as an imminent threat of rape, kidnapping, torture, or murder; or
(C) Satisfied the definition of “victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons” provided in 8 CFR 214.201.
(ii) A noncitizen who demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence any of the circumstances in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall necessarily rebut the presumption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b)
Application in credible fear determinations.
(1) Where an asylum officer has issued a negative credible fear determination pursuant to 8 CFR 208.33(b), and the noncitizen has requested immigration judge review of that credible fear determination, the immigration judge shall evaluate the case de novo, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In all cases under paragraph (b)(2), the immigration judge's review shall, where relevant, include review of the asylum officer's application of any bars to withholding of removal pursuant to 8 CFR 208.33(b)(2). In doing so, the immigration judge shall take into account the credibility of the statements made by the noncitizen in support of the noncitizen's claim and such other facts as are known to the immigration judge.
(2) The immigration judge shall first determine whether the noncitizen is covered by the presumption at 8 CFR 208.33(a)(1) and 1208.33(a)(1) and, if so, whether the noncitizen has rebutted the presumption in accordance with 8 CFR 208.33(a)(3) and 1208.33(a)(3).
(i) Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen is not covered by the presumption, or that the presumption has been rebutted, the immigration judge shall further determine, consistent with § 1208.30, whether the noncitizen has established a significant possibility of eligibility for asylum under section 208 of the Act, or has established a significant possibility of eligibility for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture with respect to the country or countries of removal identified by DHS pursuant to section 241(b) of the Act. Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen has established a significant possibility of eligibility for one of those forms of relief or protection, the immigration judge shall issue a positive credible fear finding. Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen has not established a significant possibility of eligibility for any of those forms of relief or protection, the immigration judge shall issue a negative credible fear finding.
(ii) Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen is covered by the presumption and that the presumption has not been rebutted, the immigration judge shall further determine whether the noncitizen has established a reasonable possibility of persecution (meaning a reasonable possibility of being persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group) or torture with respect to the country or countries of removal identified by DHS pursuant to section 241(b) of the Act. Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen has established a reasonable possibility of persecution or torture, the immigration judge shall issue a positive credible fear finding. Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen has not established a reasonable possibility of persecution or torture, the immigration judge shall issue a negative credible fear finding.
(3) Following the immigration judge's determination, the case will proceed as indicated in 8 CFR 208.33(b)(2)(v)(A) through (C).
(4) If, under 8 CFR 208.33(b)(2), DHS issues a Form I-862, Notice to Appear, to commence removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, the noncitizen may apply for asylum, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture, or any other form of relief or protection for which the noncitizen is eligible during those removal proceedings.
(c)
Family unity and removal proceedings.
In removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, where a principal asylum applicant is eligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding of
removal under § 1208.16(c)(2) and would be granted asylum but for the presumption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and where an accompanying spouse or child as defined in section 208(b)(3)(A) of the Act does not independently qualify for asylum or other protection from removal or the principal asylum applicant has a spouse or child who would be eligible to follow to join that applicant as described in section 208(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the presumption shall be deemed rebutted as an exceptionally compelling circumstance in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(d)
Continuing applicability of condition on eligibility.
(1) Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the condition on asylum eligibility in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall apply to any asylum application filed by a noncitizen who entered the United States during the time and in the manner specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and who is not covered by an exception in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, regardless of when the application is filed and adjudicated.
(2) The conditions on asylum eligibility in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to an asylum application filed by a noncitizen described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the asylum application is filed after May 11, 2025, the noncitizen was under the age of 18 at the time of the entry referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and the noncitizen is applying for asylum as a principal applicant.
(e)
Severability.
The Department intends that any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, should be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, unless such holding is that the provision is wholly invalid and unenforceable, in which event the provision should be severed from the remainder of this section and the holding should not affect the remainder of this section or the application of the provision to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances.

A noncitizen who is described in § 1208.13(g) and who is not described in section 3(b) of the Presidential Proclamation of June 3, 2024, as defined in 8 CFR 1208.13(h) is ineligible for asylum.
(2)
Exceptions.
(i) This limitation on eligibility does not apply if the noncitizen demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that exceptionally compelling circumstances exist, including if the noncitizen, or the noncitizen's family member as described in 8 CFR 208.30(c) with whom the noncitizen is traveling, demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time of entry, the noncitizen or a member of the noncitizen's family as described in § 208.30(c) with whom the noncitizen is traveling:
(A) Faced an acute medical emergency;
(B) Faced an imminent and extreme threat to life or safety, such as an imminent threat of rape, kidnapping, torture, or murder; or
(C) Satisfied the definition of “victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons” provided in § 214.201 of this title.
(ii) A noncitizen who demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence any of the circumstances in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section shall necessarily establish exceptionally compelling circumstances.
(iii) A noncitizen described in section 3(b) of the Presidential Proclamation of June 3, 2024, as defined in 8 CFR 1208.13(h) or who establishes exceptionally compelling circumstances under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section has established exceptionally compelling circumstances under § 1208.33(a)(3).
(b)
Application in credible fear determinations.
(1) Where an asylum officer has issued a negative credible fear determination pursuant to 8 CFR 208.35(b), and the noncitizen has requested immigration judge review of that credible fear determination, the immigration judge shall evaluate the case de novo, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In doing so, the immigration judge shall take into account the credibility of the statements made by the noncitizen in support of the noncitizen's claim and such other facts as are known to the immigration judge.
(2) The immigration judge shall first determine whether the noncitizen is subject to the limitation on asylum eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section.
(i) Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen is not subject to the limitation on asylum eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section because the noncitizen is not described in § 1208.13(g), the immigration judge shall follow the procedures in § 1208.33(b).
(ii) Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen is not subject to the limitation on asylum eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section because the noncitizen is described in section 3(b) of the Presidential Proclamation of June 3, 2024, as defined in 8 CFR 1208.13(h) or is excepted from the limitation on asylum eligibility under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the immigration judge shall follow the procedures in § 1208.30.
(iii) Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen is subject to the limitation on asylum eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section, the immigration judge shall assess the noncitizen under the procedures set forth in § 1208.33(b)(2)(ii) except that the immigration judge shall apply a reasonable probability standard. For purposes of this section,
reasonable probability
means substantially more than a reasonable possibility, but somewhat less than more likely than not.
(3) Following the immigration judge's determination, the case will proceed as indicated in 8 CFR 208.35(b)(2)(v)(A) and (B).
(4) If the limitation on asylum eligibility in paragraph (a) of this section is held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, then during the period(s) described in § 1208.13(g), the immigration judge shall, as applicable, apply a reasonable probability screening standard for any protection screening under § 1208.33(b)(2)(ii).
(c)
Family unity and removal proceedings.
In removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, where a principal asylum applicant is found eligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding of removal under § 1208.16(c)(2) and would be granted asylum but for the limitation on asylum eligibility in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or § 1208.33(a), or both, and where an accompanying spouse or child as defined in section 208(b)(3)(A) of the Act does not independently qualify for asylum or other protection from removal or the principal asylum applicant has a spouse or child who would be eligible to follow to join that applicant as described in section 208(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the noncitizen shall be deemed to have established exceptionally compelling circumstances under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and § 1208.33(a)(3)(i).
(d)
Continuing applicability of limitation on eligibility.
(1) Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the limitation on asylum eligibility in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to any asylum application filed by a noncitizen who entered the United States during the time and in the manner described in § 1208.13(g) and who is not covered by an exception in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, regardless of when the application is filed and adjudicated.
(2) The limitation on asylum eligibility in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to a noncitizen who was under the age of 18 at the time of the noncitizen's entry, if—
(i) The noncitizen is applying for asylum as a principal applicant; and
(ii) The asylum application is filed after the period of time in 1208.13(g) during which the noncitizen entered.
(e)
Severability.
The Department intends that in the event that any provision of this section or the Presidential Proclamation of June 3, 2024, as defined in 8 CFR 1208.13(h) is held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, the provisions of this section should be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to those provisions permitted by law, unless such holding is that a provision is wholly invalid and unenforceable, in which event the provision should be severed from the remainder of this section and the holding should not affect the remainder of this section or the application of the provision to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances.

§ 1209.1
Adjustment of status of refugees.
The provisions of this section shall provide the sole and exclusive procedure for adjustment of status by a refugee admitted under section 207 of the Act whose application is based on his or her refugee status.
(a)
Eligibility.
(1) Every alien in the United States who is classified as a refugee under part 207 of this chapter, whose status has not been terminated, is required to apply to the Service 1 year after entry in order for the Service to determine his or her admissibility under section 212 of the Act.
(2) Every alien processed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service abroad and paroled into the United States as a refugee after April 1, 1980, and before May 18, 1980, shall be considered as having entered the United States as a refugee under section 207(a) of the Act.
(b)
Application.
Upon admission to the United States, every refugee entrant shall be notified of the requirement to submit an application for permanent residence 1 year after entry. An application for the benefits of section 209(a) of the Act shall be filed on Form I-485, without fee, with the director of the appropriate Service office identified in the instructions which accompany the Form I-485. A separate application must be filed by each alien. Every applicant who is 14 years of age or older must submit a completed Form G-325A (Biographical Information) with the Form I-485 application. Following submission of the Form I-485 application, a refugee entrant who is 14 years of age or older will be required to execute a Form FD-258 (Applicant Fingerprint Card) at such time and place as the Service will designate.
(c)
Medical examination.
A refugee seeking adjustment of status under section 209(a) of the Act is not required to repeat the medical examination performed under § 207.2(c) of chapter I, unless there were medical grounds of inadmissibility applicable at the time of admission. The refugee is, however, required to establish compliance with the vaccination requirements described under section 212(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, by submitting with the adjustment of status application a vaccination supplement, completed by a designated civil surgeon in the United States.
(d)
Interview.
The Service director having jurisdiction over the application will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether an interview by an immigration officer is necessary to determine the applicant's admissibility for permanent resident status under this part.
(e)
Decision.
The director will notify the applicant in writing of the decision of his or her application for admission to permanent residence. If the applicant is determined to be inadmissible or no longer a refugee, the director will deny the application and notify the applicant of the reasons for the denial. The director will, in the same denial
notice, inform the applicant of his or her right to renew the request for permanent residence in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act. There is no appeal of the denial of an application by the director, but such denial will be without prejudice to the alien's right to renew the application in removal proceedings under part 240 of this chapter. If the applicant is found to be admissible for permanent residence under section 209(a) of the Act, the director will approve the application and admit the applicant for lawful permanent residence as of the date of the alien's arrival in the United States. An alien admitted for lawful permanent residence will be issued Form I-551, Alien Registration Receipt Card.
[63 FR 30109, June 3, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 10353, Mar. 5, 2003]
§ 1209.2
Adjustment of status of alien granted asylum.
The provisions of this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for adjustment of status by an asylee admitted under section 208 of the Act whose application is based on his or her asylee status.
(a)
Eligibility.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, the status of any alien who has been granted asylum in the United States may be adjusted to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, provided the alien:
(i) Applies for such adjustment;
(ii) Has been physically present in the United States for at least one year after having been granted asylum;
(iii) Continues to be a refugee within the meaning of section 101(a)(42) of the Act, or is the spouse or child of a refugee;
(iv) Has not been firmly resettled in any foreign country; and
(v) Is admissible to the United States as an immigrant under the Act at the time of examination for adjustment without regard to paragraphs (4), (5)(A), (5)(B), and (7)(A)(i) of section 212(a) of the Act, and (vi) has a refugee number available under section 207(a) of the Act.
If the application for adjustment filed under this part exceeds the refugee numbers available under section 207(a) of the Act for the fiscal year, a waiting list will be established on a priority basis by the date the application was properly filed.
(2) An alien, who was granted asylum in the United States prior to November 29, 1990 (regardless of whether or not such asylum has been terminated under section 208(b) of the Act), and is no longer a refugee due to a change in circumstances in the foreign state where he or she feared persecution, may also have his or her status adjusted by the director to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence even if he or she is no longer able to demonstrate that he or she continues to be a refugee within the meaning of section 10l(a)(42) of the Act, or to be a spouse or child of such a refugee or to have been physically present in the United States for at least one year after being granted asylum, so long as he or she is able to meet the requirements noted in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (iv), and (v) of this section. Such persons are exempt from the numerical limitations of section 209(b) of the Act. However, the number of aliens who are natives of any foreign state who may adjust status pursuant to this paragraph in any fiscal year shall not exceed the difference between the per country limitation established under section 202(a) of the Act and the number of aliens who are chargeable to that foreign state in the fiscal year under section 202 of the Act. Aliens who applied for adjustment of status under section 209(b) of the Act before June 1, 1990, are also exempt from its numerical limitation without any restrictions.
(3) No alien arriving in or physically present in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands may apply to adjust status under section 209(b) of the Act in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands prior to January 1, 2030.
(b)
Inadmissible Alien.
An applicant who is inadmissible to the United States under section 212(a) of the Act, may, under section 209(c) of the Act, have the grounds of inadmissibility waived by the director (except for those grounds under paragraphs (27), (29), (33), and so much of (23) as relates
to trafficking in narcotics) for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest. An application for the waiver may be filed on Form I-602 (Application by Refugee for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability) with the application for adjustment. An applicant for adjustment who has had the status of an exchange alien nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, and who is subject to the foreign resident requirement of section 212(e) of the Act, shall be eligible for adjustment without regard to the foreign residence requirement.
(c)
Application.
An application for the benefits of section 209(b) of the Act may be filed on Form I-485, with the correct fee, with the director of the appropriate Service office identified in the instructions to the Form I-485. A separate application must be filed by each alien. Every applicant who is 14 years of age or older must submit a completed Form G-325A (Biographic Information) with the Form I-485 application. Following submission of the Form I-485 application, every applicant who is 14 years of age or older will be required to execute a Form FD-258 (Applicant Fingerprint Card) at such time and place as the Service will designate. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the application must also be supported by evidence that the applicant has been physically present in the United States for at least 1 year. If an alien has been placed in deportation or exclusion proceedings, the application can be filed and considered only in proceedings under section 240 of the Act.
(d)
Medical examination.
An alien seeking adjustment of status under section 209(b) of the Act 1 year following the grant of asylum under section 208 of the Act shall submit the results of a medical examination to determine whether any grounds of inadmissibility described under section 212(a)(1)(A) of the Act apply. Form I-693, Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking Adjustment of Status, and a vaccination supplement to determine compliance with the vaccination requirements described under section 212(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act must be completed by a designed civil surgeon in the United States and submitted at the time of application for adjustment of status.
(e)
Interview.
Each applicant for adjustment of status under this part shall be interviewed by an immigration officer. The interview may be waived for a child under 14 years of age. The Service director having jurisdiction over the application will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether an interview by an immigration officer is necessary to determine the applicant's admissibility for permanent resident status under this part.
(f)
Decision.
The applicant shall be notified of the decision, and if the application is denied, of the reasons for denial. No appeal shall lie from the denial of an application by the director but such denial will be without prejudice to the alien's right to renew the application in proceedings under part 240 of this chapter. If the application is approved, the director shall record the alien's admission for lawful permanent residence as of the date one year before the date of the approval of the application, but not earlier than the date of the approval for asylum in the case of an applicant approved under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

Waiver of documents for returning residents.
(a) Pursuant to the authority contained in section 211(b) of the Act, an alien previously lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence who, upon return from a temporary absence was inadmissible because of failure to have or to present a valid passport, immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing card, or other document required at the time of
entry, may be granted a waiver of such requirement in the discretion of the district director if the district director determines that such alien:
(1) Was not otherwise inadmissible at the time of entry, or having been otherwise inadmissible at the time of entry is with respect thereto qualified for an exemption from deportability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act; and
(2) Is not otherwise subject to removal.
(b) Denial of a waiver by the district director is not appealable but shall be without prejudice to renewal of an application and reconsideration in proceedings before the immigration judge.

§ 1212.2
Consent to reapply for admission after deportation, removal or departure at Government expense.
(a)
Evidence.
Any alien who has been deported or removed from the United States is inadmissible to the United States unless the alien has remained outside of the United States for five consecutive years since the date of deportation or removal. If the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony, he or she must remain outside of the United States for twenty consecutive years from the deportation date before he or she is eligible to re-enter the United States. Any alien who has been deported or removed from the United States and is applying for a visa, admission to the United States, or adjustment of status, must present proof that he or she has remained outside of the United States for the time period required for re-entry after deportation or removal. The examining consular or immigration officer must be satisfied that since the alien's deportation or removal, the alien has remained outside the United States for more than five consecutive years, or twenty consecutive years in the case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act. Any alien who does not satisfactorily present proof of absence from the United States for more than five consecutive years, or twenty consecutive years in the case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, to the consular or immigration officer, and any alien who is seeking to enter the United States prior to the completion of the requisite five- or twenty-year absence, must apply for permission to reapply for admission to the United States as provided under this part. A temporary stay in the United States under section 212(d)(3) of the Act does not interrupt the five or twenty consecutive year absence requirement.
(b)
Alien applying to consular officer for nonimmigrant visa or nonresident alien border crossing card.
(1) An alien who is applying to a consular officer for a nonimmigrant visa or a nonresident alien border crossing card, must request permission to reapply for admission to the United States if five years, or twenty years if the alien's deportation was based upon a conviction for an aggravated felony, have not elapsed since the date of deportation or removal. This permission shall be requested in the manner prescribed through the consular officer, and may be granted only in accordance with sections 212(a)(17) and 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act and § 1212.4 of this part. However, the alien may apply for such permission by submitting Form I-212, Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States after Deportation or Removal, to the consular officer if that officer is willing to accept the application, and recommends to the district director that the alien be permitted to apply.
(2) The consular officer shall forward the Form I-212 to the district director with jurisdiction over the place where the deportation or removal proceedings were held.
(c)
Special provisions for an applicant for nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act.
(1) An applicant for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(K) must:
(i) Be the beneficiary of a valid visa petition approved by the Service; and
(ii) File an application on Form I-212 with the consular officer for permission to reapply for admission to the United States after deportation or removal.
(2) The consular officer must forward the Form I-212 to the Service office with jurisdiction over the area within which the consular officer is located. If the alien is ineligible on grounds which, upon the applicant's marriage to the United States citizen petitioner, may be waived under section 212 (g), (h), or (i) of the Act, the consular officer must also forward a recommendation as to whether the waiver should be granted.
(d)
Applicant for immigrant visa.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, an applicant for an immigrant visa who is not physically present in the United States and who requires permission to reapply must file Form I-212 with the district director having jurisdiction over the place where the deportation or removal proceedings were held. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, if the applicant also requires a waiver under section 212 (g), (h), or (i) of the Act, Form I-601, Application for Waiver
of Grounds of Excludability, must be filed simultaneously with the Form I-212 with the American consul having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence. The consul must forward these forms to the appropriate Service office abroad with jurisdiction over the area within which the consul is located.
(e)
Applicant for adjustment of status.
An applicant for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act and part 245 of this chapter must request permission to reapply for entry in conjunction with his or her application for adjustment of status. This request is made by filing an application for permission to reapply, Form I-212, with the district director having jurisdiction over the place where the alien resides. If the application under section 245 of the Act has been initiated, renewed, or is pending in a proceeding before an immigration judge, the district director must refer the Form I-212 to the immigration judge for adjudication.
(f)
Applicant for admission at port of entry.
Within five years of the deportation or removal, or twenty years in the case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, an alien may request permission at a port of entry to reapply for admission to the United States. The alien shall file the Form I-212 with the district director having jurisdiction over the port of entry.
(g)
Other applicants.
(1) Any applicant for permission to reapply for admission under circumstances other than those described in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section must file Form I-212. This form is filed with either:
(i) The district director having jurisdiction over the place where the deportation or removal proceedings were held; or
(ii) The district director who exercised or is exercising jurisdiction over the applicant's most recent proceeding.
(2) If the applicant is physically present in the United States but is ineligible to apply for adjustment of status, he or she must file the application with the district director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence.
(3) If an alien who is an applicant for parole authorization under § 245.15(t)(2) of 8 CFR chapter I requires consent to reapply for admission after deportation, removal, or departure at Government expense, or a waiver under section 212(g), 212(h), or 212(i) of the Act, he or she may file the requisite Form I-212 or Form I-601 at the Nebraska Service Center concurrently with the Form I-131, Application for Travel Document. If an alien who is an applicant for parole authorization under § 245.13(k)(2) of 8 CFR chapter I requires consent to reapply for admission after deportation, removal, or departure at Government expense, or a waiver under section 212(g), 212(h), or 212(i) of the Act, he or she may file the requisite Form I-212 or Form I-601 at the Texas Service Center concurrently with the Form I-131, Application for Travel Document.
(h)
Decision.
An applicant who has submitted a request for consent to reapply for admission after deportation or removal must be notified of the decision. If the application is denied, the applicant must be notified of the reasons for the denial and of his or her right to appeal as provided in part 103 of this chapter. Except in the case of an applicant seeking to be granted advance permission to reapply for admission prior to his or her departure from the United States, the denial of the application shall be without prejudice to the renewal of the application in the course of proceedings before an immigration judge under section 242 of the Act and this chapter.
(i)
Retroactive approval.
(1) If the alien filed Form I-212 when seeking admission at a port of entry, the approval of the Form I-212 shall be retroactive to either:
(i) The date on which the alien embarked or reembarked at a place outside the United States; or
(ii) The date on which the alien attempted to be admitted from foreign contiguous territory.
(2) If the alien filed Form I-212 in conjunction with an application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, the approval of Form I-212 shall be retroactive to the date on which the alien embarked or reembarked at a place outside the United States.
(j)
Advance approval.
An alien whose departure will execute an order of deportation shall receive a conditional approval depending upon his or her satisfactory departure. However, the grant of permission to reapply does not waive inadmissibility under section 212(a) (16) or (17) of the Act resulting from exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings which are instituted subsequent to the date permission to reapply is granted.

§ 1212.4
Applications for the exercise of discretion under section 212(d)(1) and 212(d)(3).
(a)
Applications under section 212(d)(3)(A)
—(1)
General.
District directors and officers in charge outside the United States in the districts of Bangkok, Thailand; Mexico City, Mexico; and Rome, Italy are authorized to act upon recommendations made by consular officers for the exercise of discretion under section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act. The District Director, Washington, DC, has jurisdiction in such cases recommended to the Service at the seat-of-government level by the Department of State. When a consular officer or other State Department official recommends that the benefits of section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act be accorded an alien, neither an application nor fee shall be required. The recommendation shall specify:
(i) The reasons for inadmissibility and each section of law under which the alien is inadmissible;
(ii) Each intended date of arrival;
(iii) The length of each proposed stay in the United States;
(iv) The purpose of each stay;
(v) The number of entries which the alien intends to make; and
(vi) The justification for exercising the authority contained in section 212(d)(3) of the Act.
If the alien desires to make multiple entries and the consular officer or other State Department official believes that the circumstances justify the issuance of a visa valid for multiple entries rather than for a specified number of entries, and recommends that the alien be accorded an authorization
valid for multiple entries, the information required by items (ii) and (iii) shall be furnished only with respect to the initial entry. Item (ii) does not apply to a bona fide crewman. The consular officer or other State Department official shall be notified of the decision on his recommendation. No appeal by the alien shall lie from an adverse decision made by a Service officer on the recommendation of a consular officer or other State Department official.
(2)
Authority of consular officers to approve section 212(d)(3)(A) recommendations pertaining to aliens inadmissible under section 212(a)(28)(C).
In certain categories of visa cases defined by the Secretary of State, United States consular officers assigned to visa-issuing posts abroad may, on behalf of the Attorney General pursuant to section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act, approve a recommendation by another consular officer that an alien be admitted temporarily despite visa ineligibility solely because the alien is of the class of aliens defined at section 212(a)(28)(C) of the Act, as a result of presumed or actual membership in, or affiliation with, an organization described in that section. Authorizations for temporary admission granted by consular officers shall be subject to the terms specified in § 1212.4(c) of this chapter. Any recommendation which is not clearly approvable shall, and any recommendation may, be presented to the appropriate official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service for a determination.
(b)
Applications under section 212(d)(3)(B).
An application for the exercise of discretion under section 212(d)(3)(B) of the Act shall be submitted on Form I-192 to the district director in charge of the applicant's intended port of entry prior to the applicant's arrival in the United States. (For Department of State procedure when a visa is required, see 22 CFR 41.95 and paragraph (a) of this section.) If the application is made because the applicant may be inadmissible due to present or past membership in or affiliation with any Communist or other totalitarian party or organization, there shall be attached to the application a written statement of the history of the applicant's membership or affiliation, including the period of such membership or affiliation, whether the applicant held any office in the organization, and whether his membership or affiliation was voluntary or involuntary. If the applicant alleges that his membership or affiliation was involuntary, the statement shall include the basis for that allegation. When the application is made because the applicant may be inadmissible due to disease, mental or physical defect, or disability of any kind, the application shall describe the disease, defect, or disability. If the purpose of seeking admission to the United States is for treatment, there shall be attached to the application statements in writing to establish that satisfactory treatment cannot be obtained outside the United States; that arrangements have been completed for treatment, and where and from whom treatment will be received; what financial arrangements for payment of expenses incurred in connection with the treatment have been made, and that a bond will be available if required. When the application is made because the applicant may be inadmissible due to the conviction of one or more crimes, the designation of each crime, the date and place of its commission and of the conviction thereof, and the sentence or other judgment of the court shall be stated in the application; in such a case the application shall be supplemented by the official record of each conviction, and any other documents relating to commutation of sentence, parole, probation, or pardon. If the application is made at the time of the applicant's arrival to the district director at a port of entry, the applicant shall establish that he was not aware of the ground of inadmissibility and that it could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence, and he shall be in possession of a passport and visa, if required, or have been granted a waiver thereof. The applicant shall be notified of the decision and if the application is denied of the reasons therefor and of his right to appeal to the Board within 15 days after the mailing of the notification of decision in accordance with
the Provisions of part 1003 of this chapter. If denied, the denial shall be without prejudice to renewal of the application in the course of proceedings before a special inquiry officer under sections 235 and 236 of the Act and this chapter. When an appeal may not be taken from a decision of a special inquiry officer excluding an alien but the alien has applied for the exercise of discretion under section 212(d)(3)(B) of the Act, the alien may appeal to the Board from a denial of such application in accordance with the provisions of § 236.5(b) of this chapter.
(c)
Terms of authorization
—(1)
General.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each authorization under section 212(d)(3)(A) or (B) of the Act shall specify:
(i) Each section of law under which the alien is inadmissible;

(iv) An authorization that was previously issued in conjunction with Form I-185, Nonresident Alien Canadian Border Crossing Card, and that is noted on the card may remain valid. Although the waiver may remain valid, the non-biometric border crossing card portion of this document is not valid after that date. This waiver authorization shall cease if otherwise revoked or voided.
(v) A single-entry authorization to apply for admission at a U.S. POE shall not be valid for more than 6 months from the date the authorization is issued.

When the Secretary of State recommends that a group of nonimmigrant aliens and their accompanying family members be admitted to attend international conferences notwithstanding their inadmissibility under section 212(a)(28) of the Act, the Deputy Commissioner, may enter an order pursuant to the authority contained in section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act specifying the
terms and conditions of their admission and stay.

Upon admitting an alien who has been granted the benefits of section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act, the immigration officer shall be guided by the conditions and limitations imposed in the authorization and noted by the consular officer in the alien's passport. When admitting any alien who has been granted the benefits of section 212(d)(3)(B) of the Act, the Immigration officer shall note on the arrival-departure record, Form I-94, or crewman's landing permit, Form I-95, issued to the alien, the conditions and limitations imposed in the authorization.

Waivers under section 212(d)(1) of the Act.
Upon the application of a federal or state law enforcement authority (“LEA”), which shall include a state or federal court or United States Attorney's Office, pursuant to the filing of Form I-854, Inter-Agency Alien Witness and Informant Record, for nonimmigrant classification described in section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act, the Commissioner shall determine whether a ground of exclusion exists with respect to the alien for whom classification is sought and, if so, whether it is in the national interest to exercise the discretion to waive the ground of excludability, other than section 212(a)(3)(E) of the Act. The Commissioner may at any time revoke a waiver previously authorized under section 212(d)(1) of the Act. In the event the Commissioner decides to revoke a previously authorized waiver for an S nonimmigrant, the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, and the relevant LEA shall be notified in writing to that effect. The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to the decision. Unless the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 7 days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy Attorney General for a final resolution. In no circumstances shall the alien or the relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any decision to revoke.
(2)
Grounds of removal.
Nothing shall prohibit the Service from removing from the United States an alien classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act for conduct committed after the alien has been admitted to the United States as an S nonimmigrant, or after the alien's change to S classification, or for conduct or a condition undisclosed to the Attorney General prior to the alien's admission in, or change to, S classification, unless such conduct or condition is waived prior to admission and classification. In the event the Commissioner decides to remove an S nonimmigrant from the United States, the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, and the relevant LEA shall be notified in writing to that effect. The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to that decision. Unless the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 7 days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the
matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy Attorney General for a final resolution. In no circumstances shall the alien or the relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any decision to remove.

§ 1212.7
Waiver of certain grounds of inadmissibility.
(a)
General
—(1)
Filing procedure
—(i)
Immigrant visa or K nonimmigrant visa applicant.
An applicant for an immigrant visa or “K” nonimmigrant visa who is inadmissible and seeks a waiver of inadmissibility shall file an application on Form I-601 at the consular office considering the visa application. Upon determining that the alien is admissible except for the grounds for which a waiver is sought, the consular officer shall transmit the Form I-601 to the Service for decision.
(ii)
Adjustment of status applicant.
An applicant for adjustment of status who is excludable and seeks a waiver under section 212(h) or (i) of the Act shall file an application on Form I-601 with the director or immigration judge considering the application for adjustment of status.
(iii)
Parole authorization applicant under § 1245.15(t).
An applicant for parole authorization under § 1245.15(t) of this chapter who is inadmissible and seeks a waiver under section 212(h) or (i) of the Act must file an application on Form I-601 with the Director of the Nebraska Service Center considering the Form I-131.
(iv)
Parole authorization applicant under § 1245.13(k)(2) of this chapter.
An applicant for parole authorization under § 1245.13(k)(2) of this chapter who is inadmissible and seeks a waiver under section 212(h) or (i) of the Act must file an application on Form I-601 with the Director of the Texas Service Center adjudicating the Form I-131.
(2)
Termination of application for lack of prosecution.
An applicant may withdraw the application at any time prior to the final decision, whereupon the case will be closed and the consulate notified. If the applicant fails to prosecute the application within a reasonable time either before or after interview the applicant shall be notified that if he or she fails to prosecute the application within 30 days the case will be closed subject to being reopened at the applicant's request. If no action has been taken within the 30-day period immediately thereafter, the case will be closed and the appropriate consul notified.
(3)
Decision.
If the application is approved the director shall complete Form I-607 for inclusion in the alien's file and shall notify the alien of the decision. If the application is denied the applicant shall be notified of the decision, of the reasons therefor, and of the right to appeal in accordance with part 103 of this chapter.
(4)
Validity.
A waiver granted under section 212(h) or section 212(i) of the Act shall apply only to those grounds of excludability and to those crimes, events or incidents specified in the application for waiver. Once granted, the waiver shall be valid indefinitely, even if the recipient of the waiver later abandons or otherwise loses lawful permanent resident status, except that any waiver which is granted to an alien who obtains lawful permanent residence on a conditional basis under section 216 of the Act shall automatically terminate concurrently with the termination of such residence pursuant to the provisions of section 216. Separate notification of the termination of the waiver is not required when an alien is notified of the termination of residence
under section 216 of the Act, and no appeal shall lie from the decision to terminate the waiver on this basis. However, if the respondent is found not to be deportable in a deportation proceeding based on the termination, the waiver shall again become effective. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the director from reconsidering a decision to approve a waiver if the decision is determined to have been made in error.
(b)

—(1)
General.
Any alien who is ineligible for a visa and is excluded from admission into the United States under section 212(a) (1), (3), or (6) of the Act may file an Application for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability (Form I-601) under section 212(g) of the Act at an office designated in paragraph (2). The family member specified in section 212(g) of the Act may file the waiver for the applicant if the applicant is incompetent to file the waiver personally.

In addition, he or his sponsor in the United States is responsible for having Statement B executed by the physician or health facility which has agreed to supply treatment or observation; and, if required, Statement C shall be executed by the appropriate local or State health officer.
(4)
Section 212(a) (1) or (3) (certain mental conditions)
—(i)
Arrangements for submission of medical report.
If the alien is excludable under section 212(a) (1) or (3) (because of mental retardation or because of a past history of mental illness) he or his sponsoring family member shall submit an executed Form I-601 to the consular or Service office with a statement that arrangements have been made for the submission to that office of a medical report. The medical report shall contain a complete medical history of the alien, including details of any hospitalization or institutional care or treatment for any physical or mental condition; findings as to the current physical condition of the alien, including reports of chest X-ray examination and of serologic test for syphilis if the alien is 15 years of age or over, and other pertinent diagnostic tests; and findings as to the current mental condition of the alien, with information as to prognosis and life expectancy and with a report of a psychiatric examination conducted by a psychiatrist who shall, in case of mental retardation, also provide an evaluation of the alien's intelligence. For an alien with a past history of mental illness, the medical report shall also contain available information on which the U.S. Public Health Service can base a finding as to whether the alien has been free of such mental illness for a period of time sufficient in the light of such history to demonstrate recovery. Upon receipt of the medical report, the consular or Service office shall refer it to the U.S. Public Health Service for review.
(ii)
Submission of statement.
Upon being notified that the medical report has been reviewed by the U.S. Public Health Service and determined to be acceptable, the alien or the alien's sponsoring family member shall submit a statement to the consular or Service office. The statement must be from a clinic, hospital, institution, specialized facility, or specialist in the United States approved by the U.S. Public Health Service. The alien or alien's sponsor may be referred to the mental retardation or mental health
agency of the state of proposed residence for guidance in selecting a post-arrival medical examining authority who will complete the evaluation and provide an evaluation report to the Centers for Disease Control. The statement must specify the name and address of the specialized facility, or specialist, and must affirm that:
(A) The specified facility or specialist agrees to evaluate the alien's mental status and prepare a complete report of the findings of such evaluation.
(B) The alien, the alien's sponsoring family member, or another responsible person has made complete financial arrangements for payment of any charges that may be incurred after arrival for studies, care, training and service;
(C) The Director, Division of Quarantine, Center for Prevention Services, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. 30333 shall be furnished:
(
1
) The report evaluating the alien's mental status within 30 days after the alien's arrival; and
(
2
) Prompt notification of the alien's failure to report to the facility or specialist within 30 days after being notified by the U.S. Public Health Service that the alien has arrived in the United States.
(D) The alien shall be in an outpatient, inpatient, study, or other specified status as determined by the responsible local physician or specialist during the initial evaluation.
(5)
Assurances: Bonds.
In all cases under paragraph (b) of this section the alien or his or her sponsoring family member shall also submit an assurance that the alien will comply with any special travel requirements as may be specified by the U.S. Public Health Service and that, upon the admission of the alien into the United States, he or she will proceed directly to the facility or specialist specified for the initial evaluation, and will submit to such further examinations or treatment as may be required, whether in an outpatient, inpatient, or other status. The alien, his or her sponsoring family member, or other responsible person shall provide such assurances or bond as may be required to assure that the necessary expenses of the alien will be met and that he or she will not become a public charge. For procedures relating to cancellation or breaching of bonds, see part 103 of 8 CFR chapter I.
(c)
Section 212(e).
(1) An alien who was admitted to the United States as an exchange visitor, or who acquired that status after admission, is subject to the foreign residence requirement of section 212(e) of the Act if his or her participation in an exchange program was financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a United States government agency or by the government of the country of his or her nationality or last foreign residence.
(2) An alien is also subject to the foreign residence requirement of section 212(e) of the Act if at the time of admission to the United States as an exchange visitor or at the time of acquisition of exchange visitor status after admission to the United States, the alien was a national or lawful permanent resident of a country which the Director of the United States Information Agency had designated, through public notice in the
Federal Register,
as clearly requiring the services of persons engaged in the field of specialized knowledge or skill in which the alien was to engage in his or her exchange visitor program.
(3) An alien is also subject to the foreign residence requirement of section 212(e) of the Act if he or she was admitted to the United States as an exchange visitor on or after January 10, 1977 to receive graduate medical education or training, or following admission, acquired such status on or after that date for that purpose. However, an exchange visitor already participating in an exchange program of graduate medical education or training as of January 9, 1977 who was not then subject to the foreign residence requirement of section 212(e) and who proceeds or has proceeded abroad temporarily and is returning to the United States to participate in the same program, continues to be exempt from the foreign residence requirement.
(4) A spouse or child admitted to the United States or accorded status under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act to accompany or follow to join an exchange visitor who is subject to the foreign residence requirement of section 212(e) of the Act is also subject to that requirement.
(5) An alien who is subject to the foreign residence requirement and who believes that compliance therewith would impose exceptional hardship upon his/her spouse or child who is a citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent resident alien, or that he or she cannot return to the country of his or her nationality or last residence because he or she will be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion, may apply for a waiver on Form I-612. The alien's spouse and minor children, if also subject to the foreign residence requirement, may be included in the application, provided the spouse has not been a participant in an exchange program.
(6) Each application based upon a claim to exceptional hardship must be accompanied by the certificate of marriage between the applicant and his or her spouse and proof of legal termination of all previous marriages of the applicant and spouse; the birth certificate of any child who is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident alien, if the application is based upon a claim of exceptional hardship to a child, and evidence of the United States citizenship of the applicant's spouse or child, when the application is based upon a claim of exceptional hardship to a spouse or child who is a citizen of the United States.
(7) Evidence of United States citizenship and of status as a lawful permanent resident shall be in the form provided in part 204 of 8 CFR chapter I. An application based upon exceptional hardship shall be supported by a statement, dated and signed by the applicant, giving a detailed explanation of the basis for his or her belief that his or her compliance with the foreign residence requirement of section 212(e) of the Act, as amended, would impose exceptional hardship upon his or her spouse or child who is a citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent resident thereof. The statement shall include all pertinent information concerning the incomes and savings of the applicant and spouse. If exceptional hardship is claimed upon medical grounds, the applicant shall submit a medical certificate from a qualified physician setting forth in terms understandable to a layman the nature and effect of the illness and prognosis as to the period of time the spouse or child will require care or treatment.
(8) An application based upon the applicant's belief that he or she cannot return to the country of his or her nationality or last residence because the applicant would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion, must be supported by a statement, dated and signed by the applicant, setting forth in detail why the applicant believes he or she would be subject to persecution.
(9)
Waivers under Pub. L. 103-416 based on a request by a State Department of Public Health (or equivalent).
In accordance with section 220 of Pub. L. 103-416, an alien admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, or who acquired status under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act after admission to the United States, to participate in an exchange program of graduate medical education or training (as of January 9, 1977), may apply for a waiver of the 2-year home country residence and physical presence requirement (the “2-year requirement”) under section 212(e)(iii) of the Act based on a request by a State Department of Public Health, or its equivalent. To initiate the application for a waiver under Pub. L. 103-416, the Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or the State in which the foreign medical graduate seeks to practice medicine, must request the Director of USIA to recommend a waiver to the Service. The waiver may be granted only if the Director of USIA provides the Service with a favorable waiver recommendation. Only the Service, however, may grant or deny the waiver application. If granted, such a waiver shall be subject to the terms and conditions imposed under section 214(l) of the Act (as redesignated by section 671(a)(3)(A) of Pub. L. 104-208). Although the alien is not required to submit a separate waiver application to the Service, the burden rests on the alien to establish eligibility for the waiver. If the Service approves a waiver request made under Pub. L. 103-416, the foreign medical graduate (and accompanying dependents) may apply for change of nonimmigrant status, from
J-1 to H-1B and, in the case of dependents of such a foreign medical graduate, from J-2 to H-4. Aliens receiving waivers under section 220 of Pub. L. 103-416 are subject, in all cases, to the provisions of section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act.
(i)
Eligibility criteria.
J-1 foreign medical graduates (with accompanying J-2 dependents) are eligible to apply for a waiver of the 2-year requirement under Pub. L. 103-416 based on a request by a State Department of Public Health (or its equivalent) if:
(A) They were admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, or acquired J nonimmigrant status before June 1, 2002, to pursue graduate medical education or training in the United States.
(B) They have entered into a bona fide, full-time employment contract for 3 years to practice medicine at a health care facility located in an area or areas designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals (“HHS-designated shortage area”);
(C) They agree to commence employment within 90 days of receipt of the waiver under this section and agree to practice medicine for 3 years at the facility named in the waiver application and only in HHS-designated shortage areas. The health care facility named in the waiver application may be operated by:
(
1
) An agency of the Government of the United States or of the State in which it is located; or
(
2
) A charitable, educational, or other not-for-profit organization; or
(
3
) Private medical practitioners.
(D) The Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, in the State where the health care facility is located has requested the Director, USIA, to recommend the waiver, and the Director, USIA, submits a favorable waiver recommendation to the Service; and
(E) Approval of the waiver will not cause the number of waivers granted pursuant to Pub. L. 103-416 and this section to foreign medical graduates who will practice medicine in the same state to exceed 20 during the current fiscal year.
(ii)
Decision on waivers under Pub. L. 103-416 and notification to the alien
—(A)
Approval.
If the Director of USIA submits a favorable waiver recommendation on behalf of a foreign medical graduate pursuant to Pub. L. 103-416, and the Service grants the waiver, the alien shall be notified of the approval on Form I-797 (or I-797A or I-797B, as appropriate). The approval notice shall clearly state the terms and conditions imposed on the waiver, and the Service's records shall be noted accordingly.
(B)
Denial.
If the Director of USIA issues a favorable waiver recommendation under Pub. L. 103-416 and the Service denies the waiver, the alien shall be notified of the decision and of the right to appeal under 8 CFR part 1103. However, no appeal shall lie where the basis for denial is that the number of waivers granted to the State in which the foreign medical graduate will be employed would exceed 20 for that fiscal year.
(iii)
Conditions.
The foreign medical graduate must agree to commence employment for the health care facility specified in the waiver application within 90 days of receipt of the waiver under Pub. L. 103-416. The foreign medical graduate may only fulfill the requisite 3-year employment contract as an H-1B nonimmigrant. A foreign medical graduate who receives a waiver under Pub. L. 103-416 based on a request by a State Department of Public Health (or equivalent), and changes his or her nonimmigrant classification from J-1 to H-1B, may not apply for permanent residence or for any other change of nonimmigrant classification unless he or she has fulfilled the 3-year employment contract with the health care facility and in the specified HHS-designated shortage area named in the waiver application.
(iv)
Failure to fulfill the three-year employment contract due to extenuating circumstances.
A foreign medical graduate who fails to meet the terms and conditions imposed on the waiver under section 214(l) of the Act and this paragraph will once again become subject to the 2-year requirement under section 212(e) of the Act.
Under section 214(l)(1)(B) of the Act, however, the Service, in the exercise of
discretion, may excuse early termination of the foreign medical graduate's 3-year period of employment with the health care facility named in the waiver application due to extenuating circumstances. Extenuating circumstances may include, but are not limited to, closure of the health care facility or hardship to the alien. In determining whether to excuse such early termination of employment, the Service shall base its decision on the specific facts of each case. In all cases, the burden of establishing eligibility for a favorable exercise of discretion rests with the foreign medical graduate. Depending on the circumstances, closure of the health care facility named in the waiver application may, but need not, be considered an extenuating circumstance excusing early termination of employment. Under no circumstances will a foreign medical graduate be eligible to apply for change of status to another nonimmigrant category, for an immigrant visa or for status as a lawful permanent resident prior to completing the requisite 3-year period of employment for a health care facility located in an HHS-designated shortage area.
(v)
Required evidence.
A foreign medical graduate who seeks to have early termination of employment excused due to extenuating circumstances shall submit documentary evidence establishing such a claim. In all cases, the foreign medical graduate shall submit an employment contract with another health care facility located in an HHS-designated shortage area for the balance of the required 3-year period of employment. A foreign medical graduate claiming extenuating circumstances based on hardship shall also submit evidence establishing that such hardship was caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond his or her control. A foreign medical graduate claiming extenuating circumstances based on closure of the health care facility named in the waiver application shall also submit evidence that the facility has closed or is about to be closed.
(vi)
Notification requirements.
A J-1 foreign medical graduate who has been granted a waiver of the 2-year requirement pursuant to Pub. L. 103-416, is required to comply with the terms and conditions specified in section 214(l) of the Act and the implementing regulations in this section. If the foreign medical graduate subsequently applies for and receives H-1B status, he or she must also comply with the terms and conditions of that nonimmigrant status. Such compliance shall also include notifying the Service of any material change in the terms and conditions of the H-1B employment, by filing either an amended or a new H-1B petition, as required, under §§ 214.2(h)(2)(i)(D), 214.2(h)(2)(i)(E), and 214.2(h)(11) of 8 CFR chapter I.
(A)
Amended H-1B petitions.
The health care facility named in the waiver application and H-1B petition shall file an amended H-1B petition, as required under § 214.2(h)(2)(i)(E) of 8 CFR chapter I, if there are any material changes in the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's employment or eligibility as specified in the waiver application filed under Pub. L. 103-416 and in the subsequent H-1B petition. In such a case, an amended H-1B petition shall be accompanied by evidence that the alien will continue practicing medicine with the original employer in an HHS-designated shortage area.
(B)
New H-1B petitions.
A health care facility seeking to employ a foreign medical graduate who has been granted a waiver under Pub. L. 103-416 (prior to the time the alien has completed his or her 3-year contract with the facility named in the waiver application and original H-1B petition), shall file a new H-1B petition with the Service, as required under §§ 214.2(h)(2)(i) (D) and (E) of 8 CFR chapter I. Although a new waiver application need not be filed, the new H-1B petition shall be accompanied by the documentary evidence generally required under § 214.2(h) of this chapter, and the following additional documents:
(
1
) A copy of Form I-797 (and/or I-797A and I-797B) relating to the waiver and nonimmigrant H status granted under Pub. L. 103-416;
(
2
) An explanation from the foreign medical graduate, with supporting evidence, establishing that extenuating circumstances necessitate a change in employment;
(
3
) An employment contract establishing that the foreign medical graduate will practice medicine at the health care facility named in the new H-1B petition for the balance of the required 3-year period; and
(
4
) Evidence that the geographic area or areas of intended employment indicated in the new H-1B petition are in HHS-designated shortage areas.
(C)
Review of amended and new H-1B petitions for foreign medical graduates granted waivers under Pub. L. 103-416 and who seek to have early termination of employment excused due to extenuating circumstances
—(
1
)
Amended H-1B petitions.
The waiver granted under Pub. L. 103-416 may be affirmed, and the amended H-1B petition may be approved, if the petitioning health care facility establishes that the foreign medical graduate otherwise remains eligible for H-1B classification and that he or she will continue practicing medicine in an HHS-designated shortage area.
(
2
)
New H-1B petitions.
The Service shall review a new H-1B petition filed on behalf of a foreign medical graduate who has not yet fulfilled the required 3-year period of employment with the health care facility named in the waiver application and in the original H-1B petition to determine whether extenuating circumstances exist which warrant a change in employment, and whether the waiver granted under Pub. L. 103-416 should be affirmed. In conducting such a review, the Service shall determine whether the foreign medical graduate will continue practicing medicine in an HHS-designated shortage area, and whether the new H-1B petitioner and the foreign medical graduate have satisfied the remaining H-1B eligibility criteria described under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act and § 214.2(h) of 8 CFR chapter I. If these criteria have been satisfied, the waiver granted to the foreign medical graduate under Pub. L. 103-416 may be affirmed, and the new H1-B petition may be approved in the exercise of discretion, thereby permitting the foreign medical graduate to serve the balance of the requisite 3-year employment period at the health care facility named in the new H-1B petition.
(D)
Failure to notify the Service of any material changes in employment.
Foreign medical graduates who have been granted a waiver of the 2-year requirement and who have obtained H-1B status under Pub. L. 103-416 but fail to: Properly notify the Service of any material change in the terms and conditions of their H-1B employment, by having their employer file an amended or a new H-1B petition in accordance with this section and § 214.2(h) of 8 CFR chapter I; or establish continued eligibility for the waiver and H-1B status, shall (together with their dependents) again become subject to the 2-year requirement. Such foreign medical graduates and their accompanying H-4 dependents also become subject to deportation under section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
(10) The applicant and his or her spouse may be interviewed by an immigration officer in connection with the application and consultation may be had with the Director, United States Information Agency and the sponsor of any exchange program in which the applicant has been a participant.
(11) The applicant shall be notified of the decision, and if the application is denied, of the reasons therefor and of the right of appeal in accordance with the provisions of part 103 of this chapter. However, no appeal shall lie from the denial of an application for lack of a favorable recommendation from the Secretary of State. When an interested United States Government agency requests a waiver of the two-year foreign-residence requirement and the Director, United States Information Agency had made a favorable recommendation, the interested agency shall be notified of the decision on its request and, if the request is denied, of the reasons thereof, and of the right of appeal. If the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished statement in writing that it has no objection to his/her being granted a waiver of the foreign residence requirement and the Director, United States Information Agency has made a favorable recommendation, the Director shall be notified of the decision and, if the foreign residence requirement is not waived, of the reasons therefor and of the foregoing right of
appeal. However, this “no objection” provision is not applicable to the exchange visitor admitted to the United States on or after January 10, 1977 to receive graduate medical education or training, or who acquired such status on or after that date for such purpose; except that the alien who commenced a program before January 10, 1977 and who was readmitted to the United States on or after that date to continue participation in the same program, is eligible for the “no objection” waiver.
(d)
Criminal grounds of inadmissibility involving violent or dangerous crimes.
The Attorney General, in general, will not favorably exercise discretion under section 212(h)(2) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(h)(2)) to consent to an application or reapplication for a visa, or admission to the United States, or adjustment of status, with respect to immigrant aliens who are inadmissible under section 212(a)(2) of the Act in cases involving violent or dangerous crimes, except in extraordinary circumstances, such as those involving national security or foreign policy considerations, or cases in which an alien clearly demonstrates that the denial of the application for adjustment of status or an immigrant visa or admission as an immigrant would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. Moreover, depending on the gravity of the alien's underlying criminal offense, a showing of extraordinary circumstances might still be insufficient to warrant a favorable exercise of discretion under section 212(h)(2) of the Act.

§ 1212.8
Certification requirement of section 212(a)(14).
(a)
General.
The certification requirement of section 212(a)(14) of the Act applies to aliens seeking admission to the United States or adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act for the purpose of performing skilled or unskilled labor, who are preference immigrants as described in section 203(a) (3) or (6) of the Act, or who are nonpreference immigrants as described in section 203(a)(8). The certification requirement shall not be applicable to a nonpreference applicant for admission to the United States or to a nonpreference applicant for adjustment of status under section 245 who establishes that he will not perform skilled or unskilled labor. A native of the Western Hemisphere who established a priority date with a consular officer prior to January 1, 1977 and who was found to be entitled to an exemption from the labor certification requirement of section 212(a)(14) of the Act under the law in effect prior to January 1, 1977 as the parent, spouse or child of a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident alien shall continue to be exempt from that requirement for so long as the relationship upon which the exemption is based continues to exist.
(b)
Aliens not required to obtain labor certifications.
The following persons are not considered to be within the purview of section 212(a)(14) of the Act and do not require a labor certification: (1) A member of the Armed Forces of the United States; (2) a spouse or child accompanying or following to join his spouse or parent who either has a labor certification or is a nondependent alien who does not require such a certification; (3) a female alien who intends to marry a citizen or alien lawful permanent resident of the United States, who establishes satisfactorily that she does not intend to seek employment in the United States and whose fiance has guaranteed her support; (4) an alien who establishes on Form I-526 that he has invested, or is actively in the process of investing, capital totaling at least $40,000 in an enterprise in the United States of which he will be a principal manager and that the enterprise will employ a person or persons in the United States of which he will be a principal manager and that the enterprise will employ a person or persons in the United States who are United
States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, exclusive of the alien, his spouse and children. A copy of a document submitted in support of Form I-526 may be accepted though unaccompanied by the original, if the copy bears a certification by an attorney, typed or rubber-stamped in the language set forth in § 204.2(j) of 8 CFR chapter I. However, the original document shall be submitted, if submittal is requested by the Service.

§ 1212.9
Applicability of section 212(a)(32) to certain derivative third and sixth preference and nonpreference immigrants.
A derivative beneficiary who is the spouse or child of a qualified third or sixth preference or nonpreference immigrant and who is also a graduate of a medical school as defined by section 101(a)(41) of the Act is not considered to be an alien who is coming to the United States principally to perform services as a member of the medical profession. Therefore, a derivative third or sixth preference or nonpreference immigrant under section 203(a)(8) of the Act, who is also a graduate of a medical school, is eligible for an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, whether or not such derivative immigrant has passed Parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners Examination or equivalent examination.

§ 1212.12
Parole determinations and revocations respecting Mariel Cubans.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to any native of Cuba who last came to the United States between April 15, 1980, and October 20, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as
Mariel Cuban
) and who is being detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (hereinafter referred to as the
Service
) pending his or her exclusion hearing, or pending his or her return to Cuba or to another country. It covers Mariel Cubans who have never been paroled as well as those Mariel Cubans whose previous parole has been revoked by the Service. It also applies to any Mariel Cuban, detained under the authority of the Immigration and Nationality Act in any facility, who has not been approved for release or who is currently awaiting movement to a Service or Bureau Of Prisons (BOP) facility. In addition, it covers the revocation of parole for those Mariel Cubans who have been released on parole at any time.
(b)
Parole authority and decision.
The authority to grant parole under section 212(d)(5) of the Act to a detained Mariel
Cuban shall be exercised by the Commissioner, acting through the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement, as follows:
(1)
Parole decisions.
The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement may, in the exercise of discretion, grant parole to a detained Mariel Cuban for emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest. A decision to retain in custody shall briefly set forth the reasons for the continued detention. A decision to release on parole may contain such special conditions as are considered appropriate. A copy of any decision to parole or to detain, with an attached copy translated into Spanish, shall be provided to the detainee. Parole documentation for Mariel Cubans shall be issued by the district director having jurisdiction over the alien, in accordance with the parole determination made by the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement.
(2)
Additional delegation of authority.
All references to the Commissioner and Associate Commissioner for Enforcement in this section shall be deemed to include any person or persons (including a committee) designated in writing by the Commissioner or Associate Commissioner for Enforcement to exercise powers under this section.
(c)
Review Plan Director.
The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement shall appoint a Director of the Cuban Review Plan. The Director shall have authority to establish and maintain appropriate files respecting each Mariel Cuban to be reviewed for possible parole, to determine the order in which the cases shall be reviewed, and to coordinate activities associated with these reviews.
(d)
Recommendations to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement.
Parole recommendations for detained Mariel Cubans shall be developed in accordance with the following procedures.
(1)
Review Panels.
The Director shall designate a panel or panels to make parole recommendations to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement. A Cuban Review Panel shall, except as otherwise provided, consist of two persons. Members of a Review Panel shall be selected from the professional staff of the Service. All recommendations by a two-member Panel shall be unanimous. If the vote of a two-member Panel is split, it shall adjourn its deliberations concerning that particular detainee until a third Panel member is added. A recommendation by a three-member Panel shall be by majority vote. The third member of any Panel shall be the Director of the Cuban Review Plan or his designee.
(2)
Criteria for Review.
Before making any recommendation that a detainee be granted parole, a majority of the Cuban Review Panel members, or the Director in case of a record review, must conclude that:
(i) The detainee is presently a nonviolent person;
(ii) The detainee is likely to remain nonviolent;
(iii) The detainee is not likely to pose a threat to the community following his release; and
(iv) The detainee is not likely to violate the conditions of his parole.
(3)
Factors for consideration.
The following factors should be weighed in considering whether to recommend further detention or release on parole of a detainee:
(i) The nature and number of disciplinary infractions or incident reports received while in custody;
(ii) The detainee's past history of criminal behavior;
(iii) Any psychiatric and psychological reports pertaining to the detainee's mental health;
(iv) Institutional progress relating to participation in work, educational and vocational programs;
(v) His ties to the United States, such as the number of close relatives residing lawfully here;
(vi) The likelihood that he may abscond, such as from any sponsorship program; and
(vii) Any other information which is probative of whether the detainee is likely to adjust to life in a community, is likely to engage in future acts of violence, is likely to engage in future criminal activity, or is likely to violate the conditions of his parole.
(4)
Procedure for review.
The following procedures will govern the review process:
(i)
Record review.
Initially, the Director or a Panel shall review the detainee's file. Upon completion of this
record review, the Director or the Panel shall issue a written recommendation that the detainee be released on parole or scheduled for a personal interview.
(ii)
Personal interview.
If a recommendation to grant parole after only a record review is not accepted or if the detainee is not recommended for release, a Panel shall personally interview the detainee. The scheduling of such interviews shall be at the discretion of the Director. The detainee may be accompanied during the interview by a person of his choice, who is able to attend at the time of the scheduled interview, to assist in answering any questions. The detainee may submit to the Panel any information, either orally or in writing, which he believes presents a basis for release on parole.
(iii)
Panel recommendation.
Following completion of the interview and its deliberations, the Panel shall issue a written recommendation that the detainee be released on parole or remain in custody pending deportation or pending further observation and subsequent review. This written recommendation shall include a brief statement of the factors which the Panel deems material to its recommendation. The recommendation and appropriate file material shall be forwarded to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement, to be considered in the exercise of discretion pursuant to § 1212.12(b).
(e)
Withdrawal of parole approval.
The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement may, in his or her discretion, withdraw approval for parole of any detainee prior to release when, in his or her opinion, the conduct of the detainee, or any other circumstance, indicates that parole would no longer be appropriate.
(f)
Sponsorship.
No detainee may be released on parole until suitable sponsorship or placement has been found for the detainee. The paroled detainee must abide by the parole conditions specified by the Service in relation to his sponsorship or placement. The following sponsorships and placements are suitable:
(1) Placement by the Public Health Service in an approved halfway house or mental health project;
(2) Placement by the Community Relations Service in an approved halfway house or community project; and
(3) Placement with a close relative such as a parent, spouse, child, or sibling who is a lawful permanent resident or a citizen of the United States.
(g)
Timing of reviews.
The timing of review shall be in accordance with the following guidelines.
(1)
Parole revocation cases.
The Director shall schedule the review process in the case of a new or returning detainee whose previous immigration parole has been revoked. The review process will commence with a scheduling of a file review, which will ordinarily be expected to occur within approximately three months after parole is revoked. In the case of a Mariel Cuban who is in the custody of the Service, the Cuban Review Plan Director may, in his or her discretion, suspend or postpone the parole review process if such detainee's prompt deportation is practicable and proper.
(2)
Continued detention cases.
A subsequent review shall be commenced for any detainee within one year of a refusal to grant parole under § 1212.12(b), unless a shorter interval is specified by the Director.
(3)
Discretionary reviews.
The Cuban Review Plan Director, in his discretion, may schedule a review of a detainee at any time when the Director deems such a review to be warranted.
(h)
Revocation of parole.
The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement shall have authority, in the exercise of discretion, to revoke parole in respect to Mariel Cubans. A district director may also revoke parole when, in the district director's opinion, revocation is in the public interest and circumstances do not reasonably permit referral of the case to the Associate Commissioner. Parole may be revoked in the exercise of discretion when, in the opinion of the revoking official:
(1) The purposes of parole have been served;
(2) The Mariel Cuban violates any condition of parole;
(3) It is appropriate to enforce an order of exclusion or to commence proceedings against a Mariel Cuban; or
(4) The period of parole has expired without being renewed.

§ 1212.13
Severability.
The provisions of part 1212 are separate and severable from one another. In the event that any provision in part 1212 is stayed, enjoined, not implemented, or otherwise held invalid, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be implemented as an independent rule and continue in effect.
[85 FR 80400, Dec. 11, 2020]
§ 1212.14
Parole determinations for alien witnesses and informants for whom a law enforcement authority (“LEA”) will request S classification.
(a)
Parole authority.
Parole authorization under section 212(d)(5) of the Act for aliens whom LEAs seek to bring to the United States as witnesses or informants in criminal/counter terrorism matters and to apply for S classification shall be exercised as follows:
(1)
Grounds of eligibility.
The Commissioner may, in the exercise of discretion, grant parole to an alien (and the alien's family members) needed for law enforcement purposes provided that a state or federal LEA:
(i) Establishes its intention to file, within 30 days after the alien's arrival in the United States, a completed Form I-854, Inter-Agency Alien Witness and Informant Record, with the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice, in accordance with the instructions on or attached to the form, which will include the names of qualified family members for whom parole is sought;
(ii) Specifies the particular operational reasons and basis for the request, and agrees to assume responsibility for the alien during the period of the alien's temporary stay in the United States, including maintaining control and supervision of the alien and the alien's whereabouts and activities, and further specifies any other terms and conditions specified by the Service during the period for which the parole is authorized;
(iii) Agrees to advise the Service of the alien's failure to report quarterly any criminal conduct by the alien, or any other activity or behavior on the alien's part that may constitute a ground of excludability or deportability;
(iv) Assumes responsibility for ensuring the alien's departure on the date of termination of the authorized parole (unless the alien has been admitted in S nonimmigrant classification pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a)(2) of this section), provides any and all assistance needed by the Service, if necessary, to ensure departure, and verifies departure in a manner acceptable to the Service;
(v) Provide LEA seat-of-government certification that parole of the alien is essential to an investigation or prosecution, is in the national interest, and is requested pursuant to the terms and authority of section 212(d)(5) of the Act;
(vi) Agrees that no promises may be, have been, or will be made by the LEA to the alien that the alien will or may:
(A) Remain in the United States in parole status or any other nonimmigrant classification;
(B) Adjust status to that of lawful permanent resident; or
(C) Otherwise attempt to remain beyond the authorized parole. The alien (and any family member of the alien who is 18 years of age or older) shall sign a statement acknowledging an awareness that parole only authorizes a temporary stay in the United States and does not convey the benefits of S nonimmigrant classification, any other nonimmigrant classification, or any entitlement to further benefits under the Act; and
(vii) Provides, in the case of a request for the release of an alien from Service custody, certification that the alien is eligible for parole pursuant to § 235.3 of chapter I.
(2)
Authorization.
(i) Upon approval of the request for parole, the Commissioner shall notify the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, of the approval.
(ii) Upon notification of approval of a request for parole, the LEA will advise the Commissioner of the date, time, and place of the arrival of the alien.
The Commissioner will coordinate the arrival of the alien in parole status with the port director prior to the time of arrival.
(iii) Parole will be authorized for a period of thirty (30) days to commence upon the alien's arrival in the United States in order for the LEA to submit a completed Form I-854 to the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division. Upon the submission to the Assistant Attorney General of the Form I-854 requesting S classification, the period of parole will be automatically extended while the request is being reviewed. The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, will notify the Commissioner of the submission of a Form I-854.
(b)
Termination of parole
—(1)
General.
The Commissioner may terminate parole for any alien (including a member of the alien's family) in parole status under this section where termination is in the public interest. A district director may also terminate parole when, in the district director's opinion, termination is in the public interest and circumstances do not reasonably permit referral of the case to the Commissioner. In such a case, the Commissioner shall be notified immediately. In the event the Commissioner, or in the appropriate case, a district director, decides to terminate the parole of an alien witness or informant authorized under the terms of this paragraph, the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, and the relevant LEA shall be notified in writing to that effect. The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to that decision. Unless the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 7 days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy Attorney General for a final resolution. In no circumstances shall the alien or the relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any decision to terminate parole.
(2)
Termination of parole and admission in S classification.
When an LEA has filed a request for an alien in authorized parole status to be admitted in S nonimmigrant classification and that request has been approved by the Commissioner pursuant to the procedures outlines in 8 CFR 214.2(t), the Commissioner may, in the exercise of discretion:
(i) Terminate the alien's parole status;
(ii) Determine eligibility for waivers; and
(iii) Admit the alien in S nonimmigrant classification pursuant to the terms and conditions of section 101(a)(15(S) of the Act and 8 CFR 214.2(t).
(c)
Departure.
If the alien's parole has been terminated and the alien has been ordered excluded from the United States, the LEA shall ensure departure from the United States and so inform the district director in whose jurisdiction the alien has last resided. The district director, if necessary, shall oversee the alien's departure from the United States and, in any event, shall notify the Commissioner of the alien's departure. The Commissioner shall be notified in writing of the failure of any alien authorized parole under this paragraph to depart in accordance with an order of exclusion and deportation entered after parole authorized under this paragraph has been terminated.
(d)
Failure to comply with procedures.
Any failure to adhere to the parole procedures contained in this section shall immediately be brought to the attention of the Commissioner, who will notify the Attorney General.

§ 1212.16
Applications for exercise of discretion relating to T nonimmigrant status.
(a)
Filing the waiver application.
An alien applying for the exercise of discretion under section 212(d)(13) or (d)(3)(B) of the Act (waivers of inadmissibility) in connection with an application for T nonimmigrant status shall
submit Form I-192, with the appropriate fee in accordance with § 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter or an application for a fee waiver, to the Service with the completed Form I-914 application package for status under section 101(a)(15)(T)(i) of the Act.
(b)
Treatment of waiver application.
(1) The Service shall determine whether a ground of inadmissibility exists with respect to the alien applying for T nonimmigrant status. If a ground of inadmissibility is found, the Service shall determine if it is in the national interest to exercise discretion to waive the ground of inadmissibility, except for grounds of inadmissibility based upon sections 212(a)(3), 212(a)(10)(C) and 212(a)(10)(E) of the Act, which the Commissioner may not waive. Special consideration will be given to the granting of a waiver of a ground of inadmissibility where the activities rendering the alien inadmissible were caused by or incident to the victimization described under section 101(a)(15)(T)(i) of the Act.
(2) In the case of applicants inadmissible on criminal and related grounds under section 212(a)(2) of the Act, the Service will only exercise its discretion in exceptional cases unless the criminal activities rendering the alien inadmissible were caused by or were incident to the victimization described under section 101(a)(15)(T)(i) of the Act.
(3) An application for waiver of a ground of inadmissibility for T nonimmigrant status (other than under section 212(a)(6) of the Act) will be granted only in exceptional cases when the ground of inadmissibility would prevent or limit the ability of the applicant to adjust to permanent resident status after the conclusion of 3 years.
(4) The Service shall have sole discretion to grant or deny a waiver, and there shall be no appeal of a decision to deny a waiver. However, nothing in this paragraph (b) is intended to prevent an applicant from re-filing a request for a waiver of a ground of inadmissibility in appropriate cases.
(c)
Incident to victimization.
When an applicant for status under section 101(a)(15)(T) of the Act seeks a waiver of a ground of inadmissibility under section 212(d)(13) of the Act on grounds other than those described in sections 212(a)(1) and (a)(4) of the Act, the applicant must establish that the activities rendering him or her inadmissible were caused by, or were incident to, the victimization described in section 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I) of the Act.
(d)
Revocation.
The Commissioner may at any time revoke a waiver previously authorized under section 212(d) of the Act. Under no circumstances shall the alien or any party acting on his or her behalf have a right to appeal from a decision to revoke a waiver.

§ 1214.1
Review of requirements for admission, extension, and maintenance of status.
Every nonimmigrant alien who applies for admission to, or an extension of stay in, the United States, shall establish that he or she is admissible to the United States, or that any ground of inadmissibility has been waived under section 212(d)(3) of the Act. Upon application for admission, the alien shall present a valid passport and valid visa unless either or both documents have been waived. However, an alien applying for extension of stay shall present a passport only if requested to do so by the Service. The passport of an alien applying for admission shall be valid for a minimum of six months
from the expiration date of the contemplated period of stay, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien shall agree to abide by the terms and conditions of his or her admission. The passport of an alien applying for extension of stay shall be valid at the time of application for extension, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien shall agree to maintain the validity of his or her passport and to abide by all the terms and conditions of his extension. The alien shall also agree to depart the United States at the expiration of his or her authorized period of admission or extension, or upon abandonment of his or her authorized nonimmigrant status. At the time a nonimmigrant alien applies for admission or extension of stay he or she shall post a bond on Form I-352 in the sum of not less than $500, to insure the maintenance of his or her nonimmigrant status and departure from the United States, if required to do so by the director, immigration judge or Board of Immigration Appeals.
§ 1214.2
Review of alien victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons; aliens in pending immigration proceedings.
(a)
Applications for T visas while in proceedings.
Individuals who believe they are victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons and who are in pending immigration proceedings must inform DHS if they intend to apply for T nonimmigrant status under this section. With the concurrence of DHS counsel, a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons in proceedings before an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals may request that the proceedings be administratively closed (or that a motion to reopen or motion to reconsider be indefinitely continued) in order to allow the alien to pursue an application for T nonimmigrant status with DHS. If the alien appears eligible for T nonimmigrant status, the immigration judge or the Board, whichever has jurisdiction, may grant such a request to administratively close the proceeding or continue a motion to reopen or motion to reconsider indefinitely. In the event DHS finds an alien ineligible for T-1 nonimmigrant status, DHS may recommence proceedings that have been administratively closed by filing a motion to re-calendar with the immigration court or a motion to reinstate with the Board. If the alien is in DHS custody pending the completion of immigration proceedings, DHS may continue to detain the alien until a decision has been rendered on the application. An alien who is in custody and requests bond or a bond redetermination will be governed by the provisions of part 236 of this chapter.
(b)
Stay of final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal.
A determination by DHS that an application for T-1 nonimmigrant status is bona fide automatically stays the execution of any final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal. This stay shall remain in effect until there is a final decision on the T application. The filing of an application for T nonimmigrant status does not stay the execution of a final order unless DHS has determined that the application is bona fide. Neither an immigration judge nor the Board of Immigration Appeals has jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for a stay of execution, deportation, or removal order, on the basis of the filing of an application for T nonimmigrant status.
[68 FR 9835, Feb. 28, 2003, as amended at 86 FR 70724, Dec, 13, 2021]
§ 1214.3
Certain spouses and children of lawful permanent residents; aliens in proceedings; V visas.
An alien who is already in immigration proceedings and believes that he or she may have become eligible to apply for V nonimmigrant status should request before the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals, as appropriate, that the proceedings be administratively closed (or before the Board that a previously-filed motion for reopening or reconsideration be indefinitely continued) in order to allow the alien to pursue an application for V nonimmigrant status with the Service. If the alien appears eligible for V nonimmigrant status, the immigration judge or the Board, whichever has jurisdiction, shall administratively close the proceeding or continue the motion indefinitely. In the event that the Service finds an
alien eligible for V nonimmigrant status, the Service can adjudicate the change of status under this section. In the event that the Service finds an alien ineligible for V nonimmigrant status, the Service shall recommence proceedings by filing a motion to re-calendar.

not of a confidential or security nature the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States, (6) to have the time and opportunity to produce evidence and witnesses on his own behalf, and (7) to reasonable continuances, upon request, for good cause shown.
(c) Any special inquiry officer who is assigned to conduct the hearing provided for in this section shall have the authority to: (1) Administer oaths and affirmations, (2) present and receive evidence, (3) interrogate, examine, and cross examine under oath or affirmation both the alien and witnesses, (4) rule upon all objections to the introduction of evidence or motions made during the course of the hearing, (5) take or cause depositions to be taken, (6) issue subpoenas, and (7) take any further action consistent with applicable provisions of law, Executive orders, proclamations, and regulations.

(4) The special inquiry officer shall present on behalf of the Government such evidence, including the testimony of witnesses and the certificates or written statements of Government officials or other persons, as may be necessary and available. In the event such certificates or statements are received in evidence, the alien may request and, in the discretion of the special inquiry officer, be given an opportunity to interrogate such officials or persons, by deposition or otherwise, at a time and place and in a manner fixed by the special inquiry officer:
Provided,
That when in the judgment of the special inquiry officer any evidence relative to the disposition of the case is of a confidential or security nature the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States, such evidence shall not be presented at the hearing but shall be taken into consideration in arriving at a decision in the case.
(5) The alien may present such additional evidence, including the testimony of witnesses, as is pertinent and available.
(b) A complete verbatim transcript of the hearing, except statements made off the record shall be recorded. The alien shall be entitled, upon request, to the loan of a copy of the transcript, without cost, subject to reasonable conditions governing its use.
(c) Following the completion of the hearing, the special inquiry officer shall make and render a recommended decision in the case, which shall be governed by and based upon the evidence presented at the hearing and any evidence of a confidential or security nature which the Government may have in its possession. The decision of the special inquiry officer shall recommend: (1) That the temporary order preventing the departure of the alien from the United States be made final, or (2) that the temporary order preventing the departure of the alien from the United States be revoked. This recommended decision of the special inquiry officer shall be made in writing and shall set forth the officer's reasons for such decision. The alien concerned shall at his request be furnished a copy of the recommended decision of the special inquiry officer, and shall be allowed a reasonable time, not to exceed 10 days, in which to submit representations with respect thereto in writing.
(d) As soon as practicable after the completion of the hearing and the rendering of a decision by the special inquiry officer, the district director shall forward the entire record of the case, including the recommended decision of the special inquiry officer and any written representations submitted by the alien, to the regional commissioner having jurisdiction over his district.
After reviewing the record, the regional commissioner shall render a decision in the case, which shall be based upon the evidence in the record and on any evidence or information of a confidential or security nature which he deems pertinent. Whenever any decision is based in whole or in part on confidential or security information not included in the record, the decision shall state that such information was considered. A copy of the regional commissioner's decision shall be furnished the alien, or his attorney or representative. No administrative appeal shall lie from the regional commissioner's decision.

If the Administrator specifically requests the Commissioner to prevent the departure of a particular alien or of a group of aliens, the Commissioner shall not permit the departure of such alien or aliens until he has consulted with the Administrator.
(f) In any case arising under §§ 1215.1 to 1215.7, the Administrator shall, at his request, be kept advised, in as much detail as he may indicate is necessary, of the facts and of any action taken or proposed.
§ 1215.6

(a) In addition to the restrictions and prohibitions imposed by the provisions of this part upon the departure of aliens from the United States, any alien who seeks to depart from the Canal Zone, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or an outlying possession of the United States shall comply with such other restrictions and prohibitions as may be imposed by regulations prescribed, with the concurrence of the Administrator of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs and the Commissioner, by the Governor of the Canal Zone, the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or by the governor of an outlying possession of the United States, respectively. No alien shall be prevented from departing from such zone, territory, or possession without first being accorded a hearing as provided in §§ 1215.4 and 1215.5.
(b) The Governor of the Canal Zone, the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the governor of any outlying possession of the United States shall have the authority to designate any employee or class of employees of the United States as hearing officers for the purpose of conducting the hearing referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. The hearing officer so designated shall exercise the same powers, duties, and functions as are conferred upon special inquiry officers under the provisions of this part. The chief executive officer of such zone, territory, or possession shall, in lieu of the regional commissioner, review the recommended decision of the hearing officer, and shall render a decision in any case referred to him, basing it on evidence in the record and on any evidence or information of a confidential or a security nature which he deems pertinent.
§ 1215.7
Instructions from the Administrator required in certain cases.
In the absence of appropriate instructions from the Administrator of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, departure-control officers shall not exercise the authority conferred by § 1215.2 in the case of any alien who seeks to depart from the United States in the status of a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15) (A) or (G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or in the status of a nonimmigrant under section 11(3), 11(4), or 11(5) of the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations (61 Stat. 756):
Provided,
That in cases of extreme urgency, where the national
security so requires, a departure-control officer may preliminarily exercise the authority conferred by § 1215.2 pending the outcome of consultation with the Administrator, which shall be undertaken immediately. In all cases arising under this section, the decision of the Administrator shall be controlling:
Provided,
That any decision to prevent the departure of an alien shall be based upon a hearing and record as prescribed in this part.

§ 1216.1
Definition of conditional permanent resident.
A
conditional permanent resident
is an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence within the meaning of section 101(a)(20) of the Act, except that a conditional permanent resident is also subject to the conditions and responsibilities set forth in section 216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is applicable, and part 216 of this chapter. Unless otherwise specified, the rights, privileges, responsibilities and duties which apply to all other lawful permanent residents apply equally to conditional permanent residents, including but not limited to the right to apply for naturalization (if otherwise eligible), the right to file petitions on behalf of qualifying relatives, the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such status not having changed; the duty to register with the Selective Service System, when required; and the responsibility for complying with all laws and regulations of the United States. All references within this chapter to lawful permanent residents apply equally to conditional permanent residents, unless otherwise specified. The conditions of section 216 of the Act shall not apply to lawful permanent resident status based on a self-petitioning relationship under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 204(a)(1)(b)(ii), or 204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act or based on eligibility as the derivative child of a self-petitioning spouse under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) or 204(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, regardless of the date on which the marriage to the abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident occurred.
[53 FR 30018, Aug. 10, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 26590, May 23, 1994; 61 FR 13079, Mar. 26, 1996]
§ 1216.2
Notification requirements.
(a)
When alien acquires status of conditional permanent resident.
At the time an alien acquires conditional permanent residence through admission to the United States with an immigrant visa or adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, the Service shall notify the alien of the conditional basis of the alien's status, of the requirement that the alien apply for removal of the conditions within the ninety days immediately preceding the second anniversary of the alien's having been granted such status, and that failure to apply for removal of the conditions will result in automatic termination of the alien's lawful status in the United States.
(b)
When alien is required to apply for removal of the conditional basis of lawful permanent resident status.
Approximately 90 days before the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained conditional permanent residence, the Service should notify the alien a second time of the requirement that the alien and the petitioning spouse or alien entrepreneur must file
a petition to remove the conditional basis of the alien's lawful permanent residence. Such notification shall be mailed to the alien's last known address.
(c)
Effect of failure to provide notification.
Failure of the Service to provide notification as required by either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section does not relieve the alien and the petitioning spouse, or alien entrepreneur of the requirement to file a petition to remove conditions within the 90 days immediately preceding the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained permanent residence.
[53 FR 30018, Aug. 10, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 26590, May 23, 1994]
§ 1216.3
Termination of conditional resident status.
(a)
During the two-year conditional period.
The director shall send a formal written notice to the conditional permanent resident of the termination of the alien's conditional permanent resident status if the director determines that any of the conditions set forth in section 216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable, are true, or it becomes known to the government that an alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her investment capital through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs). If the Service issues a notice of intent to terminate an alien's conditional resident status, the director shall not adjudicate Form I-751 or Form I-829 until it has been determined that the alien's status will not be terminated. During this time, the alien shall continue to be a lawful conditional permanent resident with all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities provided to persons possessing such status. Prior to issuing the notice of termination, the director shall provide the alien with an opportunity to review and rebut the evidence upon which the decision is to be based, in accordance with § 103.2(b)(2) of 8 CFR chapter I. The termination of status, and all of the rights and privileges concomitant thereto (including authorization to accept or continue in employment in this country), shall take effect as of the date of such determination by the director, although the alien may request a review of such determination in removal proceedings. In addition to the notice of termination, the director shall issue a notice to appear in accordance with 8 CFR part 1239. During the ensuing removal proceedings, the alien may submit evidence to rebut the determination of the director. The burden of proof shall be on the Service to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that one or more of the conditions in section 216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable, are true, or that an alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her investment capital through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs).
(b)
Determination of fraud after two years.
If, subsequent to the removal of the conditional basis of an alien's permanent resident status, the director determines that an alien spouse obtained permanent resident status through a marriage which was entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws or an alien entrepreneur obtained permanent resident status through a commercial enterprise which was improper under section 216A(b)(1) of the Act, the director may institute rescission proceedings pursuant to section 246 of the Act (if otherwise appropriate) or removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act.
[62 FR 10349, Mar. 6, 1997]
§ 1216.4
Joint petition to remove conditional basis of lawful permanent resident status for alien spouse.
(a)
Filing the petition
—(1)
General procedures.
Within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained permanent residence, the alien and the alien's spouse who filed the original immigrant visa petition or fiance/fiancee petition through which the alien obtained permanent residence must file a Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence (Form I-751) with the Service. The petition shall be filed within this time period regardless of the amount of physical presence which the alien has accumulated in the United States. Before Form I-751 may be considered as properly filed, it must
be accompanied by the fee required under 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106 and by documentation as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and it must be properly signed by the alien and the alien's spouse. If the joint petition cannot be filed due to the termination of the marriage through annulment, divorce, or the death of the petitioning spouse, or if the petitioning spouse refuses to join in the filing of the petition, the conditional permanent resident may apply for a waiver of the requirement to file the joint petition in accordance with the provisions of § 1216.5 of this part. Upon receipt of a properly filed Form I-751, the alien's conditional permanent resident status shall be extended automatically, if necessary, until such time as the director has adjudicated the petition.
(2)
Dependent children.
Dependent children of a conditional permanent resident who acquired conditional permanent resident status concurrently with the parent may be included in the joint petition filed by the parent and the parent's petitioning spouse. A child shall be deemed to have acquired conditional residence status concurrently with the parent if the child's residence was acquired on the same date or within 90 days thereafter. Children who cannot be included in a joint petition filed by the parent and parent's petitioning spouse due to the child's not having acquired conditional resident status concurrently with the parent, the death of the parent, or other reasons may file a separate Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence (Form I-751).
(3)
Jurisdiction.
Form I-751 shall be filed with the director of the regional service center having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence.
(4)
Physical presence at time of filing.
A petition may be filed regardless of whether the alien is physically present in the United States. However, if the alien is outside the United States at the time of filing, he or she must return to the United States, with his or her spouse and dependent children, to comply with the interview requirements contained in the Act. Furthermore, if the documentation submitted in support of the petition includes affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides of the marital relationship, the petitioner must arrange for the affiants to be present at the interview, at no expense to the government. Once the petition has been properly filed, the alien may travel outside the United States and return if in possession of documentation as set forth in § 1211.1(b)(1) of this chapter, provided the alien and the petitioning spouse comply with the interview requirements described in § 1216.4(b). An alien who is not physically present in the United States during the filing period but subsequently applies for admission to the United States shall be processed in accordance with § 1235.11 of this chapter.
(5)
Documentation.
Form I-751 shall be accompanied by evidence that the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws of the United States. Such evidence may include:
(i) Documentation showing joint ownership of property;
(ii) Lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence;
(iii) Documentation showing commingling of financial resources;
(iv) Birth certificates of children born to the marriage;
(v) Affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides of the marital relationship, or
(vi) Other documentation establishing that the marriage was not entered into in order to evade the immigration laws of the United States.
(6)
Termination of status for failure to file petition.
Failure to properly file Form I-751 within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained lawful permanent residence on a conditional basis shall result in the automatic termination of the alien's permanent residence status and the initiation of proceedings to remove the alien from the United States. In such proceedings the burden shall be on the alien to establish that he or she complied with the requirement to file the joint petition within the designated period. Form I-751 may be filed after the expiration of the 90-day period only if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the director, in writing,
that there was good cause for the failure to file Form I-751 within the required time period. If the joint petition is filed prior to the jurisdiction vesting with the immigration judge in removal proceedings and the director excuses the late filing and approves the petition, he or she shall restore the alien's permanent residence status, remove the conditional basis of such status and cancel any outstanding notice to appear in accordance with § 1239.2 of this chapter. If the joint petition is not filed until after jurisdiction vests with the immigration judge, the immigration judge may terminate the matter upon joint motion by the alien and the Service.
(b)
Interview
—(1)
Authority to waive interview.
The director of the regional service center shall review the Form I-751 filed by the alien and the alien's spouse to determine whether to waive the interview required by the Act. If satisfied that the marriage was not for the purpose of evading the immigration laws, the regional service center director may waive the interview and approve the petition. If not so satisfied, then the regional service center director shall forward the petition to the district director having jurisdiction over the place of the alien's residence so that an interview of both the alien and the alien's spouse may be conducted. The director must either waive the requirement for an interview and adjudicate the petition or arrange for an interview within 90 days of the date on which the petition was properly filed.
(2)
Location of interview.
Unless waived, an interview on the Form I-751 shall be conducted by an immigration examiner or other officer so designated by the district director at the district office, files control office or suboffice having jurisdiction over the residence of the joint petitioners.
(3)
Termination of status for failure to appear for interview.
If the conditional resident alien and/or the petitioning spouse fail to appear for an interview in connection with the joint petition required by section 216(c) of the Act, the alien's permanent residence status will be automatically terminated as of the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained permanent residence. The alien shall be provided with written notification of the termination and the reasons therefor, and a notice to appear shall be issued placing the alien under removal proceedings. The alien may seek review of the decision to terminate his or her status in such proceedings, but the burden shall be on the alien to establish compliance with the interview requirements. If the alien submits a written request that the interview be rescheduled or that the interview be waived, and the director determines that there is good cause for granting the request, the interview may be rescheduled or waived, as appropriate. If the interview is rescheduled at the request of the petitioners, the Service shall not be required to conduct the interview within the 90-day period following the filing of the petition.
(c)
Adjudication of petition.
The director shall adjudicate the petition within 90 days of the date of the interview, unless the interview is waived in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In adjudicating the petition the director shall determine whether—
(1) The qualifying marriage was entered into in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place;
(2) The qualifying marriage has been judicially annulled or terminated, other than through the death of a spouse;
(3) The qualifying marriage was entered into for the purpose of procuring permanent residence status for the alien; or
(4) A fee or other consideration was given (other than a fee or other consideration to an attorney for assistance in preparation of a lawful petition) in connection with the filing of the petition through which the alien obtained conditional permanent residence. If derogatory information is determined regarding any of these issues, the director shall offer the petitioners the opportunity to rebut such information. If the petitioners fail to overcome such derogatory information the director may deny the joint petition, terminate the alien's permanent residence, and issue a notice to appear to initiate removal proceedings. If derogatory information not relating to any of these
issues is determined during the course of the interview, such information shall be forwarded to the investigations unit for appropriate action. If no unresolved derogatory information is determined relating to these issues, the petition shall be approved and the conditional basis of the alien's permanent residence status removed, regardless of any action taken or contemplated regarding other possible grounds for removal.
(d)
Decision
—(1)
Approval.
If the director approves the joint petition he or she shall provide written notice of the decision to the alien and shall require the alien to report to the appropriate office of the Service for processing for a new Permanent Resident Card (if necessary), at which time the alien shall surrender any Permanent Resident Card previously issued.
(2)
Denial.
If the director denies the joint petition, he or she shall provide written notice to the alien of the decision and the reason(s) therefor and shall issue a notice to appear under section 239 of the Act and 8 CFR part 1239. The alien's lawful permanent resident status shall be terminated as of the date of the director's written decision. The alien shall also be instructed to surrender any Permanent Resident Card previously issued by the Service. No appeal shall lie from the decision of the director; however, the alien may seek review of the decision in removal proceedings. In such proceedings the burden of proof shall be on the Service to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts and information set forth by the petitioners are not true or that the petition was properly denied.

§ 1216.5
Waiver of requirement to file joint petition to remove conditions by alien spouse.
(a)
General.
(1) A conditional resident alien who is unable to meet the requirements under section 216 of the Act for a joint petition for removal of the conditional basis of his or her permanent resident status may file Form I-751, Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence, if the alien requests a waiver, was not at fault in failing to meet the filing requirement, and the conditional resident alien is able to establish that:
(i) Deportation or removal from the United States would result in extreme hardship;
(ii) The marriage upon which his or her status was based was entered into in good faith by the conditional resident alien, but the marriage was terminated other than by death, and the conditional resident was not at fault in failing to file a timely petition; or
(iii) The qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the conditional resident but during the marriage the alien spouse or child was battered by or subjected to extreme cruelty committed by the citizen or permanent resident spouse or parent.
(2) A conditional resident who is in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings may apply for the waiver only until such time as there is a final order of exclusion, deportation or removal.
(b)
Fee.
Form I-751 shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee required under 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106.
(c)
Jurisdiction.
Form I-751 shall be filed with the regional service center director having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence.
(d)
Interview.
The service center director may refer the application to the appropriate local office and require that the alien appear for an interview in connection with the application for a waiver. The director shall deny the application and initiate removal proceedings if the alien fails to appear for the interview as required, unless the alien establishes good cause for such failure and the interview is rescheduled.
(e)
Adjudication of waiver application
—(1)
Application based on claim of hardship.
In considering an application for a waiver based upon an alien's claim that extreme hardship would result from the alien's removal from the United States, the director shall take into account only those factors that arose subsequent to the alien's entry as a conditional permanent resident. The director shall bear in mind that any removal from the United States is likely
to result in a certain degree of hardship, and that only in those cases where the hardship is extreme should the application for a waiver be granted. The burden of establishing that extreme hardship exists rests solely with the applicant.
(2)
Application for waiver based upon the alien's claim that the marriage was entered into in good faith.
In considering whether an alien entered into a qualifying marriage in good faith, the director shall consider evidence relating to the amount of commitment by both parties to the marital relationship. Such evidence may include—
(i) Documentation relating to the degree to which the financial assets and liabilities of the parties were combined;
(ii) Documentation concerning the length of time during which the parties cohabited after the marriage and after the alien obtained permanent residence;
(iii) Birth certificates of children born to the marriage; and
(iv) Other evidence deemed pertinent by the director.
(3)
Application for waiver based on alien's claim of having been battered or subjected to extreme mental cruelty.
A conditional resident who entered into the qualifying marriage in good faith, and who was battered or was the subject of extreme cruelty or whose child was battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by the United States citizen or permanent resident spouse during the marriage, may request a waiver of the joint filing requirement. The conditional resident parent of a battered or abused child may apply for the waiver regardless of the child's citizenship or immigration status.
(i) For the purpose of this chapter the phrase “was battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty” includes, but is not limited to, being the victim of any act or threatened act of violence, including any forceful detention, which results or threatens to result in physical or mental injury. Psychological or sexual abuse or exploitation, including rape, molestation, incest (if the victim is a minor) or forced prostitution shall be considered acts of violence.
(ii) A conditional resident or former conditional resident who has not departed the United States after termination of resident status may apply for the waiver. The conditional resident may apply for the waiver regardless of his or her present marital status. The conditional resident may still be residing with the citizen or permanent resident spouse, or may be divorced or separated.
(iii) Evidence of physical abuse may include, but is not limited to, expert testimony in the form of reports and affidavits from police, judges, medical personnel, school officials and social service agency personnel. The Service must be satisfied with the credibility of the sources of documentation submitted in support of the application.
(iv) The Service is not in a position to evaluate testimony regarding a claim of extreme mental cruelty provided by unlicensed or untrained individuals. Therefore, all waiver applications based upon claims of extreme mental cruelty must be supported by the evaluation of a professional recognized by the Service as an expert in the field. An evaluation which was obtained in the course of the divorce proceedings may be submitted if it was provided by a professional recognized by the Service as an expert in the field.
(v) The evaluation must contain the professional's full name, professional address and license number. It must also identify the licensing, certifying, or registering authority. The Service retains the right to verify the professional's license.
(vi) The Service's decision on extreme mental cruelty waivers will be based upon the evaluation of the recognized professional. The Service reserves the right to request additional evaluations from expert witnesses chosen by the Service. Requests for additional evaluations must be authorized by the Assistant Regional Commissioner for Adjudications.
(vii) Licensed clinical social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists are professionals recognized by the Service for the purpose of this section. A clinical social worker who is not licensed only because the state in which he or she practices does not provide for licensing will be considered a licensed
professional recognized by the Service if he or she is included in the Register of Clinical Social Workers published by the National Association of Social Workers or is certified by the American Board of Examiners in Clinical Social Work.
(viii) As directed by the statute, the information contained in the application and supporting documents shall not be released without a court order or the written consent of the applicant; or, in the case of a child, the written consent of the parent or legal guardian who filed the waiver application on the child's behalf. Information may be released only to the applicant, his or her authorized representative, an officer of the Department of Justice, or any federal or State law enforcement agency. Any information provided under this part may be used for the purposes of enforcement of the Act or in any criminal proceeding.
(f)
Decision.
The director shall provide the alien with written notice of the decision on the application for waiver. If the decision is adverse, the director shall advise the alien of the reasons therefor, notify the alien of the termination of his or her permanent residence status, instruct the alien to surrender any Permanent Resident Card issued by the Service and issue a notice to appear placing the alien in removal proceedings. No appeal shall lie from the decision of the director; however, the alien may seek review of such decision in removal proceedings.

§ 1216.6
Petition by entrepreneur to remove conditional basis of lawful permanent resident status.
(a)
Filing the petition
—(1)
General procedures.
A petition to remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status of an alien accorded conditional permanent residence pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act must be filed by the alien entrepreneur on Form I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions. The alien entrepreneur must file Form I-829 within the 90-day period preceding the second anniversary of his or her admission to the United States as a conditional permanent resident. Before Form I-829 may be considered as properly filed, it must be accompanied by the fee required under 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106, and by documentation as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and it must be properly signed by the alien. Upon receipt of a properly filed Form I-829, the alien's conditional permanent resident status shall be extended automatically, if necessary, until such time as the director has adjudicated the petition. The entrepreneur's spouse and children should be included in the petition to remove conditions. Children who have reached the age of twenty-one or who have married during the period of conditional permanent residence and the former spouse of an entrepreneur, who was divorced from the entrepreneur during the period of conditional permanent residence, may be included in the alien entrepreneur's petition or may file a separate petition.
(2)
Jurisdiction.
Form I-829 must be filed with the regional service center having jurisdiction over the location of the alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States.
(3)
Physical presence at time of filing.
A petition may be filed regardless of whether the alien is physically present in the United States. However, if the alien is outside the United States at the time of filing, he or she must return to the United States, with his or her spouse and children, if necessary, to comply with the interview requirements contained in the Act. Once the petition has been properly filed, the alien may travel outside the United States and return if in possession of documentation as set forth in § 1211.1(b)(1) of this chapter, provided the alien complies with the interview requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section. An alien who is not physically present in the United States during the filing period but subsequently applies for admission to the United States shall be processed in accordance with § 1235.11 of this chapter.
(4)
Documentation.
The petition for removal of conditions must be accompanied by the following evidence:
(i) Evidence that a commercial enterprise was established by the alien.
Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, Federal income tax returns;
(ii) Evidence that the alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, an audited financial statement or other probative evidence; and
(iii) Evidence that the alien sustained the actions described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section throughout the period of the alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to have sustained the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional residence. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bank statements, invoices, receipts, contracts, business licenses, Federal or State income tax returns, and Federal or State quarterly tax statements.
(iv) Evidence that the alien created or can be expected to create within a reasonable time ten full-time jobs for qualifying employees. In the case of a “troubled business” as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), the alien entrepreneur must submit evidence that the commercial enterprise maintained the number of existing employees at no less than the pre-investment level for the period following his or her admission as a conditional permanent resident. Such evidence may include payroll records, relevant tax documents, and Forms I-9.
(5)
Termination of status for failure to file petition.
Failure to properly file Form I-829 within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained lawful permanent residence on a conditional basis shall result in the automatic termination of the alien's permanent resident status and the initiation of deportation proceedings. The director shall send a written notice of termination and an order to show cause to an alien entrepreneur who fails to timely file a petition for removal of conditions. No appeal shall lie from this decision; however, the alien may request a review of the determination during deportation proceedings. In deportation proceedings, the burden of proof shall rest with the alien to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she complied with the requirement to file the petition within the designated period. The director may deem the petition to have been filed prior to the second anniversary of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent resident status and accept and consider a late petition if the alien demonstrates to the director's satisfaction that failure to file a timely petition was for good cause and due to extenuating circumstances. If the late petition is filed prior to jurisdiction vesting with the immigration judge in deportation proceedings and the director excuses the late filing and approves the petition, he or she shall restore the alien's permanent resident status, remove the conditional basis of such status, and cancel any outstanding order to show cause in accordance with § 242.7 of 8 CFR chapter I. If the petition is not filed until after jurisdiction vests with the immigration judge, the immigration judge may terminate the matter upon joint motion by the alien and the Service.
(6)
Death of entrepreneur and effect on spouse and children.
If an entrepreneur dies during the prescribed two-year period of conditional permanent residence, the spouse and children of the entrepreneur will be eligible for removal of conditions if it can be demonstrated that the conditions set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section have been met.
(b)
Petition review
—(1)
Authority to waive interview.
The director of the service center shall review the Form I-829 and the supporting documents to determine whether to waive the interview required by the Act. If satisfied that the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section have been met, the service center director may waive the interview and approve the petition. If not so satisfied, then the service center director shall forward the petition to the district director having jurisdiction over the location of the alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States
so that an interview of the alien entrepreneur may be conducted. The director must either waive the requirement for an interview and adjudicate the petition or arrange for an interview within 90 days of the date on which the petition was properly filed.
(2)
Location of interview.
Unless waived, an interview relating to the Form I-829 shall be conducted by an immigration examiner or other officer so designated by the district director at the district office that has jurisdiction over the location of the alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States.
(3)
Termination of status for failure to appear for interview.
If the alien fails to appear for an interview in connection with the petition when requested by the Service, the alien's permanent resident status will be automatically terminated as of the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained permanent residence. The alien will be provided with written notification of the termination and the reasons therefore, and an order to show cause shall be issued placing the alien under deportation proceedings. The alien may seek review of the decision to terminate his or her status in such proceedings, but the burden shall be on the alien to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she complied with the interview requirements. If the alien has failed to appear for a scheduled interview, he or she may submit a written request to the district director asking that the interview be rescheduled or that the interview be waived. That request should explain his or her failure to appear for the scheduled interview, and if a request for waiver of the interview, the reasons such waiver should be granted. If the district director determines that there is good cause for granting the request, the interview may be rescheduled or waived, as appropriate. If the district director waives the interview, he or she shall restore the alien's conditional permanent resident status, cancel any outstanding order to show cause in accordance with § 1216.6(a)(5), and proceed to adjudicate the alien's petition. If the district director reschedules that alien's interview, he or she shall restore the alien's conditional permanent resident status, and cancel any outstanding order to show cause in accordance with § 1216.6(a)(5). If the interview is rescheduled at the request of the alien, the Service shall not be required to conduct the interview within the 90-day period following the filing of the petition.
(c)
Adjudication of petition.
(1) The decision on the petition shall be made within 90 days of the date of filing or within 90 days of the interview, whichever is later. In adjudicating the petition, the director shall determine whether:
(i) A commercial enterprise was established by the alien;
(ii) The alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital; and
(iii) The alien sustained the actions described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section throughout the period of the alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to have sustained the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional residence.
(iv) The alien created or can be expected to create within a reasonable period of time ten full-time jobs to qualifying employees. In the case of a “troubled business” as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), the alien maintained the number of existing employees at no less than the pre-investment level for the previous two years.
(2) If derogatory information is determined regarding any of these issues or it becomes known to the government that the entrepreneur obtained his or her investment funds through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs), the director shall offer the alien entrepreneur the opportunity to rebut such information. If the alien entrepreneur fails to overcome such derogatory information or evidence the investment funds were obtained through other than legal means, the director may deny the petition, terminate the alien's permanent resident status, and issue an order to show cause. If derogatory information not
relating to any of these issues is determined during the course of the interview, such information shall be forwarded to the investigations unit for appropriate action. If no unresolved derogatory information is determined relating to these issues, the petition shall be approved and the conditional basis of the alien's permanent resident status removed, regardless of any action taken or contemplated regarding other possible grounds for deportation.
(d)
Decision
—(1)
Approval.
If, after initial review or after the interview, the director approves the petition, he or she will remove the conditional basis of the alien's permanent resident status as of the second anniversary of the alien's entry as a conditional permanent resident. He or she shall provide written notice of the decision to the alien and shall require the alien to report to the appropriate district office for processing for a new Permanent Resident Card, Form I-551, at which time the alien shall surrender any Permanent Resident Card previously issued.
(2)
Denial.
If, after initial review or after the interview, the director denies the petition, he or she shall provide written notice to the alien of the decision and the reason(s) therefor, and shall issue an order to show cause why the alien should not be deported from the United States. The alien's lawful permanent resident status and that of his or her spouse and any children shall be terminated as of the date of the director's written decision. The alien shall also be instructed to surrender any Permanent Resident Card previously issued by the Service. No appeal shall lie from this decision; however, the alien may seek review of the decision in deportation proceedings. In deportation proceedings, the burden shall rest with the Service to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts and information in the alien's petition for removal of conditions are not true and that the petition was properly denied.

§ 1235.4
Withdrawal of application for admission.
The Attorney General may, in his or her discretion, permit any alien applicant for admission to withdraw his or her application for admission in lieu of removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act or expedited removal under section 235(b)(1) of the Act. The alien's decision to withdraw his or her application for admission must be made voluntarily, but nothing in this section shall be construed as to give an alien the right to withdraw his or her application for admission. Permission to withdraw an application for admission should not normally be granted unless the alien intends and is able to depart the United States immediately. An alien permitted to withdraw his or her application for admission shall normally remain in carrier or Service custody pending departure, unless the district director determines that parole of the alien is warranted in accordance with § 1212.5(b) of this chapter.

Referral by Form I-862, Notice to Appear.
An immigration officer or asylum officer will sign and deliver a Form I-862 to an alien in the following cases:
(i) If, in accordance with the provisions of section 235(b)(2)(A) of the Act, the examining immigration officer detains an alien for a proceeding before an immigration judge under section 240 of the Act; or
(ii) If an immigration officer verifies that an alien subject to expedited removal under section 235(b)(1) of the Act has been admitted as a lawful permanent resident or refugee, or granted asylum, or, upon review pursuant to § 235.3(b)(5)(iv) of chapter I, an immigration judge determines that the alien was once so admitted or granted asylum, provided that such status has not been terminated by final administrative action, and DHS initiates removal proceedings against the alien under section 240 of the Act.
(2)
Referral by Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge.
An immigration officer will sign and deliver a Form I-863 to an alien in the following cases:
(i) If an asylum officer determines that an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution or torture, and the alien requests a review of that determination by an immigration judge;
(ii) If, in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(C) of the Act, an immigration officer refers an expedited removal order entered on an alien claiming to be a lawful permanent resident, refugee, asylee, or U.S. citizen for whom the officer could not verify such status to an immigration judge for review of the order; or
(iii) If an immigration officer refers an applicant in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 208.2(b) to an immigration judge.
(b)
Certification for mental condition; medical appeal.
An alien certified under sections 212(a)(1) and 232(b) of the Act shall be advised by the examining immigration officer that he or she may appeal to a board of medical examiners of the United States Public Health Service pursuant to section 232 of the Act. If such appeal is taken, the district director shall arrange for the convening of the medical board.
(c) The provisions of part 1235 are separate and severable from one another. In the event that any provision in part 1235 is stayed, enjoined, not implemented, or otherwise held invalid, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be implemented as an independent rule and continue in effect.

For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
§ 1235.6
Referral to immigration judge.
(a) * * *
(2) * * *
(i) If an asylum officer determines that an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution, reasonable possibility of persecution, reasonable possibility of torture, or has not established that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured in the prospective country of removal, and the alien requests a review of that determination by an immigration judge; or
§ 1235.8
Inadmissibility on security and related grounds.
(a)
Report.
When an immigration officer or an immigration judge suspects that an arriving alien appears to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(3)(A) (other than clause (ii)), (B), or (C) of the Act, the immigration officer or immigration judge shall order the alien removed and report the action promptly to the district director who has administrative jurisdiction over the place where the alien has arrived or where the hearing is being held. The immigration officer shall, if possible, take a
brief sworn question-and-answer statement from the alien, and the alien shall be notified by personal service of Form I-147, Notice of Temporary Inadmissibility, of the action taken and the right to submit a written statement and additional information for consideration by the Attorney General. The district director shall forward the report to the regional director for further action as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Action by regional director.
(1) In accordance with section 235(c)(2)(B) of the Act, the regional director may deny any further inquiry or hearing by an immigration judge and order the alien removed by personal service of Form I-148, Notice of Permanent Inadmissibility, or issue any other order disposing of the case that the regional director considers appropriate.
(2) If the regional director concludes that the case does not meet the criteria contained in section 235(c)(2)(B) of the Act, the regional director may direct that:
(i) An immigration officer shall conduct a further examination of the alien, concerning the alien's admissibility; or,
(ii) The alien's case be referred to an immigration judge for a hearing, or for the continuation of any prior hearing.
(3) The regional director's decision shall be in writing and shall be signed by the regional director. Unless the written decision contains confidential information, the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety, or security of the United States, the written decision shall be served on the alien. If the written decision contains such confidential information, the alien shall be served with a separate written order showing the disposition of the case, but with the confidential information deleted.
(4) The Service shall not execute a removal order under this section under circumstances that violate section 241(b)(3) of the Act or Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. The provisions of part 1208 of this chapter relating to consideration or review by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or an asylum officer shall not apply.
(c)
Finality of decision.
The regional director's decision under this section is final when it is served upon the alien in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. There is no administrative appeal from the regional director's decision.
(d)
Hearing by immigration judge.
If the regional director directs that an alien subject to removal under this section be given a hearing or further hearing before an immigration judge, the hearing and all further proceedings in the matter shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 240 of the Act and other applicable sections of the Act to the same extent as though the alien had been referred to an immigration judge by the examining immigration officer. In a case where the immigration judge ordered the alien removed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Service shall refer the case back to the immigration judge and proceedings shall be automatically reopened upon receipt of the notice of referral. If confidential information, not previously considered in the matter, is presented supporting the inadmissibility of the alien under section 212(a)(3)(A) (other than clause (ii)), (B) or (C) of the Act, the disclosure of which, in the discretion of the immigration judge, may be prejudicial to the public interest, safety, or security, the immigration judge may again order the alien removed under the authority of section 235(c) of the Act and further action shall be taken as provided in this section.
(e)
Nonapplicability.
The provisions of this section shall apply only to arriving aliens, as defined in § 1001.1(q) of this chapter. Aliens present in the United States who have not been admitted or paroled may be subject to proceedings under Title V of the Act.
[62 FR 10358, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 64 FR 8494, Feb. 19, 1999]
§ 1235.9
Northern Marianas identification card.
During the two-year period that ended July 1, 1990, the Service issued Northern Marianas Identification Cards to aliens who acquired United States citizenship when the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political
Union with the United States entered into force on November 3, 1986. These cards remain valid as evidence of United States citizenship. Although the Service no longer issues these cards, a United States citizen to whom a card was issued may file Form I-777, Application for Issuance or Replacement of Northern Marianas Card, to obtain replacement of a lost, stolen, or mutilated Northern Marianas Identification Card.
[62 FR 10359, Mar. 6, 1997]
§ 1235.10
U.S. Citizen Identification Card.
(a)
General.
Form I-197, U.S. Citizen Identification Card, is no longer issued by the Service but valid existing cards will continue to be acceptable documentation of U.S. citizenship. Possession of the identification card is not mandatory for any purpose. A U.S. Citizen Identification Card remains the property of the United States. Because the identification card is no longer issued, there are no provisions for replacement cards.
(b)
Surrender and voidance
—(1)
Institution of proceeding under section 240 or 342 of the Act.
A U.S. Citizen Identification Card must be surrendered provisionally to a Service office upon notification by the district director that a proceeding under section 240 or 342 of the Act is being instituted against the person to whom the card was issued. The card shall be returned to the person if the final order in the proceeding does not result in voiding the card under this paragraph. A U.S. Citizen Identification Card is automatically void if the person to whom it was issued is determined to be an alien in a proceeding conducted under section 240 of the Act, or if a certificate, document, or record relating to that person is canceled under section 342 of the Act.
(2)
Investigation of validity of identification card.
A U.S. Citizen Identification Card must be surrendered provisionally upon notification by a district director that the validity of the card is being investigated. The card shall be returned to the person who surrendered it if the investigation does not result in a determination adverse to his or her claim to be a United States citizen. When an investigation results in a tentative determination adverse to the applicant's claim to be a United States citizen, the applicant shall be notified by certified mail directed to his or her last known address. The notification shall inform the applicant of the basis for the determination and of the intention of the district director to declare the card void unless within 30 days the applicant objects and demands an opportunity to see and rebut the adverse evidence. Any rebuttal, explanation, or evidence presented by the applicant must be included in the record of proceeding. The determination whether the applicant is a United States citizen must be based on the entire record and the applicant shall be notified of the determination. If it is determined that the applicant is not a United States citizen, the applicant shall be notified of the reasons, and the card deemed void. There is no appeal from the district director's decision.
(3)
Admission of alienage.
A U.S. Citizen Identification Card is void if the person to whom it was issued admits in a statement signed before an immigration officer that he or she is an alien and consents to the voidance of the card. Upon signing the statement the card must be surrendered to the immigration officer.
(4)
Surrender of void card.
A void U.S. Citizen Identification Card which has not been returned to the Service must be surrendered without delay to an immigration officer or to the issuing office of the Service.
(c)
U.S. Citizen Identification Card previously issued on Form I-179.
A valid Form I-179, U.S. Citizen Identification Card, continues to be valid subject to the provisions of this section.
[62 FR 10359, Mar. 6, 1997]
§ 1235.11
Admission of conditional permanent residents.
(a)
General
—(1)
Conditional residence based on family relationship.
An alien seeking admission to the United States with an immigrant visa as the spouse or son or daughter of a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident shall be examined to determine whether the conditions of section 216 of the Act apply. If so, the alien shall be admitted conditionally for a period of 2 years. At the time of admission, the
alien shall be notified that the alien and his or her petitioning spouse must file a Form I-751, Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence, within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the alien's admission for permanent residence.
(2)
Conditional residence based on entrepreneurship.
An alien seeking admission to the United States with an immigrant visa as an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act) or the spouse or unmarried minor child of an alien entrepreneur shall be admitted conditionally for a period of 2 years. At the time of admission, the alien shall be notified that the principal alien (entrepreneur) must file a Form I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions, within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the alien's admission for permanent residence.
(b)
Correction of endorsement on immigrant visa.
If the alien is subject to the provisions of section 216 of the Act, but the classification endorsed on the immigrant visa does not so indicate, the endorsement shall be corrected and the alien shall be admitted as a lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis, if otherwise admissible. Conversely, if the alien is not subject to the provisions of section 216 of the Act, but the visa classification endorsed on the immigrant visa indicates that the alien is subject thereto (e.g., if the second anniversary of the marriage upon which the immigrant visa is based occurred after the issuance of the visa and prior to the alien's application for admission) the endorsement on the visa shall be corrected and the alien shall be admitted as a lawful permanent resident without conditions, if otherwise admissible.
(c)
Expired conditional permanent resident status.
The lawful permanent resident alien status of a conditional resident automatically terminates if the conditional basis of such status is not removed by the Service through approval of a Form I-751, Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence or, in the case of an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), Form I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions. Therefore, an alien who is seeking admission as a returning resident subsequent to the second anniversary of the date on which conditional residence was obtained (except as provided in § 1211.1(b)(1) of this chapter) and whose conditional basis of such residence has not been removed pursuant to section 216(c) or 216A(c) of the Act, whichever is applicable, shall be placed under removal proceedings. However, in a case where conditional residence was based on a marriage, removal proceedings may be terminated and the alien may be admitted as a returning resident if the required Form I-751 is filed jointly, or by the alien alone (if appropriate), and approved by the Service. In the case of an alien entrepreneur, removal proceedings may be terminated and the alien admitted as a returning resident if the required Form I-829 is filed by the alien entrepreneur and approved by the Service.

§ 1236.1
Apprehension, custody, and detention.
(a)
Detainers.
The issuance of a detainer under this section shall be governed by the provisions of § 287.7 of 8 CFR chapter I.
(b)
Warrant of arrest
—(1)
In general.
At the time of issuance of the notice to appear, or at any time thereafter and up to the time removal proceedings are completed, the respondent may be arrested and taken into custody under the authority of Form I-200, Warrant of Arrest. A warrant of arrest may be issued only by those immigration officers listed in § 287.5(e)(2) of 8 CFR chapter I and may be served only by those immigration officers listed in § 287.5(e)(3) of 8 CFR chapter I.
(2) If, after the issuance of a warrant of arrest, a determination is made not to serve it, any officer authorized to issue such warrant may authorize its cancellation.
(c)

—(1)
In general.
(i) After the expiration of the Transition Period Custody Rules (TPCR) set forth in section 303(b)(3) of Div. C of Pub. L. 104-208, no alien described in section 236(c)(1) of the Act may be released from custody during removal proceedings except pursuant to section 236(c)(2) of the Act.
(ii) Paragraph (c)(2) through (c)(8) of this section shall govern custody determinations for aliens subject to the TPCR while they remain in effect. For purposes of this section, an alien “subject to the TPCR” is an alien described in section 303(b)(3)(A) of Div. C of Pub. L. 104-208 who is in deportation proceedings, subject to a final order of deportation, or in removal proceedings. The TPCR do not apply to aliens in exclusion proceedings under former section 236 of the Act, aliens in expedited removal proceedings under section 235(b)(1) of the Act, or aliens subject to a final order of removal.
(2)
Aliens not lawfully admitted.
Subject to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, but notwithstanding any other provision within this section, an alien subject to the TPCR who is not lawfully admitted is not eligible to be considered for release from custody.
(i) An alien who remains in status as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, conditionally admitted for permanent residence, or lawfully admitted for temporary residence is “lawfully admitted” for purposes of this section.
(ii) An alien in removal proceedings, in deportation proceedings, or subject to a final order of deportation, and not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, is not “lawfully admitted” for purposes of this section unless the alien last entered the United States lawfully and is not presently an applicant for admission to the United States.
(3)
Criminal aliens eligible to be considered for release.
Except as provided in this section, or otherwise provided by law, an alien subject to the TPCR may be considered for release from custody if lawfully admitted. Such an alien must first demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that release would not pose a danger to the safety of other persons or of property. If an alien meets this burden, the alien must further demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is likely to appear for any scheduled proceeding (including any appearance required by the Service or EOIR) in order to be considered for release in the exercise of discretion.
(4)
Criminal aliens ineligible to be considered for release except in certain special circumstances.
An alien, other than an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, subject to section 303(b)(3)(A) (ii) or (iii) of Div. C. of Pub. L. 104-208 is ineligible to be considered for release if the alien:
(i) Is described in section 241(a)(2)(C) of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997), or has been convicted of a crime described in section 101(a)(43)(B), (E)(ii) or (F) of the Act (as in effect on April 1, 1997);
(ii) Has been convicted of a crime described in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act (as in effect on April 1, 1997) or a crime or crimes involving moral turpitude related to property, and sentenced therefor (including in the aggregate) to at least 3 years' imprisonment;
(iii) Has failed to appear for an immigration proceeding without reasonable cause or has been subject to a bench
warrant or similar legal process (unless quashed, withdrawn, or cancelled as improvidently issued);
(iv) Has been convicted of a crime described in section 101(a)(43)(Q) or (T) of the Act (as in effect on April 1, 1997);
(v) Has been convicted in a criminal proceeding of a violation of section 273, 274, 274C, 276, or 277 of the Act, or has admitted the factual elements of such a violation;
(vi) Has overstayed a period granted for voluntary departure;
(vii) Has failed to surrender or report for removal pursuant to an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal;
(viii) Does not wish to pursue, or is statutorily ineligible for, any form of relief from exclusion, deportation, or removal under this chapter or the Act; or
(ix) Is described in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section but has not been sentenced, including in the aggregate but not including any portions suspended, to at least 2 years' imprisonment, unless the alien was lawfully admitted and has not, since the commencement of proceedings and within the 10 years prior thereto, been convicted of a crime, failed to comply with an order to surrender or a period of voluntary departure, or been subject to a bench warrant or similar legal process (unless quashed, withdrawn, or cancelled as improvidently issued). An alien eligible to be considered for release under this paragraph must meet the burdens described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section in order to be released from custody in the exercise of discretion.
(5)
Criminal aliens ineligible to be considered for release.
(i) A criminal alien subject to section 303(b)(3)(A)(ii) or (iii) of Div. C of Pub. L. 104-208 is ineligible to be considered for release if the alien has been sentenced, including in the aggregate but not including any portions suspended, to at least 2 years' imprisonment, and the alien
(A) Is described in section 237(a)(2)(D)(i) or (ii) of the Act (as in effect on April 1, 1997), or has been convicted of a crime described in section 101(a)(43)(A), (C), (E)(i), (H), (I), (K)(iii), or (L) of the Act (as in effect on April 1, 1997);
(B) Is described in section 237(a)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act; or
(C) Has escaped or attempted to escape from the lawful custody of a local, State, or Federal prison, agency, or officer within the United States.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, a permanent resident alien who has not, since the commencement of proceedings and within the 15 years prior thereto, been convicted of a crime, failed to comply with an order to surrender or a period of voluntary departure, or been subject to a bench warrant or similar legal process (unless quashed, withdrawn, or cancelled as improvidently issued), may be considered for release under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(6)
Unremovable aliens and certain long-term detainees.
(i) If the district director determines that an alien subject to section 303(b)(3)(A)(ii) or (iii) of Div. C of Pub. L. 104-208 cannot be removed from the United States because the designated country of removal or deportation will not accept the alien's return, the district director may, in the exercise of discretion, consider release of the alien from custody upon such terms and conditions as the district director may prescribe, without regard to paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section.
(ii) The district director may also, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(5) of this section, consider release from custody, upon such terms and conditions as the district director may prescribe, of any alien described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section who has been in the Service's custody for six months pursuant to a final order of deportation terminating the alien's status as a lawful permanent resident.
(iii) The district director may release an alien from custody under this paragraph only in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and any other applicable provisions of law.
(iv) The district director's custody decision under this paragraph shall not be subject to redetermination by an immigration judge, but, in the case of a custody decision under paragraph
(c)(6)(ii) of this section, may be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.

A reference in this section to a provision in section 241 of the Act as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, shall be deemed to include a reference to the corresponding provision in section 237 of the Act as in effect on April 1, 1997. A reference in this section to a “crime” shall be considered to include a reference to a conspiracy or attempt to commit such a crime. In calculating the 10-year period specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and the 15-year period specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, no period during which the alien was detained or incarcerated shall count toward the total. References in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section to the “district director” shall be deemed to include a reference to any official designated by the Commissioner to exercise custody authority over aliens covered by that paragraph. Nothing in this part shall be construed as prohibiting an alien from seeking reconsideration of the Service's determination that the alien is within a category barred from release under this part.
(8) Any officer authorized to issue a warrant of arrest may, in the officer's discretion, release an alien not described in section 236(c)(1) of the Act, under the conditions at section 236(a)(2) and (3) of the Act; provided that the alien must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the officer that such release would not pose a danger to property or persons, and that the alien is likely to appear for any future proceeding. Such an officer may also, in the exercise of discretion, release an alien in deportation proceedings pursuant to the authority in section 242 of the Act (as designated prior to April 1, 1997), except as otherwise provided by law.
(9) When an alien who, having been arrested and taken into custody, has been released, such release may be revoked at any time in the discretion of the district director, acting district director, deputy district director, assistant district director for investigations, assistant district director for detention and deportation, or officer in charge (except foreign), in which event the alien may be taken into physical custody and detained. If detained, unless a breach has occurred, any outstanding bond shall be revoked and canceled.
(10) The provisions of § 103.6 of 8 CFR chapter I shall apply to any bonds authorized. Subject to the provisions of this section, the provisions of § 1003.19 of this chapter shall govern availability to the respondent of recourse to other administrative authority for release from custody.
(11) An immigration judge may not exercise the authority provided in this section, and the review process described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not apply, with respect to any alien beyond the custody jurisdiction of the immigration judge as provided in § 1003.19(h) of this chapter.
(d)
Appeals from custody decisions
—(1)
Application to immigration judge.
After an initial custody determination by the district director, including the setting of a bond, the respondent may, at any time before an order under 8 CFR part 1240 becomes final, request amelioration of the conditions under which he or she may be released. Prior to such final order, and except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the immigration judge is authorized to exercise the authority in section 236 of the Act (or section 242(a)(1) of the Act as designated prior to April 1, 1997 in the case of an alien in deportation proceedings) to detain the alien in custody, release the alien, and determine the amount of bond, if any, under which the respondent may be released, as provided in § 1003.19 of this chapter. If the alien has been released from custody, an application for amelioration of the terms of release must be filed within 7 days of release.
(2)
Application to the district director.
After expiration of the 7-day period in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the respondent may request review by the district director of the conditions of his or her release.
(3)
Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.
An appeal relating to bond and custody determinations may be filed to the Board of Immigration Appeals in the following circumstances:
(i) In accordance with § 1003.38 of this chapter, the alien or the Service may
appeal the decision of an immigration judge pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(ii) The alien, within 10 days, may appeal from the district director's decision under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
(4)
Effect of filing an appeal.
The filing of an appeal from a determination of an immigration judge or district director under this paragraph shall not operate to delay compliance with the order (except as provided in § 1003.19(i)), nor stay the administrative proceedings or removal.
(e)
Privilege of communication.
Every detained alien shall be notified that he or she may communicate with the consular or diplomatic officers of the country of his or her nationality in the United States. Existing treaties with the following countries require immediate communication with appropriate consular or diplomatic officers whenever nationals of the following countries are detained in removal proceedings, whether or not requested by the alien and even if the alien requests that no communication be undertaken in his or her behalf. When notifying consular or diplomatic officials, Service officers shall not reveal the fact that any detained alien has applied for asylum or withholding of removal.

§ 1236.2
Confined aliens, incompetents, and minors.
(a)
Service.
If the respondent is confined, or if he or she is an incompetent, or a minor under the age of 14, the notice to appear, and the warrant of arrest, if issued, shall be served in the manner prescribed in § 1239.1 of this chapter upon the person or persons specified by § 103.5a(c) of 8 CFR chapter I.
(b)
Service custody and cost of maintenance.
An alien confined because of physical or mental disability in an institution or hospital shall not be accepted into physical custody by the Service until an order of removal has been entered and the Service is ready to remove the alien. When such an alien is an inmate of a public or private institution at the time of the commencement of the removal proceedings, expenses for the maintenance of the alien shall not be incurred by the Government until he or she is taken into physical custody by the Service.
§ 1236.3
Detention and release of juveniles.
(a)
Juveniles.
A juvenile is defined as an alien under the age of 18 years.
(b)
Release.
Juveniles for whom bond has been posted, for whom parole has been authorized, or who have been ordered released on recognizance, shall be released pursuant to the following guidelines:
(1) Juveniles shall be released, in order of preference, to:
(i) A parent;
(ii) Legal guardian; or
(iii) An adult relative (brother, sister, aunt, uncle, grandparent) who is not presently in Service detention, unless a determination is made that the detention of such juvenile is required to secure his or her timely appearance before the Service or the Immigration Court or to ensure the juvenile's safety or that of others. In cases where the parent, legal guardian, or adult relative resides at a location distant from where the juvenile is detained, he or she may secure release at a Service office located near the parent, legal guardian, or adult relative.
(2) If an individual specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section cannot be located to accept custody of a juvenile, and the juvenile has identified a parent, legal guardian, or adult relative in Service detention, simultaneous release of the juvenile and the parent, legal guardian, or adult relative shall be evaluated on a discretionary case-by-case basis.
(3) In cases where the parent or legal guardian is in Service detention or outside the United States, the juvenile may be released to such person as is designated by the parent or legal guardian in a sworn affidavit, executed before an immigration officer or consular officer, as capable and willing to care for the juvenile's well-being. Such person must execute an agreement to care for the juvenile and to ensure the juvenile's presence at all future proceedings before the Service or an immigration judge.
(4) In unusual and compelling circumstances and in the discretion of the Director of the Office of Juvenile Affairs, a juvenile may be released to an adult, other than those identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this section, who executes an agreement to care for the juvenile's well-being and to ensure the juvenile's presence at all future proceedings before the Service or an immigration judge.
(c)
Juvenile coordinator.
The case of a juvenile for whom detention is determined to be necessary should be referred to the “Juvenile Coordinator,” whose responsibilities should include, but not be limited to, finding suitable placement of the juvenile in a facility designated for the occupancy of juveniles. These may include juvenile facilities contracted by the Service, state or local juvenile facilities, or other appropriate agencies authorized to accommodate juveniles by the laws of the state or locality.
(d)
Detention.
In the case of a juvenile for whom detention is determined to be necessary, for such interim period of time as is required to locate suitable placement for the juvenile, whether such placement is under paragraph (b)
or (c) of this section, the juvenile may be temporarily held by Service authorities or placed in any Service detention facility having separate accommodations for juveniles.
(e)
Refusal of release.
If a parent of a juvenile detained by the Service can be located, and is otherwise suitable to receive custody of the juvenile, and the juvenile indicates a refusal to be released to his or her parent, the parent(s) shall be notified of the juvenile's refusal to be released to the parent(s), and they shall be afforded the opportunity to present their views to the district director, chief patrol agent, Director of the Office of Juvenile Affairs or immigration judge before a custody determination is made.
(f)
Notice to parent of application for relief.
If a juvenile seeks release from detention, voluntary departure, parole, or any form of relief from removal, where it appears that the grant of such relief may effectively terminate some interest inherent in the parent-child relationship and/or the juvenile's rights and interests are adverse with those of the parent, and the parent is presently residing in the United States, the parent shall be given notice of the juvenile's application for relief, and shall be afforded an opportunity to present his or her views and assert his or her interest to the district director, Director of the Office of Juvenile Affairs or immigration judge before a determination is made as to the merits of the request for relief.
(g)
Voluntary departure.
Each juvenile, apprehended in the immediate vicinity of the border, who resides permanently in Mexico or Canada, shall be informed, prior to presentation of the voluntary departure form or being allowed to withdraw his or her application for admission, that he or she may make a telephone call to a parent, close relative, a friend, or to an organization found on the free legal services list. A juvenile who does not reside in Mexico or Canada who is apprehended shall be provided access to a telephone and must in fact communicate either with a parent, adult relative, friend, or with an organization found on the free legal services list prior to presentation of the voluntary departure form. If such juvenile, of his or her own volition, asks to contact a consular officer, and does in fact make such contact, the requirements of this section are satisfied.
(h)
Notice and request for disposition.
When a juvenile alien is apprehended, he or she must be given a Form I-770, Notice of Rights and Disposition. If the juvenile is less than 14 years of age or unable to understand the notice, the notice shall be read and explained to the juvenile in a language he or she understands. In the event a juvenile who has requested a hearing pursuant to the notice subsequently decides to accept voluntary departure or is allowed to withdraw his or her application for admission, a new Form I-770 shall be given to, and signed by the juvenile.

§ 1236.4
Removal of S-5, S-6, and S-7 nonimmigrants.
(a)
Condition of classification.
As a condition of classification and continued stay in classification pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act, nonimmigrants in S classification must have executed Form I-854, Part B, Inter-agency Alien Witness and Informant Record, certifying that they have knowingly waived their right to a removal hearing and right to contest, other than on the basis of an application for withholding of deportation or removal, any removal action, including detention pending deportation or removal, instituted before lawful permanent resident status is obtained.
(b)
Determination of deportability.
(1) A determination to remove a deportable alien classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act shall be made by the district director having jurisdiction over the place where the alien is located.
(2) A determination to remove such a deportable alien shall be based on one or more of the grounds of deportability listed in section 237 of the Act based on conduct committed after, or conduct or a condition not disclosed to the Service prior to, the alien's classification as an S nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act, or for a violation of, or failure to adhere to, the particular terms and conditions of status in S nonimmigrant classification.
(c)
Removal procedures.
(1) A district director who determines to remove an alien witness or informant in S nonimmigrant classification shall notify the Commissioner, the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, and the relevant law enforcement agency in writing to that effect. The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to that decision. Unless the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 7 days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy Attorney General for a final resolution. In no circumstances shall the alien or the relevant law enforcement agency have a right of appeal from any decision to remove.
(2) A district director who has provided notice as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and who has been advised by the Commissioner that the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, has not objected shall issue a Warrant of Removal. The alien shall immediately be arrested and taken into custody by the district director initiating the removal. An alien classified under the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act who is determined, pursuant to a warrant issued by a district director, to be deportable from the United States shall be removed from the United States to his or her country of nationality or last residence. The agency that requested the alien's presence in the United States shall ensure departure from the United States and so inform the district director in whose jurisdiction the alien has last resided. The district director, if necessary, shall oversee the alien's departure from the United States and, in any event, shall notify the Commissioner of the alien's departure.
(d)
Withholding of removal.
An alien classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act who applies for withholding of removal shall have 10 days from the date the Warrant of Removal is served upon the alien to file an application for such relief with the district director initiating the removal order. The procedures contained in §§ 1208.2 and 1208.16 of this chapter shall apply to such an alien who applies for withholding of removal.
(e)
Inadmissibility.
An alien who applies for admission under the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act who is determined by an immigration officer not to be eligible for admission under that section or to be inadmissible to the United States under one or more of the grounds of inadmissibility listed in section 212 of the Act and which have not been previously waived by the Commissioner will be taken into custody. The district director having jurisdiction over the port-of-entry shall follow the notification procedures specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A district director who has provided such notice and who has been advised by the Commissioner that the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, has not objected shall remove the alien without further hearing. An alien may not contest such removal, other than by applying for withholding of removal.
§ 1236.5
Fingerprints and photographs.
Every alien 14 years of age or older against whom proceedings based on deportability under section 237 of the Act are commenced under this part by service of a notice to appear shall be fingerprinted and photographed. Such fingerprints and photographs shall be made available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies upon request to the district director or chief patrol agent having jurisdiction over the alien's record. Any such alien, regardless of his or her age, shall be photographed and/or fingerprinted if required by any immigration officer authorized to issue a notice to appear. Every alien 14 years of age or older who is found to be inadmissible to the United States and ordered removed by an immigration judge shall be fingerprinted, unless during the preceding year he or she has been fingerprinted at an American consular office.
§ 1236.6
Information regarding detainees.
No person, including any state or local government entity or any privately operated detention facility, that
houses, maintains, provides services to, or otherwise holds any detainee on behalf of the Service (whether by contract or otherwise), and no other person who by virtue of any official or contractual relationship with such person obtains information relating to any detainee, shall disclose or otherwise permit to be made public the name of, or other information relating to, such detainee. Such information shall be under the control of the Service and shall be subject to public disclosure only pursuant to the provisions of applicable federal laws, regulations and executive orders. Insofar as any documents or other records contain such information, such documents shall not be public records. This section applies to all persons and information identified or described in it, regardless of when such persons obtained such information, and applies to all requests for public disclosure of such information, including requests that are the subject of proceedings pending as of April 17, 2002.

Definitions.
As used in this part the term:
Deciding Service officer
means a district director, chief patrol agent, or another immigration officer designated by a district director, chief patrol agent, the Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner for Detention and Removal, or the Director of the Office of Juvenile Affairs, so long as that person is not the same person as the Issuing Service Officer.

(ii) Has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or has conditional permanent resident status under section 216 of the Act;
(iii) Has been convicted (as defined in section 101(a)(48) of the Act and as demonstrated by any of the documents or records listed in § 1003.41 of this chapter) of an aggravated felony and such conviction has become final; and

(2)
Notice.
(i) Removal proceedings under section 238(b) of the Act shall commence upon personal service of the Notice of Intent upon the alien, as prescribed by §§ 103.5a(a)(2) and 103.5a(c)(2) of 8 CFR chapter I. The Notice of Intent shall set forth the preliminary determinations and inform the alien of the Service's intent to issue a Form I-851A, Final Administrative Removal Order, without a hearing before an immigration judge. The Notice of Intent shall constitute the charging document. The Notice of Intent shall include allegations of fact and conclusions of law. It shall advise that the alien: has the privilege of being represented, at no expense to the government, by counsel of the alien's choosing, as long as counsel is authorized to practice in removal proceedings; may request withholding of removal to a particular country if he or she fears persecution or torture in that country; may inspect the evidence supporting the Notice of Intent; may rebut the charges within 10 calendar days after service of such Notice (or 13 calendar days if service of the Notice was by mail).
(ii) The Notice of Intent also shall advise the alien that he or she may designate in writing, within the rebuttal period, the country to which he or she chooses to be deported in accordance with section 241 of the Act, in the event that a Final Administrative Removal Order is issued, and that the Service will honor such designation only to the extent permitted under the terms, limitations, and conditions of section 241 of the Act.
(iii) The Service must determine that the person served with the Notice of Intent is the person named on the notice.
(iv) The Service shall provide the alien with a list of available free legal services programs qualified under 8 CFR part 1003 and organizations recognized pursuant to 8 CFR part 1292, located within the district or sector where the Notice of Intent is issued.
(v) The Service must either provide the alien with a written translation of the Notice of Intent or explain the contents of the Notice of Intent to the alien in the alien's native language or in a language that the alien understands.
(c)
Alien's response
—(1)
Time for response.
The alien will have 10 calendar days from service of the Notice of Intent or 13 calendar days if service is by mail, to file a response to the Notice of Intent.

(2)
Nature of rebuttal or request to review evidence.
(i) If an alien chooses to rebut the allegations contained in the Notice of Intent, the alien's written response must indicate which finding(s) are being challenged and should be accompanied by affidavit(s), documentary information, or other specific evidence supporting the challenge.
(ii) If an alien's written response requests the opportunity to review the Government's evidence, the Service shall serve the alien with a copy of the evidence in the record of proceeding upon which the Service is relying to support the charge. The alien may, within 10 calendar days following service of the Government's evidence (13 calendar days if service is by mail), furnish a final response in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the alien's final response is a rebuttal of the allegations, such a final response should be accompanied by affidavit(s), documentary information, or other specific evidence supporting the challenge.
(d)
Determination by deciding Service officer
—(1)
No response submitted or concession of deportability.
If the deciding Service officer does not receive a timely response and the evidence in the record of proceeding establishes deportability by clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence, or if the alien concedes deportability, then the deciding Service officer shall issue and cause to be served upon the alien a Final Administrative Removal Order that states the reasons for the deportation decision. The alien may, in writing, waive the 14-day waiting period before execution of the final order of removal provided in a paragraph (f) of this section.
(2)
Response submitted
—(i)
Insufficient rebuttal; no genuine issue of material fact.
If the alien timely submits a rebuttal to the allegations, but the deciding Service officer finds that deportability is established by clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence in the record of proceeding, the deciding Service officer shall issue and cause to be served upon the alien a Final Administrative Removal Order that states the reasons for the decision of deportability.
(ii)
Additional evidence required.
(A) If the deciding Service officer finds that the record of proceeding, including the alien's timely rebuttal, raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding the preliminary findings, the deciding Service officer may either obtain additional evidence from any source, including the alien, or cause to be issued a notice to appear to initiate removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act. The deciding Service officer may also obtain additional evidence from
any source, including the alien, if the deciding Service officer deems that such additional evidence may aid the officer in the rendering of a decision.
(B) If the deciding Service officer considers additional evidence from a source other than the alien, that evidence shall be made a part of the record of proceeding, and shall be provided to the alien. If the alien elects to submit a response to such additional evidence, such response must be filed with the Service within 10 calendar days of service of the additional evidence (or 13 calendar days if service is by mail). If the deciding Service officer finds, after considering all additional evidence, that deportability is established by clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence in the record of proceeding, the deciding Service officer shall issue and cause to be served upon the alien a Final Administrative Removal Order that states the reasons for the decision of deportability.
(iii)
Conversion to proceedings under section 240 of the Act.
If the deciding Service officer finds that the alien is not amenable to removal under section 238 of the Act, the deciding Service officer shall terminate the expedited proceedings under section 238 of the Act and shall, where appropriate, cause to be issued a notice to appear for the purpose of initiating removal proceedings before an immigration judge under section 240 of the Act.
(3)
Termination of proceedings by deciding Service officer.
Only the deciding Service officer may terminate proceedings under section 238 of the Act, in accordance with this section.
(e)
Proceedings commenced under section 240 of the Act.
In any proceeding commenced under section 240 of the Act which is based on deportability under section 237 of the Act, if it appears that the respondent alien is subject to removal pursuant to section 238 of the Act, the immigration judge may, upon the Service's request, terminate the case and, upon such termination, the Service may commence administrative proceedings under section 238 of the Act. However, in the absence of any such request, the immigration judge shall complete the proceeding commenced under section 240 of the Act.
(f)
Executing final removal order of deciding Service officer
—(1)
Time of execution.
Upon the issuance of a Final Administrative Removal Order, the Service shall issue a Warrant of Removal in accordance with § 1241.2 of this chapter; such warrant shall be executed no sooner than 14 calendar days after the date the Final Administrative Removal Order is issued, unless the alien knowingly, voluntarily, and in writing waives the 14-day period.
(2)
Country to which alien is to be removed.
The deciding Service officer shall designate the country of removal in the manner prescribed by section 241 of the Act.
(3)
Withholding of removal.
If the alien has requested withholding of removal under § 1208.16 of this chapter, the deciding officer shall, upon issuance of a Final Administrative Removal Order, immediately refer the alien's case to an asylum officer to conduct a reasonable fear determination in accordance with § 1208.31 of this chapter.
(g)
Arrest and detention.
At the time of issuance of a Notice of Intent or at any time thereafter and up to the time the alien becomes the subject of a Warrant of Removal, the alien may be arrested and taken into custody under the authority of a Warrant of Arrest issued by an officer listed in § 287.5(e)(2) of 8 CFR chapter I. The decision of the Service concerning custody or bond shall not be administratively appealable during proceedings initiated under section 238 of the Act and this part.
(h)
Record of proceeding.
The Service shall maintain a record of proceeding for judicial review of the Final Administrative Removal Order sought by any petition for review. The record of proceeding shall include, but not necessarily be limited to: the charging document (Notice of Intent); the Final Administrative Removal Order (including any supplemental memorandum of decision); the alien's response, if any; all evidence in support of the charge; and any admissible evidence, briefs, or documents submitted by either party respecting deportability. The executed duplicate of the Notice of Intent in the record of proceedings shall be retained as evidence that the individual upon whom the notice for the proceeding
was served was, in fact, the alien named in the notice.

An immigration judge or Board member may enter an order of dismissal in cases where DHS moves for dismissal pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. A motion to dismiss removal proceedings for a reason other than those authorized by paragraph (c) of this section shall be deemed a motion to terminate and adjudicated pursuant to 8 CFR 1003.1(m), pertaining to cases before the Board, or 8 CFR 1003.18(d), pertaining to cases before the immigration court, as applicable.
(c)
Motion to dismiss.

Dismissal of the matter shall be without prejudice to the alien or the Department of Homeland Security.
(d)
Motion for remand.
After commencement of the hearing, government counsel or an officer enumerated in 8 CFR 239.1(a) may move for remand of the matter to the Department of Homeland Security on the ground that the foreign relations of the United States are involved and require further consideration. Remand of the matter shall be without prejudice to the alien or the Department of Homeland Security.
(e)
Warrant of arrest.
When a notice to appear is canceled or proceedings are terminated under this section any outstanding warrant of arrest is canceled.

# Subpart A—Removal Proceedings
§ 1240.1
Immigration judges.
(a)
Authority.
(1) In any removal proceeding pursuant to section 240 of the Act, the immigration judge shall have the authority to:
(i) Determine removability pursuant to section 240(a)(1) of the Act; to make decisions, including orders of removal as provided by section 240(c)(1)(A) of the Act;
(ii) To determine applications under sections 208, 212(a)(2)(F), 212(a)(6)(F)(ii), 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 212(d)(11), 212(d)(12), 212(g), 212(h), 212(i), 212(k), 237(a)(1)(E)(iii), 237(a)(1)(H), 237(a)(3)(C)(ii), 240A(a) and (b), 240B, 245, and 249 of the Act, section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, section 902 of Pub. L. 105-277, and former section 212(c) of the Act (as it existed prior to April 1, 1997);
(iii) To order withholding of removal pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act and pursuant to the Convention Against Torture; and
(iv) To take any other action consistent with applicable law and regulations as may be appropriate.
(2) An immigration judge may certify his or her decision in any case under section 240 of the Act to the Board of Immigration Appeals when it involves an unusually complex or novel question of law or fact. Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to diminish the authority conferred on immigration judges under sections 101(b)(4) and 103 of the Act.
(b)
Withdrawal and substitution of immigration judges.
The immigration judge assigned to conduct the hearing shall at any time withdraw if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified. If an immigration judge becomes unavailable to complete his or her duties, another immigration judge may be assigned to complete the case. The new immigration judge shall familiarize himself or herself with the record in the case and shall state for the record that he or she has done so.
(c)
Conduct of hearing.
The immigration judge shall receive and consider material and relevant evidence, rule upon objections, and otherwise regulate the course of the hearing.
(d)
Withdrawal of application for admission.
An immigration judge may allow only an arriving alien to withdraw an application for admission. Once the issue of inadmissibility has been resolved, permission to withdraw an application for admission should ordinarily be granted only with the concurrence of the Service. An immigration judge shall not allow an alien to withdraw an application for admission unless the alien, in addition to demonstrating that he or she possesses both the intent and the means to depart immediately from the United States, establishes that factors directly relating to the issue of inadmissibility indicate that the granting of the withdrawal would be in the interest of justice. During the pendency of an appeal from the order of removal, permission to withdraw an application for admission must be obtained from the immigration judge or the Board.
[62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997; 62 FR 15363, Apr. 1, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 27829, May 21, 1998; 64 FR 8495, Feb. 19, 1999; 64 FR 25766, May 12, 1999; 69 FR 57835, Sept. 28, 2004; 72 FR 53678, Sept. 20, 2007]
§ 1240.2
DHS Counsel.
(a)
Authority.
DHS counsel shall present on behalf of the government evidence material to the issues of deportability or inadmissibility and any other issues that may require disposition by the immigration judge. The duties of the DHS counsel include, but are not limited to, the presentation of evidence and the interrogation, examination, and cross-examination of the respondent or other witnesses. Nothing contained in this subpart diminishes the authority of an immigration judge to conduct proceedings under this part. The DHS counsel is authorized to appeal from a decision of the immigration judge pursuant to § 1003.38 of this chapter and to move for reopening or reconsideration pursuant to § 1003.23 of this chapter.
(b)
Assignment.
In a removal proceeding, DHS shall assign an attorney to each case within the provisions of § 1240.10(d), and to each case in which an unrepresented respondent is incompetent or is under 18 years of age, and is not accompanied by a guardian, relative, or friend. In a case in which the removal proceeding would result in an order of removal, DHS shall assign an attorney to each case in which a respondent's nationality is in issue. A DHS counsel shall be assigned in every case in which the Commissioner approves the submission of non-record information under § 1240.11(a)(3). In his or her discretion, whenever he or she deems such assignment necessary or advantageous, the General Counsel may assign a DHS counsel to any other case at any stage of the proceeding.
[62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997. 68 FR 9838, 9840, Feb. 28, 2003, as amended at 86 FR 70724, Dec. 13, 2021]
§ 1240.3
Representation by counsel.
The respondent may be represented at the hearing by an attorney or other representative qualified under 8 CFR part 1292.
§ 1240.4
Incompetent respondents.
When it is impracticable for the respondent to be present at the hearing because of mental incompetency, the attorney, legal representative, legal guardian, near relative, or friend who was served with a copy of the notice to appear shall be permitted to appear on behalf of the respondent. If such a person cannot reasonably be found or fails or refuses to appear, the custodian of the respondent shall be requested to appear on behalf of the respondent.
§ 1240.5
Interpreter.
Any person acting as an interpreter in a hearing before an immigration judge under this part shall be sworn to interpret and translate accurately, unless the interpreter is an employee of the United States Government, in which event no such oath shall be required.
§ 1240.6
Postponement and adjournment of hearing.
After the commencement of the hearing, the immigration judge may grant a reasonable adjournment either at his or her own instance or, for good cause shown, upon application by the respondent or the Department of Homeland Security, provided that nothing in this section shall authorize an adjournment that causes the adjudication of an asylum application to exceed 180 days in the absence of exceptional circumstances, consistent with section 208(d)(5)(A)(iii) of the Act and § 1003.10(b) of this chapter.
[85 FR 81751, Dec. 16, 2020]
§ 1240.7
Evidence in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act.
(a)
Use of prior statements.
The immigration judge may receive in evidence any oral or written statement that is material and relevant to any issue in the case previously made by the respondent or any other person during any investigation, examination, hearing, or trial.
(b)
Testimony.
Testimony of witnesses appearing at the hearing shall be under oath or affirmation administered by the immigration judge.
(c)
Depositions.
The immigration judge may order the taking of depositions pursuant to § 1003.35 of this chapter.
§ 1240.8
Burdens of proof in removal proceedings.
(a)
Deportable aliens.
A respondent charged with deportability shall be found to be removable if the Service proves by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is deportable as charged.
(b)
Arriving aliens.
In proceedings commenced upon a respondent's arrival in the United States or after the revocation or expiration of parole, the respondent must prove that he or she is clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted to the United States and is not inadmissible as charged.
(c)
Aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled.
In the case of a respondent charged as being in the United States without being admitted or paroled, the Service must
first establish the alienage of the respondent. Once alienage has been established, unless the respondent demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that he or she is lawfully in the United States pursuant to a prior admission, the respondent must prove that he or she is clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted to the United States and is not inadmissible as charged.
(d)
Relief from removal.
The respondent shall have the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. If the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.
§ 1240.9
Contents of record.
The hearing before the immigration judge, including the testimony, exhibits, applications, proffers, and requests, the immigration judge's decision, and all written orders, motions, appeals, briefs, and other papers filed in the proceedings shall constitute the record in the case. The hearing shall be recorded verbatim except for statements made off the record with the permission of the immigration judge. In his or her discretion, the immigration judge may exclude from the record any arguments made in connection with motions, applications, requests, or objections, but in such event the person affected may submit a brief.
§ 1240.10
Hearing.
(a)
Opening.
In a removal proceeding, the immigration judge shall:
(1) Advise the respondent of his or her right to representation, at no expense to the government, by counsel of his or her own choice authorized to practice in the proceedings and require the respondent to state then and there whether he or she desires representation;
(2) Advise the respondent of the availability of pro bono legal services for the immigration court location at which the hearing will take place, and ascertain that the respondent has received a list of such pro bono legal service providers.
(3) Ascertain that the respondent has received a copy of appeal rights.
(4) Advise the respondent that he or she will have a reasonable opportunity to examine and object to the evidence against him or her, to present evidence in his or her own behalf and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the government (but the respondent shall not be entitled to examine such national security information as the government may proffer in opposition to the respondent's admission to the United States or to an application by the respondent for discretionary relief);
(5) Place the respondent under oath;
(6) Read the factual allegations and the charges in the notice to appear to the respondent and explain them in non-technical language; and
(7) Enter the notice to appear as an exhibit in the Record of Proceeding.
(b)
Public access to hearings.
Removal hearings shall be open to the public, except that the immigration judge may, in his or her discretion, close proceedings as provided in § 1003.27 of this chapter.
(c)
Pleading by respondent.
The immigration judge shall require the respondent to plead to the notice to appear by stating whether he or she admits or denies the factual allegations and his or her removability under the charges contained therein. If the respondent admits the factual allegations and admits his or her removability under the charges and the immigration judge is satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain, the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent. The immigration judge shall not accept an admission of removability from an unrepresented respondent who is incompetent or under the age of 18 and is not accompanied by an attorney or legal representative, a near relative, legal guardian, or friend; nor from an officer of an institution in which a respondent is an inmate or patient. When, pursuant to this paragraph, the immigration judge does not accept an admission of removability, he or she shall direct a hearing on the issues.
(d)
Issues of removability.
When removability is not determined under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, the immigration judge shall request the assignment of DHS counsel, and shall receive evidence as to any unresolved issues, except that no further evidence need be received as to any facts admitted during the pleading. The alien shall provide a court certified copy of a Judicial Recommendation Against Deportation (JRAD) to the immigration judge when such recommendation will be the basis of denying any charge(s) brought by DHS in the proceedings against the alien. No JRAD is effective against a charge of deportability under former section 241(a)(11) of the Act or if the JRAD was granted on or after November 29, 1990.
(e)
Additional charges in removal hearings.
At any time during the proceeding, additional or substituted charges of inadmissibility and/or deportability and/or factual allegations may be lodged by DHS in writing. The alien in removal proceedings shall be served with a copy of these additional charges and allegations. The immigration judge shall read the additional factual allegations and charges to the alien and explain them to him or her. The immigration judge shall advise the alien, if he or she is not represented by counsel, that the alien may be so represented, and that he or she may be given a reasonable continuance to respond to the additional factual allegations and charges. Thereafter, the provision of § 1240.6(b) relating to pleading shall apply to the additional factual allegations and charges.
(f)
Country of removal.
With respect to an arriving alien covered by section 241(b)(1) of the Act, the country, or countries in the alternative, to which the alien may be removed will be determined pursuant to section 241(b)(1) of the Act. In any other case, the immigration judge shall notify the respondent that if he or she is finally ordered removed, the country of removal will in the first instance be the country designated by the respondent, except as otherwise provided under section 241(b)(2) of the Act, and shall afford him or her an opportunity then and there to make such designation. The immigration judge shall also identify for the record a country, or countries in the alternative, to which the alien's removal may be made pursuant to section 241(b)(2) of the Act if the country of the alien's designation will not accept him or her into its territory, or fails to furnish timely notice of acceptance, or if the alien declines to designate a country. In considering alternative countries of removal, acceptance or the existence of a functioning government is not required with respect to an alternative country described in section 241(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) of the Act or a removal country described in section 241(b)(2)(E)(i)-(iv) of the Act.

8 CFR 241.15.
[62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997. Redesignated in part and duplicated in part from part 240 at 68 FR 9838, 9840, Feb. 28, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 674, Jan. 5, 2005; 80 FR 59513, Oct. 1, 2015; 86 FR 70724, Dec. 13, 2021]
§ 1240.11
Ancillary matters, applications.
(a)
Creation of the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
(1) In a removal proceeding, an alien may apply to the immigration judge for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act, adjustment of status under section 1 of the Act of November 2, 1966 (as modified by section 606 of Pub. L. 104-208), section 101 or 104 of the Act of October 28, 1977, section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, or section 902 of Pub. L. 105-277, or for the creation of a record of lawful admission for permanent residence under section 249 of the Act. The application shall be subject to the requirements of § 1240.20, and 8 CFR parts 1245 and 1249. The approval of any application made to the immigration judge under section 245 of the Act by an alien spouse (as defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act) or by an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act) shall result in the alien's obtaining the status of lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis in accordance with the provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is applicable. However, the Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence required by section 216(c) of the Act, or the Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions required by section 216A(c) of the Act shall be made to the
director in accordance with 8 CFR part 1216.
(2) In conjunction with any application for creation of status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence made to an immigration judge, if the alien is inadmissible under any provision of section 212(a) of the Act, and believes that he or she meets the eligibility requirements for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she may apply to the immigration judge for such waiver. The immigration judge shall inform the alien of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for any of the benefits enumerated in this chapter and shall afford the alien an opportunity to make application during the hearing, in accordance with the provisions of § 1240.8(d). In a relevant case, the immigration judge may adjudicate the sufficiency of an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A (Form I-864), executed on behalf of an applicant for admission or for adjustment of status, in accordance with the provisions of section 213A of the Act and 8 CFR part 213a.
(3) In exercising discretionary power when considering an application for status as a permanent resident under this chapter, the immigration judge may consider and base the decision on information not contained in the record and not made available for inspection by the alien, provided the Commissioner has determined that such information is relevant and is classified under the applicable Executive Order as requiring protection from unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security. Whenever the immigration judge believes that he or she can do so while safeguarding both the information and its source, the immigration judge should inform the alien of the general nature of the information in order that the alien may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such classified information shall state that the information is material to the decision.
(b)
Voluntary departure.
The alien may apply to the immigration judge for voluntary departure in lieu of removal pursuant to section 240B of the Act and subpart C of this part. The immigration judge shall advise the alien of the consequences of filing a post-decision motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the time specified by the immigration judge for the alien to depart voluntarily.
(c)
Applications for asylum and withholding of removal.
(1) If the alien expresses fear of persecution or harm upon return to any of the countries to which the alien might be removed pursuant to § 1240.10(f), and the alien has not previously filed an application for asylum or withholding of removal that has been referred to the immigration judge by an asylum officer in accordance with § 1208.14 of this chapter, the immigration judge shall:
(i) Advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum in the United States or withholding of removal to those countries;
(ii) Make available the appropriate application forms; and
(iii) Advise the alien of the privilege of being represented by counsel at no expense to the government and of the consequences, pursuant to section 208(d)(6) of the Act, of knowingly filing a frivolous application for asylum. The immigration judge shall provide to the alien a list of persons who have indicated their availability to represent aliens in asylum proceedings on a
pro bono
basis.
(2) An application for asylum or withholding of removal must be filed with the Immigration Court, pursuant to § 1208.4(b) of this chapter. Upon receipt of an application, the Immigration Court may forward a copy to the Department of State pursuant to § 1208.11 of this chapter and shall calendar the case for a hearing. The reply, if any, from the Department of State, unless classified under an applicable Executive Order, shall be given to both the alien and to DHS counsel and shall be included in the record.
(3) Applications for asylum and withholding of removal so filed will be decided by the immigration judge pursuant to the requirements and standards established in 8 CFR part 1208 of this chapter after an evidentiary hearing to resolve factual issues in dispute. An evidentiary hearing extending beyond issues related to the basis for a mandatory denial of the application pursuant to § 1208.14 or § 1208.16 of this chapter is
not necessary once the immigration judge has determined that such a denial is required.
(i) Evidentiary hearings on applications for asylum or withholding of removal will be open to the public unless the alien expressly requests that the hearing be closed pursuant to § 3.27 of this chapter. The immigration judge shall inquire whether the alien requests such closure.
(ii) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of the immigration judge to properly control the scope of any evidentiary hearing.
(iii) During the removal hearing, the alien shall be examined under oath on his or her application and may present evidence and witnesses in his or her own behalf. The alien has the burden of establishing that he or she is a refugee as defined in section 101(a)(42) of the Act pursuant to the standards set forth in § 1208.13 of this chapter.
(iv) DHS counsel may call witnesses and present evidence for the record, including information classified under the applicable Executive Order, provided the immigration judge or the Board has determined that such information is relevant to the hearing. When the immigration judge receives such classified information, he or she shall inform the alien. The agency that provides the classified information to the immigration judge may provide an unclassified summary of the information for release to the alien, whenever it determines it can do so consistently with safeguarding both the classified nature of the information and its sources. The summary should be as detailed as possible, in order that the alien may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such classified information shall state whether such information is material to the decision.
(4) The decision of an immigration judge to grant or deny asylum or withholding of removal shall be communicated to the alien and to the DHS counsel. An adverse decision shall state why asylum or withholding of removal was denied.
(d)
Application for relief under sections 237(a)(1)(H) and 237(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act.
The respondent may apply to the immigration judge for relief from removal under sections 237(a)(1)(H) and 237(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act.
(e)
General.
An application under this section shall be made only during the hearing and shall not be held to constitute a concession of alienage or deportability in any case in which the respondent does not admit his or her alienage or deportability. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit DHS from using information supplied in an application for asylum or withholding of deportation or removal submitted to DHS on or after January 4, 1995, as the basis for issuance of a charging document or to establish alienage or deportability in a case referred to an immigration judge under § 1208.14(b) of this chapter. The alien shall have the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. Nothing contained in this section is intended to foreclose the respondent from applying for any benefit or privilege that he or she believes himself or herself eligible to receive in proceedings under this part. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the Attorney General's authority to remove an alien to any country permitted by section 241(b) of the Act.

The alien shall not be required to pay a fee on more than one application within paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, provided that the minimum fee imposed when more than one application is made shall be determined by the cost of the application with the highest fee. When a motion to reopen or reconsider is made concurrently with an application for relief seeking one of the immigration benefits set forth in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, only the fee set forth in § 1103.7(b)(1) of this chapter for the motion must accompany the motion and application for relief. If such a motion is granted, the appropriate fee for the application for relief, if any, set forth in § 1103.7(b)(4) of this chapter, must be paid within the time specified in order to complete the application.
(g)
U.S.-Canada safe third country agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022.
(1) The immigration judge has authority to apply section
208(a)(2)(A) of the Act, relating to a determination that an alien may be removed to Canada pursuant to the 2002 U.S.-Canada Agreement (“Agreement”), in the case of an alien who is subject to the terms of the Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022, and is placed in proceedings pursuant to section 240 of the Act. In an appropriate case, the immigration judge shall determine whether under that Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022, the alien should be returned to Canada, or whether the alien should be permitted to pursue asylum or other protection in the United States.
(2) An alien described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section is ineligible to apply for asylum, pursuant to section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act, unless the immigration judge determines, by preponderance of the evidence, that:
(i) The Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022, does not apply to the alien or does not preclude the alien from applying for asylum in the United States; or
(ii) The alien qualifies for an exception to the Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022, as set forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(3) The immigration judge shall apply the applicable regulations in deciding whether the alien qualifies for any exception under the Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022, that would permit the United States to exercise authority over the alien's asylum claim. The exceptions under the Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022, are codified at 8 CFR 208.30(e)(6)(iii). The immigration judge shall not review, consider, or decide any issues pertaining to any discretionary determination on whether the alien should be permitted to pursue an asylum claim in the United States notwithstanding the general terms of the Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022, as such discretionary public interest determinations are reserved to DHS. However, an alien in removal proceedings who is otherwise ineligible to apply for asylum under the Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022, may apply for asylum if DHS files a written notice in the proceedings before the immigration judge that it has decided in the public interest to allow the alien to pursue claims for asylum or withholding of removal.
(4) An alien who is found to be ineligible to apply for asylum under section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act is ineligible to apply for withholding of removal pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act and the Convention Against Torture. However, the alien may apply for any other relief from removal for which the alien may be eligible. If an alien who is subject to the Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022, and section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act is ordered removed, the alien shall be ordered removed to Canada, in which the alien will be able to pursue his or her claims for asylum or protection against persecution or torture under the laws of Canada.
(h)
Other asylum cooperative agreements.
(1) The immigration judge has authority to apply section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act, relating to a determination that an alien may be removed to a third country pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement—other than the 2002 U.S.-Canada Agreement, which includes the Additional Protocol of 2022—in the case of an alien who is subject to the terms of the relevant agreement and is placed in proceedings pursuant to section 240 of the Act. In an appropriate case, the immigration judge shall determine whether under the relevant agreement the alien should be removed to the third country, or whether the alien should be permitted to pursue asylum or other protection claims in the United States. If more than one agreement applies to the alien and the alien is ordered removed, the immigration judge shall enter alternate orders of removal to each relevant country.
(2) An alien described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section is ineligible to apply for asylum pursuant to section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act, or for withholding of removal or CAT protection in the United States, unless the immigration judge determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that:
(i) The relevant agreement does not apply to the alien or does not preclude
the alien from applying for asylum in the United States;
(ii) The alien qualifies for an exception to the relevant agreement as set forth in paragraph (h)(3) of this section and the
Federal Register
document specifying the exceptions particular to the relevant agreement; or
(iii) The alien has demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted on account of a protected ground or tortured in the third country.
(3) The immigration judge shall apply the applicable regulations in deciding whether an alien described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section qualifies for an exception under the relevant agreement that would permit the United States to exercise authority over the alien's asylum claim. The exceptions for agreements with countries other than Canada are further explained by the applicable published
Federal Register
document setting out each Agreement and its exceptions. The immigration judge shall not review, consider, or decide any issues pertaining to any discretionary determination on whether an alien described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section should be allowed to pursue an application for asylum in the United States notwithstanding the general terms of an agreement, as section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act reserves to the Secretary or his delegates the determination whether it is in the public interest for the alien to receive asylum in the United States. However, an alien in removal proceedings who is otherwise ineligible to apply for asylum under an agreement may apply for asylum if DHS files a written notice in the proceedings before the immigration judge that DHS has decided in the public interest that the alien may pursue an application for asylum or withholding of removal in the United States.
(4) If the immigration judge determines that an alien described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section is subject to the terms of agreements formed pursuant to section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act, and that the alien has failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the alien would be persecuted on account of a protected ground or tortured in those third countries, then the alien is ineligible to apply for withholding of removal pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act and the Convention Against Torture notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter. However, the alien may apply for any other relief from removal for which the alien may be eligible. If an alien who is subject to section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act is ordered removed, the alien shall be ordered removed to the relevant third country in which the alien will be able to pursue his or her claims for asylum or protection against persecution or torture under the laws of that country.

§ 1240.16
Application of new procedures or termination of proceedings in old proceedings pursuant to section 309(c) of Public Law 104-208.
The Attorney General shall have the sole discretion to apply the provisions of section 309(c) of Public Law 104-208, which provides for the application of new removal procedures to certain cases in exclusion or deportation proceedings and for the termination of certain cases in exclusion or deportation proceedings and initiation of new removal proceedings. The Attorney General's application of the provisions of section 309(c) shall become effective upon publication of a notice in the

However, if the Attorney General determines, in the exercise of his or her discretion, that the delay caused by publication would adversely affect the interests of the United States or the effective enforcement of the immigration laws, the Attorney General's application shall become effective immediately upon issuance, and shall be published in the
Federal Register
as soon as practicable thereafter.
§ 1240.17
Removal proceedings where the respondent has a credible fear of persecution or torture.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies in cases referred to the immigration court under 8 CFR 208.14(c)(1) where the respondent has been found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) subsequently adjudicated but did not grant the respondent's application for asylum under section 208 of the Act; or the respondent was included in a spouse's or parent's application under 8 CFR 208.2(a)(1)(ii) that USCIS subsequently adjudicated but did not grant under section 208 of the Act. Except as otherwise provided in this section, removal proceedings for such respondents shall be governed by the same rules and procedures that apply to proceedings conducted under this subpart. In all cases, such proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with section 208 of the Act. Should any part of the USCIS process governing cases covered by 8 CFR 208.2(a)(1)(ii) be enjoined or vacated, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) shall have the discretion to adjudicate any case referred to EOIR under 8 CFR 208.14(c)(1) using the rules and procedures that apply to proceedings conducted under this subpart without regard to this section.
(b)
Commencement of proceedings.
Removal proceedings conducted under this section shall commence when DHS files a Notice to Appear (NTA) pursuant to 8 CFR part 1239 and schedules the master calendar hearing to take place 30 days after the date the NTA is served or, if a hearing cannot be held on that date, on the next available date no later than 35 days after the date of service. Where the NTA is served by mail, the date of service shall be construed as the date the NTA is mailed. The DHS component issuing the NTA shall also identify for the respondent and the immigration court that the case is subject to the provisions of this section. DHS shall personally serve the NTA on the respondent whenever practicable and by mail when personal service is not effectuated, and shall inform the respondent of the right to be represented by counsel.
(c)
Service of the record.
No later than the date of the master calendar hearing, DHS shall serve on the respondent and on the immigration court where the NTA is filed the record initiating proceedings as defined in this paragraph (c). The record initiating proceedings shall include the record of proceedings for the asylum merits interview, as outlined in 8 CFR 208.9(f), the Form I-213, Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, pertaining to the respondent, and the asylum officer's written decision issued pursuant to 8 CFR 208.19. If service is not effectuated as provided in this paragraph (c), the schedule of proceedings pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section shall be delayed until service is effectuated.
(d)
Failure to appear.
An immigration judge shall issue an in absentia removal order where the respondent fails to appear at the master calendar hearing scheduled under paragraph (b) of this section, or at a later status conference or hearing under this section, if the requirements under section 240(b)(5) of the Act and § 1003.26 of this chapter are met, unless the immigration judge waives the respondent's presence under § 1003.25(a) of this chapter. If the asylum officer determined the respondent eligible for withholding of removal under the Act or withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, the immigration judge shall give effect to the protection for which the asylum officer determined the respondent eligible, unless DHS makes a prima facie showing, through evidence that specifically pertains to the respondent and was not in the record of proceedings for the USCIS asylum merits interview, that the respondent is not eligible for such protection(s). Where DHS makes such a showing at the master calendar
hearing or status conference, the immigration judge shall allow the respondent a reasonable opportunity of at least 10, but no more than 30, days to respond before issuing an order.
(e)
Form of application.
In removal proceedings under this section, the written record of the positive credible fear determination issued in accordance with 8 CFR 208.30(f) satisfies the respondent's filing requirement for the application for asylum, withholding of removal under the Act, and withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. The record of the proceedings for the hearing before the asylum officer, as outlined in 8 CFR 208.9(f), and the asylum officer's decision, together with any amendment, correction, or supplementation made before the immigration judge as described in § 1208.3(a)(2) of this chapter, shall be admitted as evidence and considered by the immigration judge, in addition to any further documentation and testimony provided by the parties under the procedures in this section.
(f)
Schedule of proceedings
—(1)
Master calendar hearing.
At the master calendar hearing, the immigration judge shall perform the functions required by § 1240.10(a), including advising the respondent of the right to be represented, at no expense to the Government, by counsel of the respondent's own choice. In addition, the immigration judge shall advise the respondent as to the nature of removal proceedings under this section, including: That the respondent has pending applications for asylum, withholding of removal under the Act and withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, as appropriate; that the respondent has the right to present evidence in support of the applications; that the respondent has the right to call witnesses and to testify at any merits hearing; and that the respondent must comply with the deadlines that govern the submission of evidence. Except where the respondent is ordered removed in absentia, at the conclusion of the master calendar hearing, the immigration judge shall schedule a status conference 30 days after the master calendar hearing or, if a status conference cannot be held on that date, on the next available date no later than 35 days after the master calendar hearing. The immigration judge shall inform the respondent of the requirements for the status conference. The adjournment of the case until the status conference shall not constitute a continuance for the purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(2)
Status conference.
The purpose of the status conference shall be to take pleadings, identify and narrow the issues, determine whether the case can be decided on the documentary record, and, if necessary, ready the case for a merits hearing. At the status conference, the immigration judge shall advise the respondent that: The respondent has the right to present evidence in support of the applications; the respondent has the right to call witnesses and to testify at any merits hearing; and the respondent must comply with the deadlines that govern the submission of evidence. Based on the parties' representations at the status conference and an independent evaluation of the record, the immigration judge shall decide whether further proceedings are warranted or whether the case will be decided on the documentary record in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section. If the immigration judge determines that further proceedings are warranted, the immigration judge shall schedule the merits hearing to take place 60 days after the master calendar hearing or, if the merits hearing cannot be held on that date, on the next available date no later than 65 days after the master calendar hearing. The immigration judge may schedule additional status conferences prior to the merits hearing if the immigration judge determines that such conferences are warranted and would contribute to the efficient resolution of the case.
(i)
The respondent.
At the status conference, the respondent shall plead to the NTA under § 1240.10(c), and indicate orally or in writing whether the respondent intends to seek any protection(s) for which the asylum officer did not find the respondent eligible.
(A)(
1
) If the respondent indicates that the respondent intends to contest removal or seek any protection(s) for
which the asylum officer did not determine the respondent eligible, the respondent shall, either orally or in writing:
(
i
) Indicate whether the respondent intends to testify before the immigration court;
(
ii
) Identify any witnesses the respondent intends to call in support of the applications at the merits hearing;
(
iii
) Provide any additional documentation in support of the applications;
(
iv
) Describe any alleged errors or omissions in the asylum officer's decision or the record of proceedings before the asylum officer;
(
v
) Articulate or confirm any additional bases for asylum and related protection, whether or not they were presented to or developed before the asylum officer; and
(
vi
) State any additional requested forms of relief or protection.
(
2
) If the respondent is unrepresented, the respondent shall not be required to provide items set forth in paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A)(
1
)(
iv
), (
v
), and (
vi
) of this section.
(B) If the respondent indicates that the respondent does not intend to contest removal or seek any protection(s) for which the asylum officer did not find the respondent eligible, the immigration judge shall order the respondent removed, and no further proceedings shall be held by the immigration judge. If the asylum officer determined the respondent eligible for withholding of removal under the Act or withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, the immigration judge shall give effect to the protection(s) for which the asylum officer determined the respondent eligible, unless DHS makes a prima facie showing, through evidence that specifically pertains to the respondent and was not in the record of proceedings for the USCIS asylum merits interview, that the respondent is not eligible for such protection(s).
(ii)
DHS.
(A) At the status conference, DHS shall indicate orally or in writing whether it intends to:
(
1
) Rest on the record;
(
2
) Waive cross examination of the respondent;
(3)
Otherwise participate in the case; or
(
4
) Waive appeal if the immigration judge decides that the respondent's application should be granted.
(B) If DHS indicates that it will participate in the case, it shall, either orally or in writing at the status conference, or in a written submission pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section:
(
1
) State its position on each of the respondent's claimed grounds for asylum or related protection;
(
2
) State which elements of the respondent's claim for asylum or related protection it is contesting and which facts it is disputing, if any, and provide an explanation of its position;
(
3
) Identify any witnesses it intends to call at any merits hearing;
(
4
) Provide any additional non-rebuttal or non-impeachment evidence; and
(
5
) State whether the appropriate identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations required by section 208(d)(5)(A)(i) of the Act and § 1003.47 of this chapter have been completed.
(C) Any position DHS expresses pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may be retracted, orally or in writing, prior to the issuance of the immigration judge's decision, if DHS seeks consideration of evidence pursuant to the standard laid out in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Where the immigration judge holds a merits hearing or hearings, any position DHS expressed pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) may only be retracted prior to the final hearing; if no such hearing is held, the retraction must take place prior to the immigration judge's decision.
(3)
Written submissions.
(i) If DHS intends to participate in the case, DHS shall file a written statement that provides any information required under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section that DHS did not provide at the status conference, as well as any other relevant information or argument in response to the respondent's submissions. DHS's written statement, if any, shall be filed no later than 15 days prior to the scheduled merits hearing or, if the immigration judge determines that no such hearing is warranted, no later
than 15 days following the status conference. Where DHS intends to participate in the case but does not timely provide its position as required under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, either at the status conference or in its written statement, to one or more of the respondent's claimed grounds for asylum or related protection, including which arguments raised by the respondent it is disputing and which facts it is contesting, the immigration judge shall have authority to deem those arguments or claims unopposed; provided, however, that DHS may respond at the merits hearing to any arguments or claimed bases for asylum first advanced by the respondent after the status conference.
(ii) The respondent may submit a filing no later than 5 days prior to the scheduled merits hearing or, if the immigration judge determines that no such hearing is warranted, no later than 25 days following the status conference, that supplements the respondent's oral statement or written submission under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. In the respondent's supplemental filing, if any, the respondent shall reply to any statement submitted by DHS, identify any additional witnesses, and provide any additional documentation in support of respondent's applications.
(4)
Merits hearings.
(i) If DHS has indicated that it waives cross examination and neither the respondent nor DHS has requested to present testimony under the pre-hearing procedures in paragraph (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the immigration judge shall decide the case on the documentary record, without holding a merits hearing, unless the immigration judge, after consideration of the record, determines that a merits hearing is necessary to fulfill the immigration judge's duty to fully develop the record.
(ii) If the respondent has timely requested to present testimony and DHS has indicated that it waives cross examination and does not intend to present testimony or produce evidence, and the immigration judge concludes, consistent with the immigration judge's duty to fully develop the record, that the respondent's application can be granted without further testimony, the immigration judge shall grant the application without holding a merits hearing.
(iii) In all other situations, the immigration judge shall proceed as follows:
(A) If the immigration judge determines that proceedings can be completed at the merits hearing scheduled under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the immigration judge shall hold the scheduled merits hearing, at which the immigration judge shall swear the respondent to the truth and accuracy of any information or statements submitted pursuant to paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, hear all live testimony requested by the parties, consider the parties' submissions, and, whenever practicable, issue an oral decision in the case.
(B) If the immigration judge determines that proceedings cannot be completed at the merits hearing scheduled under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the immigration judge may conduct a portion of the scheduled hearing, hold a status conference in lieu of the scheduled hearing, and take any other steps the immigration judge deems necessary and efficient to expeditiously resolve the case. The immigration judge shall schedule any and all subsequent merits hearings to occur no later than 30 days after the initial merits hearing.
(5)
Decision.
Whenever practicable, the immigration judge shall issue an oral decision on the date of the final merits hearing or, if the immigration judge determines that no merits hearing is warranted, no more than 30 days after the status conference. The immigration judge may not, however, issue a decision in a case where DHS has made a prima facie showing, through evidence that specifically pertains to the respondent and was not in the record of proceedings for the USCIS asylum merits interview, that the respondent is not eligible for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture unless the respondent was first provided a reasonable opportunity of at least 10, but no more than 30, days to respond to the evidence submitted by DHS. Where issuance of an oral decision on the date specified under the first sentence of this paragraph (f)(5) is not practicable,
the immigration judge shall issue an oral or written decision as soon as practicable, and in no case more than 45 days after the date specified under the first sentence of this paragraph (f)(5).
(g)
Consideration of evidence and testimony.
(1) The immigration judge shall exclude documentary evidence or witness testimony only if it is not relevant or probative; if its use is fundamentally unfair; or if the documentary evidence is not submitted or the testimony is not requested by the applicable deadline, absent a timely request for a continuance or filing extension that is granted.
(2) The immigration judge may consider documentary evidence or witness testimony submitted after the applicable deadline, taking into account any timely requests for continuances or filing extensions that are granted, but before the immigration judge has issued a decision, only if the evidence could not reasonably have been obtained and presented before the applicable deadline through the exercise of due diligence or if the exclusion of such evidence would violate a statute or the Constitution. The admission of such evidence shall not automatically entitle either party to a continuance or filing extension; such a continuance or extension is governed by paragraph (h) of this section.
(h)
Continuances, adjournments, and filing extensions
—(1)
In general.
For cases governed by this section, an immigration judge may grant a continuance of a hearing date or extension of a filing deadline only as set forth in this paragraph (h).
(2)
Respondent-requested continuances and filings extensions.
(i) The immigration judge may, for good cause shown, grant the respondent continuances and extend the respondent's filing deadlines. Each such continuance or extension shall not exceed 10 calendar days, unless the immigration judge determines that a longer period is more efficient. The immigration judge may not grant the respondent continuances or extensions for good cause that cause a merits hearing to occur more than 90 days after the master calendar hearing.
(ii) The immigration judge may grant the respondent continuances or extensions that cause a merits hearing to occur more than 90 days after the master calendar hearing only if the respondent demonstrates that the continuance or extension is necessary to ensure a fair proceeding and the need for the continuance or extension exists despite the respondent's exercise of due diligence. The length of any such continuance or extension shall be limited to the time necessary to ensure a fair proceeding. The immigration judge may not grant the respondent continuances or extensions pursuant to this paragraph (h)(2)(ii) that cause a merits hearing to occur more than 135 days after the master calendar hearing.
(iii) The immigration judge may grant the respondent continuances or extensions notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section if the respondent demonstrates that failure to grant the continuance or extension would be contrary to statute or the Constitution.
(iv) In calculating the delay to a merits hearing for purposes of applying paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the immigration judge shall exclude any continuances, hearing delays, or filing extensions issued pursuant to paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) of this section.
(3)
DHS-requested continuances and filings extensions.
The immigration judge may, based on significant Government need, grant DHS continuances and extend DHS's filing deadlines. Significant Government need may include, but is not limited to, confirming domestic or foreign law-enforcement interest in the respondent, conducting forensic analysis of documents submitted in support of a relief application or other fraud-related investigations, and securing criminal history information, translations of foreign language documents, witness testimony or affidavits, or evidence suggesting that the respondent is described in sections 208(a)(2)(A)(C), 208(b)(2), or 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act or has filed a frivolous asylum application as defined in 8 CFR 208.20.
(4)
Continuances, adjournments, and filing extensions due to exigent circumstances.
The immigration judge may continue a status conference or a hearing, or extend a filing deadline, and a status conference or a hearing
set forth in this section may be adjourned, where necessary due to exigent circumstances, such as the unavailability of an immigration judge, the respondent, or either party's counsel assigned to the case due to illness; or the closure of the immigration court or a relevant DHS office. Any such continuance, extension, or adjournment shall be limited to the shortest period feasible and shall not be counted against the time limits set forth in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. A new finding of exigent circumstances must be made to justify any and every subsequent continuance, extension, or adjournment under this paragraph (h)(4).
(i)
Decision.
(1) Where the asylum officer did not grant asylum and did not determine that the respondent was eligible for withholding of removal under the Act or for withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture based on the record before USCIS, the immigration judge shall adjudicate, de novo, the respondent's applications for asylum and, if necessary, for withholding of removal under the Act, and withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, where the asylum officer did not grant asylum but determined the respondent eligible for withholding of removal under the Act, or for withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, the immigration judge shall adjudicate, de novo, the respondent's application for asylum. If the immigration judge subsequently denies asylum and enters a removal order, the immigration judge shall give effect to the protection(s) for which the asylum officer determined the applicant eligible, unless DHS has demonstrated, through evidence or testimony that specifically pertains to the respondent and was not in the record of proceedings for the USCIS asylum merits interview, that the respondent is not eligible for such protection(s). The immigration judge shall also grant any additional protection(s) for which the immigration judge finds the applicant eligible. DHS shall not be permitted to appeal to the Board the grant of any protection(s) for which the asylum officer determined the respondent eligible, except to argue that the immigration judge should have denied the application(s) based on the evidence allowed under this paragraph (i)(2).
(3) Where the respondent has requested voluntary departure in the alternative to, or in lieu of, asylum and related protection, the immigration judge shall adjudicate this application where necessary.
(j)
Changes of venue.
Where an immigration judge grants a motion to change venue under § 1003.20 of this chapter, the schedule of proceedings pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section commences again with the master calendar hearing at the court to which venue has been changed.
(k)
Exceptions.
The provisions in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section shall not apply in any of the following circumstances:
(1) The respondent was under the age of 18 on the date the NTA was issued, except where the respondent is in removal proceedings with one or more adult family members.
(2) The respondent has produced evidence of prima facie eligibility for relief or protection other than asylum, withholding of removal under the Act, withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, or voluntary departure, and the respondent is seeking to apply for, or has applied for, such relief or protection.
(3) The respondent has produced evidence that supports a prima facie showing that the respondent is not subject to removal as charged (including under any additional or substitute charges of removal brought by DHS pursuant to § 1240.10(e)), and the immigration judge determines, under § 1240.10(d), that the issue of whether the respondent is subject to removal cannot be resolved simultaneously with the adjudication of the respondent's applications for asylum, withholding of removal under the Act, or withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture.
(4) The immigration judge, pursuant to § 1240.10(f), finds the respondent subject to removal to a country other than the country or countries in which the
respondent claimed a fear of persecution, torture, or both before the asylum officer and the respondent claims a fear of persecution, torture, or both in that alternative country or countries.
(5) The case has been reopened or remanded following the immigration judge's order.
(6) The respondent has exhibited indicia of mental incompetency.
(l)
Termination of protection.
Nothing in this section shall preclude DHS from seeking termination of asylum, withholding of removal under the Act, or withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 CFR 208.17(d) and 208.24(f).

§ 1240.21
Suspension of deportation and adjustment of status under section 244(a) of the Act (as in effect before April 1, 1997) and cancellation of removal and adjustment of status under section 240A(b) of the Act for certain nonpermanent residents.
(a)
Applicability of annual cap on suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal.
(1) As used in this section, the term
cap
means the numerical limitation of 4,000 grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal in any fiscal year (except fiscal year 1998, which has a limitation of 8,000 grants) pursuant to section 240A(e) of the Act.
(2) The provisions of this section apply to grants of suspension of deportation pursuant to section 244(a) of the Act (as in effect before April 1, 1997) or cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Act that are subject to a numerical limitation in section 240A(e) of the Act for any fiscal year. This section does not apply to grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal to aliens described in section 309(c)(5)(C)(i) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), as amended by section 203(a)(1) of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), or aliens in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997, who apply for suspension of deportation pursuant to section 244(a)(3) of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997). The Immigration Court and the Board shall no longer issue conditional grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal as provided in 8 CFR 240.21 (as in effect prior to September 30, 1998).
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal in fiscal years subsequent to fiscal year 1998.
On and after October 1, 1998, the Immigration Court and the Board may grant applications for suspension of deportation and adjustment of status under section 244(a) of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997) or cancellation of removal and adjustment of status under section 240A(b) of the Act that meet the statutory requirements for such relief and warrant a favorable exercise of discretion until the annual numerical limitation has been reached in that fiscal
year. The awarding of such relief shall be determined according to the date the order granting such relief becomes final as defined in §§ 1003.1(d)(7) and 1003.39 of this chapter.
(1)
Applicability of the annual limitation.
When grants are no longer available in a fiscal year, further decisions to grant such relief must be reserved until such time as a grant becomes available under the annual limitation in a subsequent fiscal year.
(2)
Aliens applying for additional forms of relief.
Whether or not the cap has been reached, the Immigration Court or the Board shall adjudicate concurrently all other forms of relief for which the alien has applied. Applications for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal shall be denied in the exercise of discretion if the alien is granted asylum or adjustment of status, including pursuant to section 202 of NACARA, while the suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal application is pending. Where an appeal of a decision granting asylum or adjustment is sustained by the Board, a decision to deny as a matter of discretion an application for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal on this basis shall be reconsidered.

# Subpart C—Voluntary Departure
§ 1240.26
Voluntary departure—authority of the Executive Office for Immigration Review.
(a)
Eligibility: general.
A noncitizen previously granted voluntary departure under section 240B of the Act, including by DHS under § 240.25, and who fails to depart voluntarily within the time specified, shall thereafter be ineligible, for a period of ten years, for voluntary departure or for relief under sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act.
(b)
Prior to completion of removal proceedings
—(1)
Grant by the immigration judge.
(i) A noncitizen may be granted voluntary departure by an immigration judge pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Act only if the noncitizen:
(A) Makes such request prior to or at the master calendar hearing at which the case is initially calendared for a merits hearing;
(B) Makes no additional requests for relief (or if such requests have been made, such requests are withdrawn prior to any grant of voluntary departure pursuant to this section);
(C) Concedes removability;
(D) Waives appeal of all issues; and
(E) Has not been convicted of a crime described in section 101(a)(43) of the Act and is not deportable under section 237(a)(4).
(ii) The judge may not grant voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act beyond 30 days after the master calendar hearing at which the case is initially calendared for a merits hearing, except pursuant to a stipulation under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2)
Stipulation.
At any time prior to the completion of removal proceedings, the DHS counsel may stipulate to a grant of voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act.
(3)
Conditions.
(i) The judge may impose such conditions as he or she deems necessary to ensure the noncitizen's timely departure from the United States, including the posting of a voluntary departure bond to be canceled upon proof that the noncitizen has departed the United States within the time specified. The alien shall be required to present to DHS, for inspection and photocopying, the noncitizen's passport or other travel documentation sufficient to assure lawful entry into the country to which the noncitizen is departing, unless:
(A) A travel document is not necessary to return to the noncitizen's native country or to which country the noncitizen is departing; or
(B) The document is already in the possession of DHS.
(ii) DHS may hold the passport or documentation for sufficient time to investigate its authenticity. If such documentation is not immediately available to the noncitizen, but the immigration judge is satisfied that the noncitizen is making diligent efforts to secure it, voluntary departure may be granted for a period not to exceed 120 days, subject to the condition that the
noncitizen within 60 days must secure such documentation and present it to DHS. DHS in its discretion may extend the period within which the noncitizen must provide such documentation. If the documentation is not presented within the 60-day period or any extension thereof, the voluntary departure order shall vacate automatically and the alternate order of removal will take effect, as if in effect on the date of issuance of the immigration judge order.
(iii) If the noncitizen files a post-decision motion to reopen or reconsider during the period allowed for voluntary departure, the grant of voluntary departure shall be terminated automatically, and the alternate order of removal will take effect immediately. The penalties for failure to depart voluntarily under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply if the noncitizen has filed a post-decision motion to reopen or reconsider during the period allowed for voluntary departure. Upon the granting of voluntary departure, the immigration judge shall advise the noncitizen of the provisions of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii).
(iv) The automatic termination of a grant of voluntary departure and the effectiveness of the alternative order of removal shall not affect, in any way, the date that the order of the immigration judge or the Board became administratively final, as determined under the provisions of the applicable regulations in this chapter.
(c)
At the conclusion of the removal proceedings
—(1)
Required findings.
An immigration judge may grant voluntary departure at the conclusion of the removal proceedings under section 240B(b) of the Act, if he or she finds that:
(i) The alien has been physically present in the United States for period of at least one year preceding the date the Notice to Appear was served under section 239(a) of the Act;
(ii) The alien is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least five years immediately preceding the application;
(iii) The alien has not been convicted of a crime described in section 101(a)(43) of the Act and is not deportable under section 237(a)(4); and
(iv) The alien has established by clear and convincing evidence that the noncitizen has the means to depart the United States and has the intention to do so.
(2)
Travel documentation.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the clear and convincing evidence of the means to depart shall include in all cases presentation by the noncitizen of a passport or other travel documentation sufficient to assure lawful entry into the country to which the noncitizen is departing. DHS shall have full opportunity to inspect and photocopy the documentation, and to challenge its authenticity or sufficiency before voluntary departure is granted.
(3)
Conditions.
The immigration judge may impose such conditions as he or she deems necessary to ensure the noncitizen's timely departure from the United States. The immigration judge shall advise the noncitizen of the conditions set forth in this paragraph (c)(3)(i)-(iii). If the immigration judge imposes conditions beyond those specifically enumerated below, the immigration judge shall advise the noncitizen of such conditions before granting voluntary departure. Upon the conditions being set forth, the noncitizen shall be provided the opportunity to accept the grant of voluntary departure or decline voluntary departure if he or she is unwilling to accept the amount of the bond or other conditions. In all cases under section 240B(b) of the Act:
(i) The alien shall be required to post a voluntary departure bond, in an amount necessary to ensure that the noncitizen departs within the time specified, but in no case less than $500. Before granting voluntary departure, the immigration judge shall advise the noncitizen of the specific amount of the bond to be set and the duty to post the bond with the ICE Field Office Director within 5 business days of the immigration judge's order granting voluntary departure.
(ii) A noncitizen who has been granted voluntary departure shall, within 30 days of filing of an appeal with the Board, submit sufficient proof of having posted the required voluntary departure bond. If the noncitizen does not
provide timely proof to the Board that the required voluntary departure bond has been posted with DHS, the Board will not reinstate the period of voluntary departure in its final order.
(iii) Upon granting voluntary departure, the immigration judge shall advise the noncitizen that if the noncitizen files a post-order motion to reopen or reconsider during the period allowed for voluntary departure, the grant of voluntary departure shall terminate automatically and the alternate order of removal will take effect immediately.
(iv) The automatic termination of an order of voluntary departure and the effectiveness of the alternative order of removal shall not impact, in any way, the date that the order of the immigration judge or the Board became administratively final, as determined under the provisions of the applicable regulations in this chapter.
(v) If, after posting the voluntary departure bond the noncitizen satisfies the condition of the bond by departing the United States prior to the expiration of the period granted for voluntary departure, the noncitizen may apply to the ICE Field Office Director for the bond to be canceled, upon submission of proof of the noncitizen's timely departure by such methods as the ICE Field Office Director may prescribe.
(vi) The voluntary departure bond may be canceled by such methods as the ICE Field Office Director may prescribe if the noncitizen is subsequently successful in overturning or remanding the immigration judge's decision regarding removability.
(4)
Provisions relating to bond.
The voluntary departure bond shall be posted with the ICE Field Office Director within 5 business days of the immigration judge's order granting voluntary departure, and the ICE Field Office Director may, at the ICE Field Office Director's discretion, hold the noncitizen in custody until the bond is posted. Because the purpose of the voluntary departure bond is to ensure that the noncitizen does depart from the United States, as promised, the failure to post the bond, when required, within 5 business days may be considered in evaluating whether the noncitizen should be detained based on risk of flight, and also may be considered as a negative discretionary factor with respect to any discretionary form of relief. The noncitizen's failure to post the required voluntary departure bond within the time required does not terminate the noncitizen's obligation to depart within the period allowed or exempt the noncitizen from the consequences for failure to depart voluntarily during the period allowed. However, if the noncitizen had waived appeal of the immigration judge's decision, the noncitizen's failure to post the required voluntary departure bond within the period allowed means that the alternate order of removal takes effect immediately pursuant to 8 CFR 1241.1(f), except that a noncitizen granted the privilege of voluntary departure under 8 CFR 1240.26(c) will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the noncitizen:
(i) Departs the United States no later than 25 days following the failure to post bond;
(ii) Provides to DHS such evidence of the noncitizen's departure as the ICE Field Office Director may require; and
(iii) Provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she remains outside of the United States.
(d)
Alternate order of removal.
Upon granting a request made for voluntary departure either prior to the completion of proceedings or at the conclusion of proceedings, the immigration judge shall also enter an alternate order or removal.
(e)
Periods of time.
If voluntary departure is granted prior to the completion of removal proceedings, the immigration judge may grant a period not to exceed 120 days. If voluntary departure is granted at the conclusion of proceedings, the immigration judge may grant a period not to exceed 60 days.
(1)
Motion to reopen or reconsider filed during the voluntary departure period.
The filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the period allowed for voluntary departure has the effect of automatically terminating the grant of voluntary departure, and accordingly does not toll, stay, or extend the period allowed for voluntary departure under this section. See paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (c)(3)(ii)
of this section. If the noncitizen files a post-order motion to reopen or reconsider during the period allowed for voluntary departure, the penalties for failure to depart voluntarily under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. The Board shall advise the noncitizen of the condition provided in this paragraph in writing if it reinstates the immigration judge's grant of voluntary departure.
(2)
Motion to reopen or reconsider filed after the expiration of the period allowed for voluntary departure.
The filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider after the time allowed for voluntary departure has already expired does not in any way impact the period of time allowed for voluntary departure under this section. The granting of a motion to reopen or reconsider that was filed after the penalties under section 240B(d) of the Act had already taken effect, as a consequence of the noncitizen's prior failure voluntarily to depart within the time allowed, does not have the effect of vitiating or vacating those penalties, except as provided in section 240B(d)(2) of the Act.
(f)
Extension of time to depart.
Authority to extend the time within which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the Board is only within the jurisdiction of the district director, the Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner for Detention and Removal, or the Director of the Office of Juvenile Affairs. An immigration judge or the Board may reinstate voluntary departure in a removal proceeding that has been reopened for a purpose other than solely making an application for voluntarily departure if reopening was granted prior to the expiration of the original period of voluntary departure. In no event can the total period of time, including any extension, exceed 120 days or 60 days as set forth in section 240B of the Act. The filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider does not toll, stay, or extend the period allowed for voluntary departure. The filing of a petition for review has the effect of automatically terminating the grant of voluntary departure, and accordingly also does not toll, stay, or extend the period allowed for voluntary departure.
(g)
Administrative Appeals.
No appeal shall lie regarding the length of a period of voluntary departure (as distinguished from issues of whether to grant voluntary departure).
(h)
Reinstatement of voluntary departure.
An immigration judge or the Board may reinstate voluntary departure in a removal proceeding that has been reopened for a purpose other than solely making application for voluntary departure, if reopening was granted prior to the expiration of the original period of voluntary departure. In no event can the total period of time, including any extension, exceed 120 days or 60 days as set forth in section 240B of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section.
(i)
Effect of filing a petition for review.
If, prior to departing the United States, the noncitizen files a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1252) or any other judicial challenge to the administratively final order, any grant of voluntary departure shall terminate automatically upon the filing of the petition or other judicial challenge and the alternate order of removal entered pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section shall immediately take effect, except that a noncitizen granted the privilege of voluntary departure under 8 CFR 1240.26(c) will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the noncitizen departs the United States no later than 30 days following the filing of a petition for review, provides to DHS such evidence of the noncitizen's departure as the ICE Field Office Director may require, and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she remains outside of the United States. The Board shall advise the noncitizen of the condition provided in this paragraph in writing if it reinstates the immigration judge's grant of voluntary departure. The automatic termination of a grant of voluntary departure and the effectiveness of the alternative order of removal shall not affect, in any way, the date that the order of the immigration judge or the Board became administratively final, as determined under the provisions of the applicable regulations in this chapter. Since the grant of voluntary departure is terminated by the filing of the petition for review, the noncitizen will
be subject to the alternate order of removal, but the penalties for failure to depart voluntarily under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to a noncitizen who files a petition for review, and who remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending.
(j) [Reserved]
(k)
Authority of the Board to grant voluntary departure in the first instance.
The following procedures apply to any request for voluntary departure reviewed by the Board:
(1) If the Board finds that an immigration judge incorrectly denied a noncitizen's request for voluntary departure or failed to provide appropriate advisals, the Board may consider the noncitizen's request for voluntary departure de novo and, if warranted, may enter its own order of voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal.
(2) In cases in which a noncitizen has appealed an immigration judge's decision or in which DHS and the noncitizen have both appealed an immigration judge's decision, the Board shall not grant voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act unless:
(i) The alien requested voluntary departure under that section before the immigration judge, the immigration judge denied the request, and the noncitizen timely appealed;
(ii) The noncitizen's notice of appeal specified that the noncitizen is appealing the immigration judge's denial of voluntary departure and identified the specific factual and legal findings that the noncitizen is challenging;
(iii) The Board finds that the immigration judge's decision was in error; and
(iv) The Board finds that the noncitizen meets all applicable statutory and regulatory criteria for voluntary departure under that section.
(3) In cases in which DHS has appealed an immigration judge's decision, the Board shall not grant voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act unless:
(i) The alien requested voluntary departure under that section before the immigration judge and provided evidence or a proffer of evidence in support of the noncitizen's request;
(ii) The immigration judge either granted the request or did not rule on it; and,
(iii) The Board finds that the noncitizen meets all applicable statutory and regulatory criteria for voluntary departure under that section.
(4) The Board may impose such conditions as it deems necessary to ensure the noncitizen's timely departure from the United States, if supported by the record on appeal and within the scope of the Board's authority on appeal. Unless otherwise indicated in this section, the Board shall advise the noncitizen in writing of the conditions set by the Board, consistent with the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e), (h), and (i) of this section (other than paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section), except that the Board shall advise the noncitizen of the duty to post the bond with the ICE Field Office Director within 30 business days of the Board's order granting voluntary departure. If documentation sufficient to assure lawful entry into the country to which the noncitizen is departing is not contained in the record, but the noncitizen continues to assert a request for voluntary departure under section 240B of the Act and the Board finds that the noncitizen is otherwise eligible for voluntary departure under the Act, the Board may grant voluntary departure for a period not to exceed 120 days, subject to the condition that the noncitizen within 60 days must secure such documentation and present it to DHS and the Board. If the Board imposes conditions beyond those specifically enumerated, the Board shall advise the noncitizen in writing of such conditions. The noncitizen may accept or decline the grant of voluntary departure and may manifest a declination either by written notice to the Board, by failing to timely post any required bond, or by otherwise failing to comply with the Board's order. The grant of voluntary departure shall automatically terminate upon a filing by the noncitizen of a motion to reopen or reconsider the Board's decision, or by filing a timely petition for review of the Board's decision. The noncitizen may decline voluntary departure when unwilling to accept the amount of the bond or other conditions.
(l)
Penalty for failure to depart.
There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the civil penalty for failure to depart, pursuant to section 240B(d)(1)(A) of the Act, shall be set at $3,000 unless the immigration judge or the Board specifically orders a higher or lower amount at the time of granting voluntary departure within the permissible range allowed by law. The immigration judge or the Board shall advise the noncitizen of the amount of this civil penalty at the time of granting voluntary departure.

# Subpart D—Exclusion of Aliens (for Proceedings Commenced Prior to April 1, 1997)
§ 1240.30
Proceedings prior to April 1, 1997.
Subpart D of 8 CFR part 240 applies to exclusion proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997, pursuant to the former section 236 of the Act. An exclusion proceeding is commenced by the filing of Form I-122 with the Immigration Court, and an alien is considered to be in exclusion proceedings only upon such filing. All references to the Act contained in this subpart are references to the Act in effect prior to April 1, 1997.
§ 1240.31
Authority of immigration judges.
In determining cases referred for further inquiry as provided in section 235 of the Act, immigration judges shall have the powers and authority conferred upon them by the Act and this chapter, including the adjudication of applications for adjustment of status pursuant to section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, or section 902 of Pub. L. 105-277. Subject to any specific limitation prescribed by the Act and this chapter, immigration judges shall also exercise the discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney General by the Act as is appropriate and necessary for the disposition of such cases.
[62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 27829, May 21, 1998; 64 FR 25766, May 12, 1999]
§ 1240.32
Hearing.
(a)
Opening.
Exclusion hearings shall be closed to the public, unless the alien at his or her own instance requests that the public, including the press, be permitted to attend; in that event, the hearing shall be open, provided that the alien states for the record that he or she is waiving the requirement in section 236 of the Act that the inquiry shall be kept separate and apart from the public. When the hearing is to be open, depending upon physical facilities, reasonable limitation may be placed upon the number in attendance at any one time, with priority being given to the press over the general public. The immigration judge shall ascertain whether the applicant for admission is the person to whom Form I-122 was previously delivered by the examining immigration officer as provided in 8 CFR part 1235; enter a copy of such form in evidence as an exhibit in the case; inform the applicant of the nature and purpose of the hearing; advise him or her of the privilege of being represented by an attorney of his or her own choice at no expense to the Government; advise him or her of the availability of pro bono legal services for the immigration court location at which the hearing will take place, and ascertain that he or she has received a list of such pro bono legal service providers; and request him or her to ascertain then and there whether he or she desires representation; advise him or her that he or she will have a reasonable opportunity to present evidence in his or her own behalf, to examine and object to evidence against him or her, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government; and place the applicant under oath.
(b)
Procedure.
The immigration judge shall receive and adduce material and relevant evidence, rule upon objections, and otherwise regulate the course of the hearing.
(c)
Attorney for DHS.
DHS shall assign an attorney to each case in which an applicant's nationality is in issue and
may assign an attorney to any case in which such assignment is deemed necessary or advantageous. The duties of the DHS include, but are not limited to, the presentation of evidence and the interrogation, examination, and cross-examination of the applicant and other witnesses. Nothing contained in this section diminishes the authority of an immigration judge to conduct proceedings under this part.
(d)
Depositions.
The procedures specified in § 1240.48(e) shall apply.
(e)
Record.
The hearing before the immigration judge, including the testimony, exhibits, applications, proffers, and requests, the immigration judge's decision, and all written orders, motions, appeals, and other papers filed in the proceeding shall constitute the record in the case. The hearing shall be recorded verbatim except for statements made off the record with the permission of the immigration judge.

§ 1240.33
Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation.
(a) If the alien expresses fear of persecution or harm upon return to his or her country of origin or to a country to which the alien may be deported after a determination of excludability from the United States pursuant to this subpart, and the alien has not been referred to the immigration judge by an asylum officer in accordance with § 1208.14(b) of this chapter, the immigration judge shall:
(1) Advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum in the United States or withholding of deportation to that other country; and
(2) Make available the appropriate application forms.
(b) An application for asylum or withholding of deportation must be filed with the Immigration Court, pursuant to § 1208.4(b) of this chapter. Upon receipt of an application, the Immigration Court may forward a copy to the Department of State pursuant to § 1208.11 of this chapter and shall calendar the case for a hearing. The reply, if any, from the Department of State, unless classified under an applicable Executive Order, shall be given to both the applicant and to DHS counsel and shall be included in the record.
(c) Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation so filed will be decided by the immigration judge pursuant to the requirements and standards established in 8 CFR part 1208 after an evidentiary hearing that is necessary to resolve material factual issues in dispute. An evidentiary hearing extending beyond issues related to the basis for a mandatory denial of the application pursuant to § 1208.13(c) of this chapter is not necessary once the immigration judge has determined that such denial is required.
(1) Evidentiary hearings on applications for asylum or withholding of deportation will be closed to the public unless the applicant expressly requests that it be open pursuant to § 1236.3 of this chapter.
(2) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of the immigration judge properly to control the scope of any evidentiary hearing.
(3) During the exclusion hearing, the applicant shall be examined under oath on his or her application and may present evidence and witnesses on his or her own behalf. The applicant has the burden of establishing that he or she is a refugee as defined in section 101(a)(42) of the Act pursuant to the standard set forth in § 1208.13 of this chapter.
(4) The DHS counsel for the government may call witnesses and present evidence for the record, including information classified under the applicable Executive Order, provided the immigration judge or the Board has determined that such information is relevant to the hearing. The applicant shall be informed when the immigration judge receives such classified information. The agency that provides the classified information to the immigration judge may provide an unclassified summary of the information for release to the applicant whenever it determines it can do so consistently with safeguarding both the classified nature of the information and its source. The summary should be as detailed as possible, in order that the applicant may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such classified information
shall state that such information is material to the decision.
(d) The decision of an immigration judge to grant or deny asylum or withholding of deportation shall be communicated to the applicant and to the DHS counsel for the government. An adverse decision will state why asylum or withholding of deportation was denied.

§ 1240.34
Renewal of application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act.
An adjustment application by an alien paroled under section 212(d)(5) of the Act, which has been denied by the district director, may be renewed in exclusion proceedings under section 236 of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997) before an immigration judge under the following two conditions: first, the denied application must have been properly filed subsequent to the applicant's earlier inspection and admission to the United States; and second, the applicant's later absence from and return to the United States must have been under the terms of an advance parole authorization on Form I-512 granted to permit the applicant's absence and return to pursue the previously filed adjustment application. In a relevant case, the immigration judge may adjudicate the sufficiency of an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A (Form I-864), executed on behalf of an applicant for admission or for adjustment of status, in accordance with the provisions of section 213A of the Act and 8 CFR part 213a.

Aliens who are the holders of valid unexpired refugee travel documents may be ordered excluded only if they are found to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(2), 212(a)(3), or 212(a)(6)(E) of the Act, and it is determined that on the basis of the acts for which they are inadmissible there are compelling reasons of national security or public order for their exclusion. If the immigration judge finds that the alien is inadmissible but determines that there are no compelling reasons of national security or public order for exclusion, the immigration judge shall remand the case to the district director for parole.
§ 1240.36
Finality of order.
The decision of the immigration judge shall become final in accordance with § 1003.37 of this chapter.
§ 1240.37

# Subpart E—Proceedings To Determine Deportability of Aliens in the United States: Hearing and Appeal (for Proceedings Commenced Prior to April 1, 1997)
§ 1240.40
Proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997.
Subpart E of 8 CFR part 1240 applies only to deportation proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997. A deportation proceeding is commenced by the filing of Form I-221 (Order to Show Cause) with the Immigration Court, and an alien is considered to be in deportation proceedings only upon such filing, except in the case of an alien admitted to the United States under the provisions of section 217 of the Act. All references to the Act contained in this subpart pertain to the Act as in effect prior to April 1, 1997.
§ 1240.41
Immigration judges.
(a)
Authority.
In any proceeding conducted under this part the immigration judge shall have the authority to determine deportability and to make decisions, including orders of deportation, as provided by section 242(b) and 242B of the Act; to reinstate orders of deportation as provided by section 242(f) of the Act; to determine applications under sections 208, 212(k), 241(a)(1)(E)(iii), 241(a)(1)(H), 244, 245 and 249 of the Act, section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, and section 902 of Pub. L. 105-277; to determine the country to which an alien's deportation will be directed in accordance with section 243(a) of the Act; to order temporary withholding of deportation pursuant to section 243(h) of the Act; and to take any other action consistent with applicable law and regulations as may be appropriate. An immigration judge may certify his or her decision in any case to the Board of Immigration Appeals when it involves an unusually complex or novel question of law or fact. Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to diminish the authority conferred on immigration judges under section 103 of the Act.
(b)
Withdrawal and substitution of immigration judges.
The immigration judge assigned to conduct the hearing shall at any time withdraw if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified. If an immigration judge becomes unavailable to complete his or her duties within a reasonable time, or if at any time the respondent consents to a substitution, another immigration judge may be assigned to complete the case. The new immigration judge shall familiarize himself or herself with the record in the case and shall state for the record that he or she has done so.
[62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 27829, May 21, 1998; 63 FR 39121, July 21, 1998; 64 FR 25767, May 12, 1999]
§ 1240.42
Representation by counsel.
The respondent may be represented at the hearing by an attorney or other representative qualified under 8 CFR part 1292.
§ 1240.43
Incompetent respondents.
When it is impracticable for the respondent to be present at the hearing because of mental incompetency, the guardian, near relative, or friend who was served with a copy of the order to show cause shall be permitted to appear on behalf of the respondent. If such a person cannot reasonably be found or fails or refuses to appear, the custodian of the respondent shall be requested to appear on behalf of the respondent.
§ 1240.44
Interpreter.
Any person acting as interpreter in a hearing before an immigration judge under this part shall be sworn to interpret and translate accurately, unless the interpreter is an employee of the United States Government, in which event no such oath shall be required.
§ 1240.45
Postponement and adjournment of hearing.
After the commencement of the hearing, the immigration judge may grant a reasonable adjournment either at his or her own instance or, for good cause shown, upon application by the respondent or the Service.
§ 1240.46
Evidence.
(a)
Sufficiency.
A determination of deportability shall not be valid unless it is found by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the facts alleged as grounds for deportation are true.
(b)
Use of prior statements.
The immigration judge may receive in evidence any oral or written statement that is material and relevant to any issue in the case previously made by the respondent or any other person during any investigation, examination, hearing, or trial.
(c)
Testimony.
Testimony of witnesses appearing at the hearing shall be under oath or affirmation administered by the immigration judge.
(d)
Depositions.
The immigration judge may order the taking of depositions pursuant to § 1003.35 of this chapter.
§ 1240.47
Contents of record.
The hearing before the immigration judge, including the testimony, exhibits, applications, proffers, and requests, the immigration judge's decision, and all written orders, motions, appeals, briefs, and other papers filed in the proceedings shall constitute the record in the case. The hearing shall be recorded verbatim except for statements made off the record with the permission of the immigration judge. In his or her discretion, the immigration judge may exclude from the record any arguments made in connection with motions, applications, requests, or objections, but in such event the person affected may submit a brief.
§ 1240.48
Hearing.
(a)
Opening.
The immigration judge shall advise the respondent of his or her right to representation, at no expense to the Government, by counsel of his or her own choice authorized to practice in the proceedings and require him or her to state then and there whether he or she desires representation; advise the respondent of the availability of pro bono legal services for the immigration court location at which the hearing will take place; ascertain that the respondent has received a list of such pro bono legal service providers, and a copy of Form I-618, Written Notice of Appeal Rights; advise the respondent that he or she will have a reasonable opportunity to examine and object to the evidence against him or her, to present evidence in his or her own behalf and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government; place the respondent under oath; read the factual allegations and the charges in the order to show cause to the respondent and explain them in nontechnical language, and enter the order to show cause as an exhibit in the record. Deportation hearings shall be open to the public, except that the immigration judge may, in his or her discretion and for the purpose of protecting witnesses, respondents, or the public interest, direct that the general public or particular individuals shall be excluded from the hearing in any specific case. Depending upon physical facilities, reasonable limitation may be placed upon the number in attendance at any one time, with priority being given to the press over the general public.
(b)
Pleading by respondent.
The immigration judge shall require the respondent to plead to the order to show cause by stating whether he or she admits or denies the factual allegations and his or her deportability under the charges contained therein. If the respondent admits the factual allegations and admits his or her deportability under the charges and the immigration judge is satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain, the immigration judge may determine that deportability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent. The immigration judge shall not accept an admission of deportability from an unrepresented respondent who is incompetent or under age 16 and is not accompanied by a guardian, relative, or friend; nor from an officer of an institution in which a respondent is an inmate or patient. When, pursuant to this paragraph, the immigration judge may not accept an admission of deportability, he or she shall direct a hearing on the issues.
(c)
Issues of deportability.
When deportability is not determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the immigration judge shall request the assignment of a DHS counsel, and shall receive evidence as to any unresolved issues, except that no further
evidence need be received as to any facts admitted during the pleading. The respondent shall provide a court certified copy of a Judicial Recommendation Against Deportation (JRAD) to the immigration judge when such recommendation will be the basis of denying any charge(s) brought by DHS in the proceedings against the respondent. No JRAD is effective against a charge of deportability under section 241(a)(11) of the Act or if the JRAD was granted on or after November 29, 1990.
(d)
Additional charges.
The Service may at any time during a hearing lodge additional charges of deportability, including factual allegations, against the respondent. Copies of the additional factual allegations and charges shall be submitted in writing for service on the respondent and entry as an exhibit in the record. The immigration judge shall read the additional factual allegations and charges to the respondent and explain them to him or her. The immigration judge shall advise the respondent if he or she is not represented by counsel that he or she may be so represented and also that he or she may have a reasonable time within which to meet the additional factual allegations and charges. The respondent shall be required to state then and there whether he or she desires a continuance for either of these reasons. Thereafter, the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply to the additional factual allegations and lodged charges.
[62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 80 FR 59513, Oct. 1, 2015; 86 FR 70724, Dec. 13, 2021]
§ 1240.49
Ancillary matters, applications.
(a)
Creation of the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
The respondent may apply to the immigration judge for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act; for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, or under section 1 of the Act of November 2, 1966, or under section 101 or 104 of the Act of October 28, 1977; or for the creation of a record of lawful admission for permanent residence under section 249 of the Act. The application shall be subject to the requirements of 8 CFR parts 1240, 1245, and 1249. The approval of any application made to the immigration judge under section 245 of the Act by an alien spouse (as defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act) or by an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), shall result in the alien's obtaining the status of lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis in accordance with the provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is applicable. However, the Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence required by section 216(c) of the Act or the Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions required by section 216A(c) of the Act shall be made to the director in accordance with 8 CFR part 1216. In conjunction with any application for creation of status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence made to an immigration judge, if the respondent is inadmissible under any provision of section 212(a) of the Act and believes that he or she meets the eligibility requirements for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she may apply to the immigration judge for such waiver. The immigration judge shall inform the respondent of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for any of the benefits enumerated in this paragraph and shall afford the respondent an opportunity to make application therefor during the hearing. In a relevant case, the immigration judge may adjudicate the sufficiency of an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A (Form I-864), executed on behalf of an applicant for admission or for adjustment of status, in accordance with the provisions of section 213A of the Act and 8 CFR part 213a. In exercising discretionary power when considering an application under this paragraph, the immigration judge may consider and base the decision on information not contained in the record and not made available for inspection by the respondent, provided the Commissioner has determined that such information is relevant and is classified under the applicable Executive Order as requiring protection from unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security. Whenever the immigration judge believes that he or she can do so while safeguarding both the information and its source, the immigration judge
should inform the respondent of the general nature of the information in order that the respondent may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such classified information shall state that the information is material to the decision.
(b)
Voluntary departure.
The respondent may apply to the immigration judge for voluntary departure in lieu of deportation pursuant to section 244(e) of the Act and § 1240.56.
(c)
Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation.
(1) The immigration judge shall notify the respondent that if he or she is finally ordered deported, his or her deportation will in the first instance be directed pursuant to section 243(a) of the Act to the country designated by the respondent and shall afford him or her an opportunity then and there to make such designation. The immigration judge shall then specify and state for the record the country, or countries in the alternative, to which respondent's deportation will be directed pursuant to section 243(a) of the Act if the country of his or her designation will not accept him or her into its territory, or fails to furnish timely notice of acceptance, or if the respondent declines to designate a country.
(2) If the alien expresses fear of persecution or harm upon return to any of the countries to which the alien might be deported pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the alien has not previously filed an application for asylum or withholding of deportation that has been referred to the immigration judge by an asylum officer in accordance with § 1208.14(b) of this chapter, the immigration judge shall:
(i) Advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum in the United States or withholding of deportation to those countries; and
(ii) Make available the appropriate application forms.
(3) An application for asylum or withholding of deportation must be filed with the Immigration Court, pursuant to § 1208.4(b) of this chapter. Upon receipt of an application, the Immigration Court may forward a copy to the Department of State pursuant to § 1208.11 of this chapter and shall calendar the case for a hearing. The reply, if any, of the Department of State, unless classified under an applicable Executive Order, shall be given to both the applicant and to DHS counsel and shall be included in the record.
(4) Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation so filed will be decided by the immigration judge pursuant to the requirements and standards established in 8 CFR part 1208 after an evidentiary hearing that is necessary to resolve factual issues in dispute. An evidentiary hearing extending beyond issues related to the basis for a mandatory denial of the application pursuant to § 1208.13 or § 1208.16 of this chapter is not necessary once the immigration judge has determined that such a denial is required.
(i) Evidentiary hearings on applications for asylum or withholding of deportation will be open to the public unless the applicant expressly requests that it be closed.
(ii) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of the immigration judge properly to control the scope of any evidentiary hearing.
(iii) During the deportation hearing, the applicant shall be examined under oath on his or her application and may present evidence and witnesses in his or her own behalf. The applicant has the burden of establishing that he or she is a refugee as defined in section 101(a)(42) of the Act pursuant to the standard set forth in § 1208.13 of this chapter.
(iv) The DHS counsel for the government may call witnesses and present evidence for the record, including information classified under the applicable Executive Order, provided the immigration judge or the Board has determined that such information is relevant to the hearing. When the immigration judge receives such classified information he or she shall inform the applicant. The agency that provides the classified information to the immigration judge may provide an unclassified summary of the information for release to the applicant, whenever it determines it can do so consistently with safeguarding both the classified nature of the information and its
source. The summary should be as detailed as possible, in order that the applicant may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such classified information shall state whether such information is material to the decision.
(5) The decision of an immigration judge to grant or deny asylum or withholding of deportation shall be communicated to the applicant and to the DHS counsel for the government. An adverse decision will state why asylum or withholding of deportation was denied.
(d)
Application for relief under sections 241(a)(1)(H) and 241(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act.
The respondent may apply to the immigration judge for relief from deportation under sections 241(a)(1)(H) and 241(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act.
(e)
General.
An application under this section shall be made only during the hearing and shall not be held to constitute a concession of alienage or deportability in any case in which the respondent does not admit his alienage or deportability. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit DHS from using information supplied in an application for asylum or withholding of deportation submitted to an asylum officer pursuant to § 1208.2 of this chapter on or after January 4, 1995, as the basis for issuance of an order to show cause or a notice to appear to establish alienage or deportability in a case referred to an immigration judge under § 1208.14(b) of this chapter. The respondent shall have the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. The respondent shall not be required to pay a fee on more than one application within paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, provided that the minimum fee imposed when more than one application is made shall be determined by the cost of the application with the highest fee. Nothing contained in this section is intended to foreclose the respondent from applying for any benefit or privilege which he or she believes himself or herself eligible to receive in proceedings under this part.

Summary decision.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, in any case where deportability is determined on the pleadings pursuant to § 1240.48(b) and the respondent does not make an application under § 1240.49, or the respondent applies for voluntary departure only and the immigration judge grants the application, the immigration judge may enter a summary decision on Form EOIR-7, Summary Order of Deportation, if deportation is ordered, or on Form EOIR-6, Summary Order of Voluntary Departure, if voluntary departure is granted with an alternate order of deportation.

# Subpart F—Suspension of Deportation and Voluntary Departure (for Proceedings Commenced Prior to April 1, 1997)
§ 1240.55
Proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997.
Subpart F of 8 CFR part 1240 applies to deportation proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997. A deportation proceeding is commenced by the filing of Form I-221 (Order to Show Cause) with the Immigration Court, and an alien is considered to be in deportation proceedings only upon such filing, except in the case of an alien admitted to the United States under the provisions of section 217 of the Act. All references to the Act contained in this subpart are references to the Act in effect prior to April 1, 1997.
§ 1240.56
Application.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an alien who is deportable because of a conviction on or after November 18, 1988, for an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act, shall not be eligible for voluntary departure as prescribed in 8 CFR part 1240 and section 244 of the Act. Pursuant to subpart F of this part and section 244 of the Act, an immigration judge may authorize the suspension of an alien's deportation; or, if the alien establishes that he or she is willing and has the immediate means with which to depart promptly from the
United States, an immigration judge may authorize the alien to depart voluntarily from the United States in lieu of deportation within such time as may be specified by the immigration judge when first authorizing voluntary departure, and under such conditions as the district director shall direct. An application for suspension of deportation shall be made on Form EOIR-40.
§ 1240.57
Extension of time to depart.
Authority to reinstate or extend the time within which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the Board is within the sole jurisdiction of the district director, except that an immigration judge or the Board may reinstate voluntary departure in a deportation proceeding that has been reopened for a purpose other than solely making an application for voluntary departure. A request by an alien for reinstatement or an extension of time within which to depart voluntarily shall be filed with the district director having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence. Written notice of the district director's decision shall be served upon the alien and no appeal may be taken therefrom.
§ 1240.58
Extreme hardship.
(a) To be eligible for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a)(1) of the Act, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, the alien must meet the requirements set forth in the Act, which include a showing that deportation would result in extreme hardship to the alien or to the alien's spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States, or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Extreme hardship is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the particular facts and circumstances of each case. Applicants are encouraged to cite and document all applicable factors in their applications, as the presence or absence of any one factor may not be determinative in evaluating extreme hardship. Adjudicators should weigh all relevant factors presented and consider them in light of the totality of the circumstances, but are not required to offer an independent analysis of each listed factor when rendering a decision. Evidence of an extended stay in the United States without fear of deportation and with the benefit of work authorization, when present in a particular case, shall be considered relevant to the determination of whether deportation will result in extreme hardship.
(b) To establish extreme hardship, an applicant must demonstrate that deportation would result in a degree of hardship beyond that typically associated with deportation. Factors that may be considered in evaluating whether deportation would result in extreme hardship to the alien or to the alien's qualified relative include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) The age of the alien, both at the time of entry to the United States and at the time of application for suspension of deportation;
(2) The age, number, and immigration status of the alien's children and their ability to speak the native language and to adjust to life in the country of return;
(3) The health condition of the alien or the alien's children, spouse, or parents and the availability of any required medical treatment in the country to which the alien would be returned;
(4) The alien's ability to obtain employment in the country to which the alien would be returned;
(5) The length of residence in the United States;

Each application must be filed with the filing and fingerprint fees as provided in § 1103.7(b)(1) of this chapter, or a request for fee waiver, as provided in § 1103.7(c) of this chapter. The fact that an applicant has also applied for asylum does not exempt the applicant from the fingerprinting fees associated with the Form I-881.

(2) The applicant and anyone other than a spouse, parent, son, or daughter of the applicant who assists the applicant in preparing the application must sign the application under penalty of perjury. The applicant's signature establishes a presumption that the applicant is aware of the contents of the application. A person other than a relative specified in this paragraph who assists the applicant in preparing the application also must provide his or her full mailing address;
(3) An application that does not include a response to each of the questions contained in the application, is unsigned, or is unaccompanied by the required materials specified in the instructions to the application is incomplete and shall be returned by mail to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application by the Service; and
(4) Knowing placement of false information on the application may subject the person supplying that information to criminal penalties under title 18 of the United States Code and to civil penalties under section 274C of the Act.
§ 1240.64
Eligibility—general.
(a)
Burden and standard of proof.
The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is eligible for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal and that discretion should be exercised to grant relief.
(b)
Calculation of continuous physical presence and certain breaks in presence.
For purposes of calculating continuous physical presence under this section, section 309(c)(5)(A) of IIRIRA and section 240A(d)(1) of the Act shall not apply to persons described in § 1240.61. For purposes of this subpart H, a single absence of 90 days or less or absences which in the aggregate total no more than 180 days shall be considered brief.
(1) For applications for suspension of deportation made under former section 244 of the Act, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that any breaks in continuous physical presence were brief, casual, and innocent and did not meaningfully interrupt the period of continuous physical presence in the United States. For purposes of evaluating whether an absence is brief, single absences in excess of 90 days, or absences that total more than 180 days in the aggregate will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. An applicant must establish that any absence from the United States was casual and innocent and did not meaningfully interrupt the period of continuous physical presence.
(2) For applications for special rule cancellation of removal made under section 309(f)(1) of IIRIRA, as amended by NACARA, the applicant shall be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States if he or she has departed from the United States for any period in excess of 90 days or for any periods in the aggregate exceeding 180 days. The applicant must establish that any period of absence less than 90 days was casual and innocent and did not meaningfully interrupt the period of continuous physical presence in the United States.
(3) For all applications made under this subpart, a period of continuous physical presence is terminated whenever an alien is removed from the United States under an order issued pursuant to any provision of the Act or the alien has voluntarily departed under the threat of deportation or when the departure is made for purposes of committing an unlawful act.
(4) The requirements of continuous physical presence in the United States under this subpart shall not apply to an alien who:
(i) Has served for a minimum period of 24 months in an active-duty status in the Armed Forces of the United States and, if separated from such service, was separated under honorable conditions, and
(ii) At the time of the alien's enlistment or induction, was in the United States.
(c)
Factors relevant to extreme hardship.
Except as described in paragraph (d) of this section, extreme hardship shall be determined as set forth in § 1240.58.
(d)
Rebuttable presumption of extreme hardship for certain classes of aliens
—(1)
Presumption of extreme hardship.
An applicant described in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of § 1240.61 who has submitted a completed Form I-881 or Form EOIR-40 to either the Service or the Immigration Court, in accordance with § 1240.63, shall be presumed to have established that deportation or removal from the United States would result in extreme hardship to the applicant or to his or her spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
(2)
Rebuttal of presumption.
A presumption of extreme hardship as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be rebutted if the evidence in the record establishes that it is more likely than not that neither the applicant nor a qualified relative would suffer extreme hardship if the applicant were deported or removed from the United States. In making such a determination, the adjudicator shall consider relevant factors, including those listed in § 1240.58.
(3)
Burden of proof.
In those cases where a presumption of extreme hardship applies, the burden of proof shall be on the Service to establish that it is more likely than not that neither the applicant nor a qualified relative would
suffer extreme hardship if the applicant were deported or removed from the United States.
(4)
Effect of rebuttal.
(i) A determination that it is more likely than not that neither the applicant nor a qualified relative would suffer extreme hardship if the applicant were deported or removed from the United States shall be grounds for referral to the Immigration Court or dismissal of an application submitted initially to the Service. The applicant is entitled to a
de novo
adjudication and will again be considered to have a presumption of extreme hardship before the Immigration Court.
(ii) If the Immigration Court determines that extreme hardship will not result from deportation or removal from the United States, the application will be denied.

§ 1240.67
Procedure for interview before an asylum officer.
(a)
Fingerprinting requirements.
The Service will notify each applicant 14 years of age or older to appear for an interview only after the applicant has complied with fingerprinting requirements pursuant to § 103.2(e) of 8 CFR chapter I, and the Service has received a definitive response from the FBI that a full criminal background check has been completed. A definitive response that a full criminal background check on an applicant has been completed includes:

(2) Confirmation from the FBI that an applicant has an administrative or a criminal record; or
(3) Confirmation from the FBI that two properly prepared fingerprint cards (Form FD-258) have been determined unclassifiable for the purpose of conducting a criminal background check and have been rejected.
(b)
Interview.
(1) The asylum officer shall conduct the interview in a non-adversarial manner and, except at the request of the applicant, separate and apart from the general public. The purpose of the interview shall be to elicit all relevant and useful information bearing on the applicant's eligibility for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal. If the applicant has an asylum application pending with the Service, the asylum officer may also elicit information relating to the application for asylum in accordance with § 1208.9 of this chapter. At the time of the interview, the applicant must provide complete information regarding the applicant's identity, including name, date and place of birth, and nationality, and may be required to register this identity electronically or through any other means designated by the Attorney General.
(2) The applicant may have counsel or a representative present, may present witnesses, and may submit affidavits of witnesses and other evidence.
(3) An applicant unable to proceed with the interview in English must provide, at no expense to the Service, a competent interpreter fluent in both English and a language in which the applicant is fluent. The interpreter must be at least 18 years of age. The following individuals may not serve as the applicant's interpreter: the applicant's attorney or representative of record; a witness testifying on the applicant's behalf; or, if the applicant also has an asylum application pending with the Service, a representative or employee of the applicant's country of nationality, or, if stateless, country of last habitual residence. Failure without good cause to comply with this paragraph may be considered a failure to appear for the interview for purposes of § 1240.68.
(4) The asylum officer shall have authority to administer oaths, verify the identity of the applicant (including through the use of electronic means), verify the identity of any interpreter, present and receive evidence, and question the applicant and any witnesses.
(5) Upon completion of the interview, the applicant or the applicant's representative shall have an opportunity to make a statement or comment on the evidence presented. The asylum officer may, in the officer's discretion, limit the length of such statement or comment and may require its submission in writing. Upon completion of the interview, and except as otherwise provided by the asylum officer, the applicant shall be informed of the requirement to appear in person to receive and to acknowledge receipt of the decision and any other accompanying material at a time and place designated by the asylum officer.
(6) The asylum officer shall consider evidence submitted by the applicant with the application, as well as any evidence submitted by the applicant before or at the interview. As a matter of discretion, the asylum officer may grant the applicant a brief extension of time following an interview, during which the applicant may submit additional evidence.
§ 1240.68
Failure to appear at an interview before an asylum officer or failure to follow requirements for fingerprinting.
(a) Failure to appear for a scheduled interview without prior authorization may result in dismissal of the application or waiver of the right to an adjudication by an asylum officer. A written request to reschedule will be granted if it is an initial request and is received by the Asylum Office at least 2 days before the scheduled interview date. All other requests to reschedule the interview, including those submitted after the interview date, will be granted only if the applicant has a reasonable excuse for not appearing, and the excuse was received by the Asylum Office in writing within a reasonable time after the scheduled interview date.
(b) Failure to comply with fingerprint processing requirements without reasonable excuse may result in dismissal of the application or waiver of the right to an adjudication by an asylum officer.
(c) Failure to appear shall be excused if the notice of the interview or fingerprint appointment was not mailed to the applicant's current address and such address had been provided to the Office of International Affairs by the applicant prior to the date of mailing in accordance with section 265 of the Act and Service regulations, unless the asylum officer determines that the applicant received reasonable notice of the interview or fingerprinting appointment.
§ 1240.69
Reliance on information compiled by other sources.
In determining whether an applicant is eligible for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal, the asylum officer may rely on material described in § 1208.12 of this chapter. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle the applicant to conduct discovery directed toward records, officers, agents, or employees of the Service, the Department of Justice, or the Department of State.
§ 1240.70
Decision by the Service.
(a)
Service of decision.
Unless the asylum officer has granted the application for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal at the time of the interview or as otherwise provided by an Asylum Office, the applicant will be required to return to the Asylum Office to receive service of the decision on the applicant's application. If the applicant does not speak English fluently, the applicant shall bring an interpreter when returning to the office to receive service of the decision.
(b)
Grant of suspension of deportation.
An asylum officer may grant suspension of deportation to an applicant eligible to apply for this relief with the Service who qualifies for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a)(1) of the Act, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, who is not an alien described in former section 241(a)(4)(D) of the Act, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, and who admits deportability under any law of the United States, excluding former section 241(a)(2), (3), or (4) of the Act, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997. If the Service has made a preliminary decision to grant the applicant suspension of deportation under this subpart, the applicant shall be notified of that decision and will be asked to sign an admission of deportability or inadmissibility. The applicant must sign the admission before the Service may grant the relief sought. If suspension of deportation is granted, the Service shall adjust the status of the alien to lawful permanent resident, effective as of the date that suspension of deportation is granted.
(c)
Grant of cancellation of removal.
An asylum officer may grant cancellation of removal to an applicant who is eligible to apply for this relief with the Service, and who qualifies for cancellation of removal under section 309(f)(1)(A) of IIRIRA, as amended by section 203 of NACARA, and who admits deportability under section 237(a), excluding paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), of the Act, or inadmissibility under section 212(a), excluding paragraphs (2) or (3), of the Act. If the Service has made a preliminary decision to grant the applicant cancellation of removal under this subpart, the applicant shall be notified of that decision and asked to sign an admission of deportability or inadmissibility. The applicant must sign the concession before the Service may grant the relief sought. If the Service grants cancellation of removal, the Service shall adjust the status of the alien to lawful permanent resident, effective as of the date that cancellation of removal is granted.
(d)
Referral of the application.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, and unless the applicant is granted asylum or is in lawful immigrant or non-immigrant status, an asylum officer shall refer the application for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal to the Immigration Court for adjudication in deportation or removal proceedings, and will provide the applicant with written notice of the statutory or regulatory basis for the referral, if:
(1) The applicant is not clearly eligible for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a)(1) of the Act as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, or for cancellation of removal under section 309(f)(1)(A) of IIRIRA, as amended by NACARA;
(2) The applicant does not appear to merit relief as a matter of discretion;
(3) The applicant appears to be eligible for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal under this subpart, but does not admit deportability or inadmissibility; or
(4) The applicant failed to appear for a scheduled interview with an asylum officer or failed to comply with fingerprinting processing requirements and such failure was not excused by the Service, unless the application is dismissed.
(e)
Dismissal of the application.

The asylum officer will provide the applicant written notice of the statutory or regulatory basis for the dismissal.
(f)
Special provisions for certain ABC class members whose proceedings before EOIR were administratively closed or continued.
The following provisions shall apply with respect to an
ABC
class member who was in proceedings before the Immigration Court or the Board, and those proceedings were closed or continued pursuant to the
ABC
settlement agreement:

If an asylum officer grants suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal to an applicant described in § 1240.61(a)(4) or (a)(5), whose proceedings before EOIR were administratively closed or continued, those proceedings shall terminate as of the date the relief is granted. If suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal is not granted, the Service shall move to recalendar proceedings before the Immigration Court or resume proceedings before the Board, whichever is appropriate. The Service shall refer to the Immigration Court or the Board the application for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal.

§ 1241.1
Final order of removal.
An order of removal made by the immigration judge at the conclusion of proceedings under section 240 of the Act shall become final:
(a) Upon dismissal of an appeal by the Board of Immigration Appeals;
(b) Upon waiver of appeal by the respondent;
(c) Upon expiration of the time allotted for an appeal if the respondent does not file an appeal within that time;
(d) If certified to the Board or Attorney General, upon the date of the subsequent decision ordering removal;
(e) If an immigration judge orders an alien removed in the alien's absence, immediately upon entry of such order; or
(f) If an immigration judge issues an alternate order of removal in connection with a grant of voluntary departure, upon overstay of the voluntary departure period, or upon the failure to post a required voluntary departure bond within 5 business days. If the respondent has filed a timely appeal with the Board, the order shall become final upon an order of removal by the Board or the Attorney General, or upon overstay of the voluntary departure period granted or reinstated by the Board or the Attorney General.

(c) The Service shall take all reasonable steps to comply with a stay granted by an immigration judge or the Board. However, such a stay shall cease to have effect if granted (or communicated) after the alien has been placed aboard an aircraft or other conveyance
for removal and the normal boarding has been completed.

§ 1241.7
Self-removal.
Any alien who has departed from the United States while an order of deportation or removal is outstanding shall be considered to have been deported, excluded and deported, or removed, except that an alien who departed before the expiration of the voluntary departure period granted in connection with an alternate order of deportation or removal shall not be considered to be so deported or removed.
[67 FR 39260, June 7, 2002, as amended at 70 FR 674, Jan. 5, 2005]
§ 1241.8
Reinstatement of removal orders.
(a)
Applicability.
An alien who illegally reenters the United States after having been removed, or having departed voluntarily, while under an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal shall be removed from the United States by reinstating the prior order. The alien has no right to a hearing before an immigration judge in such circumstances. In establishing whether an alien is subject to this section, the immigration officer shall determine the following:
(1) Whether the alien has been subject to a prior order of removal. The immigration officer must obtain the prior order of exclusion, deportation, or removal relating to the alien.
(2) The identity of the alien,
i.e.
, whether the alien is in fact an alien who was previously removed, or who departed voluntarily while under an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal. In disputed cases, verification of identity shall be accomplished by a comparison of fingerprints between those of the previously excluded, deported, or removed alien contained in Service records and those of the subject alien. In the absence of fingerprints in a disputed case the alien shall not be removed pursuant to this paragraph.
(3) Whether the alien unlawfully reentered the United States. In making this determination, the officer shall consider all relevant evidence, including statements made by the alien and any evidence in the alien's possession. The immigration officer shall attempt to verify an alien's claim, if any, that he or she was lawfully admitted, which shall include a check of Service data systems available to the officer.
(b)
Notice.
If an officer determines that an alien is subject to removal under this section, he or she shall provide the alien with written notice of his or her determination. The officer shall advise the alien that he or she may make a written or oral statement contesting the determination. If the alien wishes to make such a statement, the officer shall allow the alien to do so and shall consider whether the alien's statement warrants reconsideration of the determination.
(c)
Order.
If the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, the alien shall be removed under the previous order of exclusion, deportation, or removal in accordance with section 241(a)(5) of the Act.
(d)
Exception for applicants for benefits under section 902 of HRIFA or sections 202 or 203 of NACARA.
If an alien who is otherwise subject to this section has applied for adjustment of status under either section 902 of Division A of Public Law 105-277, the Haitian Refugee Immigrant Fairness Act of 1998 (HRIFA), or section 202 of Public Law 105-100, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), the provisions of section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act shall not apply. The immigration officer may not reinstate the prior order in accordance with this section unless and until a final decision to deny the application for adjustment has been made. If the application for adjustment of status is granted, the prior order shall be rendered moot.
(e)
Exception for withholding of removal.
If an alien whose prior order of removal has been reinstated under this section expresses a fear of returning to the country designated in that order, the alien shall be immediately referred to an asylum officer for an interview to determine whether the alien has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture pursuant to § 1208.31 of this chapter.
(f)
Execution of reinstated order.
Execution of the reinstated order of removal and detention of the alien shall be administered in accordance with this part.
[62 FR 10378, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 64 FR 8495, Feb. 19, 1999; 66 FR 29451, May 31, 2001]
§§ 1241.9-1241.13
[Reserved]
§ 1241.14
Continued detention of removable aliens on account of special circumstances.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides for the review of determinations by the Department of Homeland Security to continue the detention of particular removable aliens found to be specially dangerous. See 8 CFR 241.14.
(1)
Applicability.
This section applies to the review of the continued detention of removable aliens because the Department of Homeland Security has determined that release of the alien would pose a special danger to the public, where there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. This section does not apply to aliens who are not subject to the special review provisions under 8 CFR 241.13.
(2)
Jurisdiction.
The immigration judges and the Board have jurisdiction with respect to determinations as to whether release of an alien would pose a special danger to the public, as provided in paragraphs (f) through (k) of this section.
(b)-(e) [Reserved]
(f)
Detention of aliens determined to be specially dangerous
—(1)
Standard for continued detention.
Subject to the review procedures provided in this section, the Service shall continue to detain an alien if the release of the alien would pose a special danger to the public, because:
(i) The alien has previously committed one or more crimes of violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. 16;
(ii) Due to a mental condition or personality disorder and behavior associated with that condition or disorder, the alien is likely to engage in acts of violence in the future; and
(iii) No conditions of release can reasonably be expected to ensure the safety of the public.
(2)
Determination by the Commissioner.
The Service shall promptly initiate review proceedings under paragraph (g) of this section if the Commissioner has determined in writing that the alien's release would pose a special danger to the public, according to the standards of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(3)
Medical or mental health examination.
Before making such a determination, the Commissioner shall arrange for a report by a physician employed or designated by the Public Health Service based on a full medical and psychiatric examination of the alien. The report shall include recommendations pertaining to whether, due to a mental condition or personality disorder and behavior associated with that condition or disorder, the alien is likely to engage in acts of violence in the future.
(4)
Detention pending review.
After the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner has made a determination under this paragraph, the Service shall continue to detain the alien, unless an immigration judge or the Board issues an administratively final decision dismissing the review proceedings under this section.
(g)
Referral to Immigration Judge.
Jurisdiction for an immigration judge to review a determination by the Service pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section that an alien is specially dangerous shall commence with the filing by the Service of a Notice of Referral to the Immigration Judge (Form I-863) with the Immigration Court having jurisdiction over the place of the alien's custody. The Service shall promptly provide to the alien by personal service a copy of the Notice of Referral to the Immigration Judge and all accompanying documents.
(1)
Factual basis.
The Service shall attach a written statement that contains a summary of the basis for the Commissioner's determination to continue to detain the alien, including a description of the evidence relied upon to reach the determination regarding the alien's special dangerousness. The Service shall attach copies of all relevant documents used to reach its decision to continue to detain the alien.
(2)
Notice of reasonable cause hearing.
The Service shall attach a written notice advising the alien that the Service
is initiating proceedings for the continued detention of the alien and informing the alien of the procedures governing the reasonable cause hearing, as set forth at paragraph (h) of this section.
(3)
Notice of alien's rights.
The Service shall also provide written notice advising the alien of his or her rights during the reasonable cause hearing and the merits hearing before the Immigration Court, as follows:
(i) The alien shall be provided with the List of Pro Bono Legal Service Providers for the immigration court at which the hearing is being held, and may be represented by an attorney or other representative of his or her choice in accordance with 8 CFR part 1292, at no expense to the Government;
(ii) The Immigration Court shall provide an interpreter for the alien, if necessary, for the reasonable cause hearing and the merits hearing.
(iii) The alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine evidence against the alien, to present evidence in the alien's own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Service; and
(iv) The alien shall have the right, at the merits hearing, to cross-examine the author of any medical or mental health reports used as a basis for the determination under paragraph (f) of this section that the alien is specially dangerous.
(4)
Record.
All proceedings before the immigration judge under this section shall be recorded. The Immigration Court shall create a record of proceeding that shall include all testimony and documents related to the proceedings.
(h)
Reasonable cause hearing.
The immigration judge shall hold a preliminary hearing to determine whether the evidence supporting the Service's determination is sufficient to establish reasonable cause to go forward with a merits hearing under paragraph (i) of this section. A finding of reasonable cause under this section will be sufficient to warrant the alien's continued detention pending the completion of the review proceedings under this section.
(1)
Scheduling of hearing.
The reasonable cause hearing shall be commenced not later than 10 business days after the filing of the Form I-863. The Immigration Court shall provide prompt notice to the alien and to the Service of the time and place of the hearing. The hearing may be continued at the request of the alien or his or her representative.
(2)
Evidence.
The Service must show that there is reasonable cause to conduct a merits hearing under a merits hearing under paragraph (i) of this section. The Service may offer any evidence that is material and relevant to the proceeding. Testimony of witnesses, if any, shall be under oath or affirmation. The alien may, but is not required to, offer evidence on his or her own behalf.
(3)
Decision.
The immigration judge shall render a decision, which should be in summary form, within 5 business days after the close of the record, unless that time is extended by agreement of both parties, by a determination from the Chief Immigration Judge that exceptional circumstances make it impractical to render the decision on a highly expedited basis, or because of delay caused by the alien. If the immigration judge determines that the Service has met its burden of establishing reasonable cause, the immigration judge shall advise the alien and the Service, and shall schedule a merits hearing under paragraph (i) of this section to review the Service's determination that the alien is specially dangerous. If the immigration judge determines that the Service has not met its burden, the immigration judge shall order that the review proceedings under this section be dismissed. The order and any documents offered shall be included in the record of proceedings, and may be relied upon in a subsequent merits hearing.
(4)
Appeal.
If the immigration judge dismisses the review proceedings, the Service may appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals in accordance with § 1003.38 of this chapter, except that the Service must file the Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) with the Board within 2 business days after the immigration judge's order. The Notice of Appeal should state clearly and conspicuously that it is an appeal of a reasonable cause decision under this section.
(i) If the Service reserves appeal of a dismissal of the reasonable cause hearing, the immigration judge's order shall be stayed until the expiration of the time to appeal. Upon the Service's filing of a timely Notice of Appeal, the immigration judge's order shall remain in abeyance pending a final decision of the appeal. The stay shall expire if the Service fails to file a timely Notice of Appeal.
(ii) The Board will decide the Service's appeal, by single Board Member review, based on the record of proceedings before the immigration judge. The Board shall expedite its review as far as practicable, as the highest priority among the appeals filed by detained aliens, and shall determine the issue within 20 business days of the filing of the notice of appeal, unless that time is extended by agreement of both parties, by a determination from the Chairman of the Board that exceptional circumstances make it impractical to render the decision on a highly expedited basis, or because of delay caused by the alien.
(iii) If the Board determines that the Service has met its burden of showing reasonable cause under this paragraph (h), the Board shall remand the case to the immigration judge for the scheduling of a merits hearing under paragraph (i) of this section. If the Board determines that the Service has not met its burden, the Board shall dismiss the review proceedings under this section.
(i)
Merits hearing.
If there is reasonable cause to conduct a merits hearing under this section, the immigration judge shall promptly schedule the hearing and shall expedite the proceedings as far as practicable. The immigration judge shall allow adequate time for the parties to prepare for the merits hearing, but, if requested by the alien, the hearing shall commence within 30 days. The hearing may be continued at the request of the alien or his or her representative, or at the request of the Service upon a showing of exceptional circumstances by the Service.
(1)
Evidence.
The Service shall have the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien should remain in custody because the alien's release would pose a special danger to the public, under the standards of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The immigration judge may receive into evidence any oral or written statement that is material and relevant to this determination. Testimony of witnesses shall be under oath or affirmation. The alien may, but is not required to, offer evidence on his or her own behalf.
(2)
Factors for consideration.
In making any determination in a merits hearing under this section, the immigration judge shall consider the following non-exclusive list of factors:
(i) The alien's prior criminal history, particularly the nature and seriousness of any prior crimes involving violence or threats of violence;
(ii) The alien's previous history of recidivism, if any, upon release from either Service or criminal custody;
(iii) The substantiality of the Service's evidence regarding the alien's current mental condition or personality disorder;
(iv) The likelihood that the alien will engage in acts of violence in the future; and
(v) The nature and seriousness of the danger to the public posed by the alien's release.
(3)
Decision.
After the closing of the record, the immigration judge shall render a decision as soon as practicable. The decision may be oral or written. The decision shall state whether or not the Service has met its burden of establishing that the alien should remain in custody because the alien's release would pose a special danger to the public, under the standards of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The decision shall also include the reasons for the decision under each of the standards of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, although a formal enumeration of findings is not required. Notice of the decision shall be served in accordance with § 1240.13(a) or (b).
(i) If the immigration judge determines that the Service has met its burden, the immigration judge shall enter an order providing for the continued detention of the alien.
(ii) If the immigration judge determines that the Service has failed to meet its burden, the immigration judge
shall order that the review proceedings under this section be dismissed.
(4)
Appeal.
Either party may appeal an adverse decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals in accordance with § 3.38 of this chapter, except that, if the immigration judge orders dismissal of the proceedings, the Service shall have only 5 business days to file a Notice of Appeal with the Board. The Notice of Appeal should state clearly and conspicuously that this is an appeal of a merits decision under this section.
(i) If the Service reserves appeal of a dismissal, the immigration judge's order shall be stayed until the expiration of the time to appeal. Upon the Service's filing of a timely Notice of Appeal, the immigration judge's order shall remain in abeyance pending a final decision of the appeal. The stay shall expire if the Service fails to file a timely Notice of Appeal.
(ii) The Board shall conduct its review of the appeal as provided in 8 CFR part 3, but shall expedite its review as far as practicable, as the highest priority among the appeals filed by detained aliens. The decision of the Board shall be final as provided in § 1003.1(d)(3) of this chapter.
(j)
Release of alien upon dismissal of proceedings.
If there is an administratively final decision by the immigration judge or the Board dismissing the review proceedings under this section upon conclusion of the reasonable cause hearing or the merits hearing, the Service shall promptly release the alien on conditions of supervision, as determined by the Service, pursuant to § 1241.13. The conditions of supervision shall not be subject to review by the immigration judge or the Board.
(k)
Subsequent review for aliens whose release would pose a special danger to the public
—(1)
Periodic review.
In any case where the immigration judge or the Board has entered an order providing for the alien to remain in custody after a merits hearing pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section, the Service shall continue to provide an ongoing, periodic review of the alien's continued detention, according to § 1241.4 and paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section.
(2)
Alien's request for review.
The alien may also request a review of his or her custody status because of changed circumstances, as provided in this paragraph (k). The request shall be in writing and directed to the HQPDU.
(3)
Time for review.
An alien may only request a review of his or her custody status under this paragraph (k) no earlier than six months after the last decision of the immigration judge under this section or, if the decision was appealed, the decision of the Board.
(4)
Showing of changed circumstances.
The alien shall bear the initial burden to establish a material change in circumstances such that the release of the alien would no longer pose a special danger to the public under the standards of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(5)
Review by the Service.
If the Service determines, upon consideration of the evidence submitted by the alien and other relevant evidence, that the alien is not likely to commit future acts of violence or that the Service will be able to impose adequate conditions of release so that the alien will not pose a special danger to the public, the Service shall release the alien from custody pursuant to the procedures in § 1241.13. If the Service determines that continued detention is needed in order to protect the public, the Service shall provide a written notice to the alien stating the basis for the Service's determination, and provide a copy of the evidence relied upon by the Service. The notice shall also advise the alien of the right to move to set aside the prior review proceedings under this section.
(6)
Motion to set aside determination in prior review proceedings.
If the Service denies the alien's request for release from custody, the alien may file a motion with the Immigration Court that had jurisdiction over the merits hearing to set aside the determination in the prior review proceedings under this section. The immigration judge shall consider any evidence submitted by the alien or relied upon by the Service and shall provide an opportunity for the Service to respond to the motion.
(i) If the immigration judge determines that the alien has provided good reason to believe that, because of a material change in circumstances, releasing the alien would no longer pose a special danger to the public under the standards of paragraph (f)(1) of this
section, the immigration judge shall set aside the determination in the prior review proceedings under this section and schedule a new merits hearing as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
(ii) Unless the immigration judge determines that the alien has satisfied the requirements under paragraph (k)(6)(i) of this section, the immigration judge shall deny the motion. Neither the immigration judge nor the Board may
sua sponte
set aside a determination in prior review proceedings. Notwithstanding 8 CFR 1003.23 or 1003.2 (motions to reopen), the provisions set forth in this paragraph (k) shall be the only vehicle for seeking review based on material changed circumstances.
(iii) The alien may appeal an adverse decision to the Board in accordance with § 1003.38 of this chapter. The Notice of Appeal should state clearly and conspicuously that this is an appeal of a denial of a motion to set aside a prior determination in review proceedings under this section.

Final order of deportation.
Except as otherwise required by section 242(c) of the Act for the specific purposes of that section, an order of deportation, including an alternate order of deportation coupled with an order of voluntary departure, made by the immigration judge in proceedings under 8 CFR part 1240 shall become final upon dismissal of an appeal by the Board of Immigration Appeals, upon waiver of appeal, or upon expiration of the time allotted for an appeal when no appeal is taken; or, if such an order is issued by the Board or approved by the Board upon certification, it shall be final as of the date of the Board's decision.
§ 1241.32
Warrant of deportation.
A Form I-205, Warrant of Deportation, based upon the final administrative order of deportation in the alien's case shall be issued by a district director. The district director shall exercise the authority contained in section 243 of the Act to determine at whose expense the alien shall be deported and whether his or her mental or physical condition requires personal care and attention en route to his or her destination.

Expulsion.
(a)
Execution of order.
Except in the exercise of discretion by the district director, and for such reasons as are set forth in § 1212.5(b) of this chapter, once an order of deportation becomes final, an alien shall be taken into custody and the order shall be executed. For the purposes of this part, an order of
deportation is final and subject to execution upon the date when any of the following occurs:
(1) A grant of voluntary departure expires;
(2) An immigration judge enters an order of deportation without granting voluntary departure or other relief, and the alien respondent waives his or her right to appeal;
(3) The Board of Immigration Appeals enters an order of deportation on appeal, without granting voluntary departure or other relief; or
(4) A Federal district or appellate court affirms an administrative order of deportation in a petition for review or habeas corpus action.
(b)
Service of decision.
In the case of an order entered by any of the authorities enumerated above, the order shall be executed no sooner than 72 hours after service of the decision, regardless of whether the alien is in Service custody, provided that such period may be waived on the knowing and voluntary request of the alien. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed, however, to preclude assumption of custody by the Service at the time of issuance of the final order.

(4) Such notice shall also advise the alien of the following:

Authority of director.
The director may withdraw the status of an alien granted Temporary Protected Status under section 244 of the Act at any time upon the occurrence of any of the following:
(1) The alien was not in fact eligible at the time such status was granted, or at any time thereafter becomes ineligible for such status;
(2) The alien has not remained continuously physically present in the United States from the date the alien was first granted Temporary Protected Status under this part.

(3) The alien fails without good cause to register with the Attorney General annually within thirty (30) days before the end of each 12-month period after the granting of Temporary Protected Status.
(b)
Decision by director.
(1) Withdrawal of an alien's status under paragraph (a) of this section shall be in writing and served by personal service pursuant to § 103.5(a) of this chapter. If the ground for withdrawal is § 240.14(a)(3), the notice shall provide that the alien has thirty (30) days within which to provide evidence of good cause for failure to register. If the alien fails to respond within thirty (30) days, Temporary Protected Status shall be withdrawn without further notice.
(2) Withdrawal of the alien's Temporary Protected Status under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may subject the applicant to exclusion or deportation proceedings under sections 235, 236, 237, 238, 240, or 241 of the Act as appropriate.
(3) If the basis for the withdrawal of Temporary Protected Status constitutes a ground of deportability or excludability which renders an alien ineligible for Temporary Protected Status under § 1244.4 or inadmissible under § 1244.3(c), the decision shall include a charging document which sets forth such ground(s) with notice of the right of a
de novo
determination of eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in deportation or exclusion proceedings. If the basis for withdrawal does not constitute such a ground, the alien shall be given written notice of his or her right to appeal to the AAU. Upon receipt of an appeal, the administrative record will be forwarded to the AAU for review and decision pursuant to the authority delegated under § 103.1(f)(2). Temporary Protected Status benefits will be extended during the pendency of an appeal.
(c)
Decision by AAU.
If a decision to withdraw Temporary Protected Status is entered by the AAU, the AAU shall notify the alien of the decision and the right to a
de novo
determination of eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in deportation or exclusion proceedings, if the alien is then deportable or excludable, as provided by § 1244.10(d).

There is no appeal from a denial of advance parole.
(b) Failure to obtain advance parole prior to the alien's departure from the United States may result in the withdrawal of Temporary Protected Status and/or the institution or recalendering of deportation or exclusion proceedings against the alien.

Confidentiality.
The information contained in the application and supporting documents submitted by an alien shall not be released in any form whatsoever to a third party requester without a court order, or the written consent of the alien. For the purpose of this provision, a third party requester means any requester other than the alien, his or her authorized representative, an officer of the Department of Justice, or any federal or State law enforcement agency. Any information provided under this part may be used for purposes of enforcement of the Act or in any criminal proceeding.

§ 1244.17
Annual registration.
(a) Aliens granted Temporary Protected Status must register annually with the INS designated office having jurisdiction over their place of residence. Such registration will apply to nationals of those foreign states designated or redesignated for more than one year by the Attorney General pursuant to section 244(b) of the Act. Registration may be accomplished by mailing or submitting in person, depending on the practice in place at the INS designated office, completed Forms I-821 and I-765 within the thirty (30) day period prior to the anniversary of the grant of Temporary Protected Status (inclusive of such anniversary date). Form I-821 will be filed without fee. Form I-765 will be filed with fee only if the alien is requesting employment authorization. Completing the block on the I-821 attesting to the continued maintenance of the conditions of eligibility will generally preclude the need for supporting documents or evidence. The Service, however, reserves the right to request additional information and/or documentation on a case-by-case basis.
(b) Unless the Service determines otherwise, registration by mail shall suffice to meet the alien's registration requirements. However, as part of the registration process, an alien will generally have to appear in person in order to secure a renewal of employment authorization unless the Service determines that employment authorization will be extended in another fashion due to operational need. The Service may also request that an alien appear in person as part of the registration process. In such cases, failure to appear without good cause shall be deemed a failure to register under this chapter.
(c) Failure to register without good cause will result in the withdrawal of the alien's Temporary Protected Status.
[56 FR 619, Jan. 7, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 23498, May 22, 1991; 60 FR 21975, May 4, 1995. Redesignated at 62 FR 10367, 10382, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 63597, Nov. 16, 1998]
§ 1244.18
Issuance of charging documents; detention.
(a) A charging document may be issued against an alien granted Temporary Protected Status on grounds of deportability or excludability which would have rendered the alien statutorily ineligible for such status pursuant to §§ 1244.3(c) and 244.4. Aliens shall not be deported for a particular offense for which the Service has expressly granted a waiver. If the alien is deportable on a waivable ground, and no such waiver for the charged offense has been previously granted, then the alien may seek such a waiver in deportation or exclusion proceedings. The charging document shall constitute notice to the alien that his or her status in the United States is subject to withdrawal. A final order of deportation or exclusion against an alien granted Temporary Protected Status shall constitute a withdrawal of such status.
(b) The filing of the charging document by the Service with the Immigration Court renders inapplicable any other administrative, adjudication or review of eligibility for Temporary
Protected Status. The alien shall have the right to a
de novo
determination of his or her eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in the deportation or exclusion proceedings. Review by the Board of Immigration Appeals shall be the exclusive administrative appellate review procedure. If an appeal is already pending before the Administrative Appeals Unit, the director shall notify the Administrative Appeals Unit of the filing of the charging document, in which case the pending appeal shall be dismissed and the record of proceeding returned to the jurisdiction where the charging document was filed.
(c) Upon denial of Temporary Protected Status by the Administrative Appeals Unit, the Administrative Appeals Unit shall immediately forward the record of proceeding to the director having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence. The director shall, as soon as practicable, file a charging document with the Immigration Court if the alien is then deportable or excludable under section 241(a) or section 212(a) of the Act, respectively.
(d) An alien who is determined by the Service to be deportable or excludable upon grounds which would have rendered the alien ineligible for such status as provided in §§ 1240.3(c) and 1240.4 may be detained under the provisions of this chapter pending deportation or exclusion proceedings. Such alien may be removed from the United States upon entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion.

§ 1244.19
Termination of designation.
Upon the termination of designation of a foreign state, those nationals afforded temporary Protected Status shall, upon the sixtieth (60th) day after the date notice of termination is published in the
Federal Register,
or on the last day of the most recent extension of designation by the Attorney General, automatically and without further notice or right of appeal, lose Temporary Protected Status in the United States. Such termination of a foreign state's designation is not subject to appeal.
[56 FR 619, Jan. 7, 1991. Redesignated at 62 FR 10367, 10382, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 63597, Nov. 16, 1998]
§ 1244.20
Waiver of fees.
(a) Any of the fees prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106 which relate to applications to the district director or service center director for Temporary Protected Status may be waived if the applicant establishes that he or she is unable to pay the prescribed fee. The applicant will have established his or her inability to pay when the adjudicating officer concludes, on the basis of the requisite affidavit and of any other information submitted, that it is more probable than not that:
(1) The applicant's gross income from all sources for the three-month period prior to the filing of the fee waiver request, including income received or earned by any dependent in the United States, was equaled or exceeded by essential expenditures for such three-month period; and
(2) The applicant does not own, possess, or control assets sufficient to pay the fee without substantial hardship.
(b) For purposes of this section, essential expenditures are limited to reasonable expenditures for rent, utilities, food, transportation to and from employment, and any essential extraordinary expenditures, such as essential medical expenses, or expenses for clothing, laundry, and child care, to the extent that the applicant can show that those expenditures made during the three-month period prior to the filing of the fee waiver request were reasonable and essential to his or her physical well-being or to earning a livelihood.
(c) For purposes of this section, the TPS registration fee (including the fee for employment authorization, if applicable) shall be considered an essential expenditure. A fee waiver will be granted if the sum of the fees for TPS registration and employment authorization equals or exceeds income and assets that remain after deducting other essential expenditures.
(d) If an adjudicating officer is satisfied that an applicant has established
inability to pay, he or she shall not deny a fee waiver due to the cost of administering the TPS program.
(e) For purposes of this section, the following documentation shall be required:
(1) The applicant seeking a fee waiver must submit an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, setting forth information to establish that he or she satisfies the requirements of this section. The affidavit shall individually list:
(i) The applicant's monthly gross income from each source for each of the three months prior to the filing of the fee waiver request;
(ii) All assets owned, possessed, or controlled by the applicant or by his or her dependents;
(iii) The applicant's essential monthly expenditures, itemized for each of the three months prior to the filing of the fee waiver request, including essential extraordinary expenditures; and
(iv) The applicant's dependents in the United States, his or her relationship to those dependents, the dependents' ages, any income earned or received by those dependents, and the street address of each dependent's place of residence.
(2) The applicant may also submit other documentation tending to substantiate his or her inability to pay.
(f) If the adjudicating officer concludes based upon the totality of their circumstances that the information presented in the affidavit and in any other additional documentation is inaccurate or insufficient, the adjudicating officer may require that the applicant submit the following additional documents prior to the adjudication of a fee waiver:
(1) The applicant's employment records, pay stubs, W-2 forms, letter(s) from employer(s), and proof of filing of a local, state, or federal income tax return. The same documents may also be required from the applicant's dependents in the United States.
(2) The applicant's rent receipts, bills for essential utilities (for example, gas, electricity, telephone, water), food, medical expenses, and receipts for other essential expenditures.
(3) Documentation to show all assets owned, possessed, or controlled by the applicant or by dependents of the applicant.
(4) Evidence of the applicant's living arrangements in the United States (living with relative, living in his or her own house or apartment, etc.), and evidence of whether his or her spouse, children, or other dependents are residing in his or her household in the United States.
(5) Evidence of the applicant's essential extraordinary expenditures or those of his or her dependents residing in the United States.
(g) The adjudicating officer must consider the totality of the information submitted in each case before requiring additional information or rendering a final decision.
(h) All documents submitted by the applicant or required by the adjudicating officer in support of a fee waiver request are subject to verification by the Service.
(i) In requiring additional information, the adjudicating officer should consider that some applicants may have little or no documentation to substantiate their claims. An adjudicating officer may accept other evidence, such as an affidavit from a member of the community of good moral character, but only if the applicant provides an affidavit stating that more direct documentary evidence in unavailable.

(a)
General.
Any alien who is physically present in the United States, except for an alien who is ineligible to apply for adjustment of status under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, may apply for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident of the United States if the applicant is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and an immigrant visa is immediately available at the time of filing of the application. A special immigrant described under section 101(a)(27)(J) of the Act shall be deemed, for the purpose of applying the adjustment to status provisions of section 245(a) of the Act, to have been paroled into the United States, regardless of the actual method of entry into the United States.

(7) A nonimmigrant classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act, unless the nonimmigrant is applying for adjustment of status pursuant to the request of a law enforcement authority, the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act, and 8 CFR 1245.11;
(8) Any alien who seeks to adjust status based upon a marriage which occurred on or after November 10, 1986, and while the alien was in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, or judicial proceedings relating thereto.
(i)
Commencement of proceedings.
The period during which the alien is in deportation, exclusion, or removal proceedings or judicial proceedings relating thereto, commences:
(A) With the issuance of the Form I-221, Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing prior to June 20, 1991;
(B) With the filing of a Form I-221, Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing, issued on or after June 20, 1991, with the Immigration Court;
(C) With the issuance of Form I-122, Notice to Applicant for Admission Detained for Hearing Before Immigration Judge, prior to April 1, 1997,
(D) With the filing of a Form I-862, Notice to Appear, with the Immigration Court, or
(E) With the issuance and service of Form I-860, Notice and Order of Expedited Removal.
(ii)
Termination of proceedings.
The period during which the alien is in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, or judicial proceedings relating thereto, terminates:
(A) When the alien departs from the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding or before the expiration of the voluntary departure time granted in connection with an alternate order of deportation or removal;
(B) When the alien is found not to be inadmissible or deportable from the United States;
(C) When the Form I-122, I-221, I-860, or I-862 is canceled;
(D) When proceedings are terminated by the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals; or
(E) When a petition for review or an action for habeas corpus is granted by a Federal court on judicial review.
(iii)
Exemptions.
This prohibition shall no longer apply if:
(A) The alien is found not to be inadmissible or deportable from the United States;
(B) Form I-122, I-221, I-860, or I-862, is canceled;
(C) Proceedings are terminated by the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals;
(D) A petition for review or an action for habeas corpus is granted by a Federal court on judicial review;
(E) The alien has resided outside the United States for 2 or more years following the marriage; or
(F) The alien establishes the marriage is bona fide by providing clear and convincing evidence that the marriage was entered into in good faith and in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place, was not entered into for the purpose of procuring the alien's entry as an immigrant, and no fee or other consideration was given (other than to an attorney for assistance in preparation of a lawful petition) for the filing of a petition.
(iv)
Request for exemption.
No application or fee is required to request the exemption under section 245(e) of the Act. The request must be made in writing and submitted with the Form I-485. Application for Permanent Residence. The request must state the basis for requesting consideration for the exemption and must be supported by documentary evidence establishing eligibility for the exemption.
(v)
Evidence to establish eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption.
Section 204(g) of the Act provides that certain visa petitions based upon marriages entered into during deportation,
exclusion or related judicial proceedings may be approved only if the petitioner provides clear and convincing evidence that the marriage is bona fide. Evidence that a visa petition based upon the same marriage was approved under the bona fide marriage exemption to section 204(g) of the Act will be considered primary evidence of eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption provided in this part. The applicant will not be required to submit additional evidence to qualify for the bona fide marriage exemption provided in this part, unless the district director determines that such additional evidence is needed. In cases where the district director notifies the applicant that additional evidence is required, the applicant must submit documentary evidence which clearly and convincingly establishes that the marriage was entered into in good faith and not entered into for the purpose of procuring the alien's entry as an immigrant. Such evidence may include:
(A) Documentation showing joint ownership of property;
(B) Lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence;
(C) Documentation showing commingling of financial resources;
(D) Birth certificates of children born to the applicant and his or her spouse;
(E) Affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides of the marital relationship, or
(F) Other documentation establishing that the marriage was not entered into in order to evade the immigration laws of the United States.
(vi)
Decision.
An application for adjustment of status filed during the prohibited period shall be denied, unless the applicant establishes eligibility for an exemption from the general prohibition.
(vii)
Denials.
The denial of an application for adjustment of status because the marriage took place during the prohibited period shall be without prejudice to the consideration of a new application or a motion to reopen a previously denied application, if deportation or exclusion proceedings are terminated while the alien is in the United States. The denial shall also be without prejudice to the consideration of a new application or motion to reopen the adjustment of status application, if the applicant presents clear and convincing evidence establishing eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption contained in this part.
(viii)
Appeals.
An application for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident which is denied by the district director solely because the applicant failed to establish eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption contained in this part may be appealed to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations, in accordance with 8 CFR part 103. The appeal to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations, shall be the single level of appellate review established by statute.
(d)
Definitions
—(1)
Lawful immigration status.
For purposes of section 245(c)(2) of the Act, the term “lawful immigration status” will only describe the immigration status of an individual who is:
(i) In lawful permanent resident status;
(ii) An alien admitted to the United States in nonimmigrant status as defined in section 101(a)(15) of the Act, whose initial period of admission has not expired or whose nonimmigrant status has been extended in accordance with part 214 of 8 CFR chapter I;
(iii) In refugee status under section 207 of the Act, such status not having been revoked;
(iv) In asylee status under section 208 of the Act, such status not having been revoked;
(v) In parole status which has not expired, been revoked or terminated; or
(vi) Eligible for the benefits of Public Law 101-238 (the Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989) and files an application for adjustment of status on or before October 17, 1991.
(2)
No fault of the applicant or for technical reasons.
The parenthetical phrase
other than through no fault of his or her own or for technical reasons
shall be limited to:
(i) Inaction of another individual or organization designated by regulation to act on behalf of an individual and over whose actions the individual has no control, if the inaction is acknowledged by that individual or organization (as, for example, where a designated school official certified under
§ 214.2(f) of 8 CFR chapter I or an exchange program sponsor under § 214.2(j) of 8 CFR chapter I did not provide required notification to the Service of continuation of status, or did not forward a request for continuation of status to the Service); or
(ii) A technical violation resulting from inaction of the Service (as for example, where an applicant establishes that he or she properly filed a timely request to maintain status and the Service has not yet acted on that request). An individual whose refugee or asylum status has expired through passage of time, but whose status has not been revoked, will be considered to have gone out of status for a technical reason.
(iii) A technical violation caused by the physical inability of the applicant to request an extension of nonimmigrant stay from the Service either in person or by mail (as, for example, an individual who is hospitalized with an illness at the time nonimmigrant stay expires). The explanation of such a technical violation shall be accompanied by a letter explaining the circumstances from the hospital or attending physician.
(iv) A technical violation resulting from the Service's application of the maximum five/six year period of stay for certain H-1 nurses only if the applicant was subsequently reinstated to H-1 status in accordance with the terms of Public Law 101-656 (Immigration Amendments of 1988).
(3)
Effect of departure.
The departure and subsequent reentry of an individual who was employed without authorization in the United States after January 1, 1977 does not erase the bar to adjustment of status in section 245(c)(2) of the Act. Similarly, the departure and subsequent reentry of an individual who has not maintained a lawful immigration status on any previous entry into the United States does not erase the bar to adjustment of status in section 245(c)(2) of the Act for any application filed on or after November 6, 1986.
(e)
Special categories
—(1)
Alien medical graduates.
Any alien who is a medical graduate qualified for special immigrant classification under section 101(a)(27)(H) of the Act and is the beneficiary of an approved petition as required under section 204(a)(1)(E)(i) of the Act is eligible for adjustment of status. An accompanying spouse and children also may apply for adjustment of status under this section. Temporary absences from the United States for 30 days or less, during which the applicant was practicing or studying medicine, do not interrupt the continuous presence requirement. Temporary absences authorized under the Service's advance parole procedures will not be considered interruptive of continuous presence when the alien applies for adjustment of status.
(2)
Adjustment of certain nurses who were in H-1 nonimmigrant status on September 1, 1989 (Pub. L. 101-238)
—(i)
Eligibility.

(
2

(D) Evidence that the applicant was licensed, either temporarily or permanently, as a registered nurse during all periods of qualifying employment, and
(E) Evidence which establishes that the applicant was in the United States in H-1 nonimmigrant status for the purpose of performing services as a registered nurse on September 1, 1989.
(iv)
Effect of section 245(c)(2).
An applicant for the benefits of the adjustment of status provisions of Public Law 101-238 must establish eligibility for adjustment of status under all provisions of section 245 unless those provisions have specifically been waived.
(A)
Application for adjustment of status filed on or before October 17, 1991.
An applicant who qualifies for the benefits of Public Law 101-238, who properly files an application for adjustment of status on or before October 17, 1991, may be granted adjustment of status even though the alien has engaged or is engaging in unauthorized employment. For purposes of adjustment of status, the applicant will be considered to have continuously maintained a lawful nonimmigrant status throughout his or her stay in the United States as a nonimmigrant and to be in lawful nonimmigrant status at the time the application is filed.
(B)
Application for adjustment of status filed after October 17, 1991.
An alien who files an application for adjustment of status after October 17, 1991, will not automatically be considered as having maintained lawful nonimmigrant status. An alien who files for adjustment after this date will be subject to the statutory bar of section 245(c)(2) of the Act and will be ineligible to apply for adjustment of status if he or she has failed to continuously maintain lawful nonimmigrant status (other than through no fault of his or her own or for technical reasons); if he or she was not in lawful nonimmigrant status at the time the application was filed; or if he or she was employed without authorization on or after November 29, 1990. Unauthorized employment which has been waived as a basis for ineligibility for adjustment of status may not be used as the basis of a determination that the applicant is ineligible for adjustment of status due to failure to continuously maintain lawful nonimmigrant status.
(C)
Motions to reopen.
Public Law 101-649 (the Immigration Act of 1990), which became law on November 29, 1990, retroactively amended Public Law 101-238 (the Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989). An alien whose application for adjustment of status under the provisions of Public Law 101-238 was denied by the district director before November 29, 1990, because of unauthorized employment, failure to continuously maintain a lawful nonimmigrant status, or not being in lawful immigration status at the time of filing, may file a motion to reopen the adjustment application. The motion to reopen must be made in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 103.5. The district director will reopen the application for adjustment of status and enter a new decision based upon the provisions of Public Law 101-238, as amended by Public Law 101-649. Any other alien whose application for adjustment of status was denied may file a motion to reopen or reconsider in accordance with normal statutory and regulatory provisions.
(v)
Description of qualifying employment.
Qualifying employment as a registered nurse may have taken place at any time before the alien files the application for adjustment of status. It may have occurred before, on, or after the enactment of Public Law 101-238. All qualifying employment must have occurred in the United States. The qualifying employment as a registered nurse may have occurred while the alien was in any immigration status, provided that the alien had been admitted in or changed to H-1 status for the purpose of performing services as a registered nurse on or before September 1, 1989, and had not thereafter changed from H-1 status to any other status before September 1, 1989. The employment need not have been continuous, provided the applicant can establish that he or she engaged in qualifying employment for a total of three or more years. Qualifying employment may include periods when the applicant possessed a provisional, temporary, interim, or other permit or license authorizing the applicant to perform services as a registered nurse; provided the license or permit was issued or recognized by the State Board of Nursing of the state in which the employment was performed. Qualifying employment may not include periods when the applicant performed duties as a registered nurse in violation of any state law regulating the employment of registered nurses in that state.
(vi)
Effect of enactment on spouse or child
—(A)
Spouse or child accompanying principal alien.
The accompanying spouse or child of an applicant for adjustment of status who benefits from Public Law 101-238, may also apply for adjustment of status. All benefits and limitations of this section, including those resulting from the implementation of the adjustment of status provisions of section 162(f) of Public Law 101-649, apply equally to the principal applicant and his or her accompanying spouse or child.
(B)
Spouse or child residing outside the United States or ineligible for adjustment of status.
A spouse or child who is ineligible to apply for adjustment of status as an accompanying spouse or child is not immediately eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa under the provisions of Public Law 101-238. However, the spouse or child may be eligible for visa issuance under other provisions of the Act.
(
1
)
Existing relationship.
A spouse or child acquired by the principal alien prior to the approval of the principal's adjustment of status application may be accorded the derivative priority date and preference category of the principal alien. The spouse or child may use the priority date and category when it becomes current, in accordance with existing limitations outlined in sections 201 and 202 of the Act. The priority date is not considered immediately available for these family members under Public Law 101-238.
(
2
)
Relationship entered into after adjustment of status is approved.
An alien who acquires lawful permanent residence under the provisions of Public Law 101-238 may file a petition under section 204 of the Act for an alien spouse, unmarried son or unmarried daughter in accordance with existing laws and regulations. The priority date is not considered immediately available for these family members under Public Law 101-238.
(3)
Special immigrant juveniles.
Any alien qualified for special immigrant classification under section 101(a)(27)(J) of the Act shall be deemed, for the purpose of section 245(a) of the Act, to have been paroled into the United States, regardless of the alien's actual method of entry into the United States. Neither the provisions of section 245(c)(2) nor the exclusion provisions of sections 212(a)(4), (5)(A), or (7)(A) of the Act shall apply to a qualified special immigrant under section 101(a)(27)(J) of the Act. The exclusion provisions of sections 212(a)(2)(A), (2)(B), (2)(C) (except for so much of such paragraph as related to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana), (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), or (3)(E) of the Act may not be waived. Any other exclusion provision may be waived on an individual basis for humanitarian purposes, family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest; however, the relationship between the alien and the alien's natural parents or prior adoptive parents shall not be considered a factor in a discretionary waiver determination.
(f)
Concurrent applications to overcome grounds of inadmissibility.
Except as provided in 8 CFR parts 1235 and 1249, an application under this part shall be the sole method of requesting the exercise of discretion under sections 212(g), (h), (i), and (k) of the Act, as they relate to the inadmissibility of an alien in the United States. No fee is required for filing an application to overcome the grounds of inadmissibility of the Act if filed concurrently with an application for adjustment of status under the provisions of the Act of October 28, 1977, and of this part.
(g)
Availability of immigrant visas under section 245 and priority dates
—(1)
Availability of immigrant visas under section 245.
An alien is ineligible for the benefits of section 245 of the Act unless an immigrant visa is immediately available to him or her at the time the application is filed. If the applicant is a preference alien, the current Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Bulletin will be consulted to determine whether an immigrant visa is immediately available. An immigrant visa is considered available for accepting and processing the application Form I-485 is the preference category applicant has a priority date on the waiting list which is earlier than the date shown in the Bulletin (or the Bulletin shows that numbers for visa applicants in his or her category are current). An immigrant visa is also considered immediately available if the applicant establishes eligibility for the benefits of Public Law 101-238. Information concerning the immediate availability of an immigrant visa may be obtained at any Service office.
(2)
Priority dates.
The priority date of an applicant who is seeking the allotment of an immigrant visa number under one of the preference classes specified in section 203(a) or 203(b) of the Act by virtue of a valid visa petition approved in his or her behalf shall be fixed by the date on which such approved petition was filed.
(h)
Conditional basis of status.
Whenever an alien spouse (as defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act), an alien son or daughter (as defined in section 216(g)(2) of the Act), an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), or an alien spouse or child (as defined in section 216A(f)(2) of the Act) is granted adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent residence, the
alien shall be considered to have obtained such status on a conditional basis subject to the provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, as appropriate.
(i)
Adjustment of status from K-3/K-4 status.
An alien admitted to the United States as a K-3 under section 101(a)(15)(K)(ii) of the Act may apply for adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident pursuant to section 245 of the Act at any time following the approval of the Form I-130 petition filed on the alien's behalf, by the same citizen who petitioned for the alien's K-3 status. An alien admitted to the United States as a K-4 under section 101(a)(15)(K)(iii) of the Act may apply for adjustment of status to that of permanent residence pursuant to section 245 of the Act at any time following the approval of the Form I-130 petition filed on the alien's behalf, by the same citizen who petitioned for the alien's parent's K-3 status. Upon approval of the application, the director shall record his or her lawful admission for permanent residence in accordance with that section and subject to the conditions prescribed in section 216 of the Act. An alien admitted to the U.S. as a K-3/K-4 alien may not adjust to that of permanent resident status in any way other than as a spouse or child of the U.S. citizen who originally filed the petition for that alien's K-3/K-4 status.
(Title I of Pub. L. 95-145 enacted Oct. 28, 1977 (91 Stat. 1223), sec. 103 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1103). Interpret or apply secs. 101, 212, 242 and 245 (8 U.S.C. 1101, 1182, 1252 and 1255))

(ii)
Under section 245 of the Act.
(A) The departure from the United States of an applicant who is under exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings shall be deemed an abandonment of the application constituting grounds for termination of the proceeding by reason of the departure. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, the departure of an applicant who is not under exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings shall be deemed an abandonment of the application constituting grounds for termination of any pending application for adjustment of status, unless the applicant was previously granted advance parole by the Service for such absences, and was inspected upon returning to the United States. If the adjustment application of an individual granted advance parole is subsequently denied the individual will be treated as an applicant for admission, and subject to the provisions of section 212 and 235 of the Act.
(B) The travel outside of the United States by an applicant for adjustment who is not under exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings shall not be deemed an abandonment of the application if he or she was previously granted advance parole by the Service for such absences, and was inspected

The travel outside of the United States by an applicant for adjustment of status who is not under exclusion, deportation, or removal proceeding and who is in lawful H-4 or L-2 status shall not be deemed an abandonment of the application if the spouse or parent of such alien through whom the H-4 or L-2 status was obtained is maintaining H-1 or L-1 status and the alien remains otherwise eligible for H-4 or L-2 status, and, the alien is in possession of a valid H-4 or L-2 visa (if required) and the original copy of the I-797 receipt notice for the application for adjustment of status.

Decision
—(i)
General.

(ii)
Under section 245 of the Act.
If the application is approved, the applicant's permanent residence shall be recorded as of the date of the order approving the adjustment of status. An application for adjustment of status, as a preference alien, shall not be approved until an immigrant visa number has been allocated by the Department of State, except when the applicant has established eligibility for the benefits of Public Law 101-238. No appeal lies from the denial of an application by the director, but the applicant, if not an arriving alien, retains the right to renew his or her application in proceedings under 8 CFR part 1240. Also, an applicant who is a parolee and meets the two conditions described in § 1245.2(a)(1) may renew a denied application in proceedings under 8 CFR part 1240 to determine admissibility. At the time of renewal of the application, an applicant does not need to meet the statutory requirement of section 245(c) of the Act, or § 1245.1(g), if, in fact, those requirements were met at the time the renewed application was initially filed with the director. Nothing in this section shall entitle an alien to proceedings under section 240 of the Act who is not otherwise so entitled.
(iii)
Under the Act of November 2, 1966.
If the application is approved, the applicant's permanent residence shall be recorded in accordance with the provisions of section 1.

The application shall be accompanied by the Permanent Resident Card, Form I-151 or I-551, issued to the applicant in connection with his lawful admission for permanent residence, and shall be submitted to the director having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence in the United States. The decision on the application shall be made by the director. No appeal shall lie from his decision. If the application is approved, the applicant will be furnished with a replacement of his Form I-151 or I-551 bearing the new date as of which the lawful admission for permanent residence has been recorded.
(c)
Application under section 214(d) of the Act.
An application for permanent resident status pursuant to section 214(d) of the Act shall be filed on Form I-485 with the director having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence. A separate application shall be filed by each applicant. If the application is approved, the director shall record the lawful admission of the applicant as of the date of approval.

Adjustment of status under section 13 of the Act of September 11, 1957, as amended.
Any application for benefits under section 13 of the Act of September 11, 1957, as amended, must be filed on Form I-485 with the director having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence. The benefits under section 13 are limited to aliens who were admitted into the United States under section 101, paragraphs (a)(15)(A)(i), (a)(15)(A)(ii), (a)(15)(G)(i), or (a)(15)(G)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act who performed diplomatic or semi-diplomatic duties and to their immediate families, and who establish that there are compelling reasons why the applicant or the member of the applicant's immediate family is unable to return to the country represented by the government which accredited the applicant and that adjustment of the applicant's status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence would be in the national interest. Aliens whose duties were of a custodial, clerical, or menial nature, and members of their immediate families, are not eligible for benefits under section 13. In view of the annual limitation of 50 on the number of aliens whose status may be adjusted under section 13, any alien who is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident under another provision of law shall be advised to apply for adjustment pursuant to such other provision of law. An applicant for the benefits of section 13 shall not be subject to the labor certification requirement of section 212(a)(14) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The applicant shall be notified of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reasons for the denial and of the right to appeal under the provisions of part 103 of this chapter. Any applications pending with the Service before December 29, 1981 must be resubmitted to comply with the requirements of this section.

Pursuant to section 232(b) of the Act, an applicant for adjustment of status shall be required to have a medical examination by a designated civil surgeon, whose report setting forth the findings of the mental and physical condition of the applicant, including compliance with section 212(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, shall be incorporated into the record. A medical examination shall not be required of an applicant for adjustment of status who entered the United States as a nonimmigrant spouse, fianceé, or fianceeé of a United States citizen or the child of such an alien as defined in section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act and § 214.2(k) of 8 CFR chapter I if the applicant was medically examined prior to, and as a condition of, the issuance of the nonimmigrant visa; provided that the medical examination must have occurred not more than 1 year prior the date of application for adjustment of status. Any applicant certified under paragraphs (1)(A)(ii) or (1)(A)(iii) of section 212(a) of the Act may appeal to a Board of Medical Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service as provided in section 234 of the Act and part 1235 of this chapter.

If the Service is made aware by notification from the appropriate executive department or by any other means that a section 101(a)(27)(K) special immigrant who has already been granted permanent residence fails to complete his or her total active duty service obligation for reasons other than an honorable discharge, the alien may become subject to the removal provisions of section 237 of the Act, provided the alien is in one or more of
the classes of deportable aliens specified in section 237 of the Act. The Service shall obtain a current Form DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, from the appropriate executive department for verification of the alien's failure to maintain eligibility.

Secondary evidence may be submitted if the applicant is unable to obtain the required primary evidence. Applicants who are nationals of the People's Republic of China should complete Part 2 of Form I-485 by checking box “h—other” and writing “CSPA—Principal” next to that block. Applicants who are not nationals of the People's Republic of China should complete Part 2 of Form I-485 by checking box “h—other” and writing “CSPA—Qualified Family Member” next to that block. Each applicant for the benefits of Public Law 102-404 must also submit evidence of eligibility for the adjustment of status benefits of Public Law 102-404:
(1) A photocopy of all pages of the applicant's most recent passport or an explanation of why the applicant does not have a passport;
(2) An attachment on a plain piece of paper showing:
(i) The date of the applicant's last arrival in the United States before or on April 11, 1990;
(ii) The date of each departure the applicant made from the United States since that arrival (if the applicant did not depart the United States after the initial date of arrival, the applicant should write “I was in the United States on April 11, 1990, and I have not departed the United States since April 11, 1990”);
(iii) The reason for each departure; and
(iv) The date of each return to the United States.
(3) An attachment on a plain piece of paper showing:
(i) The date the applicant arrived in the People's Republic of China; and
(ii) The date the applicant left the People's Republic of China for each trip the applicant made to the People's Republic of China between April 11, 1990, and October 9, 1992 (if the applicant did not travel to the People's Republic of China, the applicant should write “I was not in the People's Republic of China between April 11, 1990, and October 9, 1992”);
(4) A copy of evidence showing that the applicant was found eligible for benefits under E.O. 12711, such as deferred enforced departure (DED), employment authorization, and/or waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement, if the applicant previously applied for benefits under E.O. 12711; and
(5) Primary or secondary evidence of a qualifying family relationship to an eligible national of the People's Republic of China, such as a birth or marriage certificate, if the applicant is a qualified family member who is not a national of the People's Republic of China.
(h)
Secondary evidence.
If any required primary evidence is unavailable, church or school records, or other secondary evidence pertinent to the facts in issue, may be submitted. If such documents are unavailable, affidavits may be submitted. The applicant may submit as many types of secondary evidence as necessary to establish the birth, marriage, or other event. Documentary evidence establishing that primary evidence is unavailable need not accompany secondary evidence of birth or marriage in the People's Republic of China.
(i)
Filing.
The application period begins on July 1, 1993. To benefit from the provisions of Public Law 102-404 (the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992), an alien must properly file an application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act on or before June 30, 1994. All applications for the benefits of Public Law 102-404 must be submitted by mail to the Service Center having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence in the United States. Pursuant to the deactivation clause of Public Law 102-404, if the President of the United States determines and certifies to Congress before July 1, 1993, that conditions in the People's Republic of China permit persons covered by Public Law 102-404 to safely return to the People's Republic of China, no applications for lawful permanent resident status under Public Law 102-404 will be processed or granted.
(j)
Immigrant classification and assignment of priority date.
Public Law 102-404 provides eligible applicants with automatic classifications as immigrants under section 203(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act. No immigrant visa petition is required and applicants need not meet the usual requirements for classification as skilled workers. The applicant's priority date shall be the date his or her application for adjustment of status under Public Law 102-404 is properly filed with the Service.
(k)
Effect of immigrant visa number limitations.
Eligible Public Law 102-404 applicants are exempt from the per-country immigrant visa number limitations of section 202(a)(2) of the Act. Eligible Public Law 102-404 applicants may file an application for adjustment of status under Public Law 102-404 without regard to immigrant visa number limitations of sections 202(a)(2) and 203(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act. However, the adjustment of status application may not be approved and adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident of the United States may not be granted until a visa number becomes available for the applicant under the worldwide allocation of immigrant visa numbers for employment-based aliens under section 203(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act. The applicant may request initial or continued employment authorization during this period by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. If the applicant needs to travel outside the United States during this period, he or she may file a request for advance parole on Form I-131, Application for Travel Document.
(l)
Decision.
In the case of an application for adjustment of status filed pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 102-404, the authority conferred upon district directors in 8 CFR part 1245 to accept and adjudicate an application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act is delegated exclusively to the service center director having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence in the United States. If the service center director transfers the application to the district director, authority to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 102-404 lies with the district director having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence.
(m)
Effect of enactment on family members other than qualified family members.
The adjustment of status benefits and waivers provided by Public Law 102-404 do not apply to a spouse or child who is not a qualified family member as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. However, a spouse or child whose relationship to the principal alien was established prior to the approval of the principal's adjustment-of-status application may be accorded the derivative priority date and preference category of the principal alien, in accordance with the provisions of section 203(d) of the Act. The spouse or child may use the priority date and category when it becomes current, in accordance with the limitations set forth in sections 201 and 202 of the Act.
[58 FR 35838, July 1, 1993, as amended at 62 FR 10384, Mar. 6, 1997; 62 FR 63254, Nov. 28, 1997]
§ 1245.10
Adjustment of status upon payment of additional sum under section 245(i).
(a)
Definitions.
As used in this section the term:
(1)(i)
Grandfathered alien
means an alien who is the beneficiary (including a spouse or child of the alien beneficiary if eligible to receive a visa under section 203(d) of the Act) of:
(A) A petition for classification under section 204 of the Act which was properly filed with the Attorney General on or before April 30, 2001, and which was approvable when filed; or
(B) An application for labor certification under section 212(a)(5)(A) of the Act that was properly filed pursuant to the regulations of the Secretary of Labor on or before April 30, 2001, and which was approvable when filed.
(ii) If the qualifying visa petition or application for labor certification was filed after January 14, 1998, the alien must have been physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000. This requirement does not apply with respect to a spouse or child accompanying or following to join a principal alien who is a grandfathered alien as described in this section.
(2)
Properly filed
means:
(i) With respect to a qualifying immigrant visa petition, that the application was physically received by the Service on or before April 30, 2001, or if mailed, was postmarked on or before April 30, 2001, and accepted for filing as provided in § 103.2(a)(1) and (a)(2) of 8 CFR chapter I; and
(ii) With respect to a qualifying application for labor certification, that the application was properly filed and accepted pursuant to the regulations of the Secretary of Labor, 20 CFR 656.21.
(3)
Approvable when filed
means that, as of the date of the filing of the qualifying immigrant visa petition under section 204 of the Act or qualifying application for labor certification, the qualifying petition or application was properly filed, meritorious in fact, and non-frivolous (“frivolous” being defined herein as patently without substance). This determination will be made based on the circumstances that existed at the time the qualifying petition or application was filed. A visa petition that was properly filed on or before April 30, 2001, and was approvable when filed, but was later withdrawn, denied, or revoked due to circumstances that have arisen after the time of filing, will preserve the alien beneficiary's grandfathered status if the alien is otherwise eligible to file an application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act.
(4)
Circumstances that have arisen after the time of filing
means circumstances similar to those outlined in § 1205.1(a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(ii) of this chapter.
(b)
Eligibility.
An alien who is included in the categories of restricted aliens under § 1245.1(b) and meets the definition of a “grandfathered alien” may apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act if the alien meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(7) of this section:
(1) Is physically present in the United States;
(2) Is eligible for immigrant classification and has an immigrant visa number immediately available at the time of filing for adjustment of status;
(3) Is not inadmissible from the United States under any provision of section 212 of the Act, or all grounds for inadmissibility have been waived;
(4) Properly files Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status on or after October 1, 1994, with the required fee for that application;
(5) Properly files Supplement A to Form I-485 on or after October 1, 1994;
(6) Pays an additional sum of $1,000, unless payment of the additional sum is not required under section 245(i) of the Act; and
(7) Will adjust status under section 245 of the Act to that of lawful permanent resident of the United States on or after October 1, 1994.
(c)
Payment of additional sum.
An adjustment applicant filing under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act must pay the standard adjustment application filing fee as specified in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106. Each application submitted under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act must be submitted with an additional sum of $1,000. An applicant must submit the additional sum of $1,000 only once per application for adjustment of status submitted under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act. However, an applicant filing under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act is not required to pay the additional sum if, at the time the application for adjustment of status is filed, the alien is:
(1) Unmarried and less than 17 years of age;
(2) The spouse of a legalized alien, qualifies for and has properly filed Form I-817, Application for Voluntary Departure under the Family Unity Program, and submits a copy of his or her receipt or approval notice for filing Form I-817; or
(3) The child of a legalized alien, is unmarried and less than 21 years of age, qualifies for and has filed Form I-817, and submits a copy of his or her receipt or approval notice for filing Form I-817. Such an alien must pay the additional sum if he or she has reached the age of 21 years at the time of filing for adjustment of status. Such an alien must meet all other conditions for adjustment of status contained in the Act and in this chapter.
(d)
Pending adjustment application with the Service or Executive Office for Immigration Review filed without Supplement A to Form I-485 and additional sum.
An alien who filed an adjustment of status application with the Service in accordance with § 103.2 of 8 CFR chapter I will be allowed the opportunity to amend such an application to request consideration under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act, if it appears that the alien is not otherwise ineligible for adjustment of status. The Service shall notify the applicant in writing of the Service's intent to deny the adjustment of status application, and any other requests for benefits that derive from the adjustment application, unless Supplement A to Form I-485 and any required additional sum is filed within 30 days of the date of the notice. If the application for adjustment of status is pending before the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), EOIR will allow the respondent an opportunity to amend an adjustment of status application filed in accordance with § 103.2 of 8 CFR chapter I (to include Supplement A to Form I-485 and proof of remittance to the INS of the required additional sum) in order to request consideration under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act.
(e)
Applications for Adjustment of Status filed before October 1, 1994.
The provisions of section 245(i) of the Act shall not apply to an application for adjustment of status that was filed before October 1, 1994. The provisions of section 245(i) of the Act also shall not apply to a motion to reopen or reconsider an application for adjustment of status if the application for adjustment of status was filed before October 1, 1994. An applicant whose pre-October 1, 1994, application for adjustment of status has been denied may file a new application for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act on or after October 1, 1994, provided that such new application is accompanied by: the required fee; Supplement A to Form I-485; the additional sum required by section 245(i) of the Act; and all other required initial and additional evidence.
(f)
Effect of section 245(i) on completed adjustment applications before the Service.
(1) Any motion to reopen or reconsider before the Service alleging availability of section 245(i) of the Act must be filed in accordance with § 103.5 of 8 CFR chapter I. If said motion to reopen with the Service is granted, the alien must remit to the Service Supplement A to Form I-485 and the additional sum required by section 245(i) of the Act. If the alien had previously remitted Supplement A to Form I-485 and the additional sum with the application which is the subject of the motion to reopen, then no additional sum need be remitted upon such reopening.
(2) An alien whose adjustment application was adjudicated and denied by the Service because of ineligibility under section 245(a) or (c) of the Act and now alleges eligibility due to the availability of section 245(i) of the Act may file a new application for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act, provided that such new application is accompanied by the required fee for the application, Supplement A to Form I-485, additional sum required by section 245(i) of the Act and all other required and additional evidence.
(g)
Aliens deportable under section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Act are ineligible to adjust status.
Section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Act renders any alien who has engaged, is engaged, or at any time after admission engages in any terrorist activity, as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act, deportable. Under section 245(c)(6) of the Act, persons who are deportable under section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Act are ineligible to adjust status under section 245(a) of the Act. Any person who is deportable under section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Act is also ineligible to adjust status under section 245(i) of the Act.
(h)
Asylum or diversity immigrant visa applications.
An asylum application, diversity visa lottery application, or diversity visa lottery-winning letter does not serve to grandfather the alien for purposes of section 245(i) of the Act. However, an otherwise grandfathered alien may use winning a diversity visa as a basis for adjustment.
(i)
Denial, withdrawal, or revocation of the approval of a visa petition or application for labor certification.
The denial, withdrawal, or revocation of the approval of a qualifying immigrant visa petition, or application for labor certification, that was properly filed on or before April 30, 2001, and that was approvable when filed, will not preclude
its grandfathered alien (including the grandfathered alien's family members) from seeking adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act on the basis of another approved visa petition, a diversity visa, or any other ground for adjustment of status under the Act, as appropriate.
(j)
Substitution of a beneficiary on an application for a labor certification.
Only the alien who was the beneficiary of the application for the labor certification on or before April 30, 2001, will be considered to have been grandfathered for purposes of filing an application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act. An alien who was previously the beneficiary of the application for the labor certification but was subsequently replaced by another alien on or before April 30, 2001, will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien. An alien who was substituted for the previous beneficiary of the application for the labor certification after April 30, 2001, will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien.
(k)
Changes in employment.
An applicant for adjustment under section 245(i) of the Act who is adjusting status through an employment-based category is not required to work for the petitioner who filed the petition that grandfathered the alien, unless he or she is seeking adjustment based on employment for that same petitioner.
(l)
Effects of grandfathering on an alien's nonimmigrant status
. An alien's nonimmigrant status is not affected by the fact that he or she is a grandfathered alien. Lawful immigration status for a nonimmigrant is defined in § 1245.1(d)(1)(ii).
(m)
Effect of grandfathering on unlawful presence under section 212(a)(9)(B) and (c) of the Act.
If the alien is not in a period of stay authorized by the Attorney General, the fact that he or she is a grandfathered alien does not prevent the alien from accruing unlawful presence under section 212(a)(9)(B) and (C) of the Act.

The same Form I-854 may be used by the LEA to request that the principals nonimmigrant's spouse, married and unmarried sons and daughters, regardless of age, and parents who are in derivative S nonimmigrant classification and who are qualified family members as described in paragraph (b) of this section similarly be allowed to apply for adjustment of status pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act.

The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to that decision. Unless the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 7 days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy Attorney General for a final resolution.

(vi) A certified copy of a Federal, State, or local governmental record that was created on or prior to December 1, 1995, shows that the applicant was present in the United States at the time, and establishes that the applicant submitted an income tax return, property tax payment, or similar submission or payment to the Federal, State, or local governmental agency keeping such record; or
(vii) In the case of an applicant who, while under the age of 21, attended a private or religious school in the United States on or prior to December 1, 1995, a transcript from such private or religious school, provided that the school:

Such documentation may include, but is not limited to:
(i) School records;
(ii) Rental receipts;
(iii) Utility bill receipts;
(iv) Any other dated receipts;
(v) Personal checks written by the applicant bearing a dated bank cancellation stamp;

If the applicant resides or resided in a State where the State Police maintain a compilation of all local arrests and convictions, a statewide clearance is sufficient. If the applicant presents a letter from the local police agencies involved, or other evidence, to the effect that the applicant attempted to obtain such clearance but was unable to do so because of local or State policy, the director or immigration judge having jurisdiction over the application may waive the local police clearance. Furthermore, if such local police agency has provided the Service or the Immigration Court with a blanket statement that issuance of such police clearance is against local or state policy, the director or immigration judge having jurisdiction over the case may waive the local police clearance requirement regardless of whether the applicant individually submits a letter from that local police agency;

such documents are unavailable, affidavits may be submitted. The applicant may submit as many types of secondary evidence as necessary to establish the birth, marriage, or other event. Documentary evidence establishing that primary evidence is unavailable must accompany secondary evidence of birth or marriage in the home country. In adjudicating the application for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100, the Service or immigration judge shall determine the weight to be given such secondary evidence. Secondary evidence may not be submitted in lieu of the documentation specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section. However, subject to verification by the Service, if the documentation specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) is already contained in the Service's file relating to the applicant, the applicant may submit an affidavit to that effect in lieu of the actual documentation.
(g)
Filing.
The application period begins on June 22, 1998. To benefit from the provisions of section 202 of Public Law 105-100, an alien must properly file an application for adjustment of status before April 1, 2000. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all applications for the benefits of section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 must be submitted by mail to: USINS Texas Service Center, P.O. Box 851804, Mesquite, TX 75185-1804. All applications must be accompanied by either the correct fee as specified in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106; or a request for a fee waiver in accordance with 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106. An application received by the Service or Immigration Court before April 1, 2000, that has been properly signed and executed and for which a waiver of the filing fee has been requested shall be regarded as having been filed before the statutory deadline regardless of whether the fee waiver request is denied provided that the applicant submits the required fee within 30 days of the date of any notice that the fee waiver request has been denied. In a case over which the Board has jurisdiction, an application received by the Board before April 1, 2000, that has been properly signed and executed shall be considered filed before the statutory deadline without payment of the fee or submission of a fee waiver request. Upon demand by the Board, the payment of the fee or a request for a fee waiver shall be made upon submission of the application to the Immigration Court in accordance with 8 CFR 1240.11(f). If a request for a fee waiver is denied, the application shall be considered as having been properly filed with the Immigration Court before the statutory deadline provided that the applicant submits the required fee within 30 days of the date of any notice that the fee waiver request has been denied. After proper filing of the application, the Service will notify the applicant to appear for fingerprinting as prescribed in § 103.2(e) of 8 CFR chapter I.
(h)
Jurisdiction.
Except as provide din paragraphs (d) and (i) of this section, the director of the Texas Service Center shall have jurisdiction over all applications for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100.
(i)
Interview.
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d), (i)(2), and (i)(3) of this section, all applicants for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 must be personally interviewed by an immigration officer at a local office of the Service. In any case in which the director of the Texas Service Center determines that an interview of the applicant is necessary, that director shall forward the case to the appropriate local Service office for interview and adjudication.
(2) In the case of an applicant who has submitted evidence of commencement of physical presence in the United States consisting of one or more of the documents specified in section 202(b)(2)(A)(i) through (v) or section 202(b)(2)(A)(vii) of Pub. L. 105-100 and upon examination of the application, including all other evidence submitted in support of the application, all relevant Service records and all other relevant law enforcement indices, if the director of the Texas Service Center determines that the alien is clearly eligible for adjustment of status under Pub. L. 105-100 and that an interview of the applicant is not necessary, the director may approve the application.
(3) Upon examination of the application, all supporting documentation, all relevant Service records, and all other
relevant law enforcement indices, if the director of the Texas Service Center determines that the alien is clearly ineligible for adjustment of status under Pub. L. 105-100 and that an interview of the applicant is not necessary, the director may deny the application.
(j)
Authorization to be employed in the United States while the application is pending
—(1)
Application.
An applicant for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 who wishes to obtain initial or continued employment authorization during the pendency of the adjustment application must file an Application for Employment authorization (Form I-765), with fee as set forth in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106. The applicant may submit Form I-765 concurrently with, or subsequent to, the filing of the Form I-485.
(2)
Adjudication and issuance.
In general, employment authorization may not be issued to an applicant for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 until the adjustment application has been pending for 180 days. However, if Service records contain one or more of the documents specified in section 202(b)(2)(A)(i) through (v) and (vii) of Pub. L. 105-100, evidence of the applicant's Nicaraguan or Cuban nationality, and no indication that the applicant is clearly ineligible for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the application for employment authorization may be approved, and the resulting document issued immediately upon verification that the Service record contains such information. If the Service fails to adjudicate the application for employment authorization upon expiration of the 180-day waiting period or within 90 days of the filing of application for employment authorization, whichever comes later, the alien shall be eligible for interim employment authorization in accordance with § 1274a.13(d) of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall preclude an applicant for adjustment of status under Pub. L. 105-100 from being granted an initial employment authorization or an extension of employment authorization under any other provision of law or regulation for which the alien may be eligible.
(k)
Parole authorization for purposes of travel
—(1)
Travel from and return to the United States while the application for adjustment of status is pending.
If an applicant for benefits under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 desires to travel outside, and return to, the United States while the application for adjustment of status is pending, he or she must file a request for advance parole authorization on an Application for Travel Document (Form I-131), with fee as set forth in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106 and in accordance with the instructions on the form. If the alien is either in deportation or removal proceedings, or subject to a final order of deportation or removal, the Form I-131 must be submitted to the Assistant Commissioner for International Affairs; otherwise the Form I-131 must be submitted to the director of the Texas Service Center, who shall have jurisdiction over such applications. Unless the applicant files an advance parole request prior to departing from the United States, and the Service approves such request, his or her application for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100 is deemed to be abandoned as of the moment of his or her departure. Parole may only be authorized pursuant to the authority contained in, and the standards prescribed in, section 212(d)(5) of the Act.
(2)
Parole authorization for the purpose of filing an application for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100.
An otherwise eligible applicant who is outside the United States and wishes to come to the United States in order to apply for benefits under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 may request parole authorization for such purpose by filing an Application for Travel Document (Form I-131) with the Texas Service Center, at P.O. Box 851804, Mesquite, TX 75185-1804. Such application must be supported by a photocopy of the Form I-485 that the alien will file once he or she has been paroled into the United States. The applicant must include photocopies of all the supporting documentation listed in paragraph (e) of this section, except the filing fee, the medical report, the fingerprint card, and the local police clearances. If the director of the Texas Service Center is satisfied that the alien will be eligible for adjustment of status once the alien has been paroled into
the United States and files the application, he or she may issue an Authorization for Parole of an Alien into the United States (Form I-512) to allow the alien to travel to, and be paroled into, the United States for a period of 60 days. The applicant shall have 60 days from the date of parole to file the application for adjustment of status. If the alien files the application for adjustment of status within that 60-day period, the Service may re-parole the alien for such time as is necessary for adjudication of the application. Failure to file such application for adjustment of status within 60 days shall result in the alien being returned to the custody of the Service and being examined as an arriving alien applying for admission. Such examination will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 235(b)(1) of the Act if the alien is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act, or section 240 of the Act if the alien is inadmissible under any other grounds. Parole may only be authorized pursuant to the authority contained in, and the standards prescribed in, section 212(d)(5) of the Act.
(3)
Effect of departure on an outstanding warrant of exclusion, deportation, or removal.
If an alien who is the subject of an outstanding final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal departs from the United States, with or without an advance parole authorization, such final order shall be executed by the alien's departure. The execution of such final order shall not preclude the applicant from filing an Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission Into the United States After Deportation or Removal (Form I-212) in accordance with § 1212.2 of this chapter.
(l)
Approval.
If the director approves the application for adjustment of status under the provisions of section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the director shall record the alien's lawful admission for permanent resident as of the date of such approval and notify the applicant accordingly. The director shall also advise the alien regarding the delivery of his or her Permanent Resident Card and of the process for obtaining temporary evidence of alien registration. If the alien had previously been issued a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, such order shall be deemed canceled as of the date of the director's approval of the application for adjustment of status. If the alien had been in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings that were administratively closed, such proceedings shall be deemed terminated as of the date of approval of the application for adjustment of status by the director. If an immigration judge grants or if the Board, upon appeal, grants an application for adjustment under the provisions of section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence shall be as of the date of such grant.
(m)
Denial and review of decision.
(1) If the director denies the application for adjustment of status under the provisions of section 202 of Public Law 105-100, the director shall notify the applicant of the decision. The director shall also:
(i) In the case of an alien who is not maintaining valid nonimmigrant status and who had not previously been placed in exclusion, deportation or removal proceedings, initiate removal proceedings in accordance with § 1239.1 of this chapter during which the alien may renew his or her application for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100; or
(ii) In the case of an alien whose previously initiated exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings had been administratively closed or continued indefinitely under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, advise the Immigration Court that had administratively closed the proceedings, or the Board, as appropriate, of the denial of the application. Upon a motion to recalendar filed by the Service, the Immigration Court or the Board will then recalendar or reinstate the prior exclusion, deportation or removal proceedings, during which the alien may renew his or her application for adjustment under section 202 of Public Law 105-100; or
(iii) In the case of an alien who is the subject of an outstanding final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, refer the decision to deny the application by filing a Form I-290C, Notice of Certification, with the Immigration Court that issued the final order for
consideration in accordance with paragraph (n) of this section.
(2) Aliens who were denied adjustment of status by the director, but who are now eligible for such adjustment of status pursuant to section 1505(a)(1) of the LIFE Act and amendments, and have not been referred to immigration proceedings as specified in paragraph (m)(1) of this section may file a motion to reopen with the Service. If an alien has been referred to the Immigration Court or has filed an appeal with the Board after an Immigration Court has denied the application for adjustment under NACARA section 202, and proceedings are pending, then the application for adjustment of status will be adjudicated in accordance with section 1505(a) of the LIFE Act and its amendments. An alien present in the United States subject to a final order of removal after his or her application was denied by an Immigration Court or the Board, but who was made eligible for adjustment pursuant to section 1505(a) of the LIFE Act and its amendments may file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court or the Board, whichever had jurisdiction last. Pursuant to section 1505(a)(2) of the LIFE Act and its amendments, motions to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Court or the Board must be filed on or before June 19, 2001.
(n)
Action of immigration judge upon referral of decision by a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C)
—(1)
General.
Upon the referral by a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C) of a decision to deny the application, in accordance with paragraph (m)(3) of this section, and under the authority contained in § 1003.10 of this chapter, the immigration judge shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the alien is eligible for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100. Such hearing shall be conducted under the same rules of procedure as proceedings conducted under part 1240 of this chapter, except the scope of review shall be limited to a determination on the alien's eligibility for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100. During such proceedings all parties are prohibited from raising or considering any other issues, including but not limited to issues of admissibility, deportability, removability, and eligibility for any form of relief other than adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100. Should the alien fail to appear for such hearing, the immigration judge shall deny the application for adjustment under section 202 of Public Law 105-100.
(2)
Appeal of immigration judge decision.
Once the immigration judge issues his or her decision on the application, either the alien or the Service may appeal the decision to the Board. Such appeal must be filed pursuant to the requirements for appeals to the Board from an immigration judge decision set forth in §§ 1003.3 and 1003.8 of this chapter.
(3)
Rescission of the decision of an immigration judge.
The decision of an immigration judge under paragraph (n)(1) of this section denying an application for adjustment under section 202 of Public Law 105-100 for failure to appear may be rescinded only:
(i) Upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the denial if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act;
(ii) Upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice of the hearing in person (or, if personal service was not practicable, through service by mail to the alien or to the alien's counsel of record, if any) or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien; or
(iii) Upon a motion to reopen filed not later than June 19, 2001, by an alien present in the United States who became eligible for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100, as amended by section 1505, Public Law 106-554.
(o)
Transition period provisions for tolling the physical presence in the United States provision for certain individuals
—(1)
Departure without advance authorization for parole.
In the case of an otherwise eligible applicant who departed the United States on or before December 31, 1997, the physical presence in the United States provision of section 202(b)(1) of Pub. L. 105-100 is tolled as of
November 19, 1997, and until July 20, 1998.
(2)
Departure with advance authorization for parole.
In the case of an alien who departed the United States after having been issued an Authorization for parole of an Alien into the United States (Form I-512), and who returns to the United States in accordance with the conditions of that document, the physical presence in the United States requirement of section 202(b)(1) of Pub. L. 105-100 is tolled while the alien is outside the United States pursuant to the issuance of the Form I-512.
(3)
Request for parole authorization from outside the United States.
In the case of an alien who is outside the United States and submits an application for parole authorization in accordance with paragraph (k)(2) of this section, and such application for parole authorization is granted by the Service, the physical presence in the United States provisions of section 202(b)(1) of Pub. L. 105-100 is tilled from the date the application is received at the Texas Service Center until the alien is paroled into the United States pursuant to the issuance of the Form I-512.

(b)
Applicability of provisions of section 902 of HRIFA in general.
Section 902 of Division A of Pub. L. 105-277, the Haitian Refugee Immigrant Fairness Act of 1998 (HRIFA), provides special rules for adjustment of status for certain nationals of Haiti, and without regard to section 241(a)(5) of the Act, if they meet the other requirements of HRIFA.
(1)
Principal applicants.
Section 902(b)(1) of HRIFA defines five categories of principal applicants who may apply for adjustment of status, if the alien was physically present in the United States on December 31, 1995:
(i) An alien who filed for asylum before December 31, 1995;
(ii) An alien who was paroled into the United States prior to December 31, 1995, after having been identified as having a credible fear of persecution, or paroled for emergent reasons or reasons deemed strictly in the public interest; or
(iii) An alien who at the time of arrival in the United States and on December 31, 1995, was unmarried and under 21 years of age and who:
(A) Arrived in the United States without parents in the United States and has remained, without parents, in the United States since his or her arrival;
(B) Became orphaned subsequent to arrival in the United States; or
(C) Was abandoned by parents or guardians prior to April 1, 1998, and has remained abandoned since such abandonment.
(2)
Dependents.
Section 902(d) of HRIFA provides for certain Haitian nationals to apply for adjustment of status as the spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter of a principal HRIFA beneficiary, even if the individual would not otherwise be eligible for adjustment under section 902. The eligibility requirements for dependents are described further in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Eligibility of principal HRIFA applicants.
A Haitian national who is described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is eligible to apply for adjustment of status under the provisions of section 902 of HRIFA if the alien meets the following requirements:
(1)
Physical presence.
The alien is physically present in the United States at the time the application is filed;
(2)
Proper application.
The alien properly files an application for adjustment of status in accordance with this section, including the evidence described in paragraphs (h), (i), (j), and (k) of this section. For purposes of § 1245.15 of this chapter only, an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485) submitted by a principal applicant for benefits under HRIFA may be considered to have been properly filed if it:
(i) Is received not later than March 31, 2000, at the Nebraska Service Center, the Board, or the Immigration Court having jurisdiction;
(ii) Has been properly completed and signed by the applicant;
(iii) Identifies the provision of HRIFA under which the applicant is seeking adjustment of status; and
(iv) Is accompanied by either:
(A) The correct fee as specified in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106; or
(B) A request for a fee waiver in accordance with 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106, provided such fee waiver request is subsequently granted; however, if such a fee waiver request is subsequently denied and the applicant submits the require fee within 30 days of the date of any notice that the fee waiver request had been denied, the application shall be regarded as having been filed before the statutory deadline. In addition, in a case over which the Board has jurisdiction, an application received by the Board before April 1, 2000, that has been properly signed and executed shall be considered filed before the statutory deadline without payment of the fee or submission of a fee waiver request. Upon remand by the Board, the payment of the fee or a request for a fee waiver shall be made upon submission of the application to the Immigration Court in accordance with 8 CFR 1240.11(f). If a request for a fee waiver is denied, the application shall be considered as having been properly filed with the Immigration Court before the statutory deadline
provided that the applicant submits the required fee within 30 days of the date of any notice that the fee waiver request has been denied.
(3)
Admissibility.
The alien is not inadmissible to the United States for permanent residence under any provisions of section 212(a) of the Act, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section; and
(4)
Continuous physical presence.
The alien has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period beginning on December 31, 1995, and ending on the date the application for adjustment is granted, except for the following periods of time:
(i) Any period or periods of absence from the United States not exceeding 180 days in the aggregate; and
(ii) Any periods of absence for which the applicant received an Advance Authorization for Parole (Form I-512) prior to his or her departure from the United States, provided the applicant returned to the United States in accordance with the conditions of such Advance Authorization for Parole.
(iii) Any periods of absence from the United States occurring after October 21, 1998, and before July 12, 1999, provided the applicant departed the United States prior to December 31, 1998.
(d)
Eligibility of dependents of a principal HRIFA beneficiary.
A Haitian national who is the spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter of a principal beneficiary eligible for adjustment of status under the provisions of HRIFA is eligible to apply for benefits as a dependent, if the dependent alien meets the following requirements:
(1)
Physical presence.
The alien is physically present in the United States at the time the application is filed;
(2)
Proper application.
The alien properly files an application for adjustment of status as a dependent in accordance with this section, including the evidence described in paragraphs (h) and (l) of this section;
(3)
Admissibility.
The alien is not inadmissible to the United States for permanent residence under any provisions of section 212(a) of the Act, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section;
(4)
Relationship.
The qualifying relationship to the principal alien must have existed at the time the principal was granted adjustment of status and must continue to exist at the time the dependent alien is granted adjustment of status. To establish the qualifying relationship to the principal alien, evidence must be submitted in accordance with § 204.2 of this chapter. Such evidence should consist of the documents specified in § 204.2(a)(1)(i)(B), (a)(1)(iii)(B), (a)(2), (d)(2), and (d)(5) of 8 CFR chapter I;
(5)
Continuous physical presence.
If the alien is applying as the unmarried son or unmarried daughter of a principal HRIFA beneficiary, he or she must have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period beginning not later than December 31, 1995, and ending on the date the application for adjustment is granted, as provided in paragraphs (c)(4) and (j) of this section.
(e)
Applicability of grounds of inadmissibility contained in section 212(a)
—(1)
Certain grounds of inadmissibility inapplicable to HRIFA applicants.
Paragraphs (4), (5), (6)(A), (7)(A) and (9)(B) of section 212(a) of the Act are inapplicable to HRIFA principal applicants and their dependents. Accordingly, an applicant for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA need not establish admissibility under those provisions in order to be able to adjust his or her status to that of permanent resident.
(2)
Availability of individual waivers.
If a HRIFA applicant is inadmissible under any of the other provisions of section 212(a) of the Act for which an immigrant waiver is available, the applicant may apply for one or more of the immigrant waivers of inadmissibility under section 212 of the Act, in accordance with § 1212.7 of this chapter. In considering an application for waiver under section 212(g) of the Act by an otherwise statutorily eligible applicant for adjustment of status under HRIFA who was paroled into the United States from the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, for the purpose of receiving treatment of an HIV or AIDS condition, the fact that his or her arrival in the United States was the direct result of a government decision to provide
such treatment should be viewed as a significant positive factor when weighing discretionary factors. In considering an application for waiver under section 212(i) of the Act by an otherwise statutorily eligible applicant for adjustment of status under HRIFA who used counterfeit documents to travel from Haiti to the United States, the adjudicator shall, when weighing discretionary factors, take into consideration the general lawlessness and corruption which was widespread in Haiti at the time of the alien's departure, the difficulties in obtaining legitimate departure documents at that time, and other factors unique to Haiti at that time which may have induced the alien to commit fraud or make willful misrepresentations.
(3)
Special rule for waiver of inadmissibility grounds for HRIFA applicants under section 212(a)(9)(A) and 212(a)(9)(C) of the Act.
An applicant for adjustment of status under HRIFA who is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(A) or 212(a)(9)(C) of the Act, may apply for a waiver of these grounds of inadmissibility while present in the United States. Such an alien must file Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability. If the application for adjustment is pending at the Nebraska Service Center, Form I-601 must be filed with the director of that office. If the application for adjustment is pending at a district office, Form I-601 must be filed with the district director having jurisdiction over the application. If the application for adjustment is pending before the immigration court, Form I-601 must be filed with the immigration judge having jurisdiction, or with the Board of Immigration Appeals if the appeal is pending before the Board.
(f)
Time for filing of applications
—(1)
Applications for HRIFA benefits by a principal HRIFA applicant.
The application period begins on June 11, 1999. To benefit from the provisions of section 902 of HRIFA, an alien who is applying for adjustment as a principal applicant must properly file an application for adjustment of status before April 1, 2000.
(2)
Applications by dependent aliens.
The spouse, minor child, or unmarried son or daughter of an alien who is eligible for adjustment of status as a principal beneficiary under HRIFA may file an application for adjustment of status under this section concurrently with or subsequent to the filing of the application of the principal HRIFA beneficiary. An application filed by a dependent may not be approved prior to approval of the principal's application.
(g)
Jurisdiction for filing of applications
—(1)
Filing of applications with the Service.
The Service has jurisdiction over all applications for the benefits of section 902 of HRIFA as a principal applicant or as a dependent under this section, except for applications filed by aliens who are in pending immigration proceedings as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. All applications filed with the Service for the benefits of section 902 of HRIFA must be submitted by mail to: USINS Nebraska Service Center, PO Box 87245, Lincoln, NE 68501-7245. After proper filing of the application, the Service will instruct the applicant to appear for fingerprinting as prescribed in § 103.2(e) of this chapter. The Director of the Nebraska Service Center shall have jurisdiction over all applications filed with the Service for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA, unless the Director refers the applicant for a personal interview at a local Service office as provided in paragraph (o)(1) of this section.
(2)
Filing of applications by aliens in pending exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings.
An alien who is in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings pending before the Immigration Court or the Board, or who has a pending motion to reopen or motion to reconsider filed with the Immigration Court or the Board on or before May 12, 1999, must apply for HRIFA benefits to the Immigration Court or the Board, as provided in paragraph (p)(1) of this section, rather than to the Service. However, an alien whose proceeding has been administratively closed (see paragraph (p)(4) of this section) may only apply for HRIFA benefits with the Service as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(3)(i)
Filing of applications with the Service by aliens who are subject to a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal.
An alien who is subject to a
final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, and who has not been denied adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA by the Immigration Court or the Board, may only apply for HRIFA benefits with the Service as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. This includes applications for HRIFA benefits filed by aliens who have filed a motion to reopen or motion to reconsider a final order after May 12, 1999.
(ii) An alien present in the United States who is subject to a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal and has been denied adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA by the Immigration Court or the Board, or who never applied for adjustment of status with the Service, an Immigration Court, or the Board on or before March 31, 2000, and who was made eligible for HRIFA benefits under the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act of 2000 (LIFE Act) and LIFE amendments, Public Law 106-553 and Public Law 106-554, respectively, may file a motion to reopen with either the Immigration Court or the Board, whichever had jurisdiction last. As provided by the LIFE Act, motions to reopen must be filed on or before June 19, 2001.
(iii)
Stay of final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal.
The filing of an application for adjustment under section 902 of HRIFA with the Service shall not stay the execution of such final order unless the applicant has requested and been granted a stay in connection with the HRIFA application. An alien who has filed a HRIFA application with the Service may file an Application for Stay of Removal (Form I-246) in accordance with section 241(c)(2) of the Act and § 1241.6 of this chapter.
(iv)
Grant of stay.
Absent evidence of the applicant's statutory ineligibility for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA or significant negative discretionary factors, a Form I-246 filed by a bona fide applicant for adjustment under section 902 of HRIFA shall be approved and the removal of the applicant shall be stayed until such time as the Service has adjudicated the application for adjustment in accordance with this section.
(h)
Application and supporting documents.
Each applicant for adjustment of status must file an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485). An applicant should complete Part 2 of Form I-485 by checking box “h—other” and writing “HRIFA—Principal” or “HRIFA—Dependent” next to that block. Each application must be accompanied by:
(1)
Application fee.
The fee for Form I-485 prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106;
(2)
Fingerprinting fee.
If the applicant is 14 years of age or older, the fee for fingerprinting prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106;
(3)
Identifying information.
(i) A copy of the applicant's birth certificate or other record of birth as provided in paragraph (m) of this section;
(ii) A completed Biographic Information Sheet (Form G-325A), if the applicant is between 14 and 79 years of age;
(iii) A report of medical examination, as specified in § 1245.5 of this chapter; and
(iv) Two photographs, as described in the instructions to Form I-485;
(4)
Arrival-Departure Record.
A copy of the Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, issued at the time of the applicant's arrival in the United States, if the alien was inspected and admitted or paroled;
(5)
Police clearances.
If the applicant is 14 years old or older, a police clearance from each municipality where the alien has resided for 6 months or longer since arriving in the United States. If there are multiple local law enforcement agencies (e.g., city police and county sheriff) with jurisdiction over the alien's residence, the applicant may obtain a clearance from either agency. If the applicant resides or resided in a State where the State police maintain a compilation of all local arrests and convictions, a statewide clearance is sufficient. If the applicant presents a letter from the local police agencies involved, or other evidence, to the effect that the applicant attempted to obtain such clearance but was unable to do so because of local or State policy, the director or immigration judge having jurisdiction over the application may waive the local police clearance. Furthermore, if such local police agency has provided the Service
or the Immigration Court with a blanket statement that issuance of such police clearance is against local or State policy, the director or immigration judge having jurisdiction over the case may waive the local police clearance requirement regardless of whether the applicant individually submits a letter from that local police agency;
(6)
Proof of Haitian nationality.
If the applicant acquired Haitian nationality other than through birth in Haiti, a copy of the certificate of naturalization or certificate of citizenship issued by the Haitian government; and
(7)

If the Service fails to adjudicate the application for employment authorization upon expiration of the 180-day waiting period, or within 90 days of the filing of application for employment authorization, whichever comes later, the alien shall be eligible for interim employment authorization in accordance with § 1274a.13(d) of this chapter.

If the immigration judge denies, or the alien fails to file, the application for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA, the immigration judge shall certify the decision to the Board for consideration in conjunction with the applicant's previously pending appeal or motion.
(4)
Administrative closure of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings.
(i) An alien who is in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, or who has a pending motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider such proceedings filed on or before May 12, 1999, may request that the proceedings be administratively closed, or that the motion be indefinitely continued, in order to allow the alien to file such application with the Service as prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section.

(ii) In the case of an otherwise-eligible alien whose exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings have been administratively closed for reasons not specified in this section, the alien may only apply before the Service for adjustment of status under this section.
(q)
Approval of HRIFA applications
—(1)
Applications approved by the Service.
If the Service approves the application for adjustment of status under the provisions of section 902 of HRIFA, the director shall record the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date of such approval and notify the applicant accordingly. The director shall also advise the alien regarding the delivery of his or her Permanent Resident Card and of the process for obtaining temporary evidence of alien registration. If the alien had previously been issued a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, such order shall be deemed canceled as of the date of the director's approval of the application for adjustment of status. If the alien had been in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings that were administratively closed, such proceedings shall be deemed terminated as of the date of approval of the application for adjustment of status by the director.
(2)
Applications approved by an immigration judge or the Board.
If an immigration judge or (upon appeal) the Board grants an application for adjustment under the provisions of section 902 of HRIFA, the date of the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence shall be the date of such grant.

(ii)
Recalendaring or reinstatement of prior proceedings.
In the case of an alien whose previously initiated exclusion, deportation, or removal proceeding had been administratively closed or continued indefinitely under paragraph (p)(4) of this section, the director shall make a request for recalendaring or reinstatement to the Immigration Court that had administratively closed the proceeding, or the Board, as appropriate, when the application has been denied. The Immigration Court or the Board will then recalendar or reinstate the prior exclusion, deportation, or removal proceeding.
(iii)
Filing of renewed application.
A principal alien may file a renewed application for HRIFA benefits with the Immigration Court either before or after March 31, 2000, if he or she had filed his or her initial application for such benefits with the Service on or before March 31, 2000.

(3)
Aliens with final orders.
In the case of an alien who is the subject of an outstanding final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, the Service shall refer the decision to deny the application by filing a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C) with the Immigration Court that issued the final order for consideration in accordance with paragraph (s) of this section.
(4)(i) An alien whose case has been referred to the Immigration Court under paragraphs (r)(2) or (r)(3) of this section, or who filed an appeal with the Board after his or her application for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA was denied, and whose proceedings are pending, and who is now eligible for adjustment of status under HRIFA as amended by section 1505(b) of the LIFE Act and its amendments, may renew the application for adjustment of status with either the Immigration Court or the Board, whichever has jurisdiction. The application will be adjudicated in accordance with section 1505(b) of the LIFE Act and its amendments.
(ii) An alien present in the United States who is subject to a final order of exclusion, deportation or removal after his or her HRIFA adjustment application was denied by an Immigration Court or the Board, but who was made eligible for HRIFA adjustment as a result of section 1505(b) of the LIFE Act and its amendments, may file a motion to reopen with either the Immigration Court or the Board, whichever had jurisdiction last. Such motion to reopen must be filed on or before June 19, 2001.

Action on decisions referred to the Immigration Court by a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C)
—(1)
General.
Upon the referral by a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C) of a decision to deny the application, in accordance with paragraph (r)(3) of this section, the immigration judge shall conduct a hearing, under the authority contained in § 3.10 of this chapter, to determine whether the alien is eligible for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA. Such hearing shall be conducted under the same rules of procedure as proceedings conducted under part 240 of this chapter, except the scope of review shall be limited to a determination of the alien's eligibility for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA. During such proceedings, all parties are prohibited from raising or considering any unrelated issues, including, but not limited to, issues of admissibility, deportability, removability, and eligibility for any remedy other than adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA. Should the alien fail to appear for such hearing, the immigration judge shall deny the application for adjustment under section 902 of HRIFA.
(2)
Stay pending review.
When the Service refers a decision to the Immigration Court on a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C) in accordance with paragraph (r)(3) of this section,
the referral shall not stay the execution of the final order. Execution of such final order shall proceed unless a stay of execution is specifically granted by the immigration judge, the Board, or an authorized Service officer.
(3)
Appeal of Immigration Court decision.
Once the immigration judge issues his or her decision on the application, either the alien or the Service may appeal the decision to the Board. Such appeal must be filed pursuant to the requirements for appeals to the Board from an Immigration Court decision set forth in §§ 1003.3 and 1003.8 of this chapter.
(4)
Rescission or reopening of the decision of an Immigration Court.
The decision of an Immigration Court under paragraph (s)(1) of this section denying an application for adjustment under section 902 of HRIFA for failure to appear may be rescinded or reopened only:
(i) Upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the denial if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act;
(ii) Upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in person (or, if personal service was not practicable, through service by mail to the alien or to the alien's counsel of record, if any) or the alien demonstrates that he or she was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien; or
(iii) Upon a motion to reopen filed not later than June 19, 2001, by an alien present in the United States who became eligible for adjustment of status under HRIFA, as amended by section 1505, of Public Law 106-554.
(t)
Parole authorization for purposes of travel
—(1)
Travel from and return to the United States while the application for adjustment of status is pending.
If an applicant for benefits under section 902 of HRIFA desires to travel outside, and return to, the United States while the application for adjustment of status is pending, he or she must file a request for advance parole authorization on an Application for Travel Document (Form I-131), with fee as set forth in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106 and in accordance with the instructions on the form. If the alien is either in deportation or removal proceedings, or subject to a final order of deportation or removal, the Form I-131 must be submitted to the Director, Office of International Affairs; otherwise the Form I-131 must be submitted to the Director of the Nebraska Service Center, who shall have jurisdiction over such applications. Unless the applicant files an advance parole request prior to departing from the United States, and the Service approves such request, his or her application for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA is deemed to be abandoned as of the moment of his or her departure. Parole may only be authorized pursuant to the authority contained in, and the standards prescribed in, section 212(d)(5) of the Act.
(2)
Parole authorization for the purpose of filing an application for adjustment of status under section 902 of HRIFA.
(i) An otherwise eligible applicant who is outside the United States and wishes to come to the United States in order to apply for benefits under section 902 of HRIFA may request parole authorization for such purpose by filing an Application for Travel Document (Form I-131) with the Nebraska Service Center, at P.O. Box 87245, Lincoln, NE 68501-7245. Such application must be supported by a photocopy of the Form I-485 that the alien will file once he or she has been paroled into the United States. The applicant must include photocopies of all the supporting documentation listed in paragraph (h) of this section, except the filing fee, the medical report, the fingerprint card, and the local police clearances.
(ii) If the Director of the Nebraska Service Center is satisfied that the alien will be eligible for adjustment of status once the alien has been paroled into the United States and files the application, he or she may issue an Authorization for Parole of an Alien into the United States (Form I-512) to allow the alien to travel to, and be paroled into, the United States for a period of 60 days.
(iii) The applicant shall have 60 days from the date of parole to file the application for adjustment of status. If
the alien files the application for adjustment of status within that 60-day period, the Service may re-parole the alien for such time as is necessary for adjudication of the application. Failure to file such application for adjustment of status within 60 days shall result in the alien being returned to the custody of the Service and being examined as an arriving alien applying for admission. Such examination will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 235(b)(1) of the Act if the alien is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act, or section 240 of the Act if the alien is inadmissible under any other grounds.
(iv) Parole may only be authorized pursuant to the authority contained in, and the standards prescribed in, section 212(d)(5) of the Act. The authority of the Director of the Nebraska Service Center to authorize parole from outside the United States under this provision shall expire on March 31, 2000.
(3)
Effect of departure on an outstanding warrant of exclusion, deportation, or removal.
If an alien who is the subject of an outstanding final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal departs from the United States, with or without an advance parole authorization, such final order shall be executed by the alien's departure. The execution of such final order shall not preclude the applicant from filing an Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission Into the United States After Deportation or Removal (Form I-212) in accordance with § 1212.2 of this chapter.
(u)
Tolling the physical presence in the United States provision for certain individuals
—(1)
Departure with advance authorization for parole.
In the case of an alien who departed the United States after having been issued an Authorization for Parole of an Alien into the United States (Form I-512), and who returns to the United States in accordance with the conditions of that document, the physical presence in the United States requirement of section 902(b)(1) of HRIFA is tolled while the alien is outside the United States pursuant to the issuance of the Form I-512.
(2)
Request for parole authorization from outside the United States.
In the case of an alien who is outside the United States and submits an application for parole authorization in accordance with paragraph (t)(2) of this section, and such application for parole authorization is granted by the Service, the physical presence requirement contained in section 902(b)(1) of HRIFA is tolled from the date the application is received at the Nebraska Service Center until the alien is paroled into the United States pursuant to the issuance of the Form I-512.
(3)
Departure without advance authorization for parole.
In the case of an otherwise-eligible applicant who departed the United States on or before December 31, 1998, the physical presence in the United States provision of section 902(b)(1) of HRIFA is tolled as of October 21, 1998, and until July 12, 1999.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 902(f) of HRIFA, there shall be no judicial appeal or review of any administrative determination as to whether the status of an alien should be adjusted under the provisions of section 902 of HRIFA.
[64 FR 25767, May 12, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 15844, Mar. 24, 2000; 66 FR 29452, May 1, 2001; 67 FR 78673, Dec. 26, 2002; 85 FR 82794, Dec. 18, 2020]
§ 1245.18
How can physicians (with approved Forms I-140) that are serving in medically underserved areas or at a Veterans Affairs facility adjust status?
(a)
Which physicians are eligible for this benefit?
Any alien physician who has been granted a national interest waiver under § 204.12 of 8 CFR chapter 1 may submit Form I-485 during the 6-year period following Service approval of a second preference employment-based immigrant visa petition.
(b)
Do alien physicians have special time-related requirements for adjustment?
(1) Alien physicians who have been granted a national interest waiver under § 204.12 of 8 CFR chapter I must meet all the adjustment of status requirements of this part.
(2) The Service shall not approve an adjustment application filed by an alien physician who obtained a waiver under section 203(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act until the alien physician has completed
the period of required service established in § 204.12 of 8 CFR chapter I.
(c)
Are the filing procedures and documentary requirements different for these particular alien physicians?
Alien physicians submitting adjustment applications upon approval of an immigrant petition are required to follow the procedures outlined within this part with the following modifications.
(1) Delayed fingerprinting. Fingerprinting, as noted in the Form I-485 instructions, will not be scheduled at the time of filing. Fingerprinting will be scheduled upon the physician's completion of the required years of service.
(2) Delayed medical examination. The required medical examination, as specified in § 1245.5, shall not be submitted with Form I-485. The medical examination report shall be submitted with the documentary evidence noting the physician's completion of the required years of service.
(d)
Are alien physicians eligible for Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document?
(1) Once the Service has approved an alien physician's Form I-140 with a national interest waiver based upon full-time clinical practice in an underserved area or at a Veterans Affairs facility, the alien physician should apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident on Form I-485, accompanied by an application for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), Form I-765, as specified in § 274a.12(c)(9) of 8 CFR chapter I.
(2) Since section 203(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act requires the alien physician to complete the required employment before the Service can approve the alien physician's adjustment application, an alien physician who was in lawful nonimmigrant status when he or she filed the adjustment application is not required to maintain a nonimmigrant status while the adjustment application remains pending. Even if the alien physician's nonimmigrant status expires, the alien physician shall not be considered to be unlawfully present, so long as the alien physician is practicing medicine in accordance with § 204.5(k)(4)(iii) of 8 CFR chapter I.
(e)
When does the Service begin counting the physician's 5-year or 3-year medical practice requirement?
Except as provided in this paragraph, the 6-year period during which a physician must provide the required 5 years of service begins on the date of the notice approving the Form I-140 and the national interest waiver. Alien physicians who have a 3-year medical practice requirement must complete their service within the 4-year period beginning on that date.
(1) If the physician does not already have employment authorization and so must obtain employment authorization before the physician can begin working, then the period begins on the date the Service issues the employment authorization document.
(2) If the physician formerly held status as a J-1 nonimmigrant, but obtained a waiver of the foreign residence requirement and a change of status to that of an H-1B nonimmigrant, pursuant to section 214(1) of the Act, as amended by section 220 of Public Law 103-416, and § 212.7(c)(9) of 8 CFR chapter I, the period begins on the date of the alien's change from J-1 to H-1B status. The Service will include the alien's compliance with the 3-year period of service required under section 214(l) in calculating the alien's compliance with the period of service required under section 203(b)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of the Act and this section.
(3) An alien may not include any time employed as a J-1 nonimmigrant physician in calculating the alien's compliance with the 5 or 3-year medical practice requirement. If an alien is still in J-1 nonimmigrant status when the Service approves a Form I-140 petition with a national interest job offer waiver, the aggregate period during which the medical practice requirement period must be completed will begin on the date the Service issues an employment authorization document.
(f)
Will the Service provide information to the physician about evidence and supplemental filings?
The Service shall provide the physician with the information and the projected timetables for completing the adjustment process, as described in this paragraph. If the physician either files the Form I-485 concurrently with or waits to subsequently file the Form I-485 while the previously filed Form I-140 is still pending, then the Service will given
this information upon approval of the Form I-140. If the physician does not file the adjustment application until after approval of the Form I-140 visa petition, the Service shall provide this information upon receipt of the Form I-485 adjustment application.
(1) The Service shall note the date that the medical service begins (provided the physician already had work authorization at the time the Form I-140 was filed) or the date that an employment authorization document was issued.
(2) A list of the evidence necessary to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
(3) A projected timeline noting the dates that the physician will need to submit preliminary evidence two years and 120 days into his or her medical service in an underserved area or VA facility, and a projected date six years and 120 days in the future on which the physician's final evidence of completed medical service will be due.
(g)
Will physicians be required to file evidence prior to the end of the 5 or 3-year period?
(1) For physicians with a 5-year service requirement, no later than 120 days after the second anniversary of the approval of Petition for Immigrant Worker, Form I-140, the alien physician must submit to the Service Center having jurisdiction over his or her place of employment documentary evidence that proves the physician has in fact fulfilled at least 12 months of qualifying employment. This may be accomplished by submitting the following.
(i) Evidence noted in paragraph (h) of this section that is available at the second anniversary of the I-140 approval.
(ii) Documentation from the employer attesting to the fill-time medical practice and the date on which the physician began his or her medical service.
(2) Physicians with a 3-year service requirement are not required to make a supplemental filing, and must only comply with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
(h)
What evidence is needed to prove final compliance with the service requirement?
No later than 120 days after completion of the service requirement established under § 204.12(a) of this section, an alien physician must submit to the Service Center having jurisdiction over his or her place of employment documentary evidence that proves the physician has in fact satisfied the service requirement. Such evidence must include, but is not limited to:
(1) Individual Federal income tax returns, including copies of the alien'sW-2 forms, for the entire 3-year period or the balance years of the 5-year period that follow the submission of the evidence required in paragraph (e) of this section;
(2) Documentation from the employer attesting to the full-time medical service rendered during the required aggregate period. The documentation shall address instances of breaks in employment, other than routine breaks such as paid vacations;
(3) If the physician established his or her own practice, documents noting the actual establishment of the practice, including incorporation of the medical practice (if incorporated), the business license, and the business tax returns and tax withholding documents submitted for the entire 3 year period, or the balance years of the 5-year period that follow the submission of the evidence required in paragraph (e) of this section.
(i)
What if the physician does not comply with the requirements of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section?
If an alien physician does not submit (in accordance with paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section) proof that he or she has completed the service required under § 204.12(a) of 8 CFR chapter I, the Service shall serve the alien physician with a written notice of intent to deny the alien physician's application for adjustment of status and, after the denial is finalized, to revoke approval of the Form I-140 and national interest waiver. The written notice shall require the alien physician to provide the evidence required by paragraph (f) or (g) of this section within 30 days of the date of the written notice. The Service shall not extend this 30-day period. If the alien physician fails to submit the evidence within the 30-day period established by the written notice, the Service shall deny the alien physician's application for adjustment of status and
shall revoke approval of the Form I-140 and of the national interest waiver.
(j)
Will a Service officer interview the physician?
(1) Upon submission of the evidence noted in paragraph (h) of this section, the Service shall match the documentary evidence with the pending form I-485 and schedule the alien physician for fingerprinting at an Application Support Center.
(2) The local Service office shall schedule the alien for an adjustment interview with a Service officer, unless the Service waives the interview as provided in § 1245.6. The local Service office shall also notify the alien if supplemental documentation should either be mailed to the office, or brought to the adjustment interview.
(k)
Are alien physicians allowed to travel outside the United States during the mandatory 3 or 5-year service period?
An alien physician who has been granted a national interest waiver under § 204.12 of this chapter and has a pending application for adjustment of status may travel outside of the United States during the required 3 or 5-year service period by obtaining advanced parole prior to traveling. Alien physicians may apply for advanced parole by submitting form I-131, Application for Travel Document, to the Service office having jurisdiction over the alien physician's place of business.
(l)
What if the Service denies the adjustment application?
If the Service denies the adjustment application, the alien physician may renew the application in removal proceedings.

An alien with a final order of removal, deportation, or exclusion who believes he or she is eligible for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 must apply directly to DHS in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(1) An application under this section does not automatically stay the order of removal, deportation, or exclusion. An alien who is eligible for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 may request that the district director with jurisdiction over the alien grant a stay of removal during the pendency of the application. The regulations governing such a request are found at 8 CFR 241.6.
(2) DHS in general will exercise its discretion not to grant a stay of removal, deportation, or exclusion with respect to an alien who is inadmissible on any of the grounds specified in paragraph (m)(3) of this section, unless there is substantial reason to believe that DHS will grant the necessary waivers of inadmissibility.
(3) An immigration judge or the Board may not grant a motion to re-open or stay in connection with an application under this section.
(4) If DHS approves the application, the approval will constitute the automatic re-opening of the alien's immigration proceedings, vacating of the final order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, and termination of the reopened proceedings.
(e)
Grounds of inadmissibility that do not apply.
In making a determination of whether an applicant is otherwise eligible for admission to the United States for lawful permanent residence under the provisions of section 586 of Public Law 106-429, the grounds of inadmissibility under sections 212(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(7)(A), and (a)(9) of the Act shall not apply.
(f)
Waiver of grounds of inadmissibility.
In connection with an application for adjustment of status under this section, the alien may apply for a waiver of the grounds of inadmissibility under sections 212(a)(1), (a)(6)(B), (a)(6)(C), (a)(6)(F), (a)(8)(A), (a)(10)(B), and (a)(10)(D) of the Act as provided in section 586(c) of Public Law 106-429, if the alien demonstrates that a waiver is necessary to prevent extreme hardship to the alien, or to the alien's spouse, parent, son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. In addition, the alien may apply for any other waiver of inadmissibility under section 212 of the Act, if eligible. In order to obtain a waiver for any of these grounds, an applicant must submit Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability, with the application for adjustment.
(g)
Evidence.
Applicants must submit evidence that demonstrates they are eligible for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429. Such evidence shall include the following:
(1) A birth certificate or other record of birth;
(2) Documentation to establish that the applicant was physically present in the United States on October 1, 1997, under the standards set forth in § 1245.22 of this chapter.
(3) A copy of the applicant's Arrival-Departure Record (Form I-94) or other evidence that the alien was inspected or paroled into the United States prior to October 1, 1997, from one of the three programs listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Subject to verification, documentation pertaining to paragraph (a)(2) of this section is already contained in DHS files and the applicant may submit an affidavit to that effect in lieu of actual documentation.
(h)
Employment authorization.
Applicants who want to obtain employment authorization based on a pending application for adjustment of status under this section may submit Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, along with the application fee listed in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106. If DHS approves the application for employment authorization, the applicant will be issued an employment authorization document.
(i)
Travel while an application to adjust status is pending.
An alien may travel
abroad while an application to adjust status is pending. Applicants must obtain advance parole in order to avoid the abandonment of their application to adjust status. An applicant may obtain advance parole by filing Form I-131, Application for a Travel Document, along with the application fee listed in 8 CFR 103.7 and 8 CFR part 106. If DHS approves Form I-131, the alien will be issued Form I-512, Authorization for the Parole of an Alien into the United States. Aliens granted advance parole will still be subject to inspection at a port-of-entry.
(j)
Approval and date of admission as a lawful permanent resident.
When DHS approves an application to adjust status to that of lawful permanent resident based on section 586 of Public Law 106-429, the applicant will be notified in writing of DHS's decision. In addition, the record of the alien's admission as a lawful permanent resident will be recorded as of the date of the alien's inspection and parole into the United States, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(k)
Notice of denial.
When DHS denies an application to adjust status to that of lawful permanent resident based on section 586 of Public Law 106-429, the applicant will be notified of the decision in writing.
(l)
Administrative review.
An alien whose application for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 is denied by DHS may appeal the decision to the Administrative Appeals Office in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(2).
(m)
Number of adjustments permitted under this section
—(1)
Limit.
No more than 5,000 aliens may have their status adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident under section 586 of Public Law 106-429.
(2)
Counting procedures.
Each alien granted adjustment of status under this section will count towards the 5,000 limit. DHS will assign a tracking number, ascending chronologically by filing date, to all applications properly filed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (g) of this section. Except as described in paragraph (m)(3) of this section, DHS will adjudicate applications in that order until it reaches 5,000 approvals under this part. Applications initially denied but pending on administrative appeal will retain their place in the queue by virtue of their tracking number, pending DHS's adjudication of the appeal.
(3)
Applications submitted with a request for the waiver of a ground of inadmissibility.
In the discretion of DHS, applications that do not require adjudication of a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2), (a)(6)(B), (a)(6)(F), (a)(8)(A), or (a)(10)(D) of the Act may be approved and assigned numbers within the 5,000 limit before those applications that do require a waiver of inadmissibility under any of those provisions. Applications requiring a waiver of any of those provisions will be assigned a tracking number chronologically by the date of approval of the necessary waivers rather than the date of filing of the application.
(4)
Procedures when the 5,000 limit is reached.
DHS will track the total number of adjustments and stop processing applications after the 5,000 limit has been reached. When the limit is reached, DHS will return any additional applications to applicants with a dated notice encouraging applicants to retain their application package and the notice in the event the 5,000 limit is expanded or eliminated and the alien wishes to apply again. DHS will keep an identifying chronological record of the application for purposes of processing applications under this section if the 5,000 limit subsequently is expanded or eliminated. If at the time the 5,000 limit is reached, it appears that Congress is about to pass legislation to expand or eliminate the cap, DHS retains the discretion to retain such applications and the related fees.

§ 1245.22
Evidence to demonstrate an alien's physical presence in the United States on a specific date.
(a)
Evidence.
Generally, an alien who is required to demonstrate his or her physical presence in the United States on a specific date in connection with an application to adjust status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence should submit evidence according to this section. In
cases where a more specific regulation relating to a particular adjustment of status provision has been issued in the 8 CFR, such regulation is controlling to the extent that it conflicts with this section.
(b)
The number of documents.
If no one document establishes the alien's physical presence on the required date, he or she may submit several documents establishing his or her physical presence in the United States prior to and after that date.
(c)
Service-issued documentation.
To demonstrate physical presence on a specific date, the alien may submit Service-issued documentation. Examples of acceptable Service documentation include, but are not limited to, photocopies of:
(1) Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, issued upon the alien's arrival in the United States;
(2) Form I-862, Notice to Appear, issued by the Service on or before the required date;
(3) Form I-122, Notice to Applicant for Admission Detained for Hearing before Immigration Judge, issued by the Service on or prior to the required date, placing the applicant in exclusion proceedings under section 236 of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997);
(4) Form I-221, Order to Show Cause, issued by the Service on or prior to the required date, placing the applicant in deportation proceedings under section 242 or 242A (redesignated as section 238) of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997); or
(5) Any application or petition for a benefit under the Act filed by or on behalf of the applicant on or prior to the required date that establishes his or her presence in the United States, or a fee receipt issued by the Service for such application or petition.
(d)
Government-issued documentation.
To demonstrate physical presence on the required date, the alien may submit other government documentation. Other government documentation issued by a Federal, State, or local authority must bear the signature, seal, or other authenticating instrument of such authority (if the document normally bears such instrument), be dated at the time of issuance, and bear a date of issuance not later than the required date. For this purpose, the term Federal, State, or local authority includes any governmental, educational, or administrative function operated by Federal, State, county, or municipal officials. Examples of such other documentation include, but are not limited to:
(1) A state driver's license;
(2) A state identification card;
(3) A county or municipal hospital record;
(4) A public college or public school transcript;
(5) Income tax records;
(6) A certified copy of a Federal, State, or local governmental record that was created on or prior to the required date, shows that the applicant was present in the United States at the time, and establishes that the applicant sought in his or her own behalf, or some other party sought in the applicant's behalf, a benefit from the Federal, State, or local governmental agency keeping such record;
(7) A certified copy of a Federal, State, or local governmental record that was created on or prior to the required date, that shows that the applicant was present in the United States at the time, and establishes that the applicant submitted an income tax return, property tax payment, or similar submission or payment to the Federal, State, or local governmental agency keeping such record; or
(8) A transcript from a private or religious school that is registered with, or approved or licensed by, appropriate State or local authorities, accredited by the State or regional accrediting body, or by the appropriate private school association, or maintains enrollment records in accordance with State or local requirements or standards. Such evidence will only be accepted to document the physical presence of an alien who was in attendance and under the age of 21 on the specific date that physical presence in the United States is required.
(e)
Copies of records.
It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain and submit copies of the records of any other government agency that the applicant desires to be considered in support of his or her application. If the
alien is not in possession of such a document or documents, but believes that a copy is already contained in the Service file relating to him or her, he or she may submit a statement as to the name and location of the issuing Federal, State, or local government agency, the type of document and the date on which it was issued.
(f)
Other relevant document(s) and evaluation of evidence.
The adjudicator will consider any other relevant document(s) as well as evaluate all evidence submitted, on a case-by-case basis. The Service may require an interview when necessary.
(g)
Accuracy of documentation.
In all cases, any doubts as to the existence, authenticity, veracity, or accuracy of the documentation shall be resolved by the official government record, with records of the Service having precedence over the records of other agencies. Furthermore, determinations as to the weight to be given any particular document or item of evidence shall be solely within the discretion of the adjudicating authority.

§ 1246.1
Notice.
If it appears to a district director that a person residing in his or her district was not in fact eligible for the adjustment of status made in his or her case, or it appears to an asylum office director that a person granted adjustment of status by an asylum officer pursuant to 8 CFR 1240.70 was not in fact eligible for adjustment of status, a proceeding shall be commenced by the personal service upon such person of a notice of intent to rescind, which shall inform him or her of the allegations upon which it is intended to rescind the adjustment of his or her status. In such a proceeding the person shall be known as the respondent. The notice shall also inform the respondent that he or she may submit, within thirty days from the date of service of the notice, an answer in writing under oath setting forth reasons why such rescission shall not be made, and that he or she may, within such period, request a hearing before an immigration judge in support of, or in lieu of, his or her written answer. The respondent shall further be informed that he or she may have the assistance of or be represented by counsel or representative of his or her choice qualified under part 292 of this chapter, at no expense to the Government, in the preparation of his or her answer or in connection with his or her hearing, and that he or she may present such evidence in his or her behalf as may be relevant to the rescission.

§ 1246.2
Allegations admitted; no answer filed; no hearing requested.
If the answer admits the allegations in the notice, or if no answer is filed within the thirty-day period, or if no hearing is requested within such period, the district director or asylum office director shall rescind the adjustment of status previously granted, and no appeal shall lie from his decision.

§ 1246.3
Allegations contested or denied; hearing requested.
If, within the prescribed time following service of the notice pursuant to § 1246.1, the respondent has filed an answer which contests or denies any allegation in the notice, or a hearing is requested, a hearing pursuant to § 1246.5
shall be conducted by an immigration judge, and the requirements contained in §§ 1240.3, 1240.4, 1240.5, 1240.6, 1240.7, and 1240.9 of this chapter shall be followed.
§ 1246.4
Immigration judge's authority; withdrawal and substitution.
In any proceeding conducted under this part, the immigration judge shall have authority to interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the respondent and other witnesses, to present and receive evidence, to determine whether adjustment of status shall be rescinded, to make decisions thereon, including an appropriate order, and to take any other action consistent with applicable provisions of law and regulations as may be appropriate to the disposition of the case. Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to diminish the authority conferred on immigration judges by the Act. The immigration judge assigned to conduct a hearing shall, at any time, withdraw if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified. If a hearing has begun but no evidence has been adduced other than the notice and answer, if any, pursuant to §§ 1246.1 and 1246.2, or if an immigration judge becomes unavailable to complete his or her duties within a reasonable time, or if at any time the respondent consents to a substitution, another immigration judge may be assigned to complete the case. The new immigration judge shall familiarize himself or herself with the record in the case and shall state for the record that he or she is familiar with the record in the case.
§ 1246.5
Hearing.
(a)
DHS counsel.
The Government shall be represented at the hearing by a DHS counsel who shall have authority to present evidence, and to interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the respondent and other witnesses. The DHS counsel is authorized to appeal from a decision of the immigration judge pursuant to § 1246.7 and to move for reopening or reconsideration pursuant to § 1003.23 of this chapter.
(b)
Opening.
The immigration judge shall advise the respondent of the nature of the proceeding and the legal authority under which it is conducted; advise the respondent of his or her right to representation, at no expense to the Government, by counsel or representative of his or her own choice qualified under part 1292 of this chapter and require him or her to state then and there whether he or she desires representation; advise the respondent that he or she will have a reasonable opportunity to examine and object to the evidence against him or her, to present evidence in his or her own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government; place the respondent under oath; read the allegations in the notice to the respondent and explain them in nontechnical language, and enter the notice and respondent's answer, if any, as exhibits in the record.
(c)
Pleading by respondent.
The immigration judge shall require the respondent to state for the record whether he or she admits or denies the allegations contained in the notice, or any of them, and whether he or she concedes that his or her adjustment of status should be rescinded. If the respondent admits all of the allegations and concedes that the adjustment of status in his or her case should be rescinded under the allegations set forth in the notice, and the immigration judge is satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain, he or she may determine that rescission as alleged has been established by the respondent's admissions. The allegations contained in the notice shall be taken as admitted when the respondent, without reasonable cause, fails or refuses to attend or remain in attendance at the hearing.

An appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the mailing of a written decision or the stating of an oral decision. The reasons for the appeal shall be specifically identified in the Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR 26); failure to do so may constitute a ground for dismissal of the appeal by the Board.

In conjunction with an application under section 249 of the Act, an otherwise eligible alien who is inadmissible under paragraph (9), (10), or (12) of section 212(a) of the Act or so much of paragraph (23) of section 212(a) of the Act as relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marihuana may request a waiver of such ground of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. Any alien within the classes described in subparagraphs (B) through (H) of section 212(a)(28) of the Act may apply for the benefits of section 212(a)(28)(I)(ii) in conjunction with an application under section 249 of the Act.
[47 FR 44238, Oct. 7, 1982]
§ 1249.2
Application.
(a)
Jurisdiction.
An application by an alien, other than an arriving alien, who has been served with a notice to appear or warrant of arrest shall be considered only in proceedings under 8 CFR part 1240. In any other case, an alien who believes he or she meets the eligibility requirements of section 249 of the Act shall apply to the district director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. The application shall be made on Form I-485 and shall be accompanied by Form G-325A, which shall be considered part of the application. The application shall also be accompanied by documentary evidence establishing continuous residence in the United States since prior to January 1, 1972, or since entry and prior to July 1, 1924. All documents must be submitted in accordance with § 103.2(b) of this chapter. Documentary evidence may include any records of official or personal transactions or recordings of events occurring during the period of claimed residence. Affidavits of credible witnesses may also be accepted. Persons unemployed and unable to furnish evidence in their own names may furnish evidence in the names of parents or other persons with whom they have been living, if affidavits of the parents or other persons are submitted attesting to the residence. The numerical limitations of sections 201 and 202 of the Act shall not apply.
(b)
Decision.
The applicant shall be notified of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reasons therefor. If the application is granted, a Form I-551, showing that the applicant has acquired the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, shall not be issued until the applicant surrenders any other document in his or her possession evidencing compliance with the alien registration requirements of former or existing law. No appeal shall lie from the denial of an application by the district director.
However, an alien, other than an arriving alien, may renew the denied application in proceedings under 8 CFR part 1240.

§ 1249.3
Reopening and reconsideration.
An applicant who alleged entry and residence since prior to July 1, 1924, but in whose case a record was created as of the date of approval of the application because evidence of continuous residence prior to July 1, 1924, was not submitted, may have his case reopened and reconsidered pursuant to § 103.5 of 8 CFR chapter I. Upon the submission of satisfactory evidence, a record of admission as of the date of alleged entry may be created.

§ 1270.1
Definitions.
For the purpose of this part—
Document

§ 1270.2
Enforcement procedures.
(a)
Procedures for the filing of complaints.
Any person or entity having knowledge of a violation or potential violation of section 274C of the Act may submit a signed, written complaint to the Service office having jurisdiction over the business or residence of the potential violator or the location where the violation occurred. The signed, written complaint must contain sufficient information to identify both the complainant and the alleged violator, including their names and addresses. The complaint should also contain detailed factual allegations relating to the potential violation including the date, time and place of the alleged violation and the specific act or conduct alleged to constitute a violation of the Act. Written complaints may be delivered either by mail to the appropriate Service office or by personally appearing before any immigration officer at a Service office.
(b)
Investigation.
When the Service receives complaints from a third party in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, it shall investigate only those complaints which, on their face, have a substantial probability of validity. The Service may also conduct investigations for violations on its own initiative, and without having received a written complaint. If it is determined after investigation that the person or entity has violated section 274C of the Act, the Service may issue and serve upon the alleged violator a Notice of Intent to Fine.
(c)
Issuance of a subpoena.
Service officers shall have reasonable access to examine any relevant evidence of any person or entity being investigated. The Service may issue subpoenas pursuant to its authority under sections 235(a) and 287 of the Act, in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1287.4 of this chapter.
(d)
Notice of Intent to Fine.
The proceeding to assess administrative penalties under section 274C of the Act is commenced when the Service issues a Notice of Intent to Fine. Service of this notice shall be accomplished by personal service pursuant to § 103.5a(a)(2)
of 8 CFR chapter I. Service is effective upon receipt, as evidenced by the certificate of service or the certified mail return receipt. The person or entity identified in the Notice of Intent to Fine shall be known as the respondent. The Notice of Intent to Fine may be issued by an officer defined in § 242.1 of this chapter or by an INS port director designated by his or her district director.
(e)
Contents of the Notice of Intent to Fine.
(1) The Notice of Intent to Fine shall contain the basis for the charge(s) against the respondent, the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated, and the monetary amount of the penalty the Service intends to impose.
(2) The Notice of Intent to Fine shall provide the following advisals to the respondent:
(i) That the person or entity has the right to representation by counsel of his or her own choice at no expense to the government;
(ii) That any statement given may be used against the person or entity;
(iii) That the person or entity has the right to request a hearing before an administrative law judge pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554-557, and that such request must be filed with INS within 60 days from the service of the Notice of Intent to Fine; and
(iv) That if a written request for a hearing is not timely filed, the Service will issue a final order from which there is no appeal.
(f)
Request for hearing before an administrative law judge.
If a respondent contests the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Fine, the respondent must file with the INS, within 60 days of the Notice of Intent to Fine, a written request for a hearing before an administrative law judge. Any written request for a hearing submitted in a foreign language must be accompanied by an English language translation. A request for hearing is deemed filed when it is either received by the Service office designated in the Notice of Intent to Fine, or addressed to such office, stamped with the proper postage, and postmarked within the 60-day period. In computing the 60-day period prescribed by this section, the day of service of the Notice of Intent to Fine shall not be included. In the request for a hearing, the respondent may, but is not required to, respond to each allegation listed in the Notice of Intent to Fine. A respondent may waive the 60-day period in which to request a hearing before an administrative law judge and ask that the INS issue a final order from which there is no appeal. Prior to execution of the waiver, a respondent who is not a United States citizen will be advised that a waiver of a section 274C hearing will result in the issuance of a final order and that the respondent will be excludable and/or deportable from the United States pursuant to the Act.
(g)
Failure to file a request for hearing.
If the respondent does not file a written request for a hearing within 60 days of service of the Notice of Intent to Fine, the INS shall issue a final order from which there shall be no appeal.
(h)
Issuance of the final order.
A final order may be issued by an officer defined in § 242.1 of 8 CFR chapter I, by an INS port director designated by his or her district director, or by the Director of the INS National Fines Office.

Service of the final order
—(1)
Generally.

(2)
Alternative provisions for service in a foreign country.
When service is to be effected upon a party in a foreign country, it is sufficient if service of the final order is made: (i) In the manner prescribed by the law of the foreign country for service in that country in an action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction; or
(ii) As directed by the foreign authority in response to a letter rogatory, when service in either case is reasonably calculated to give actual notice; or

Other acts of document fraud committed by such an alien may result in the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Fine and the imposition of civil money penalties.
§ 1270.3
Penalties.
(a)
Criminal penalties.
Nothing in section 274C of the Act shall be construed to diminish or qualify any of the penalties available for activities prohibited by this section but proscribed as well in title 18, United States Code.
(b)
Civil penalties.
A person or entity may face civil penalties for a violation of section 274C of the Act. Civil penalties may be imposed by the Service or by an administrative law judge for violations under section 274C of the Act. The Service may charge multiple violations of section 274C of the Act in a single Notice of Intent to Fine, and may impose separate penalties for each such unlawful act in a single proceeding or determination. However, in determining whether an offense is a first offense or a subsequent offense, a finding of more than one violation in the course of a single proceeding or determination will be counted as a single offense.
(1) A respondent found by the Service or an administrative law judge to have violated section 274C of the Act shall be subject to an order:
(i) To cease and desist from such behavior; and
(ii) To pay a civil penalty as follows:
(A)
First offense.
Not less than $250 and not exceeding $2,000 for each fraudulent document or each proscribed activity described in section 274C(a)(1) through (a)(4) of the Act before September 29, 1999, and not less than $275 and not exceeding $2,200, for each fraudulent document or each proscribed activity on or after September 29, 1999.
(B)
Subsequent offenses.
Not less than $2,000 and not more than $5,000 for each fraudulent document or each proscribed activity described in section 274C(a)(1) through (a)(4) of the Act before September 29, 1999, and not less than $2,200 and not exceeding $5,500, for each fraudulent document or each proscribed activity occurring on or after September 29, 1999.
(2) Where an order is issued to a respondent composed of distinct, physically separate subdivisions each of which provides separately for the hiring, recruiting, or referring for a fee for employment (without reference to the practices of, and not under the common control of or common control with, another subdivision), each subdivision shall be considered a separate person or entity.

(2) The organization is a Federal tax-exempt organization established in the United States;
(3) The organization is simultaneously applying to have at least one employee or volunteer of the organization approved as an accredited representative by the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) and at least one application for accreditation is concurrently approved, unless the organization is seeking renewal of recognition and has an accredited representative or is seeking renewal of recognition on inactive status as described in § 1292.16(i);
(4) The organization has access to adequate knowledge, information, and experience in all aspects of immigration law and procedure; and

The organization must submit its annual budget for providing immigration legal services for the current year and, if available, its annual budget for providing immigration legal services for the prior year. If the annual budgets for both the current and prior years are unavailable, the organization must submit its projected annual budget for the upcoming year.

Accreditation of representatives.
(a)
In general.
Only recognized organizations, or organizations simultaneously applying for recognition, may request accreditation of individuals.

(d)
Validity period of accreditation.
Accreditation is valid for a period of three years from the date of the Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) approval of accreditation, unless the organization's recognition or the representative's accreditation is terminated pursuant to § 1292.17 or the organization or the representative is subject to disciplinary sanctions (termination, revocation, suspension, or disbarment) under 8 CFR 1003.101
et seq.
(e)
Change in accreditation.
An organization may request to change the accreditation of a representative from partial to full accreditation at any time during the validity period of accreditation or at renewal. Such a request will be treated as a new, initial request for full accreditation and must comply with this section.

§ 1292.13
Applying for recognition of organizations or accreditation of representatives.
(a)
In general.
An organization applying for recognition or accreditation of a representative must submit a request for recognition (Form EOIR-31) or a request for accreditation (Form EOIR-31A) to the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) with proof of service of a copy of the request on the appropriate USCIS office(s) in the jurisdictions where the organization offers or intends to offer immigration legal services. An organization must submit a separate request for accreditation (Form EOIR-31A) for each individual for whom it seeks accreditation. To determine whether an organization has established eligibility for recognition or accreditation of a representative, the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) shall review all information contained in the request for recognition or accreditation and may review any publicly available information or any other information that the Office of Policy may obtain or possess about the organization, its authorized officer, or the proposed representative or may have received pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Unfavorable information obtained by the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) that may be relied upon to disapprove a recognition or accreditation request, if not previously served on the organization, shall be disclosed to the organization, and the organization shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond. Prior to determining whether to approve or disapprove a request for recognition or accreditation, the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) may request additional information from the organization pertaining to the eligibility requirements for recognition or accreditation. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate), in writing, shall inform the organization and each USCIS office in the jurisdictions where the organization offers or intends to offer immigration legal services of the determination approving or disapproving the organization's request for recognition or accreditation of a representative. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) may, in the exercise of discretion, extend the deadlines provided in this section. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) is authorized to allow requests, notifications, recommendations, and determinations described in this section to be made electronically.
(b)
USCIS recommendation and investigation.
Within 30 days from the date of service of the request for recognition or accreditation, the USCIS office
served with the request may submit to the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) a recommendation for approval or disapproval of the request for recognition or accreditation, including an explanation for the recommendation, or may request from the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) a specified period of additional time, generally no more than 30 days, in which to conduct an investigation or otherwise obtain relevant information regarding the organization, its authorized officer, or any individual for whom the organization seeks accreditation. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) shall inform the organization if the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) grants a request from USCIS for additional time to conduct an investigation, or if, in the exercise of discretion, the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) has requested that USCIS conduct an investigation of the organization, its authorized officer, or any individual for whom the organization seeks accreditation. USCIS must submit any recommendation with proof of service of a copy of the recommendation on the organization. Within 30 days of service of an unfavorable recommendation, the organization may file with the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) a response to the unfavorable recommendation, along with proof of service of a copy of such response on the USCIS office that provided the recommendation.
(c)
ICE recommendation.
Upon receipt of a request for recognition or accreditation, the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) may request a recommendation or information from ICE in the jurisdictions where the organization offers or intends to offer immigration legal services regarding the organization, its authorized officer, or any individual for whom the organization seeks accreditation. Within 30 days from the date of receipt of the Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) request, ICE may make a recommendation or disclose information regarding the organization, its authorized officer, or individuals for whom the organization seeks accreditation. ICE must submit any recommendation with proof of service of a copy of the recommendation on the organization. Within 30 days of service of an unfavorable recommendation, the organization may file with the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) a response to the unfavorable recommendation, along with proof of service of a copy of such response on the ICE office that provided the recommendation. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate), in writing, shall inform ICE of the determination approving or disapproving the organization's request for recognition or accreditation of a representative.
(d)
EOIR investigation.
Upon receipt of a request for recognition or accreditation, the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) may request that the EOIR disciplinary counsel or anti-fraud officer conduct an investigation into the organization, its authorized officer, or any individual for whom the organization seeks accreditation. Within 30 days from the date of receipt of the Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) request, the EOIR disciplinary counsel or anti-fraud officer may disclose to the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) information, including complaints, preliminary inquiries, warning letters, and admonitions, relating to the organization, its authorized officer, or any individual for whom the organization seeks accreditation.
(e)
Finality of decision.
The Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) determination to approve a request for recognition or accreditation is final. An organization whose request for recognition or accreditation was disapproved may make one request for reconsideration of the disapproval within 30 days of the determination. An organization whose request for recognition or accreditation was disapproved, or whose
request for reconsideration after disapproval and, if applicable, request for administrative review pursuant to § 1292.18 was denied, may submit a new request for recognition or accreditation at any time unless otherwise prohibited.

§ 1292.14
Reporting, recordkeeping, and posting requirements for recognized organizations.
(a)
Duty to report changes.
A recognized organization has a duty to promptly notify the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) in writing or electronically of changes in the organization's contact information, changes to any material information the organization provided in Form EOIR-31, Form EOIR-31A, or the documents submitted in support thereof, or changes that otherwise materially relate to the organization's eligibility for recognition or the eligibility for accreditation of any of the organization's accredited representatives. These changes may include alterations to: The organization's name, address, telephone number, Web site address, email address, or the designation of the authorized officer of the organization; an accredited representative's name or employment or volunteer status with the organization; and the organization's structure, including a merger of organizations that have already been individually accorded recognition, or a change in non-profit or Federal tax-exempt status.
(b)
Recordkeeping.
A recognized organization must compile each of the following records in a timely manner, and retain them for a period of six years from the date the record is created, as long as the organization remains recognized:
(1) The organization's immigration legal services fee schedule, if the organization charges any fees for immigration legal services, for each office or location where such services are provided; and
(2) An annual summary of immigration legal services provided by the organization, which includes: The total number of clients served (whether through client intakes, applications prepared and filed with DHS, cases in which its attorneys or accredited representatives appeared before the Immigration Courts or, if applicable, the Board, or referrals to attorneys or other organizations) and clients to whom it provided services at no cost; a general description of the immigration legal services and other immigration-related services (
e.g.,
educational or outreach events) provided; a statement regarding whether services were provided pro bono or clients were charged in accordance with a fee schedule and organizational policies or guidance regarding fee waivers and reduced fees; and a list of the offices or locations where the immigration legal services were provided. The summary should not include any client-specific or client-identifying information. The Office of Policy may require the organization to submit such records to it or DHS upon request.
(c)
Posting.
The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) shall have the authority to issue public notices regarding recognition and accreditation and to require recognized organizations and accredited representatives to post such public notices. Information contained in the public notices shall be limited to: The names and validity periods of a recognized organization and its accredited representatives, the requirements for recognition and accreditation, and the means to complain about a recognized organization or accredited representative.

§ 1292.15
Extension of recognition and accreditation to multiple offices or locations of an organization.
Upon approving an initial request for recognition or a request for renewal of recognition, or at any other time, the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate), in the Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) discretion, may extend the recognition of an organization to any office or location where the organization offers services. To request extension of recognition, an organization
that is seeking or has received recognition must submit a Form EOIR-31 that identifies the name and address of the organization's headquarters or designated office and the name and address of each other office or location for which the organization seeks extension of recognition. The organization must also provide a declaration from its authorized officer attesting that it periodically conducts inspections of each such office or location, exercises supervision and control over its accredited representatives at those offices and locations, and provides access to adequate legal resources at each such office or location. The Office of Policy may require an organization to seek separate recognition for an office or location of the organization, for example, when a subordinate office or location has distinct operations, management structure, or funding sources from the organization's headquarters. The Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) determination to extend recognition to the offices or locations identified in Form EOIR-31 permits the organization's accredited representatives to provide immigration legal services out of those offices or locations. The Office of Policy will post the address of each office or location to which recognition has been extended on the roster of recognized organizations and accredited representatives. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) is authorized to allow requests and determinations described in this section to be made electronically.

Accreditation.
Each request for renewal of accreditation must establish that the individual remains eligible for accreditation under § 1292.12(a) and has continued to receive formal training in immigration law and procedure commensurate with the services the organization provides and the duration of the representative's accreditation.
(d)
Recommendations and investigations.
Each USCIS office served with a request for renewal of recognition or a request for renewal of accreditation may submit to the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) a recommendation for approval or disapproval of that request pursuant to § 1292.13(b).

Renewal process.
The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) shall review all information contained in the requests and may review any publicly available information or any other information that the Office of Policy may possess about the organization, its authorized officer, or any individual for whom the organization seeks accreditation or renewal of accreditation or that the Office of Policy may have received pursuant to § 1292.13(b) through (d). Unfavorable information obtained by the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) that may be relied upon to disapprove a recognition or accreditation request, if not previously served on the organization, shall be disclosed to the organization, and the organization shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond. Prior to determining whether to approve or disapprove a request for renewal of recognition or accreditation, the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) may request additional information from the organization pertaining to the eligibility requirements for recognition or accreditation. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate), in writing, shall inform the organization and the appropriate DHS office(s) in the jurisdictions where the organization offers or intends to offer immigration legal services of the determination to approve or disapprove a request for renewal of recognition. If the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) renews recognition, the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) shall issue a written determination approving or disapproving each request for accreditation or renewal of accreditation. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) is authorized to allow requests, notifications, recommendations, and determinations described in this section to be made electronically.

An organization whose request for renewal of recognition or accreditation of its representatives has been disapproved may make one request for reconsideration of the disapproval within 30 days of the determination. The recognition of the organization and the accreditation of any representatives for whom the organization timely requests reconsideration shall remain valid pending the Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) consideration of the reconsideration request, except in the case of an interim suspension pursuant to 8 CFR 1003.111. An organization whose recognition or accreditation of its representatives is terminated because the organization's request to renew recognition or accreditation is disapproved or whose request for reconsideration after disapproval and, if applicable, request for administrative review pursuant to § 1292.18 was denied, may submit a new request for recognition and accreditation at any time unless otherwise prohibited.
(g)

i.e.,
termination or revocation) under 8 CFR 1003.101
et seq.
