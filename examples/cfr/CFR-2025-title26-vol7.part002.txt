, except that on March 15, 2007, P completely disposes of its interest in S. Thereafter, S continues to grant options for S stock to S employees under the plan.
(ii) The new S options are granted under a plan that meets the stockholder approval requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section without regard to whether S seeks approval of the plan from the stockholders of S after P disposes of its interest in S.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
, except that under the plan as adopted on January 1, 2006, only options for P stock are granted to S employees. Assume further that after P disposes of its interest in S, S changes the plan to provide for the grant of options for S stock to S employees. Because there is a change in the stock available for purchase or grant under
the plan, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the stockholders of S must approve the plan within 12 months before or after the change to the plan to meet the stockholder approval requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

# Example 3. Stockholder approval.
(i) Corporation X maintains a plan under which incentive stock options may be granted to all eligible employees. Corporation Y does not maintain an incentive stock option plan. On May 15, 2006, Corporation X and Corporation Y consolidate under state law to form one corporation. The new corporation will be named Corporation Y. The consolidation agreement describes the Corporation X plan, including the maximum aggregate number of shares available for issuance pursuant to incentive stock options after the consolidation and the employees eligible to receive options under the plan. Additionally, the consolidation agreement states that the plan will be continued by Corporation Y after the consolidation and incentive stock options will be issued by Corporation Y. The consolidation agreement is unanimously approved by the shareholders of Corporations X and Y on May 1, 2006. Corporation Y assumes the plan formerly maintained by Corporation X and continues to grant options under the plan to all eligible employees.
(ii) Because there is a change in the granting corporation (from Corporation X to Corporation Y), under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, Corporation Y is considered to have adopted a new plan. Because the plan is fully described in the consolidation agreement, including the maximum aggregate number of shares available for issuance pursuant to incentive stock options and employees eligible to receive options under the plan, the approval of the consolidation agreement by the shareholders constitutes approval of the plan. Thus, the shareholder approval of the consolidation agreement satisfies the shareholder approval requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the plan is considered to be adopted by Corporation Y and approved by its shareholders on May 1, 2006.

# Example 4. Maximum aggregate number of shares.
X Corporation maintains a plan under which statutory options and nonstatutory options may be granted. The plan designates the number of shares that may be used for incentive stock options. Because the maximum aggregate number of shares that will be used for incentive stock options is designated in the plan, the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are satisfied.

# Example 5. Maximum aggregate number of shares.
Y Corporation adopts an incentive stock option plan on November 1, 2006. On that date, there are two million outstanding shares of Y Corporation stock. The plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan may not exceed 15% of the outstanding number of shares of Y Corporation on November 1, 2006. Because the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan is designated in the plan, the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are met.

# Example 6. Maximum aggregate number of shares.
(i) B Corporation adopts an incentive stock option plan on March 15, 2005. The plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the plan is 50,000, increased on each anniversary date of the adoption of the plan by 5 percent of the then-outstanding shares.
(ii) Because the maximum aggregate number of shares is not designated under the plan, the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are not met.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 6,
except that the plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares available under the plan is the lesser of (a) 50,000 shares, increased each anniversary date of the adoption of the plan by 5 percent of the then-outstanding shares, or (b) 200,000 shares. Because the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan is designated as the lesser of one of two numbers, one of which provides an immediately determinable maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan in any event, the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are met.
(c)
Duration of option grants under the plan.
An incentive stock option must be granted within 10 years from the date that the plan under which it is granted is adopted or the date such plan is approved by the stockholders, whichever is earlier. To grant incentive stock options after the expiration of the 10-year period, a new plan must be adopted and approved.
(d)
Period for exercising options.
An incentive stock option, by its terms, must not be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date such option is granted, or 5 years from the date such option is granted to an employee described in paragraph (f) of this section. An option that does not contain such a provision when granted is not an incentive stock option.
(e)
Option price.
(1) Except as provided by paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the option price of an incentive stock option must not be less than the fair market value of the stock subject to the option at the time the option is
granted. The option price may be determined in any reasonable manner, including the valuation methods permitted under § 20.2031-2 of this chapter, so long as the minimum price possible under the terms of the option is not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. For general rules relating to the option price, see § 1.421-1(e). For rules relating to the determination of when an option is granted, see § 1.421-1(c).
(2)(i) If a share of stock is transferred to an individual pursuant to the exercise of an option which fails to qualify as an incentive stock option merely because there was a failure of an attempt, made in good faith, to meet the option price requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the requirements of such paragraph are considered to have been met. Whether there was a good-faith attempt to set the option price at not less than the fair market value of the stock subject to the option at the time the option was granted depends on the relevant facts and circumstances.
(ii) For publicly held stock that is actively traded on an established market at the time the option is granted, determining the fair market value of such stock by the appropriate method described in § 20.2031-2 of this chapter establishes that a good-faith attempt to meet the option price requirements of this paragraph (e) was made.
(iii) For non-publicly traded stock, if it is demonstrated, for example, that the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant was based upon an average of the fair market values as of such date set forth in the opinions of completely independent and well-qualified experts, such a demonstration generally establishes that there was a good-faith attempt to meet the option price requirements of this paragraph (e). The optionee's status as a majority or minority stockholder may be taken into consideration.
(iv) Regardless of whether the stock offered under an option is publicly traded, a good-faith attempt to meet the option price requirements of this paragraph (e) is not demonstrated unless the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant is determined with regard to
nonlapse restrictions
(as defined in § 1.83-3(h)) and without regard to
lapse restrictions
(as defined in § 1.83-3(i)).
(v) Amounts treated as interest and amounts paid as interest under a deferred payment arrangement are not includible as part of the option price. See § 1.421-1(e)(1). An attempt to set the option price at not less than fair market value is not regarded as made in good faith where an adjustment of the option price to reflect amounts treated as interest results in the option price being lower than the fair market value on which the option price was based.
(3) Notwithstanding that the option price requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied by an option granted to an employee whose stock ownership exceeds the limitation provided by paragraph (f) of this section, such option is not an incentive stock option when granted unless it also complies with paragraph (f) of this section. If the option, when granted, does not comply with the requirements described in paragraph (f) of this section, such option can never become an incentive stock option, even if the employee's stock ownership does not exceed the limitation of paragraph (f) of this section when such option is exercised.
(f)
Options granted to certain stockholders.
(1) If, immediately before an option is granted, an individual owns (or is treated as owning) stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the corporation employing the optionee or of any related corporation of such corporation, then an option granted to such individual cannot qualify as an incentive stock option unless the option price is at least 110 percent of the stock's fair market value on the date of grant and such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of 5 years from the date of grant. For purposes of determining the minimum option price for purposes of this paragraph (f), the rules described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, relating to the good-faith determination of the option price, do not apply.
(2) For purposes of determining the stock ownership of the optionee, the stock attribution rules of § 1.424-1(d)
apply. Stock that the optionee may purchase under outstanding options is not treated as stock owned by the individual. The determination of the percentage of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the employer corporation (or of its related corporations) that is owned by the optionee is made with respect to each such corporation in the related group by comparing the voting power of the shares owned (or treated as owned) by the optionee to the aggregate voting power of all shares of each such corporation actually issued and outstanding immediately before the grant of the option to the optionee. The aggregate voting power of all shares actually issued and outstanding immediately before the grant of the option does not include the voting power of treasury shares or shares authorized for issue under outstanding options held by the individual or any other person.
(3)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) E, an employee of M Corporation, owns 15,000 shares of M Corporation common stock, which is the only class of stock outstanding. M has 100,000 shares of its common stock outstanding. On January 1, 2005, when the fair market value of M stock is $100, E is granted an option with an option price of $100 and an exercise period of 10 years from the date of grant.
(ii) Because E owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of M Corporation stock, M cannot grant an incentive stock option to E unless the option is granted at an option price of at least 110 percent of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option and the option, by its terms, expires no later than 5 years from its date of grant. The option granted to E fails to meet the option-price and term requirements described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and, thus, the option is not an incentive stock option.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1
, except that E's father and brother each owns 7,500 shares of M Corporation stock, and E owns no M stock in E's own name. Because under the attribution rules of § 1.424-1(d), E is treated as owning stock held by E's parents and siblings, M cannot grant an incentive stock option to E unless the option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option, and the option, by its terms, expires no later than 5 years from the date of grant.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1.
Assume further that M is a subsidiary of P Corporation. Regardless of whether E owns any P stock and the number of P shares outstanding, if P Corporation grants an option to E which purports to be an incentive stock option, but which fails to meet the 110-percent-option-price and 5-year-term requirements, the option is not an incentive stock option because E owns more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a related corporation of P Corporation (
i.e.
, M Corporation). An individual who owns (or is treated as owning) stock in excess of the ownership specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, in any corporation in a group of corporations consisting of the employer corporation and its related corporations, cannot be granted an incentive stock option by any corporation in the group unless such option meets the 110-percent-option-price and 5-year-term requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

# Example 3.
(i) F is an employee of R Corporation. R has only one class of stock, of which 100,000 shares are issued and outstanding. F owns no stock in R Corporation or any related corporation of R Corporation. On January 1, 2005, R grants a 10-year incentive stock option to F to purchase 50,000 shares of R stock at $3 per share, the fair market value of R stock on the date of grant of the option. On April 1, 2005, F exercises half of the January option and receives 25,000 shares of R stock that previously were not outstanding. On July 1, 2005, R grants a second 50,000 share option to F which purports to be an incentive stock option. The terms of the July option are identical to the terms of the January option, except that the option price is $3.25 per share, which is the fair market value of R stock on the date of grant of the July option.
(ii) Because F does not own more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of R Corporation or any related corporation on the date of the grant of the January option and the pricing requirements of paragraph (e) of this section are satisfied on the date of grant of such option, the unexercised portion of the January option remains an incentive stock option regardless of the changes in F's percentage of stock ownership in R after the date of grant. However, the July option is not an incentive stock option because, on the date that it is granted, F owns 20 percent (25,000 shares owned by F divided by 125,000 shares of R stock issued and outstanding) of the total combined voting power of all classes of R Corporation stock and, thus the pricing requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section are not met.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 3
except that the partial
exercise of the January incentive stock option on April 1, 2003, is for only 10,000 shares. Under these circumstances, the July option is an incentive stock option, because, on the date of grant of the July option, F does not own more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power (10,000 shares owned by F divided by 110,000 shares of R issued and outstanding) of all classes of R Corporation stock.

§ 1.422-3
Stockholder approval of incentive stock option plans.
This section addresses the stockholder approval of incentive stock option plans required by section 422(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. (Section 422 was added to the Code as section 422A by section 251 of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, and was redesignated as section 422 by section 11801 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.) The approval of stockholders must comply with all applicable provisions of the corporate charter, bylaws, and applicable State law prescribing the method and degree of stockholder approval required for the issuance of corporate stock or options. If the applicable State law does not prescribe a method and degree of stockholder approval in such cases an incentive stock option plan must be approved:
(a) By a majority of the votes cast at a duly held stockholders' meeting at which a quorum representing a majority of all outstanding voting stock is, either in person or by proxy, present and voting on the plan; or
(b) By a method and in a degree that would be treated as adequate under applicable State law in the case of an action requiring stockholder approval (i.e., an action on which stockholders would be entitled to vote if the action were taken at a duly held stockholders' meeting).
[T.D. 8374, 56 FR 61160, Dec. 2, 1991. Redesignated by T.D. 9144, 69 FR 46415, Aug. 3, 2004]
§ 1.422-4
$100,000 limitation for incentive stock options.
(a)
$100,000 per year limitation
—(1)
General rule.
An option that otherwise qualifies as an incentive stock option nevertheless fails to be an incentive stock option to the extent that the $100,000 limitation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is exceeded.
(2)
$100,000 per year limitation.
To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of stock with respect to which an incentive stock option (determined without regard to this section) is exercisable for the first time by any individual during any calendar year (under all plans of the employer corporation and related corporations) exceeds $100,000, such option is treated as a nonstatutory option. See § 1.83-7 for rules applicable to nonstatutory options.
(b)
Application.
To determine whether the limitation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section has been exceeded, the following rules apply:
(1) An option that does not meet the requirements of § 1.422-2 when granted (including an option which, when granted, contains terms providing that it will not be treated as an incentive stock option) is disregarded. See § 1.422-2(a)(4).
(2) The fair market value of stock is determined as of the date of grant of the option for such stock.
(3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, options are taken into account in the order in which they are granted.
(4) For purposes of this section, an option is considered to be first exercisable during a calendar year if the option will become exercisable at any time during the year assuming that any condition on the optionee's ability to exercise the option related to the performance of services is satisfied. If the optionee's ability to exercise the option in the year is subject to an acceleration provision, then the option is considered first exercisable in the calendar year in which the acceleration provision is triggered. After an acceleration provision is triggered, the options subject to such provision are then taken into account in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section for purposes of applying the limitation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to all options first exercisable during a calendar year. However, because an acceleration provision is not taken into account prior to its triggering, an incentive stock option that becomes exercisable for the first time during a
calendar year by operation of such a provision does not affect the application of the $100,000 limitation with respect to any option (or portion thereof) exercised prior to such acceleration. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), an acceleration provision includes, for example, a provision that accelerates the exercisability of an option on a change in ownership or control or a provision that conditions exercisability on the attainment of a performance goal. See paragraph (d),
Example 4
of this section.
(5)(i) An option (or portion thereof) is disregarded if, prior to the calendar year during which it would otherwise have become exercisable for the first time, the option (or portion thereof) is modified and thereafter ceases to be an incentive stock option described in § 1.422-2, is canceled, or is transferred in violation of § 1.421-1(b)(2).
(ii) If an option (or portion thereof) is modified, canceled, or transferred at any other time, such option (or portion thereof) is treated as outstanding according to its original terms until the end of the calendar year during which it would otherwise have become exercisable for the first time.
(6) A disqualifying disposition has no effect on the determination of whether an option exceeds the $100,000 limitation.
(c)
Bifurcation
—(1)
Options.
The application of the rules described in paragraph (b) of this section may result in an option being treated, in part, as an incentive stock option and, in part, as a nonstatutory option.
See
§ 1.83-7 for the treatment of nonstatutory options.
(2)
Stock.
A corporation may issue a separate certificate for incentive option stock or designate such stock as incentive stock option stock in the corporation's transfer records or plan records. In such a case, the issuance of separate certificates or designation in the corporation's transfer records or plan records is not a modification under § 1.424-1(e). In the absence of such an issuance or designation, shares are treated as first purchased under an incentive stock option to the extent of the $100,000 limitation, and the excess shares are treated as purchased under a nonstatutory option.
See
§ 1.83-7 for the treatment of nonstatutory options.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this section. In each of the following examples E is an employee of X Corporation. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. General rule.
Effective January 1, 2004, X Corporation adopts a plan under which incentive stock options may be granted to its employees. On January 1, 2004, and each succeeding January 1 through January 1, 2013, E is granted immediately exercisable options for X Corporation stock with a fair market value of $100,000 determined on the date of grant. The options qualify as incentive stock options (determined without regard to this section). On January 1, 2014, E exercises all of the options. Because the $100,000 limitation has not been exceeded during any calendar year, all of the options are treated as incentive stock options.

# Example 2. Order of grant.
X Corporation is a parent corporation of Y Corporation, which is a parent corporation of Z Corporation. Each corporation has adopted its own separate plan, under which an employee of any member of the corporate group may be granted options for stock of any member of the group. On January 1, 2004, X Corporation grants E an incentive stock option (determined without regard to this section) for stock of Y Corporation with a fair market value of $100,000 on the date of grant. On December 31, 2004, Y Corporation grants E an incentive stock option (determined without regard to this section) for stock of Z Corporation with a fair market value of $75,000 as of the date of grant. Both of the options are immediately exercisable. For purposes of this section, options are taken into account in the order in which granted using the fair market value of stock as of the date on the option is granted. During calendar year 2004, the aggregate fair market value of stock with respect to which E's options are exercisable for the first time exceeds $100,000. Therefore, the option for Y Corporation stock is treated as an incentive stock option, and the option for Z Corporation stock is treated as a nonstatutory option.

# Example 3. Acceleration provision.
(i) In 2004, X Corporation grants E three incentive stock options (determined without regard to this section) to acquire stock with an aggregate fair market value of $150,000 on the date of grant. The dates of grant, the fair market value of the stock (as of the applicable date of grant) with respect to which the options are exercisable, and the years in which the options are first exercisable (without regard to acceleration provisions) are as follows:
Date of grant
Fair market value of stock
First
exercisable
Option 1
April 1, 2004
$60,000
2004
Option 2
May 1, 2004
50,000
2006
Option 3
June 1, 2004
40,000
2004
(ii) In July of 2004, a change in control of X Corporation occurs, and, under the terms of its option plan, all outstanding options become immediately exercisable. Under the rules of this section, Option 1 is treated as an incentive stock option in its entirety; Option 2 exceeds the $100,000 aggregate fair market value limitation for calendar year 2004 by $10,000 (Option 1's $60,000 + Option 2's $50,000 = $110,000) and is, therefore, bifurcated into an incentive stock option for stock with a fair market value of $40,000 as of the date of grant and a nonstatutory option for stock with a fair market value of $10,000 as of the date of grant. Option 3 is treated as a nonstatutory option in its entirety.

# Example 4. Exercise of option and acceleration provision.
(i) In 2004, X Corporation grants E three incentive stock options (determined without regard to this section) to acquire stock with an aggregate fair market value of $120,000 on the date of grant. The dates of grant, the fair market value of the stock (as of the applicable date of grant) with respect to which the options are exercisable, and the years in which the options are first exercisable (without regard to acceleration provisions) are as follows:
Date of grant
Fair market value of stock
First
exercisable
Option 1
April 1, 2004
$60,000
2005
Option 2
May 1, 2004
40,000
2006
Option 3
June 1, 2004
20,000
2005
(ii) On June 1, 2005, E exercises Option 3. At the time of exercise of Option 3, the fair market value of X stock (at the time of grant) with respect to which options held by E are first exercisable in 2005 does not exceed $100,000. On September 1, 2005, a change of control of X Corporation occurs, and, under the terms of its option plan, Option 2 becomes immediately exercisable. Under the rules of this section, because E's exercise of Option 3 occurs before the change of control and the effects of an acceleration provision are not taken into account until it is triggered, Option 3 is treated as an incentive stock option in its entirety. Option 1 is treated as an incentive stock option in its entirety. Option 2 is bifurcated into an incentive stock option for stock with a fair market value of $20,000 on the date of grant and a nonstatutory option for stock with a fair market value of $20,000 on the date of grant because it exceeds the $100,000 limitation for 2003 by $20,000 (Option 1 for $60,000 + Option 3 for $20,000 + Option 2 for $40,000 = $120,000).
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 4
, except that the change of control occurs on May 1, 2005. Because options are taken into account in the order in which they are granted, Option 1 and Option 2 are treated as incentive stock options in their entirety. Because the exercise of Option 3 (on June 1, 2005) takes place after the acceleration provision is triggered, Option 3 is treated as a nonstatutory option in its entirety.

# Example 5. Cancellation of option.
(i) In 2004, X Corporation grants E three incentive stock options (determined without regard to this section) to acquire stock with an aggregate fair market value of $140,000 as of the date of grant. The dates of grant, the fair market value of the stock (as of the applicable date of grant) with respect to which the options are exercisable, and the years in which the options are first exercisable (without regard to acceleration provisions) are as follows:
Date of grant
Fair market value of stock
First
exercisable
Option 1
April 1, 2004
$60,000
2005
Option 2
May 1, 2004
40,000
2005
Option 3
June 1, 2004
40,000
2005
(ii) On December 31, 2004, Option 2 is canceled. Because Option 2 is canceled before the calendar year during which it would have become exercisable for the first time, it is disregarded. As a result, Option 1 and Option 3 are treated as incentive stock options in their entirety.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 5
, except that Option 2 is canceled on January 1, 2005. Because Option 2 is not canceled prior to the calendar year during which it would have become exercisable for the first time (2005), it is treated as an outstanding option for purposes of determining whether the $100,000 limitation for 2005 has been exceeded. Because options are taken into account in the order in which granted, Option 1 is treated as an incentive stock option in its entirety. Because Option 3 exceeds the $100,000 limitation by $40,000 (Option 1 for $60,000 + Option 2 for $40,000 + Option 3 for $40,000 = $140,000), it is treated as a nonstatutory option in its entirety.
(iv) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 5
, except that on January 1, 2005, E exercises Option 2 and immediately sells the stock in a disqualifying disposition. A disqualifying disposition has no effect on the determination of whether the underlying option is considered outstanding during the calendar year during which it is first exercisable. Because options are taken into account in the order in which granted, Option 1 is treated as an incentive stock option in its entirety. Because Option 3 exceeds the $100,000 limitation by $40,000 (Option 1 for $60,000 + Option 2 for $40,000 + Option 3 for
$40,000 = $140,000), it is treated as a nonstatutory option in its entirety.

# Example 6. Designation of stock.
On January 1, 2004, X grants E an immediately exercisable incentive stock option (determined without regard to this section) to acquire X stock with a fair market value of $150,000 on that date. Under the rules of this section, the option is bifurcated and treated as an incentive stock option for X stock with a fair market value of $100,000 and a nonstatutory option for X stock with a fair market value of $50,000. In these circumstances, X may designate the stock that is treated as stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an incentive stock option by issuing a separate certificate (or certificates) for $100,000 of stock and identifying such certificates as Incentive Stock Option Stock in its transfer records. In the absence of such a designation (or a designation in the corporation's transfer records or the plan records) shares with a fair market value of $100,000 are deemed purchased first under an incentive stock option, and shares with a fair market value of $50,000 are deemed purchased under a nonstatutory option.

§ 1.422-5
Permissible provisions.
(a)
General rule.
An option that otherwise qualifies as an incentive stock option does not fail to be an incentive stock option merely because such option contains one or more of the provisions described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
(b)
Cashless exercise.
(1) An option does not fail to be an incentive stock option merely because the optionee may exercise the option with previously acquired stock of the corporation that granted the option or stock of the corporation whose stock is being offered for purchase under the option. For special rules relating to the use of statutory option stock to pay the option price of an incentive stock option, see § 1.424-1(c)(3).
(2) All shares acquired through the exercise of an incentive stock option are individually subject to the holding period requirements described in § 1.422-1(a) and the disqualifying disposition rules of § 1.422-1(b), regardless of whether the option is exercised with previously acquired stock of the corporation that granted the option or stock of the corporation whose stock is being offered for purchase under the option. If an incentive stock option is exercised with such shares, and the exercise results in the basis allocation described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the optionee's disqualifying disposition of any of the stock acquired through such exercise is treated as a disqualifying disposition of the shares with the lowest basis.
(3) If the exercise of an incentive stock option with previously acquired shares is comprised in part of an exchange to which section 1036 (and so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036) applies, then:
(i) The optionee's basis in the incentive stock option shares received in the section 1036 exchange is the same as the optionee's basis in the shares surrendered in the exchange, increased, if applicable, by any amount included in gross income as compensation pursuant to sections 421 through 424 or section 83. Except for purposes of § 1.422-1(a), the holding period of the shares is determined under section 1223. For purposes of § 1.422-1 and sections 421(b) and 83 and the regulations thereunder, the amount paid for the shares purchased under the option is the fair market value of the shares surrendered on the date of the exchange.
(ii) The optionee's basis in the incentive stock option shares not received pursuant to the section 1036 exchange is zero. For all purposes, the holding period of such shares begins as of the date that such shares are transferred to the optionee. For purposes of § 1.422-1(b) and sections 421(b) and 83 and the regulations thereunder, the amount paid for the shares is considered to be zero.
(c)
Additional compensation.
An option does not fail to be an incentive stock option merely because the optionee has the right to receive additional compensation, in cash or property, when the option is exercised, provided such additional compensation is includible in income under section 61 or section 83. The amount of such additional compensation may be determined in any manner, including by reference to the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise or to the option price.
(d)
Option subject to a condition.
(1) An option does not fail to be an incentive stock option merely because the option is subject to a condition, or grants a
right, that is not inconsistent with the requirements of §§ 1.422-2 and 1.422-4.
(2) An option that includes an alternative right is not an incentive stock option if the requirements of § 1.422-2 are effectively avoided by the exercise of the alternative right. For example, an alternative right extending the option term beyond ten years, setting an option price below fair market value, or permitting transferability prevents an option from qualifying as an incentive stock option. If either of two options can be exercised, but not both, each such option is a disqualifying alternative right with respect to the other, even though one or both options would individually satisfy the requirements of §§ 1.422-2, 1.422-4, and this section.
(3) An alternative right to receive a taxable payment of cash and/or property in exchange for the cancellation or surrender of the option does not disqualify the option as an incentive stock option if the right is exercisable only when the then fair market value of the stock exceeds the exercise price of the option and the option is otherwise exercisable, the right is transferable only when the option is otherwise transferable, and the exercise of the right has economic and tax consequences no more favorable than the exercise of the option followed by an immediate sale of the stock. For this purpose, the exercise of the alternative right does not have the same economic and tax consequences if the payment exceeds the difference between the then fair market value of the stock and the exercise price of the option.
(e)
Examples.
The principles of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On June 1, 2004, X Corporation grants an incentive stock option to A, an employee of X Corporation, entitling A to purchase 100 shares of X Corporation common stock at $10 per share. The option provides that A may exercise the option with previously acquired shares of X Corporation common stock. X Corporation has only one class of common stock outstanding. Under the rules of section 83, the shares transferable to A through the exercise of the option are transferable and not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. On June 1, 2005, when the fair market value of an X Corporation share is $25, A uses 40 shares of X Corporation common stock, which A had purchased on the open market on June 1, 2002, for $5 per share, to pay the full option price. After exercising the option, A owns 100 shares of incentive stock option stock. Under section 1036 (and so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036), 40 of the shares have a $200 aggregate carryover basis (the $5 purchase price × 40 shares) and a three-year holding period for purposes of determining capital gain, and 60 of the shares have a zero basis and a holding period beginning on June 1, 2005, for purposes of determining capital gain. All 100 shares have a holding period beginning on June 1, 2005, for purposes of determining whether the holding period requirements of § 1.422-1(a) are met.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1.
Assume further that, on September 1, 2005, A sells 75 of the shares that A acquired through exercise of the incentive stock option for $30 per share. Because the holding period requirements were not satisfied, A made a disqualifying disposition of the 75 shares on September 1, 2005. Under the rules of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, A has sold all 60 of the non-section-1036 shares and 15 of the 40 section-1036 shares. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(3) of this section and section 83(a), the amount of compensation attributable to A's exercise of the option and subsequent disqualifying disposition of 75 shares is $1,500 (the difference between the fair market value of the stock on the date of transfer, $1,875 (75 shares at $25 per share), and the amount paid for the stock, $375 (60 shares at $0 per share plus 15 shares at $25 per share)). In addition, A must recognize a capital gain of $675, which consists of $375 ($450, the amount realized from the sale of 15 shares, less A's basis of $75) plus $300 ($1,800, the amount realized from the sale of 60 shares, less A's basis of $1,500 resulting from the inclusion of that amount in income as compensation). Accordingly, A must include in gross income for the taxable year in which the sale occurs $1,500 as compensation and $675 as capital gain. For its taxable year in which the disqualifying disposition occurs, if otherwise allowable under section 162 and if the requirements of § 1.83-6(a) are met, X Corporation is allowed a deduction of $1,500 for the compensation paid to A.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
, except that, instead of selling the 75 shares of incentive stock option stock on September 1, 2005, A uses those shares to exercise a second incentive stock option. The second option was granted to A by X Corporation on January 1, 2005, entitling A to purchase 100 shares of X Corporation common stock at $22.50 per share. As in
Example 2
, A has made a disqualifying disposition of the 75 shares of stock pursuant to § 1.424-1(c). Under paragraph (b) of this section, A has disposed of all 60 of the non-section-1036
shares and 15 of the 40 section-1036 shares. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section and section 83(a), the amount of compensation attributable to A's exercise of the first option and subsequent disqualifying disposition of 75 shares is $1,500 (the difference between the fair market value of the stock on the date of transfer, $1,875 (75 shares at $25 per share), and the amount paid for the stock, $375 (60 shares at $0 per share plus 15 shares at $25 per share)). Unlike
Example 2
, A does not recognize any capital gain as a result of exercising the second option because, for all purposes other than the determination of whether the exercise is a disposition pursuant to section 424(c), the exercise is considered an exchange to which section 1036 applies. Accordingly, A must include in gross income for the taxable year in which the disqualifying disposition occurs $1,500 as compensation. If the requirements of § 83(h) and § 1.83-6(a) are satisfied and the deduction is otherwise allowable under section 162, for its taxable year in which the disqualifying disposition occurs, X Corporation is allowed a deduction of $1,500 for the compensation paid to A. After exercising the second option, A owns a total of 125 shares of incentive stock option stock. Under section 1036 (and so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036), the 100 “new” shares of incentive stock option stock have the following bases and holding periods: 15 shares have a $75 carryover basis and a three-year-and-three-month holding period for purposes of determining capital gain, 60 shares have a $1,500 basis resulting from the inclusion of that amount in income as compensation and a three-month holding period for purposes of determining capital gain, and 25 shares have a zero basis and a holding period beginning on September 1, 2005, for purposes of determining capital gain. All 100 shares have a holding period beginning on September 1, 2005, for purposes of determining whether the holding period requirements of § 1.422-1(a) are met.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
, except that, instead of selling the 75 shares of incentive stock option stock on September 1, 2005, A uses those shares to exercise a nonstatutory option. The nonstatutory option was granted to A by X Corporation on January 1, 2005, entitling A to purchase 100 shares of X Corporation common stock at $22.50 per share. Unlike
Example 3
, A has not made a disqualifying disposition of the 75 shares of stock. After exercising the nonstatutory option, A owns a total of 100 shares of incentive stock option stock and 25 shares of nonstatutory stock option stock. Under section 1036 (and so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036), the 75 new shares of incentive stock option stock have the same basis and holding period as the 75 old shares used to exercise the nonstatutory option. The additional 25 shares of stock received upon exercise of the nonstatutory option are taxed under the rules of section 83(a). Accordingly, A must include in gross income for the taxable year in which the transfer of such shares occurs $750 (25 shares at $30 per share) as compensation. A's basis in such shares is the same as the amount included in gross income. For its taxable year in which the transfer occurs, X Corporation is allowed a deduction of $750 for the compensation paid to A to the extent the requirements of section 83(h) and § 1.83-6(a) are satisfied and the deduction is otherwise allowable under section 162.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts in
Example 1
, except that the shares transferred pursuant to the exercise of the incentive stock option are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not transferable (substantially nonvested) for a period of six months after such transfer. Assume further that the shares that A uses to exercise the incentive stock option are similarly restricted. Such shares were transferred to A on January 1, 2005, through A's exercise of a nonstatutory stock option which was granted to A on January 1, 2004. A paid $5 per share for the stock when its fair market value was $22.50 per share. A did not file a section 83(b) election to include the $700 spread (the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the stock on date of exercise of the nonstatutory option) in gross income as compensation. After exercising the incentive stock option with the 40 substantially-nonvested shares, A owns 100 shares of substantially-nonvested incentive stock option stock. Section 1036 (and so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036) applies to the 40 shares exchanged in exercise of the incentive stock option. However, pursuant to section 83(g), the stock received in such exchange, because it is incentive stock option stock, is not subject to restrictions and conditions substantially similar to those to which the stock given in such exchange was subject. For purposes of section 83(a) and § 1.83-1(b)(1), therefore, A has disposed of the 40 shares of substantially-nonvested stock on June 1, 2005, and must include in gross income as compensation $800 (the difference between the amount realized upon such disposition, $1,000, and the amount paid for the stock, $200). Accordingly, 40 shares of the incentive stock option stock have a $1,000 basis (the $200 original basis plus the $800 included in income as compensation) and 60 shares of the incentive stock option stock have a zero basis. For its taxable year in which the disposition of the substantially-nonvested stock occurs, X Corporation is allowed a deduction of $800 for the compensation paid to A, provided the requirements of section 83(h) and § 1.83-6(a) are satisfied and the deduction is otherwise allowable under section 162.

§ 1.423-2
Employee stock purchase plan defined.
(a)
In general
—(1) The term “employee stock purchase plan” means a plan that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section. If the terms of the plan do not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, then such requirements may be satisfied by the terms of an offering made under the plan. However, where the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section are satisfied by the terms of an offering, such requirements will be treated as satisfied only with respect to options exercised under that offering. One or more offerings may be made under an employee stock purchase plan. Offerings may be consecutive or overlapping, and the terms of each offering need not be identical provided the terms of the plan and the offering together satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section. The plan and the terms of an offering must be in writing or electronic form, provided that such writing or electronic form is adequate to establish the terms of the plan or offering, as applicable.
(2) To satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) and § 1.423-1, the plan must meet both of the following requirements—
(i) The plan must provide that options can be granted only to employees of the employer corporation or of a related corporation (as defined in paragraph (i) of § 1.421-1) to purchase stock in any such corporation (see paragraph (b) of this section); and
(ii) The plan must be approved by the stockholders of the granting corporation within 12 months before or after the date the plan is adopted (see paragraph (c) of this section).
(3) To satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) and § 1.423-1, the terms of the plan or offering must meet all of the following requirements—
(i) An employee cannot be granted an option if, immediately after the option is granted, the employee owns stock possessing 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the employer corporation or of a related corporation (see paragraph (d) of this section);
(ii) Options must be granted to all employees of any corporation whose employees are granted any options by reason of their employment by the corporation (see paragraph (e) of this section);
(iii) All employees granted options must have the same rights and privileges (see paragraph (f) of this section);
(iv) The option price cannot be less than the lesser of—
(A) An amount equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is granted, or
(B) An amount not less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is exercised (see paragraph (g) of this section).
(v) Options cannot be exercised after the expiration of—
(A) Five years from the date the option is granted if, under the terms of such plan, the option price cannot be less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is exercised, or
(B) Twenty-seven months from the date the option is granted, if the option price is not determined in the manner described in paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section (see paragraph (h) of this section).
(vi) No employee may be granted an option that permits the employee's rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the employer corporation and its related corporations to accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 of fair market value of the stock (determined at the time the option is granted) for each calendar year in which the option is outstanding at any time (see paragraph (i) of this section); and
(vii) Options are not transferable by the optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and are exercisable, during the lifetime of the optionee, only by the optionee (see paragraph (j) of this section).
(4) The determination of whether a particular option is an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan is made at the time the option is granted. If the terms of an option are inconsistent with the terms of the employee stock purchase plan or the offering under the plan pursuant to which the option is granted, the option will not be treated as granted under an employee stock purchase plan. If an option with terms that are inconsistent with the terms of the plan or an offering under the plan is granted to an employee who is entitled to the grant of an option under the terms of the plan or offering, and the employee is not granted an option under the offering that qualifies as an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan, the offering will not meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. Accordingly, none of the options granted under the offering will be eligible for the special tax treatment of section 421. However, if an option with terms that are inconsistent with the terms of the plan or an offering under the plan is granted to an individual who is not entitled to the grant of an option under the terms of the plan or offering, the option will not be treated as an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan but the grant of the option will not disqualify the options granted under the plan or offering. If, at the time of grant, an option qualifies as an option granted under an employee stock purchase
plan, but after the time of grant one or more of the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section is not satisfied with respect to the option, the option will not be treated as granted under an employee stock purchase plan but this failure to comply with the terms of the option will not disqualify the other options granted under the plan or offering.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraph (a):

# Example 1.
Corporation A operates an employee stock purchase plan under which options for A stock are granted to employees of A. The terms of an offering provide that the option price will be 90 percent of the fair market value of A stock on the date of exercise. A grants an option under the offering to Employee Z, an employee of A. The terms of the option provide that the option price will be 85 percent of the fair market value of A stock on the date of exercise. Because the terms of Z's option are inconsistent with the terms of the offering, the option granted to Z will not be treated as an option granted under the employee stock purchase plan. Further, unless Z is granted an option under the offering that qualifies as an option granted under the employee stock purchase plan, the offering will not meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section and none of the options granted under the offering will be eligible for the special tax treatment of section 421.

# Example 2.
Corporation B operates an employee stock purchase plan that provides that options for B stock may only be granted to employees of B. Under the terms of the plan, options may not be granted to consultants and other non-employees. B grants an option to Consultant Y, a consultant of B. Because Y is ineligible to receive an option under the plan because Y is not an employee, the grant of the option to Y is inconsistent with the terms of the plan and the option granted to Y will not be treated as an option granted under the employee stock purchase plan. However, the grant of the option to Y will not disqualify the options granted under the plan or any offering because Y was not entitled to the grant of an option under the plan.

# Example 3.
Corporation C operates an employee stock purchase plan under which options for C stock are granted to employees of C. C grants an option pursuant to an offering under the plan to Employee X, an employee of C who is a highly compensated employee. The terms of the employee stock purchase plan exclude highly compensated employees from participation in the plan. Because X is ineligible to receive an option under the plan by reason of X's exclusion from participation in the plan, the option granted to X will not be treated as an option granted under the employee stock purchase plan. However, the grant of the option to X will not disqualify the options granted under the plan or offering because X was not entitled to the grant of an option under the plan.

# Example 4.
Corporation D operates an employee stock purchase plan under which options for D stock are granted to employees of D. D grants an option pursuant to an offering under the plan to Employee W, an employee of D. The terms of the option provide that the option price will be 90 percent of the fair market value of D stock on the date of exercise. On the date of exercise, W pays only 85 percent of the fair market value of D stock. Because the terms of W's option are not satisfied, the option granted to W will not be treated as an option granted under the employee stock purchase plan. However, the failure to comply with the terms of the option granted to W will not disqualify the options granted under the plan or offering.
(b)
Options restricted to employees.
An employee stock purchase plan must provide that options can be granted only to employees of the employer corporation (or employees of its related corporations) to purchase stock in the employer corporation (or one of its related corporations). If such a provision is not included in the terms of the plan, the plan will not be an employee stock purchase plan and options granted under the plan will not qualify for the special tax treatment of section 421. For rules relating to the employment requirement, see § 1.421-1(h).
(c)
Stockholder approval
—(1) An employee stock purchase plan must be approved by the stockholders of the granting corporation within 12 months before or after the date such plan is adopted. The approval of the stockholders must comply with all applicable provisions of the corporate charter and bylaws and of applicable State law prescribing the method and degree of stockholder approval required for the issuance of corporate stock or options. If the applicable State law does not prescribe a method and degree of stockholder approval, then an employee stock purchase plan must be approved—
(i) By a majority of the votes cast at a duly held stockholder's meeting at which a quorum representing a majority of all outstanding voting stock is,
either in person or by proxy, present and voting on the plan; or
(ii) By a method and in a degree that would be treated as adequate under applicable State law in the case of an action requiring stockholder approval (such as, an action on which stockholders would be entitled to vote if the action were taken at a duly held stockholders' meeting).
(2) For purposes of the stockholder approval required by this paragraph (c), ordinarily, a plan is adopted when it is approved by the granting corporation's board of directors, and the date of the board's action is the reference point for determining whether stockholder approval occurs within the applicable 24-month period. However, if the board's action is subject to a condition (such as stockholder approval) or the happening of a particular event, the plan is adopted on the date the condition is met or the event occurs, unless the board's resolution fixes the date of adoption as the date of the board's action.
(3) An employee stock purchase plan, as adopted and approved, must designate the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan, and the corporations or class of corporations whose employees may be offered options under the plan. A plan that merely provides that the number of shares that may be issued under the plan may not exceed a stated percentage of the shares outstanding at the time of each offering or grant under the plan does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3). However, the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan may be stated in terms of a percentage of the authorized, issued, or outstanding shares on the date of the adoption of the plan. The plan may specify that the maximum aggregate number of shares available for grants under the plan may increase annually by a specified percentage of the authorized, issued, or outstanding shares on the date of the adoption of the plan. A plan that provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued as options under the plan may change based on any other specific circumstances satisfies the requirements of this paragraph only if the stockholders approve an immediately determinable maximum number of shares that may be issued under the plan in any event. If there is more than one employee stock purchase plan under which options may be granted and stockholders of the granting corporation merely approve a maximum aggregate number of shares that are available for issuance under the plans, the stockholder approval requirements described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are not satisfied. A separate maximum aggregate number of shares available for issuance pursuant to options must be specified and approved for each plan.
(4) Once an employee stock purchase plan is approved by the stockholders of the granting corporation, the plan need not be reapproved by the stockholders of the granting corporation unless the plan is amended or changed in a manner that is considered the adoption of a new plan, in which case the plan must be reapproved within the prescribed 24-month period. Any increase in the aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan (other than an increase merely reflecting a change in the number of outstanding shares, such as a stock dividend or stock split) will be considered the adoption of a new plan requiring stockholder approval within the prescribed 24-month period. Similarly, a change in the designation of corporations whose employees may be offered options under the plan will be considered the adoption of a new plan requiring stockholder approval within the prescribed 24-month period unless the plan provides that designations of participating corporations may be made from time to time from among a group consisting of the granting corporation and its related corporations. The group from among which such changes and designations are permitted without additional stockholder approval may include corporations having become parents or subsidiaries of the granting corporation after the adoption and approval of the plan. In addition, a change in the granting corporation or the stock available for purchase under the plan will be considered the adoption of a new plan requiring stockholder approval within the prescribed 24-month period. Any other
changes in the terms of an employee stock purchase plan are not considered the adoption of a new plan and, thus, do not require stockholder approval.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1.
(i) Corporation E is a subsidiary of Corporation F, a publicly traded corporation. On January 1, 2010, E adopts an employee stock purchase plan under which options for E stock are granted to E employees.
(ii) To meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the plan must be approved by the stockholders of E (in this case, F) within 12 months before or after January 1, 2010.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that the plan was approved by the stockholders of E (in this case, F) on March 1, 2010. On January 1, 2012, E changes the plan to provide that options for F stock will be granted to E employees under the plan. Because there is a change in the stock available for grant under the plan, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the change is considered the adoption of a new plan that must be approved by the stockholders of E (in this case, F) within 12 months before or after January 1, 2012.

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of
Example 1,
except that on March 15, 2011, F completely disposes of its interest in E. Thereafter, E continues to grant options for E stock to E employees under the plan.
(ii) The new E options are granted under a plan that meets the stockholder approval requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section without regard to whether E seeks approval of the plan from the stockholders of E after F disposes of its interest in E.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2,
except that under the plan as adopted on January 1, 2010, only options for F stock are granted to E employees. Assume further that, after F disposes of its interest in E, E changes the plan to provide for the grant of options for E stock to E employees. Because there is a change in the stock available for purchase or grant under the plan, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the stockholders of E must approve the plan within 12 months before or after the change to the plan to meet the stockholder approval requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

# Example 3.
(i) Corporation G maintains an employee stock purchase plan providing options for G stock. Corporation H does not maintain an employee stock purchase plan. On May 15, 2010, G and H consolidate under State law to form one corporation. The new corporation is named Corporation H. The consolidation agreement describes the G plan, including the maximum aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the plan after the consolidation. Additionally, the consolidation agreement states that the plan will be continued by H after the consolidation. The consolidation agreement is approved by the stockholders of G and H on May 1, 2010. H assumes the plan formerly maintained by G and continues to grant options under the plan to all eligible employees, but the options are for H stock.
(ii) Because there is a change in the granting corporation (from G to H) and the stock available for purchase, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, H is considered to have adopted a new plan. Because the plan is fully described in the consolidation agreement, including the maximum aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the plan, the approval of the consolidation agreement by the stockholders constitutes approval of the plan. Thus, the stockholder approval of the consolidation agreement satisfies the stockholder approval requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the plan is considered to be adopted by H and approved by its stockholders on May 1, 2010.

# Example 4.
Corporation I adopts an employee stock purchase plan on November 1, 2010. On that date, there are two million shares of I stock outstanding. The plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan may not exceed 15 percent of the number of shares of I stock outstanding on November 1, 2010. Because the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan is designated in the plan, the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section are met.

# Example 5.
(i) Corporation J adopts an employee stock purchase plan on March 15, 2010. The plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares of J stock available for issuance under the plan is 50,000, increased on each anniversary date of the adoption of the plan by 5 percent of the then outstanding shares. Because the maximum aggregate number of shares is not designated under the plan, the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not met.
(ii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 5,
except that the plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares available under the plan is the lesser of (a) 50,000 shares, increased each anniversary date of the adoption of the plan by 5 percent of the then-outstanding shares, or (b) 200,000 shares. Because the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan is designated as the lesser of two numbers, one of which provides an immediately determinable maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the plan in any event, the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section are met.
(d)
Options granted to certain shareholders
—(1) An employee stock purchase plan or offering must, by its terms, provide that an employee cannot be granted an option if the employee, immediately after the option is granted, owns stock possessing 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the employer corporation or a related corporation. In determining whether the stock ownership of an employee equals or exceeds this 5 percent limit, the rules of section 424(d) (relating to attribution of stock ownership) shall apply, and stock that the employee may purchase under outstanding options (whether or not the options qualify for the special tax treatment afforded by section 421(a)) shall be treated as stock owned by the employee. An option is outstanding for purposes of this paragraph (d) although under its terms it may be exercised only in installments or after the expiration of a fixed period of time. If an option is granted to an employee whose stock ownership (as determined under this paragraph (d)) exceeds the limitation set forth in this paragraph (d), no portion of the option will be treated as having been granted under an employee stock purchase plan.
(2) The determination of the percentage of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the employer corporation (or a related corporation) that is owned by the employee is made by comparing the voting power or value of the shares owned (or treated as owned) by the employee to the aggregate voting power or value of all shares actually issued and outstanding immediately after the grant of the option to the employee. The aggregate voting power or value of all shares actually issued and outstanding immediately after the grant of the option does not include the voting power or value of treasury shares or shares authorized for issue under outstanding options held by the employee or any other person.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d):

# Example 1.
Employee V, an employee of Corporation K, owns 6,000 shares of K common stock, the only class of K stock outstanding. K has 100,000 shares of its common stock outstanding. Because V owns 6 percent of the combined voting power or value of all classes of K stock, K cannot grant an option to V under K's employee stock purchase plan. If V's father and brother each owned 3,000 shares of K stock and V did not own any K stock, then the result would be the same because, under section 424(d), an individual is treated as owning stock held by the person's father and brother. Similarly, the result would be the same if, instead of actually owning 6,000 shares, V merely held an option on 6,000 shares of K stock, irrespective of whether the transfer of stock under the option could qualify for the special tax treatment of section 421, because this paragraph (d) provides that stock the employee may purchase under outstanding options is treated as stock owned by such employee.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that K is a 50 percent subsidiary corporation of Corporation L. Irrespective of whether V owns any L stock, V cannot receive an option from L under L's employee stock purchase plan because he owns 5 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a subsidiary of L, in this example, K. An employee who owns (or is treated as owning) stock in excess of the limitation of this paragraph (d), in any corporation in a group of related corporations, consisting of a parent and its subsidiary corporations, cannot receive an option under an employee stock purchase plan from any corporation in the group.

# Example 3.
Employee U is an employee of Corporation M. M has only one class of stock, of which 100,000 shares are issued and outstanding. Assuming U does not own (and is not treated as owning) any stock in M or in any related corporation of M, M may grant an option to U under its employee stock purchase plan for 4,999 shares, because immediately after the grant of the option, U would not own 5 percent or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of M stock actually issued and outstanding at such time. The 4,999 shares that U would be treated as owning under this paragraph (d) would not be added to the 100,000 shares actually issued and outstanding immediately after the grant for purposes of determining whether U's stock ownership exceeds the limitation of this paragraph (d).

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3
but instead of an option for 4,999 shares, M grants U an option, purportedly under its employee stock purchase plan, for 5,000 shares. No portion of this option will be treated as granted under an employee stock purchase plan because U's stock ownership exceeds the limitation of this paragraph (d).
(e)
Employees covered by plan
—(1) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph (e) and the limitations of paragraphs
(d), (f) and (i) of this section, an employee stock purchase plan or offering must, by its terms, provide that options are to be granted to all employees of any corporation whose employees are granted any of such options by reason of their employment by that corporation, except that one or more of the following categories of employees may be excluded from the coverage of the plan or offering—
(i) Employees who have been employed less than two years;
(ii) Employees whose customary employment is 20 hours or less per week;
(iii) Employees whose customary employment is for not more than five months in any calendar year; and
(iv) Highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)).
(2) A plan or offering does not fail to satisfy the coverage provision of paragraph (e)(1) of this section in the following circumstances—
(i) The plan or offering excludes employees who have completed a shorter period of service or whose customary employment is for fewer hours per week or fewer months in a calendar year than is specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this section, provided the exclusion is applied in an identical manner to all employees of every corporation whose employees are granted options under the plan or offering.
(ii) The plan or offering excludes highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)) with compensation above a certain level or who are officers or subject to the disclosure requirements of section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided the exclusion is applied in an identical manner to all highly compensated employees of every corporation whose employees are granted options under the plan or offering.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, employees who are citizens or residents of a foreign jurisdiction (without regard to whether they are also citizens of the United States or resident aliens (within the meaning of section 7701(b)(1)(A))) may be excluded from the coverage of an employee stock purchase plan or offering under the following circumstances—
(i) The grant of an option under the plan or offering to a citizen or resident of the foreign jurisdiction is prohibited under the laws of such jurisdiction; or
(ii) Compliance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction would cause the plan or offering to violate the requirements of section 423.
(4) No option granted under a plan or offering that excludes from participation any employees, other than those who may be excluded under this paragraph (e), and those barred from participation by reason of paragraphs (d), (f) and (i) of this section, can be regarded as having been granted under an employee stock purchase plan. If an option is not granted to any employee who is entitled to the grant of an option under the terms of the plan or offering, none of the options granted under such offering will be treated as having been granted under an employee stock purchase plan. However, a plan that, by its terms, permits all eligible employees to elect to participate in an offering will not violate the requirements of this paragraph solely because eligible employees who elect not to participate in the offering are not granted options pursuant to such offering.
(5) For purposes of this paragraph (e), the existence of the employment relationship between an individual and the corporation participating under the plan will be determined under § 1.421-1(h).
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1.
Corporation N has a stock purchase plan that meets all the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section except that options are not required to be granted to employees whose weekly rate of pay is less than $1,000. As a matter of corporate practice, however, N grants options under its plan to all employees, irrespective of their weekly rate of pay. Even though N's plan is operated in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (e), N's plan is not an employee stock purchase plan because the terms of the plan exclude a category of employees that is not permitted under this paragraph (e).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the first offering under N's plan provides that options will be granted to all employees of N. The terms of the first offering will be treated as part of the
terms of N's plan, but only for purposes of the first offering. Because the terms of the first offering satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (e), stock transferred pursuant to options exercised under the first offering will be treated as stock transferred pursuant to the exercise of options granted under an employee stock purchase plan for purposes of section 421.

# Example 3.
Corporation O has a stock purchase plan that excludes from participation all employees who have been employed less than one year. Assuming all other requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section are satisfied, O's plan qualifies as an employee stock purchase plan under section 423.

# Example 4.
Corporation P has a stock purchase plan that excludes from participation clerical employees who have been employed less than two years. However, non-clerical employees with less than two years of service are permitted to participate in the plan. P's plan is not an employee stock purchase plan because the exclusion of employees who have been employed less than two years applies only to certain employees of P and is not applied in an identical manner to all employees of P. If, instead, P's plan excludes from participation all employees (both clerical and non-clerical) who have been employed less than two years, then P's plan would qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under section 423 assuming all other requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section are satisfied.

# Example 5.
Corporation Q has a stock purchase plan that excludes from participation all officers who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)). Assuming all other requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section are satisfied, Q's plan qualifies as an employee stock purchase plan under section 423.

# Example 6.
Corporation R maintains an employee stock purchase plan that excludes from participation all highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)), except highly compensated employees who are officers of R. R's plan is not an employee stock purchase plan because the exclusion of all highly compensated employees except highly compensated employees who are officers of R is not a permissible exclusion under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.

# Example 7.
Corporation S is the parent corporation of Subsidiary YY and Subsidiary ZZ. S maintains an employee stock purchase plan with both YY and ZZ participating in the same offering under the plan. Under the terms of the offering under the plan, all employees of YY and ZZ are permitted to participate in the plan with the exception of ZZ's highly compensated employees with annual compensation greater than $300,000. None of the options granted under the offering will be considered granted under an employee stock purchase plan because the exclusion of highly compensated employees with annual compensation greater than $300,000 is not applied in an identical manner to all employees of YY and ZZ granted options in the same offering.

# Example 8.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 7,
except that Corporation S establishes separate offerings under the plan for YY and ZZ. Under the terms of the separate offering for YY, all employees of YY are permitted to participate in the plan. Under the terms of the separate offering established for ZZ, all employees of ZZ are permitted to participate in the plan with the exception of ZZ's highly compensated employees with annual compensation greater than $300,000. The options granted under the separate offering for YY will be considered granted under an employee stock purchase plan. Further, the options granted under the separate offering for ZZ will be considered granted under an employee stock purchase plan because the exclusion of highly compensated employees with annual compensation greater than $300,000 is applied in an identical manner to all employees of ZZ granted options in the same offering.

# Example 9.
The laws of Country A require that options granted to residents of Country A be transferable during the lifetime of the option recipient. Corporation T has a stock purchase plan that excludes residents of Country A from participation in the plan. Because compliance with the laws of Country A would cause options granted to residents of Country A to violate paragraph (j) of this section, T may exclude residents of Country A from participation in the plan. Assuming all other requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section are satisfied, T's plan qualifies as an employee stock purchase plan under section 423.
(f)
Equal rights and privileges
—(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(6) of this section, an employee stock purchase plan or offering must, by its terms, provide that all employees granted options under the plan or offering shall have the same rights and privileges. Thus, the provisions applying to one option under an offering (such as the provisions relating to the method of payment for the stock and the determination of the purchase price per share) must apply to all other options under the offering in the same manner. If all the options granted under a plan or offering do not, by their terms, give the respective optionees the same rights and privileges, none of the options will be treated as having been granted
under an employee stock purchase plan for purposes of section 421.
(2) The requirements of this paragraph (f) do not prevent the maximum amount of stock that an employee may purchase from being determined on the basis of a uniform relationship to the total compensation, or the basic or regular rate of compensation, of all employees.
(3) A plan or offering will not fail to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (f) because the plan or offering provides that no employee may purchase more than a maximum amount of stock fixed under the plan or offering.
(4) A plan or offering will not fail to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (f) if, in order to comply with the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, the terms of an option granted under a plan or offering to citizens or residents of such foreign jurisdiction (without regard to whether they are also citizens of the United States or resident aliens (within the meaning of section 7701(b)(1)(A))) are less favorable than the terms of options granted under the same plan or offering to employees resident in the United States.
(5)(i) Except as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section, a plan or offering permitting one or more employees to carry forward amounts that were withheld but not applied toward the purchase of stock under an earlier plan or offering and apply the amounts towards the purchase of additional stock under a subsequent plan or offering will be a violation of the equal rights and privileges under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. However, the carry forward of amounts withheld but not applied toward the purchase of stock under an earlier plan or offering will not violate the equal rights and privileges requirement of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, if all other employees participating in the current plan or offering are permitted to make direct payments toward the purchase of shares under a subsequent plan or offering in an amount equal to the excess of the greatest amount which any employee is allowed to carry forward from an earlier plan or offering over the amount, if any, the employee will carry forward from an earlier plan or offering.
(ii) A plan or offering will not fail to satisfy the requirements of this section merely because employees are permitted to carry forward amounts representing a fractional share, that were withheld but not applied toward the purchase of stock under an earlier plan or offering and apply the amounts toward the purchase of additional stock under a subsequent plan or offering.
(6) Paragraph (f) does not prohibit the delaying of the grant of an option to any employee who is barred from being granted an option solely by reason of the employee's failing to meet a minimum service requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section until the employee meets such requirement.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (f):

# Example 1.
Corporation U has an employee stock purchase plan that provides that the maximum amount of stock that each employee may purchase under the offering is one share for each $100 of annual gross pay. The plan meets the requirements of this paragraph (f).

# Example 2.
Corporation V has an employee stock purchase plan that provides that the maximum amount of stock that each employee may purchase under the offering is one share for each $100 of annual gross pay up to and including $10,000, and two shares for each $100 of annual gross pay in excess of $10,000. The plan will not meet the requirements of this paragraph (f) because the amount of stock that may be purchased under the plan is not based on a uniform relationship to the total compensation of all employees.

# Example 3.
Corporation W has an employee stock purchase plan that provides that options to purchase stock in an amount equal to ten percent of an employee's annual salary at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value on the first day of the offering will be granted to all employees other than those who have been employed less than 18 months. In addition, the plan provides that employees who have not yet met the minimum service requirements on the first day of the offering will be granted similar options on the date the 18 month service requirement has been attained. The plan meets the requirements of this paragraph (f).

# Example 4.
Corporation X is the parent corporation of Subsidiary AA, Subsidiary BB and Subsidiary CC. X maintains an employee stock purchase plan with AA, BB and CC participating in the same offering under the
plan. Under the terms of the offering under the plan, options to purchase stock at a price equal to 90 percent of the fair market value at the time the option is exercised will be granted to all employees. Certain employees of AA are residents of Country B. The laws of Country B provide that options granted to employees who are residents of Country B must have a purchase price not less than 95 percent of the fair market value at the time the option is exercised. The plan will not fail to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (f) merely because the residents of Country B are granted options under the plan to purchase stock at a price equal to 95 percent of the fair market value at the time the option is exercised.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 4,
except that Corporation X establishes two separate offerings under the plan: A separate offering for the employees of AA and a separate offering for the employees of BB and CC. Under the separate offering for the employees of BB and CC, options are granted to all employees with an exercise price equal to 90 percent of the fair market value at the time the option is exercised. Under the separate offering for the employees of AA, options are granted to all employees with an exercise price equal to 95 percent of the fair market value at the time the option is exercised. The plan does not violate the equal rights and privileges requirement of this paragraph (f) merely because the exercise price of options granted under one offering is less than the exercise price of options granted under a separate offering.

# Example 6.
Corporation Y maintains an employee stock purchase plan. Employee T is employed by Y. T is granted an option under the current offering to purchase a maximum of 100 shares of Y stock at an option price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at exercise. The plan permits the carry forward of withheld but unused amounts from an earlier offering. Prior to the exercise date, $2000 of T's salary has been withheld and is available to be applied toward the purchase of Y stock. On the exercise date, the fair market value of Y stock is $20 per share. T is able to purchase 100 shares of Y stock at $17 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1700. T can carry forward $300 to the subsequent offering. Each employee in the subsequent offering other than T will be permitted to make direct payments toward the purchase of shares under the subsequent offering in a maximum amount of $300 less any amount the employee has carried forward from an earlier offering. The plan does not violate the equal rights and privileges requirement of this paragraph (f).
(g)
Option price
—(1) An employee stock purchase plan or offering must, by its terms, provide that the option price will not be less than the lesser of—
(i) An amount equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is granted, or
(ii) An amount that under the terms of the option may not be less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is exercised.
(2) For purposes of determining the option price, the fair market value of the stock may be determined in any reasonable manner, including the valuation methods permitted under § 20.2031-2. However, the option price must meet the minimum pricing requirements of this paragraph (g). For general rules relating to the option price, see § 1.421-1(e). For rules relating to the determination of when an option is granted,
see
§§ 1.421-1(c) and 1.423-2(h)(2). Any option that does not meet the minimum pricing requirements of this paragraph (g) will not be treated as an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan irrespective of whether the plan or offering satisfies those requirements. If an option that does not meet the minimum pricing requirements is granted to an employee who is entitled to the grant of an option under the terms of the plan or offering, and the employee is not granted an option under such offering that qualifies as an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan, the offering will not meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. Accordingly, none of the options granted under the offering will be eligible for the special tax treatment of section 421.
(3) The option price may be stated either as a percentage or as a dollar amount. If the option price is stated as a dollar amount, then the requirement of this paragraph (g) can only be met by a plan or offering in which the price is fixed at not less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is granted. If the fixed price is less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at grant, then the option cannot meet the requirement of this paragraph (g) even if a decline in the fair market value of the stock results in such fixed price being not less than 85 percent of the
fair market value of the stock at the time the option is exercised, because that result was not certain to occur under the terms of the option.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (g):

# Example 1.
Corporation Z has an employee stock purchase plan that provides that the option price will be 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock on the first day of the offering (which is the date of grant in this case), or 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at exercise, whichever amount is the lesser. Upon the exercise of an option issued under Z's plan, Z agrees to accept an option price that is less than the minimum amount allowable under the terms of such plan. Notwithstanding that the option was issued under an employee stock purchase plan, the transfer of stock pursuant to the exercise of such option does not satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (g) and cannot qualify for the special tax treatment of section 421.

# Example 2.
Corporation AA has an employee stock purchase plan that provides that the option price is set at 85 percent of the fair market value of AA stock at exercise, but not less than $80 per share. On the first day of the offering (which is the date of grant in this case), the fair market value of AA stock is $100 per share. The option satisfies the requirement of this paragraph (g), and can qualify for the special tax treatment of section 421.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2,
except that the option price is set at 85 percent of the fair market value of AA stock at exercise, but not more than $80 per share. This option cannot satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (g) irrespective of whether, at the time the option is exercised, 85 percent of the fair market value of AA stock is $80 or less.
(h)
Option period
—(1) An employee stock purchase plan or offering must, by its terms, provide that options granted under the plan cannot be exercised after the expiration of 27 months from the date of grant unless, under the terms of the plan or offering, the option price is not less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time of the exercise of the option. If the option price is not less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is exercised, then the option period provided under the plan must not exceed five years from the date of grant. If the requirements of this paragraph (h) are not met by the terms of the plan or offering, then options issued under such plan or offering will not be treated as options granted under an employee stock purchase plan irrespective of whether the options, by their terms, are exercisable beyond the period allowable under this paragraph (h). An option that provides that the option price is not less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at exercise may have an option period of 5 years irrespective of whether the fair market value of the stock at exercise is more or less than the fair market value of the stock at grant. However, if the option provides that the option price is 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at exercise, but not more than some other fixed amount determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, then irrespective of the price paid on exercise, the option period must not be more than 27 months.
(2) Section 1.421-1(c) provides that, for purposes of §§ 1.421-1 through 1.424-1, the language “the date of the granting of the option” and the “time such option is granted,” and similar phrases refer to the date or time when the granting corporation completes the corporate action constituting an offer of stock for sale to an individual under the terms and conditions of a statutory option. With respect to options granted under an employee stock purchase plan, the principles of § 1.421-1(c) shall be applied without regard to the requirement that the minimum option price must be fixed or determinable in order for the corporate action constituting an offer of stock to be considered complete.
(3) The date of grant will be the first day of an offering if the terms of an employee stock purchase plan or offering designate a maximum number of shares that may be purchased by each employee during the offering. Similarly, the date of grant will be the first day of an offering if the terms of the plan or offering require the application of a formula to establish, on the first day of the offering, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by each employee during the offering. It is not required that an employee stock purchase plan or offering designate a
maximum number of shares that may be purchased by each employee during the offering or incorporate a formula to establish a maximum number of shares that may be purchased by each employee during the offering. If the maximum number of shares that can be purchased under an option is not fixed or determinable until the date the option is exercised, then the date of exercise will be the date of grant of the option.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (h):

# Example 1.
(i) Corporation BB has an employee stock purchase plan that provides that the option price will be the lesser of 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock on the first day of an offering or 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of the offering. Options are exercised on the last day of the offering. One million shares of BB stock are reserved for issuance under the plan. The plan provides that no employee may be permitted to purchase stock under the plan at a rate that exceeds $25,000 in fair market value of the BB stock (determined on the date of grant) for each calendar year during which an option granted to the employee is outstanding. The terms of each option granted under an offering provide that a maximum of 500 shares may be purchased by the option recipient during the offering. Because the maximum number of shares that can be purchased under the option is fixed and determinable on the first day of the offering, the date of grant for the option is the first day of the offering.
(ii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of
Example 1,
except that BB's plan excludes all employees who have been employed less than 18 months. The plan provides that employees who have not yet met the minimum service requirements on the first day of an offering will be granted an option on the date the 18-month service requirement has been attained. With respect to those employees who have been employed less than 18 months on the first day of an offering, the date of grant for the option is the date the 18-month service requirement has been attained.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of
Example 1,
except that the terms of each option granted do not provide that a maximum of 500 shares may be purchased by the option recipient during the offering. Notwithstanding the fixed number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan and the $25,000 limitation set forth in the plan, the maximum number of shares that can be purchased under the option is not fixed or determinable until the last day of the offering when the option is exercised. Therefore the date of grant for the option is the last day of the offering when the option is exercised.

# Example 3.
Corporation CC has an employee stock purchase plan that provides that the option price will be 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of the offering. Options are exercised on the last day of the offering. Each offering under the plan begins on January 1 and ends on December 31 of the same calendar year. The terms of each option granted under an offering provide that the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by any employee during the offering equals $25,000 divided by the fair market value of the stock on the first day of the offering. The maximum number of shares that can be purchased under the option is fixed and determinable on the first day of the offering and therefore the date of grant for the option is the first day of the offering.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3
except that the terms of each option granted under an offering provide that the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by any employee during the offering equals 10 percent of the employee's annual salary (determined as of January 1 of the year in which the offering commences) divided by the fair market value of the stock on the first day of the offering. The maximum number of shares that can be purchased under the option is fixed and determinable on the first day of the offering and therefore the date of grant for the option is the first day of the offering.
(i)
Annual $25,000 limitation
—(1) An employee stock purchase plan or offering must, by its terms, provide that no employee may be permitted to purchase stock under all the employee stock purchase plans of the employer corporation and its related corporations at a rate that exceeds $25,000 in fair market value of the stock (determined at the time the option is granted) for each calendar year in which any option granted to the employee is outstanding at any time. In applying the foregoing limitation—
(i) The right to purchase stock under an option accrues when the option (or any portion thereof) first becomes exercisable during the calendar year;
(ii) The right to purchase stock under an option accrues at the rate provided in the option, but in no case may such rate exceed $25,000 of fair market value of such stock (determined at the time
such option is granted) for any one calendar year; and
(iii) A right to purchase stock that has accrued under one option granted pursuant to the plan may not be carried over to any other option.
(2) If an option is granted under an employee stock purchase plan that satisfies the requirement of this paragraph (i), but the option gives the optionee the right to buy stock in excess of the maximum rate allowable under this paragraph (i), then no portion of the option will be treated as having been granted under an employee stock purchase plan. Furthermore, if the option was granted to an employee entitled to the grant of an option under the terms of the plan or offering, and the employee is not granted an option under the offering that qualifies as an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan, then the offering will not meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. Accordingly, none of the options granted under the offering will be eligible for the special tax treatment of section 421.
(3) The limitation of this paragraph (i) applies only to options granted under employee stock purchase plans and does not limit the amount of stock that an employee may purchase under incentive stock options (as defined in section 422(b)) or any other stock options except those to which section 423 applies. Stock purchased under options to which section 423 does not apply will not limit the amount that an employee may purchase under an employee stock purchase plan, except for purposes of the 5-percent stock ownership provision of paragraph (d) of this section.
(4) Under the limitation of this paragraph (i), an employee may purchase up to $25,000 of stock (based on the fair market value of the stock at the time the option was granted) in each calendar year during which an option granted to the employee under an employee stock purchase plan is outstanding. Alternatively, an employee may purchase more than $25,000 of stock (based on the fair market value of such stock at the time the option was granted) in a calendar year, so long as the total amount of stock that the employee purchases does not exceed $25,000 in fair market value of the stock (determined at the time the option was granted) for each calendar year in which any option was outstanding. If, in any calendar year, the employee holds two or more outstanding options granted under employee stock purchase plans of the employer corporation, or a related corporation, then the employee's purchases of stock attributable to that year under all options granted under employee stock purchase plans must not exceed $25,000 in fair market value of the stock (determined at the time the options were granted). Under an employee stock purchase plan, an employee may not purchase stock in anticipation that the option will be outstanding in some future year. Thus, the employee may purchase only the amount of stock that does not exceed the limitation of this paragraph (i) for the year of the purchase and for preceding years during which the option was outstanding. Thus, the amount of stock that may be purchased under an option depends on the number of years in which the option is actually outstanding. The amount of stock that may be purchased under an employee stock purchase plan may not be increased by reason of the failure to grant an option in an earlier year under such plan, or by reason of the failure to exercise an earlier option. For example, if an option is granted to an individual and expires without having been exercised at all, then the failure to exercise the option does not increase the amount of stock which such individual may be permitted to purchase under an option granted in a year following the year of such expiration. If an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan is outstanding in more than one calendar year, then stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of such an option will be applied first, to the extent allowable under this paragraph (i), against the $25,000 limitation for the earliest year in which the option was outstanding, then, against the $25,000 limitation for each succeeding year, in order.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (i):

# Example 1.
Assume that Corporation DD maintains an employee stock purchase plan
and that Employee S is employed by DD. On June 1, 2010, DD grants S an option under the plan to purchase a total of 750 shares of DD stock at $85 per share. On that date, the fair market value of DD stock is $100 per share. The option provides that it may be exercised at any time but cannot be exercised after May 31, 2012. Under this paragraph (i), the option must not permit S to purchase more than 250 shares of DD stock during the calendar year 2010, because 250 shares are equal to $25,000 in fair market value of DD stock determined at the time of grant. During the calendar year 2011, S may purchase under the option an amount of DD stock equal to the difference between $50,000 in fair market value of DD stock (determined at the time the option was granted) and the fair market value of DD stock (determined at the time of grant of the option) purchased during the year 2010. During the calendar year 2012, S may purchase an amount of DD stock equal to the difference between $75,000 in fair market value of the stock (determined at the time of grant of the option) and the total amount of the fair market value of the stock (determined at the time of grant of the option) purchased under the option during the calendar years 2010 and 2011. S may purchase $25,000 of stock for the year 2010, and $25,000 of stock for the year 2012, although the option was outstanding for only a part of each of such years. However, S may not be granted another option under an employee stock purchase plan of DD or a related corporation to purchase stock of DD or a related corporation during the calendar years 2010, 2011, and 2012, so long as the option granted June 1, 2010, is outstanding.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the option granted to S in 2010 is terminated in 2011 without any part of the option having been exercised, and that subsequent to the termination and during 2011, S is granted another option under DD's employee stock purchase plan. Under that option, S may be permitted to purchase $25,000 of stock for 2011. The failure of S to exercise the option granted to S in 2010, does not increase the amount of stock that S may be permitted to purchase under the option granted to S in 2011.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that, on May 31, 2012, S exercised the option granted to S in 2010, and purchased 600 shares of DD stock. Five hundred shares, the maximum amount of stock that could have been purchased in 2011, under the option, are treated as having been purchased for the years 2010 and 2011. Only 100 shares of the stock are treated as having been purchased for 2012. After S's exercise of the option on May 31, 2012, S is granted another option under DD's employee stock purchase plan. S may be permitted under the new option to purchase for 2012 stock having a fair market value of no more than $15,000 at the time the new option is granted.

# Example 4.
Corporation EE maintains an employee stock purchase plan and Employee R is employed by EE. On August 1, 2010, EE grants R an option under the plan to purchase 150 shares of EE stock at $85 per share during each of the calendar years 2010, 2011, and 2012. On that date, the fair market value of EE stock is $100 per share. The option provides that it may be exercised at any time during years 2010, 2011, and 2012. Because this option permits R to purchase only $15,000 of EE's stock for each year the option is outstanding, R could be granted another option by EE, or by a related corporation, in year 2010, permitting R to purchase an additional $10,000 of stock during each of the calendar years 2010, 2011, and 2012.

# Example 5.
Corporation FF maintains an employee stock purchase plan and Employee Q is employed by FF. On September 1, 2010, FF grants Q an option under the plan that will be automatically exercised on August 31, 2011, and August 31, 2012. The terms of the option provide that no more than 150 shares may be purchased on each date that the option is automatically exercised. On August 31, 2011, Q may purchase under the option an amount of FF stock equal to $50,000 in fair market value of FF stock (determined at the time the option was granted). On August 31, 2012, Q may purchase under the option an amount of FF stock equal to the difference between $75,000 in fair market value of FF stock (determined at the time the option was granted) and the fair market value of FF stock (determined at the time of grant of the option) purchased during year 2011.
(j)
Restriction on transferability.
An employee stock purchase plan or offering must, by its terms, provide that options granted under the plan are not transferable by the optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and must be exercisable, during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee. For general rules relating to the restriction on transferability required by this paragraph (j),
see
§ 1.421-1(b)(2). For a limited exception to the requirement of this paragraph (j), see section 424(h)(3).
(k)
Special rule where option price is between 85 percent and 100 percent of value of stock
—(1)(i) If all the conditions necessary for the application of section 421(a) exist, this paragraph (k) provides additional rules that are applicable in cases where, at the time the option is granted, the option price per share is less than 100 percent (but not less than 85 percent) of the fair market
value of the share. In that case, upon the disposition of the share by the employee after the expiration of the two-year and the one-year holding periods, or upon the employee's death while owning the share (whether occurring before or after the expiration of such periods), there shall be included in the employee's gross income as compensation (and not as gain upon the sale or exchange of a capital asset) the lesser of—
(A) The amount, if any, by which the price paid under the option was exceeded by the fair market value of the share at the time the option was granted, or
(B) The amount, if any, by which the price paid under the option was exceeded by the fair market value of the share at the time of such disposition or death.
(ii) For purposes of applying the rules of this paragraph (k), if the option price is not fixed or determinable at the time the option is granted, the option price will be computed as if the option had been exercised at such time. The amount of compensation resulting from the application of this paragraph (k) shall be included in the employee's gross income for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs, or for the taxable year closing with the employee's death, whichever event results in the application of this paragraph (k).
(iii) The application of the special rules provided in this paragraph (k) shall not affect the rules provided in section 421(a) with respect to the employee exercising the option, the employer corporation, or a related corporation. Thus, notwithstanding the inclusion of an amount as compensation in the gross income of an employee, as provided in this paragraph (k), no income results to the employee at the time the stock is transferred to the employee, and no deduction under section 162 is allowable at any time to the employer corporation or a related corporation with respect to such amount.
(iv) If, during the employee's lifetime, the employee exercises an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan, but the employee dies before the stock is transferred to the employee pursuant to the exercise of the option, then for the purpose of sections 421 and 423, on the employee's death, the stock is deemed to be transferred immediately to the employee, and immediately thereafter, the employee is deemed to have transferred the stock to the employee's executor, administrator, trustee, beneficiary by operation of law, heir, or legatee, as the case may be.
(2) If the special rules provided in this paragraph (k) are applicable to the disposition of a share of stock by an employee, then the basis of the share in the employee's hands at the time of the disposition, determined under section 1011, shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount includible as compensation in the employee's gross income under this paragraph (k). However, the basis of a share of stock acquired after the death of an employee by the exercise of an option granted to the employee under an employee stock purchase plan shall be determined in accordance with the rules of section 421(c) and § 1.421-2(c). If the special rules provided in this paragraph (k) are applicable to a share of stock upon the death of an employee, then the basis of the share in the hands of the estate or the person receiving the stock by bequest or inheritance shall be determined under section 1014 or under section 1022, if applicable, and shall not be increased by reason of the inclusion upon the decedent's death of any amount in the decedent's gross income under this paragraph (k).See
Example (9)
of this paragraph (k) with respect to the determination of basis of the share in the hands of a surviving joint owner.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (k):

# Example 1.
On June 1, 2010, Corporation GG grants to Employee P, an employee of GG, an option under GG's employee stock purchase plan to purchase a share of GG stock for $85. The fair market value of GG stock on such date is $100 per share. On June 1, 2011, P exercises the option and on that date GG transfers the share of stock to P. On January 1, 2013, P sells the share for $150, its fair market value on that date. P's income tax return is filed on the basis of the calendar year. The income tax consequences to P and GG are as follows—
(i) Compensation in the amount of $15 is includible in P's gross income for the year 2013, the year of the disposition of the share. The $15 represents the difference between the option price ($85) and the fair market value of the share on the date the option was granted ($100), because the value is less than the fair market value of the share on the date of disposition ($150). For the purpose of computing P's gain or loss on the sale of the share, P's cost basis of $85 is increased by $15, the amount includible in P's gross income as compensation. Thus, P's basis for the share is $100. Because the share was sold for $150, P realizes a gain of $50, which is treated as long-term capital gain; and
(ii) GG is not entitled to any deduction under section 162 at any time with respect to the share transferred to P.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that P sells the share of GG stock on January 1, 2014, for $75, its fair market value on that date. Because $75 is less than the option price ($85), no amount in respect of the sale is includible as compensation in P's gross income for the year 2014. P's basis for determining gain or loss on the sale is $85. Because P sold the share for $75, P realized a loss of $10 on the sale that is treated as a long-term capital loss.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the option provides that the option price shall be 90 percent of the fair market value of the stock on the day the option is exercised. On June 1, 2011, when the option is exercised, the fair market value of the stock is $120 per share so that P pays $108 for the share of the stock. Compensation in the amount of $10 is includible in P's gross income for the year 2013, the year of the disposition of the share. This is determined in the following manner: The excess of the fair market value of the stock at the time of the disposition ($150) over the price paid for the share ($108) is $42; and the excess of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option was granted ($100) over the option price, computed as if the option had been exercised at such time ($90), is $10. Accordingly, $10, the lesser, is includible in gross income. In this situation, P's cost basis of $108 is increased by $10, the amount includible in P's gross income as compensation. Thus, P's basis for the share is $118. Because the share was sold for $150, P realizes a gain of $32 that is treated as long-term capital gain.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the option provides that the option price shall be the lesser of 95 percent of the fair market value of the stock on the first day of the offering period and 95 percent of the fair market value of the stock on the day the option is exercised. On June 1, 2011, when the option is exercised, the fair market value of the stock is $120 per share. P pays $95 for the share of the stock. Compensation in the amount of $5 is includible in P's gross income for the year 2013, the year of the disposition of the share. This is determined in the following manner: The excess of the fair market value of the stock at the time of the disposition ($150) over the price paid for the share ($95) is $55; and the excess of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option was granted ($100) over the option price, computed as if the option had been exercised at such time ($95), is $5. Accordingly, $5, the lesser, is includible in gross income. In this situation, P's cost basis of $95 is increased by $5, the amount includible in P's gross income as compensation. Thus, P's basis for the share is $100. Because the share was sold for $150, P realizes a gain of $50 that is treated as long-term capital gain.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that instead of selling the share on January 1, 2013, P makes a gift of the share on that day. In that case $15 is includible as compensation in P's gross income for 2013. P's cost basis of $85 is increased by $15, the amount includible in P's gross income as compensation. Thus, P's basis for the share is $100, which becomes the donee's basis, as of the time of the gift, for determining gain or loss.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2,
except that instead of selling the share on January 1, 2014, P makes a gift of the share on that date. Because the fair market value of the share on that day ($75) is less than the option price ($85), no amount in respect of the disposition by way of gift is includible as compensation in P's gross income for 2014. P's basis for the share is $85, which becomes the donee's basis, as of the time of the gift, for the purpose of determining gain. The donee's basis for the purpose of determining loss, determined under section 1015(a), is $75 (fair market value of the share at the date of gift).

# Example 7.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that after acquiring the share of stock on June 1, 2011, P dies on August 1, 2012, at which time the share has a fair market value of $150. Compensation in the amount of $15 is includible in P's gross income for the taxable year closing with P's death, $15 being the difference between the option price ($85) and the fair market value of the share when the option was granted ($100), because such value is less than the fair market value at date of death ($150). The basis of the share in the hands of P's estate is determined under section 1014 without regard to the $15 includible in the decedent's gross income.

# Example 8.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 7,
except that P dies on August 1, 2011, at which time the share has a fair market value of $150. Although P's death occurred within one year after the transfer of the
share to P, the income tax consequences are the same as in
Example 7.

# Example 9.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the share of stock was issued in the names of P and P's spouse jointly with right of survivorship, and that P and P's spouse sold the share on June 15, 2012, for $150, its fair market value on that date. Compensation in the amount of $15 is includible in P's gross income for the year 2012, the year of the disposition of the share. The basis of the share in the hands of P and P's spouse for the purpose of determining gain or loss on the sale is $100, that is, the cost of $85 increased by the amount of $15 includible as compensation in P's gross income. The gain of $50 on the sale is treated as long-term capital gain, and is divided equally between P and P's spouse.

# Example 10.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the share of stock was issued in the names of P and P's spouse jointly with right of survivorship, and that P predeceased P's spouse on August 1, 2012, at which time the share had a fair market value of $150. Compensation in the amount of $15 is includible in P's gross income for the taxable year closing with his death. See
Example 7.
The basis of the share in the hands of P's spouse as survivor is determined under section 1014 without regard to the $15 includible in the decedent's gross income.

# Example 11.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 10,
except that P's spouse predeceased P on July 1, 2012. Section 423(c) does not apply in respect of the death of P's spouse. Upon the subsequent death of P on August 1, 2012, the income tax consequences in respect of P's taxable year closing with the date of P's death, and in respect of the basis of the share in the hands of P's estate, are the same as in
Example 7.
If P had sold the share on July 15, 2012 (after the death of P's spouse), for $150, its fair market value at that time, the income tax consequences would be the same as in
Example 1.

Effective/applicability date.
The regulations under this section are effective on November 17, 2009. The regulations under this section apply to options granted under an employee stock purchase plan on or after January 1, 2010. The provisions of this section relating to section 1022 are effective on and after January 19, 2017.
[T.D. 9471, 74 FR 59078, Nov. 17, 2009; 74 FR 67973, Dec. 22, 2009; T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6238, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.424-1
Definitions and special rules applicable to statutory options.
(a)
Substitutions and assumptions of options
—(1)
In general.
(i) This paragraph (a) provides rules under which an
eligible corporation
(as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) may, by reason of a
corporate transaction
(as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), substitute a new statutory option (new option) for an outstanding statutory option (old option) or assume an old option without such substitution or assumption being considered a modification of the old option. For the definition of
modification,
see paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii) For purposes of §§ 1.421-1 through 1.424-1, the phrase “substituting or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which section 424 applies,” “substituting or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which § 1.424-1(a) applies,” and similar phrases means a substitution of a new option for an old option or an assumption of an old option that meets the requirements of this paragraph (a). For a substitution or assumption to qualify under this paragraph (a), the substitution or assumption must meet all of the requirements described in paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this section.
(2)
Eligible corporation.
For purposes of this paragraph (a), the term
eligible corporation
means a corporation that is the employer of the optionee or a related corporation of such corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (a), the determination of whether a corporation is the employer of the optionee or a related corporation of such corporation is based upon all of the relevant facts and circumstances existing immediately after the corporate transaction. See § 1.421-1(h) for rules concerning the employment relationship.
(3)
Corporate transaction.
For purposes of this paragraph (a), the term
corporate transaction
includes—
(i) A corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization, or liquidation;
(ii) A distribution (excluding an ordinary dividend or a stock split or stock dividend described in § 1.424-1(e)(4)(v)) or change in the terms or number of outstanding shares of such corporation; and
(iii) Such other corporate events prescribed by the Commissioner in published guidance.
(4)
By reason of.
(i) For a change in an option or issuance of a new option to
qualify as a substitution or assumption under this paragraph (a), the change must be made by an
eligible corporation
(as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) and occur by reason of a
corporate transaction
(as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section).
(ii) Generally, a change in an option or issuance of a new option is considered to be by reason of a corporate transaction, unless the relevant facts and circumstances demonstrate that such change or issuance is made for reasons unrelated to such corporate transaction. For example, a change in an option or issuance of a new option will be considered to be made for reasons unrelated to a corporate transaction if there is an unreasonable delay between the corporate transaction and such change in the option or issuance of a new option, or if the corporate transaction serves no substantial corporate business purpose independent of the change in options. Similarly, a change in the number or price of shares purchasable under an option merely to reflect market fluctuations in the price of the stock purchasable under an option is not by reason of a corporate transaction.
(iii) A change in an option or issuance of a new option is by reason of a distribution or change in the terms or number of the outstanding shares of a corporation (as described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section) only if the option as changed, or the new option issued, is an option on the same stock as under the old option (or if such class of stock is eliminated in the change in capital structure, on other stock of the same corporation).
(5)
Other requirements.
For a change in an option or issuance of a new option to qualify as a substitution or assumption under this paragraph (a), all of the requirements described in this paragraph (a)(5) must be met.
(i) In the case of an issuance of a new option (or a portion thereof) in exchange for an old option (or portion thereof), the optionee's rights under the old option (or portion thereof) must be canceled, and the optionee must lose all rights under the old option (or portion thereof). There cannot be a substitution of a new option for an old option within the meaning of this paragraph (a) if the optionee may exercise both the old option and the new option. It is not necessary to have a complete substitution of a new option for the old option. However, any portion of such option which is not substituted or assumed in a transaction to which this paragraph (a) applies is an outstanding option to purchase stock or, to the extent paragraph (e) of this section applies, a modified option.
(ii) The excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to the new or assumed option immediately after the change in the option or issuance of a new option over the aggregate option price of such shares must not exceed the excess of the aggregate fair market value of all shares subject to the old option (or portion thereof) immediately before the change in the option or issuance of a new option over the aggregate option price of such shares.
(iii) On a share by share comparison, the ratio of the option price to the fair market value of the shares subject to the option immediately after the change in the option or issuance of a new option must not be more favorable to the optionee than the ratio of the option price to the fair market value of the stock subject to the old option (or portion thereof) immediately before the change in the option or issuance of a new option. The number of shares subject to the new or assumed option may be adjusted to compensate for any change in the aggregate spread between the aggregate option price and the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to the option immediately after the change in the option or issuance of the new option as compared to the aggregate spread between the option price and the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to the option immediately before the change in the option or issuance of the new option.
(iv) The new or assumed option must contain all terms of the old option, except to the extent such terms are rendered inoperative by reason of the corporate transaction.
(v) The new option or assumed option must not give the optionee additional benefits that the optionee did not have under the old option.
(6)
Obligation to substitute or assume not necessary.
For a change in the option or issuance of a new option to meet the requirements of this paragraph (a), it is not necessary to show that the corporation changing an option or issuing a new option is under any obligation to do so. In fact, this paragraph (a) may apply even when the option that is being replaced or assumed expressly provides that it will terminate upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions. However, this paragraph (a) cannot be applied to revive a statutory option which, for reasons not related to the corporate transaction, expires before it can properly be replaced or assumed under this paragraph (a).
(7)
Issuance of stock without meeting the requirements of this paragraph (a).
A change in the terms of an option resulting in a modification of such option occurs if an optionee's new employer (or a related corporation of the new employer) issues its stock (or stock of a related corporation) upon exercise of such option without satisfying all of the requirements described in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section.
(8)
Date of grant.
For purposes of applying the rules of this paragraph (a), a substitution or assumption is considered to occur on the date that the optionee would, but for this paragraph (a), be considered to have been granted the option that the eligible corporation is substituting or assuming. A substitution or an assumption that occurs by reason of a corporate transaction may occur before or after the corporate transaction.
(9) Any reasonable methods may be used to determine the fair market value of the stock subject to the option immediately before the assumption or substitution and the fair market value of the stock subject to the option immediately after the assumption or substitution. Such methods include the valuation methods described in § 20.2031-2 of this chapter (the Estate Tax Regulations). In the case of stock listed on a stock exchange, the fair market value may be based on the last sale before and the first sale after the assumption or substitution if such sales clearly reflect the fair market value of the stock, or may be based upon an average selling price during a longer period, such as the day or week before, and the day or week after, the assumption or substitution. If the stocks are not listed, or if they are newly issued, it will be reasonable to base the determination on experience over even longer periods. In the case of a merger, consolidation, or other reorganization which is arrived at by arm's-length negotiations, the fair market value of the stocks subject to the option before and after the assumption or substitution may be based upon the values assigned to the stock for purposes of the reorganization. For example, if in the case of a merger the parties treat each share of the merged company as being equal in value to a share of the surviving company, it will be reasonable to assume that the stocks are of equal value so that the substituted option may permit the employee to purchase at the same price one share of the surviving company for each share he could have purchased of the merged company.

Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Eligible corporation.
X Corporation acquires a new subsidiary, Y Corporation, and transfers some of its employees to Y. Y Corporation wishes to grant to its new employees and to the employees of X Corporation new options for Y shares in exchange for old options for X shares that were previously granted by X Corporation. Because Y Corporation is an employer with respect to its own employees and a related corporation of X Corporation, Y Corporation is an eligible corporation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to both the employees of X and Y Corporations.

# Example 2. Corporate transaction.
(i) On January 1, 2004, Z Corporation grants E, an employee of Z, an option to acquire 100 shares of Z common stock. At the time of grant, the fair market value of Z common stock is $200 per share. E's option price is $200 per share. On July 1, 2005, when the fair market value of Z common stock is $400, Z declares a stock dividend of preferred stock distributed on common stock that causes the fair market value of Z common stock to decrease to $200 per share. On the same day, Z grants to E a new option to acquire 200 shares of Z common stock in exchange for E's old option. The new option has an exercise price of $100 per share.
(ii) A stock dividend other than that described in § 1.424-1(e)(4)(v) is a corporate
transaction under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. Generally, the issuance of a new option is considered to be by reason of a corporate transaction. None of the facts in this
Example 2
indicate that the new option is not issued by reason of the stock dividend. In addition, the new option is issued on the same stock as the old option. Thus, the substitution occurs by reason of the corporate transaction. Assuming the other requirements of this section are met, the issuance of the new option is a substitution that meets the requirements of this paragraph (a) and is not a modification of the option.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2.
Assume further that on December 1, 2005, Z declares an ordinary cash dividend. On the same day, Z grants E a new option to acquire Z stock in substitution for E's old option. Under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, an ordinary cash dividend is not a corporate transaction. Thus, the exchange of the new option for the old option does not meet the requirements of this paragraph (a) and is a modification of the option.

# Example 3. Corporate transaction.
On March 15, 2004, A Corporation grants E, an employee of A, an option to acquire 100 shares of A stock at $50 per share, the fair market value of A stock on the date of grant. On May 2, 2005, A Corporation transfers several employees, including E, to B Corporation, a related corporation. B Corporation arranges to purchase some assets from A on the same day as E's transfer to B. Such purchase is without a substantial business purpose independent of making the exchange of E's old options for the new options appear to be by reason of a corporate transaction. The following day, B Corporation grants to E, one of its new employees, an option to acquire shares of B stock in exchange for the old option held by E to acquire A stock. Under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the purchase of assets is a corporate transaction. Generally, the substitution of an option is considered to occur by reason of a corporate transaction. However, in this case, the relevant facts and circumstances demonstrate that the issuance of the new option in exchange for the old option occurred by reason of the change in E's employer rather than a corporate transaction and that the sale of assets is without a substantial corporate business purpose independent of the change in the options. Thus, the exchange of the new option for the old option is not by reason of a corporate transaction that meets the requirements of this paragraph (a) and is a modification of the old option.

# Example 4. Corporate transaction.
(i) E, an employee of Corporation A, holds an option to acquire 100 shares of Corporation A stock. On September 1, 2006, Corporation A has one class of stock outstanding and declares a stock dividend of one share of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock. The rights associated with the common stock issued as a dividend are the same as the rights under existing shares of stock. In connection with the stock dividend, E's option is exchanged for an option to acquire 200 shares of Corporation A stock. The per-share exercise price is equal to one half of the per-share exercise price of the original option. The stock dividend merely changes the number of shares of Corporation A outstanding and effects no other change to the stock of Corporation A. The option is proportionally adjusted and the aggregate exercise price remains the same and therefore satisfies the requirements described in § 1.424-1(e)(4)(v).
(ii) The stock dividend is not a corporate transaction under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the declaration of the stock dividend is not a modification of the old option under paragraph (a) of this section. Pursuant to § 1.424-1(e)(4)(v), the exercise price of the old option may be adjusted proportionally with the change in the number of outstanding shares of Corporation A such that the ratio of the aggregate exercise price of the option to the number of shares covered by the option is the same both before and after the stock dividend. The adjustment of E's option is not treated as a modification of the option.

# Example 5. Additional benefit.
On June 1, 2004, P Corporation acquires 100 percent of the shares of S Corporation and issues a new option to purchase P shares in exchange for an old option to purchase S shares that is held by E, an employee of S. On the date of the exchange, E's old option is exercisable for 3 more years, and, after the exchange, E's new option is exercisable for 5 years. Because the new option is exercisable for an additional period of time beyond the time allowed under the old option, the effect of the exchange of the new option for the old option is to give E an additional benefit that E did not enjoy under the old option. Thus, the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section are not met, and this paragraph (a) does not apply to the exchange of the new option for the old option. Therefore, the exchange is a modification of the old options.

# Example 6. Spread and ratio tests.
E is an employee of S Corporation. E holds an old option that was granted to E by S to purchase 60 shares of S at $12 per share. On June 1, 2005, S Corporation is merged into P Corporation, and on such date P issues a new option to purchase P shares in exchange for E's old option to purchase S shares. Immediately before the exchange, the fair market value of an S share is $32; immediately after the exchange, the fair market value of a P share is $24. The new option entitles E to buy P shares at $9 per share. Because, on a share-by-share comparison, the ratio of the new option price ($9 per share) to the fair market value of a P share immediately after the exchange ($24 per share) is not more favorable
to E than the ratio of the old option price ($12 per share) to the fair market value of an S share immediately before the exchange ($32 per share) (
9/24
=
12/32
), the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section are met. The number of shares subject to E's option to purchase P stock is set at 80. Because the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate option price of the shares subject to E's new option to purchase P stock, $1,200 (80 × $24 minus 80 × $9), is not greater than the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate option price of the shares subject to E's old option to purchase S stock, $1,200 (60 × $32 minus 60 × $12), the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section are met.

# Example 7. Ratio test and partial substitution.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 6
, except that the fair market value of an S share immediately before the exchange of the new option for the old option is $8, that the option price is $10 per share, and that the fair market value of a P share immediately after the exchange is $12. P sets the new option price at $15 per share. Because, on a share-by-share comparison, the ratio of the new option price ($15 per share) to the fair market value of a P share immediately after the exchange ($12) is not more favorable to E than the ratio of the old option price ($10 per share) to the fair market value of an S share immediately before the substitution ($8 per share) (
15/12
=
10/8
), the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section are met. Assume further that the number of shares subject to E's P option is set at 20, as compared to 60 shares under E's old option to buy S stock. Immediately after the exchange, 2 shares of P are worth $24, which is what 3 shares of S were worth immediately before the exchange (2 × $12 = 3 × $8). Thus, to achieve a complete substitution of a new option for E's old option, E would need to receive a new option to purchase 40 shares of P (
i.e.
, 2 shares of P for each 3 shares of S that E could have purchased under the old option (
2/3
=
40/60
)). Because E's new option is for only 20 shares of P, P has replaced only
1/2
of E's old option, and the other
1/2
is still outstanding.

# Example 8. Partial substitution.
X Corporation forms a new corporation, Y Corporation, by a transfer of certain assets and, in a spin-off, distributes the shares of Y Corporation to the stockholders of X Corporation. E, an employee of X Corporation, is thereafter an employee of Y. Y wishes to substitute a new option to purchase some of its stock for E's old option to purchase 100 shares of X. E's old option to purchase shares of X, at $50 a share, was granted when the fair market value of an X share was $50, and an X share was worth $100 just before the distribution of the Y shares to X's stockholders. Immediately after the spin-off, which is also the time of the substitution, each share of X and each share of Y is worth $50. Based on these facts, a new option to purchase 200 shares of Y at an option price of $25 per share could be granted to E in complete substitution of E's old option. In the alternative, it would also be permissible in connection with the spin off, to grant E a new option to purchase 100 shares of Y, at an option price of $25 per share, and for E to retain an option to purchase 100 shares of X under the old option, with the option price adjusted to $25. However, because X is no longer a related corporation with respect to Y, E must exercise the option for 100 shares of X within three months from the date of the spin off for the option to be treated as a statutory option. See § 1.421-1(h). It would also be permissible to grant E a new option to purchase 100 shares of Y, at an option price of $25 per share, in substitution for E's right to purchase 50 of the shares under the old option.

# Example 9. Stockholder approval requirements.
(i) X Corporation, a publicly traded corporation, adopts an incentive stock option plan that meets the requirements of § 1.422-2. Under the plan, options to acquire X stock are granted to X employees. X Corporation is acquired by Y Corporation and becomes a subsidiary corporation of Y Corporation. After the acquisition, X employees remain employees of X. In connection with the acquisition, Y Corporation substitutes new options to acquire Y stock for the old options to acquire X stock previously granted to the employees of X. As a result of this substitution, on exercise of the new options, X employees receive Y Corporation stock.
(ii) Because the requirements of § 1.422-2 were met on the date of grant, the substitution of the new Y options for the old X options does not require new stockholder approval. If the other requirements of paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section are met, the issuance of new options for Y stock in exchange for the old options for X stock meets the requirements of this paragraph (a) and is not a modification of the old options.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this
Example 9.
Assume further that as part of the acquisition, X amends its plan to allow future grants under the plan to be grants to acquire Y stock. Because the amendment of the plan to allow options on a different stock is considered the adoption of a new plan under § 1.422-2(b)(2)(iii), the stockholders of X (in this case, Y) must approve the plan within 12 months before or after the date of the amendment of the plan. If the stockholders of X (in this case, Y) timely approve the plan, the future grants to acquire Y stock will be incentive stock options (assuming the other requirements of § 1.422-2 have been met).

# Example 10. Modification.
X Corporation merges into Y Corporation. Y Corporation retains employees of X who hold old options
to acquire X Corporation stock. When the former employees of X exercise the old options, Y Corporation issues Y stock to the former employees of X. Under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, because Y issues its stock on exercise of the old options for X stock, there is a change in the terms of the old options for X stock. Thus, the issuance of Y stock on exercise of the old options is a modification of the old options.

# Example 11. Eligible corporation.
(i) D Corporation grants an option to acquire 100 shares of D Corporation stock to E, an employee of D Corporation. S Corporation is a subsidiary of D Corporation. On March 1, 2005, D Corporation spins off S Corporation. E remains an employee of D Corporation. In connection with the spin off, D Corporation substitutes a new option to acquire D Corporation stock and a new option to acquire S Corporation stock for the old option in a manner that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(ii) The substitution of the new option to acquire S and D stock for the old option to acquire D stock is not a modification of the old option. However, because S is no longer a related corporation with respect to D Corporation, E must exercise the option for S stock within three months from March 1, 2005, for the option to be treated as a statutory option. See § 1.421-1(h).
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 11
except that E's employment with D Corporation is terminated on February 20, 2005. The substitution of the new option to acquire S and D stock for the old option to acquire D stock is not a modification of the old option. However, because the employment relationship between E and D Corporation terminated on February 20, 2005, E must exercise the option for the D and S stock within three months from February 20, 2005, for the option to be treated as a statutory option. See § 1.421-1(h).
(b)
Acquisition of new stock.
(1) Section 424(b) provides that the rules provided by sections 421 through 424 which are applicable with respect to stock transferred to an individual upon his exercise of an option, shall likewise be applicable with respect to stock acquired by a distribution or an exchange to which section 305, 354, 355, 356, or 1036 (or so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036) applies. Stock so acquired shall, for purposes of sections 421 through 424, be considered as having been transferred to the individual upon his exercise of the option. A similar rule shall be applied in the case of a series of such acquisitions. With respect to such acquisitions, section 424(b) does not make inapplicable any of the provisions of section 305, 354, 355, 356, or 1036 (or so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036).
(2) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
If, with respect to stock transferred pursuant to the timely exercise of a statutory option, there is a distribution of new stock to which section 305(a) is applicable, and if there is a disposition of such new stock before the expiration of the applicable holding period required with respect to the stock originally acquired pursuant to the exercise of such option, such disposition makes section 421 inapplicable to the transfer of the original stock pursuant to the exercise of the option to the extent that the disposition effects a reduction of the individual's total interest in the old and new stock. However, if the new stock, as well as the old stock, is not disposed of before the expiration of the holding period required with respect to the original stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of the option, the special tax treatment provided by section 421 is applicable to both the original shares and the shares acquired by virtue of the distribution to which section 305(a) applies.
(c)
Disposition of stock.
(1) For purposes of sections 421 through 424, the term “disposition of stock” includes a sale, exchange, gift, or any transfer of legal title, but does not include—
(i) A transfer from a decedent to his estate or a transfer by bequest or inheritance; or
(ii) An exchange to which is applicable section 354, 355, 356, or 1036 (or so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036); or
(iii) A mere pledge or hypothecation. However, a disposition of the stock pursuant to a pledge or hypothecation is a disposition by the individual, even though the making of the pledge or hypothecation is not such a disposition.
(iv) A transfer between spouses or incident to divorce (described in section 1041(a)). The special tax treatment of § 1.421-2(a) with respect to the transferred stock applies to the transferee. However, see § 1.421-1(b)(2) for the treatment of the transfer of a statutory option incident to divorce.
(2) A share of stock acquired by an individual pursuant to the exercise of a statutory option is not considered disposed of by the individual if such share is taken in the name of the individual
and another person jointly with right of survivorship, or is subsequently transferred into such joint ownership, or is retransferred from such joint ownership to the sole ownership of the individual. However, any termination of such joint ownership (other than a termination effected by the death of a joint owner) is a disposition of such share, except to the extent the individual reacquires ownership of the share. For example, if such individual and his joint owner transfer such share to another person, the individual has made a disposition of such share. Likewise, if a share of stock held in the joint names of such individual and another person is transferred to the name of such other person, there is a disposition of such share by the individual. If an individual exercises a statutory option and a share of stock is transferred to another or is transferred to such individual in his name as trustee for another, the individual has made a disposition of such share. However, a termination of joint ownership resulting from the death of one of the owners is not a disposition of such share. For determination of basis in the hands of the survivor where joint ownership is terminated by the death of one of the owners, see section 1014 or section 1022, if applicable.
(3) If an optionee exercises an incentive stock option with statutory option stock and the applicable holding period requirements (under § 1.422-1(a) or § 1.423-1(a)) with respect to such statutory option stock are not met before such transfer, then sections 354, 355, 356, or 1036 (or so much of 1031 as relates to 1036) do not apply to determine whether there is a disposition of those shares. Therefore, there is a disposition of the statutory option stock, and the special tax treatment of § 1.421-2(a) does not apply to such stock.
(4) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On June 1, 2004, the X Corporation grants to E, an employee, a statutory option to purchase 100 shares of X Corporation stock at $100 per share, the fair market value of X Corporation stock on that date. On June 1, 2005, while employed by X Corporation, E exercises the option in full and pays X Corporation $10,000, and on that day X Corporation transfers to E 100 shares of its stock having a fair market value of $12,000. Before June 1, 2006, E makes no disposition of the 100 shares so purchased. E realizes no income on June 1, 2005, with respect to the transfer to him of the 100 shares of X Corporation stock. X Corporation is not entitled to any deduction at any time with respect to its transfer to E of the stock. E's basis for such 100 shares is $10,000.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except assume that on August 1, 2006, three years and two months after the transfer of the shares to him, E sells the 100 shares of X Corporation stock for $13,000 which is the fair market value of the stock on that date. For the taxable year in which the sale occurs, E realizes a gain of $3,000 ($13,000 minus E's basis of $10,000), which is treated as capital gain.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except assume that on August 1, 2006, E makes a gift of the 100 shares of Y Corporation stock to his son. Such disposition results in no realization of gain to E either for the taxable year in which the option is exercised or the taxable year in which the gift is made. E's basis of $10,000 becomes the donee's basis for determining gain or loss.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except assume that on May 1, 2006, E sells the 100 shares of X Corporation stock for $13,000. The special rules of section 421(a) are not applicable to the transfer of the stock by X Corporation to E, because disposition of the stock was made by E within two years from the date the options were granted and within one year of the date that the shares were transferred to him.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except assume that E dies on September 1, 2005, owning the 100 shares of X Corporation stock acquired by him pursuant to his exercise on June 1, 2005, of the statutory option. On the date of death, the fair market value of the stock is $12,500. No income is realized by E by reason of the transfer of the 100 shares to his estate. If the stock is valued as of the date of E's death for estate tax purposes, the basis of the 100 shares in the hands of the executor is $12,500.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except assume that on June 1, 2005, when the option is exercised by E the 100 shares are transferred by X to E and his wife W, as joint owners with right of survivorship, and that E dies on July 1, 2005. Neither the transfer into joint ownership nor the termination of such joint ownership by E's death is a disposition. Because E has made no disqualifying disposition of the shares, section 421(a) is applicable and E realizes no compensation income at death with respect to the shares even though he held the stock less than 2 years after the transfer of the shares to him pursuant to his exercise of the option. See § 1.421-2(b)(2).

# Example 7.
On January 1, 2004, X Corporation grants to E, an employee of X Corporation, an incentive stock option to purchase 100 shares of X Corporation stock at $100 per share (the fair market value of an X Corporation share on that date). On January 1, 2005, when the fair market value of a share of X Corporation stock is $200, E exercises half of the option, pays X Corporation $5,000 in cash, and is transferred 50 shares of X Corporation stock with an aggregate fair market value of $10,000. E makes no disposition of the shares before January 2, 2006. Under § 1.421-2(a), no income is recognized by E on the transfer of shares pursuant to the exercise of the incentive stock option, and X Corporation is not entitled to any deduction at any time with respect to its transfer of the shares to E. E's basis in the shares is $5,000.

# Example 8.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 7
, except that on December 1, 2005, one year and 11 months after the grant of the option and 11 months after the transfer of the 50 shares to E, E uses 25 of those shares, with a fair market value of $5,000, to pay for the remaining 50 shares purchasable under the option. On that day, X Corporation transfers 50 of its shares, with an aggregate fair market value of $10,000, to E. Because E disposed of the 25 shares before the expiration of the applicable holding periods, § 1.421-2(a) does not apply to the January 1, 2005, transfer of the 25 shares used by E to exercise the remainder of the option. As a result of the disqualifying disposition of the 25 shares, E recognizes compensation income under the rules of § 1.421-2(b).

# Example 9.
On January 1, 2005, X Corporation grants an incentive stock option to E, an employee of X Corporation. The exercise price of the option is $10 per share. On June 1, 2005, when the fair market value of an X Corporation share is $20, E exercises the option and purchases 5 shares with an aggregate fair market value of $100. On January 1, 2006, when the fair market value of an X Corporation share is $50, X Corporation is acquired by Y Corporation in a section 368(a)(1)(A) reorganization. As part of the acquisition, all X Corporation shares are converted into Y Corporation shares. After the conversion, if an optionee holds a fractional share of Y Corporation stock, Y Corporation will purchase the fractional share for cash equal to its fair market value. After applying the conversion formula to the shares held by E, E has 10
1/2
Y Corporation shares. Y Corporation purchases E's one-half share for $25, the fair market value of one-half of a Y Corporation share on the conversion date. Because E sells the one-half share prior to expiration of the holding periods described in § 1.422-1(a), the sale is a disqualifying disposition of the one-half share. Thus, in 2006, E must recognize compensation income of $5 (one-half of the fair market value of an X Corporation share on the date of exercise of the option, or $10, less one-half of the exercise price per share, or $5). For purposes of computing any additional gain, E's basis in the one-half share increases to $10 (reflecting the $5 included in income as compensation). E recognizes an additional gain of $15 ($25, the fair market value of the one-half share, less $10, the basis in such share). The extent to which the additional $15 of gain is treated as a redemption of Y Corporation stock is determined under section 302.
(d)
Attribution of stock ownership.
To determine the amount of stock owned by an individual for purposes of applying the percentage limitations relating to certain stockholders described in §§ 1.422-2(f) and 1.423-2(d), shares of the employer corporation or of a related corporation that are owned (directly or indirectly) by or for the individual's brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half blood), spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants, are considered to be owned by the individual. Also, for such purposes, if a domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, estate, or trust owns (directly or indirectly) shares of the employer corporation or of a related corporation, the shares are considered to be owned proportionately by or for the stockholders, partners, or beneficiaries of the corporation, partnership, estate, or trust. The extent to which stock held by the optionee as a trustee of a voting trust is considered owned by the optionee is determined under all of the facts and circumstances.
(e)
Modification, extension, or renewal of option.
(1) This paragraph (e) provides rules for determining whether a share of stock transferred to an individual upon the individual's exercise of an option after the terms of the option have been changed is transferred pursuant to the exercise of a statutory option.
(2) Any modification, extension, or renewal of the terms of an option to purchase shares is considered the granting of a new option. The new option may or may not be a statutory option. To determine the date of grant of the new option for purposes of section 422 or 423, see § 1.421-1(c).
(3) If section 423(c) applies to an option then, in case of a modification, extension, or renewal of an option, the highest of the following values shall be considered to be the fair market value
of the stock at the time of the granting of such option for purposes of applying the rules of sections 423(b)(6)—
(i) The fair market value on the date of the original granting of the option,
(ii) The fair market value on the date of the making of such modification, extension, or renewal, or
(iii) The fair market value at the time of the making of any intervening modification, extension, or renewal.
(4)(i) For purposes of §§ 1.421-1 through 1.424-1 the term
modification
means any change in the terms of the option (or change in the terms of the plan pursuant to which the option was granted or in the terms of any other agreement governing the arrangement) that gives the optionee additional benefits under the option regardless of whether the optionee in fact benefits from the change in terms. In contrast, for example, a change in the terms of the option shortening the period during which the option is exercisable is not a modification. However, a change providing an extension of the period during which an option may be exercised (such as after termination of employment) or a change providing an alternative to the exercise of the option (such as a stock appreciation right) is a modification regardless of whether the optionee in fact benefits from such extension or alternative right. Similarly, a change providing an additional benefit upon exercise of the option (such as the payment of a cash bonus) or a change providing more favorable terms for payment for the stock purchased under the option (such as the right to tender previously acquired stock) is a modification.
(ii) If an option is not immediately exercisable in full, a change in the terms of the option to accelerate the time at which the option (or any portion thereof) may be exercised is not a modification for purposes of this section. Additionally, no modification occurs if a provision accelerating the time when an option may first be exercised is removed prior to the year in which it would otherwise be triggered. For example, if an acceleration provision is timely removed to avoid exceeding the $100,000 limitation described in § 1.422-4, a modification of the option does not occur.
(iii) A change to an option which provides, either by its terms or in substance, that the optionee may receive an additional benefit under the option at the future discretion of the grantor, is a modification at the time that the option is changed to provide such discretion. In addition, the exercise of discretion to provide an additional benefit is a modification of the option. However, it is not a modification for the grantor to exercise discretion specifically reserved under an option with respect to the payment of a cash bonus at the time of exercise, the availability of a loan at exercise, the right to tender previously acquired stock for the stock purchasable under the option, or the payment of employment taxes and/or required withholding taxes resulting from the exercise of a statutory option. An option is not modified merely because an optionee is offered a change in the terms of an option if the change to the option is not made. An offer to change the terms of an option that remains open less than 30 days is not a modification of the option. However, if an offer to change the terms of an option remains outstanding for 30 days or more, there is a modification of the option as of the date the offer to change the option is made.
(iv) A change in the terms of the stock purchasable under the option that increases the value of the stock is a modification of such option, except to the extent that a new option is substituted for such option by reason of the change in the terms of the stock in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
(v) If an option is amended solely to increase the number of shares subject to the option, the increase is not considered a modification of the option but is treated as the grant of a new option for the additional shares. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the exercise price and number of shares subject to an option are proportionally adjusted to reflect a stock split (including a reverse stock split) or stock dividend, and the only effect of the stock split or stock dividend is to increase (or decrease) on a pro rata basis the number of shares owned by each shareholder of the class of stock subject to the option, then the option is
not modified if it is proportionally adjusted to reflect the stock split or stock dividend and the aggregate exercise price of the option is not less than the aggregate exercise price before the stock split or stock dividend.
(vi) Any change in the terms of an option made in an attempt to qualify the option as a statutory option grants additional benefits to the optionee and is, therefore, a modification. However, if the terms of an option are changed to provide that the optionee cannot transfer the option except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution in order to meet the requirements of section 422(b)(5) or 423(b)(9) such change is not a modicication.
(vii) An extension of an option refers to the granting by the corporation to the optionee of an additional period of time within which to exercise the option beyond the time originally prescribed. A renewal of an option is the granting by the corporation of the same rights or privileges contained in the original option on the same terms and conditions. The rules of this paragraph apply as well to successive modifications, extensions, and renewals.
(viii) Any inadvertent change to the terms of an option (or change in the terms of the plan pursuant to which the option was granted or in the terms of any other agreement governing the arrangement) that is treated as a modification under this paragraph (e) is not considered a modification of the option to the extent the change in the terms of the option is removed by the earlier of the date the option is exercised or the last day of the calendar year during which such change occurred. Thus, for example, if the terms of an option are inadvertently changed on March 1 to extend the exercise period and the change is removed on November, then if the option is not exercised prior to November 1, the option is not considered modified under this paragraph (e).
(5) A statutory option may, as a result of a modification, extension, or renewal, thereafter cease to be a statutory option, or any option may, by modification, extension, or renewal, thereafter become a statutory option.
(6) [Reserved]
(7) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On June 1, 2004, the X Corporation grants to an employee an option under X's employee stock purchase plan to purchase 100 shares of the stock of X Corporation at $90 per share, such option to be exercised on or before June 1, 2006. At the time the option is granted, the fair market value of the X Corporation stock is $100 per share. On February 1, 2005, before the employee exercises the option, X Corporation modifies the option to provide that the price at which the employee may purchase the stock shall be $80 per share. On February 1, 2005, the fair market value of the X Corporation stock is $90 per share. Under section 424(h), the X Corporation is deemed to have granted an option to the employee on February 1, 2005. Such option shall be treated as an option to purchase at $80 per share 100 shares of stock having a fair market value of $100 per share, that is, the higher of the fair market value of the stock on June 1, 2004, or on February 1, 1965. Because the requirements of § 1.424-1(e)(3) and § 1.423-2(g) have not been met, the exercise of such option by the employee after February 1, 2005, is not the exercise of a statutory option.

# Example 2.
On June 1, 2004, the X Corporation grants to an employee an option under X's employee stock purchase plan to purchase 100 shares of X Corporation stock at $90 per share, exercisable after December 31, 2005, and on or before June 1, 2006. On June 1, 2004, the fair market value of X Corporation's stock is $100 per share. On February 1, 2005, X Corporation modifies the option to provide that the option shall be exercisable on or before September 1, 2006. On February 1, 2005, the fair market value of X Corporation stock is $110 per share. Under section 424(h), X Corporation is deemed to have granted an option to the employee on February 1, 2005, to purchase at $90 per share 100 shares of stock having a fair market value of $110 per share, that is, the higher of the fair market value of the stock on June 1, 2004, or on February 1, 2005. Because the requirements of § 1.424-1(e)(3) and § 1.423-2(g) have not been met, the exercise of such option by the employee is not the exercise of a statutory option.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the employee exercised the option to the extent of 50 shares on January 15, 2005, before the date of the modification of the option. Any exercise of the option after February 1, 2005, the date of the modification, is not the exercise of a statutory option. See example (1) in this subparagraph. The exercise of the option on January 15, 2005, pursuant to which 50 shares were acquired, is the exercise of a statutory option.

§ 1.430(a)-1
Determination of minimum required contribution.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
This section sets forth rules for determining a plan's minimum required contribution for a plan year under section 430(a). Section 430 and this section apply to single-employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans as defined in section 413(c)) that are subject to section 412 but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section 414(f)). Paragraph (b) of this section defines a plan's minimum required contribution for a plan year. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining shortfall amortization installments. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for determining waiver amortization installments. Paragraph (e) of this section provides for early deemed amortization of shortfall and waiver amortization bases for fully funded plans. Paragraph (f) of this section provides definitions that apply for purposes of this section. Paragraph (g) of this section provides examples that illustrate the application of this section. Paragraph (h) of this section provides effective/applicability dates and transition rules.
(2)
Special rules for multiple employer plans
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules of section 430 and this section are applied separately for each employer under the plan, as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, the minimum required contribution is computed separately for each employer under such a multiple employer plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is,
a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430 and this section are applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.
(ii)
CSEC plans.
A CSEC plan (that is, a plan that fits within the definition of a CSEC plan in section 414(y) for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and for which the election under section 414(y)(3)(A) has not been made) is not subject to the rules of section 430. See section 433 for the minimum funding rules that apply to CSEC plans.
(b)
Definition of minimum required contribution
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a defined benefit plan that is subject to section 430, except as offset under section 430(f) and § 1.430(f) 1, the minimum required contribution for a plan year is determined as the applicable amount determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or paragraph (b)(3) of this section, reduced by the amount of any funding waiver under section 412(c) that is granted for the plan year. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for special rules for a plan maintained by a commercial passenger airline (or other eligible employer) for which an election under section 402 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780), as amended (PPA '06), has been made, and see section 430(j) and § 1.430(j) 1(b) for rules regarding the required interest adjustment for a contribution that is paid on a date other than the valuation date for the plan year. See also § 1.430(j)-1(d)(3)(iv)(B) for rules regarding an increase to the minimum required contribution in certain circumstances for a plan with an unpaid liquidity amount.
(2)
Plan assets less than funding target
—(i)
General rule.
For any plan year in which the value of plan assets (as reduced to reflect the subtraction of certain funding balances as provided under § 1.430(f)-1(c), but not below zero) is less than the funding target for the plan year, the minimum required contribution for that plan year is equal to the sum of—
(A) The target normal cost for the plan year;
(B) The total (not less than zero) of the shortfall amortization installments as described in paragraph (c) of this section determined with respect to any shortfall amortization base for the plan year and for each preceding plan year for which the shortfall amortization base has not been fully taken into account (generally, the 6 preceding plan years); and
(C) The total of the waiver amortization installments as described in paragraph (d) of this section determined with respect to any waiver amortization base for all preceding plan years for which the waiver amortization base has not been fully taken into account (generally, the 5 preceding plan years).
(ii)
Special rule for short plan years
—(A)
Proration of amortization installments.
In determining the minimum required contribution in the case of a plan year that is shorter than 12 months (and is not a 52-week plan year of a plan that uses a 52-53 week plan year), the shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments that are taken into account under paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section are determined by multiplying the amount of those installments that would be taken into account for a 12-month plan year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the duration of the short plan year and the denominator of which is 1 year.
(B)
Effect on subsequent years.
In plan years after the short plan year, installments with respect to a shortfall amortization base or waiver amortization base continue to be taken into account under paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section until the total amount of those installments, as originally determined when the base was established, has been taken into account. Thus, in the case of a plan that has a short plan year, an additional partial installment will be taken into account under paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section for the plan year that ends after the end of the original amortization period (generally 7 years for shortfall amortization bases and 5 years for waiver amortization bases) in an amount determined so that the total of the amortization installments (including the prorated installment payable for the
short plan year and the additional partial installment) is equal to the total of the amortization installments as originally determined.
(3)
Plan assets equal or exceed funding target.
For any plan year in which the value of plan assets (as reduced to reflect the subtraction of certain funding balances as provided under § 1.430(f)-1(c), but not below zero) equals or exceeds the funding target for the plan year, the minimum required contribution for that plan year is equal to the target normal cost for the plan year reduced (but not below zero) by that excess.
(4)
Special rules for commercial passenger airlines
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (b)(4) provides special rules for a plan maintained by a commercial passenger airline (or an employer whose principal business is providing catering services to a commercial passenger airline) for which an election under section 402(a)(1) of PPA '06 has been made. See paragraph (c)(4) of this section for special rules for a plan maintained by a commercial passenger airline (or an employer whose principal business is providing catering services to a commercial passenger airline) for which an election under section 402(a)(2) of PPA '06 has been made.
(ii)
Determinations during 17-year amortization period.
If an election described in section 402(a)(1) of PPA '06 applies for the plan year with respect to an eligible plan described in section 402(c)(1) of PPA '06, then the plan's minimum required contribution for purposes of section 430 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) for the plan year is equal to the amount necessary to amortize (at an interest rate of 8.85 percent) the unfunded liability of the plan in equal installments over the remaining amortization period. For this purpose, the unfunded liability means the excess of the accrued liability under the plan determined using the unit credit funding method and an interest rate of 8.85 percent over the value of assets (as determined under section 430(g)(3) and § 1.430(g)-1(c)), and the remaining amortization period is the 17-plan-year period beginning with the first plan year for which the election was made, reduced by 1 year for each plan year after the first plan year for which the election was made. In addition, the section 430(f)(3) election to apply funding balances against the minimum required contribution does not apply to a plan to which the election described in section 402(a)(1) of PPA '06 applies for the plan year.
(iii)
Determinations following the election period.
If an election described in section 402(a)(1) of PPA '06 applied to the plan for any preceding plan year but does not apply for the current plan year, then the plan's minimum required contribution for purposes of section 430 of the Code for the plan year is determined without regard to that election. For the first plan year for which that election no longer applies to the plan, any prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance is reduced to zero.
(5)
Terminated plans
—(i)
Short plan year.
If a plan's termination date occurs during a plan year but before the last day of a plan year, then, for purposes of section 430, the plan is treated as having a short plan year that ends on the termination date.
(ii)
Valuation date.
If a plan's termination date is before the date that would otherwise have been the valuation date for a plan year, then the valuation date for the plan year must be changed so that it falls within the short plan year pursuant to § 1.430(g)-1(b)(2)(i). See § 1.430(g)-1(b)(2)(iv) for a rule providing automatic approval of changes in the valuation date that are required by section 430.
(c)
Shortfall amortization installments
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section, the shortfall amortization installments with respect to a shortfall amortization base established for a plan year are the annual amounts necessary to amortize that shortfall amortization base in level annual installments over the 7-year period beginning with that plan year. See § 1.430(h)(2)-1(e) and (f) for rules regarding interest rates used for determining shortfall amortization installments and the date within each plan year on which the installments are assumed to be paid. The shortfall amortization installments are determined using the interest rates that apply for the plan year for which
the shortfall amortization base is established and are not redetermined in subsequent plan years to reflect any changes in the valuation date or changes in interest rates under section 430(h)(2) for those subsequent plan years.
(2)
Shortfall amortization base
—(i)
In general.
Unless the value of plan assets (as reduced to reflect the subtraction of certain funding balances as provided under § 1.430(f)-1(c)(2), but not below zero) is equal to or greater than the funding target for the plan year, a shortfall amortization base is established for the plan year equal to—
(A) The funding shortfall for the plan year; minus
(B) The amount attributable to future installments determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Amount attributable to future installments.
The amount attributable to future installments is equal to the sum of the present values (determined in accordance with § 1.430(h)(2)-1(e) and (f) using the interest rates that apply for the current plan year) of—
(A) The shortfall amortization installments that have been determined for the plan year and any succeeding plan year with respect to the shortfall amortization bases for any plan year preceding the plan year; and
(B) The waiver amortization installments that have been determined for the plan year and any succeeding plan year with respect to the waiver amortization bases for any plan year preceding the plan year.
(iii)
Timing assumption for installments after change in valuation date.
For purposes of determining the present value in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments are assumed to be paid on the valuation date for the current plan year and anniversaries thereof even if the valuation date for a subsequent plan year is not the same as the valuation date for the plan year for which a shortfall amortization base or waiver amortization base was established. For example, assume that a plan has a July 1 to June 30 plan year and a valuation date that is the first day of the plan year, and that the plan year for the plan is changed to the calendar year, so that the plan has a short plan year beginning July 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2017 and a calendar plan year thereafter. In this case—
(A) For the July 1, 2017 actuarial valuation, the shortfall amortization payments with respect to shortfall amortization bases established for all prior plan years are assumed to be paid on July 1, 2017 and anniversaries thereof; and
(B) For the January 1, 2018 actuarial valuation, the shortfall amortization payments with respect to shortfall amortization bases established for all prior plan years are assumed to be paid on January 1, 2018 and anniversaries thereof.
(iv)
Transition rule.
See paragraph (h)(4) of this section for a transition rule under which only a portion of the funding target is taken into account in determining whether a shortfall amortization base is established under this paragraph (c)(2).
(3)
Election of funding relief for certain plans
—(i)
Funding relief under the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010.
See section 430(c)(2)(D) and section 430(c)(7) for special rules that apply to determine the amount of shortfall amortization installments with respect to shortfall amortization bases established for plan years ending on or after October 10, 2009 and beginning before January 1, 2012, for which the relief under section 430(c)(2)(D) is elected.
(ii)
Funding relief related to eligible charity plans.
See section 104(d)(3)(B) through (F) of PPA '06, which reflects amendments made by section 103(b)(2) of the Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act of 2014, Public Law 113-97 (128 Stat. 1137), for special rules that apply to determine the amount of shortfall amortization installments with respect to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, in the case of an eligible charity plan for which the relief under section 104(d)(3)(A) of PPA '06 is elected.
(iii)
Election by commercial passenger airline under section 402(a)(2) of PPA '06.
If an election described in section 402(a)(2) of PPA '06 has been made for an eligible plan described in section 402(c)(1) of PPA '06, then the minimum
required contribution for purposes of section 430 is determined under generally applicable rules, except that the shortfall amortization base for the first plan year for which section 430 applies to the plan is amortized over 10 years (rather than over 7 years as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) in accordance with § 1.430(h)(2)-1(e) and (f) using the interest rates that apply for purposes of determining the target normal cost for the first plan year for which section 430 applies to the plan. In such a case, the shortfall amortization installments with respect to the shortfall amortization base for that plan year will continue to be included in determining the minimum required contribution for 10 years rather than 7 years. See also § 1.430(h)(2)-1(b)(6) for a special rule for determining the funding target in the case of a plan for which an election under section 402(a)(2) of PPA '06 has been made.
(d)
Waiver amortization installments
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the waiver amortization installments with respect to a waiver amortization base established for a plan year are the annual amounts necessary to amortize that waiver amortization base in level annual installments over the 5-year period beginning with the following plan year. See § 1.430(h)(2)-1(e) and (f) for rules regarding interest rates used for determining waiver amortization installments and the date within each plan year on which the installments are assumed to be paid. The waiver amortization installments established with respect to a waiver amortization base are determined using the interest rates that apply for the plan year for which the waiver is granted (even though the first installment with respect to the waiver amortization base is not due until the subsequent plan year) and are not redetermined in subsequent plan years to reflect any changes in the valuation date or changes in interest rates under section 430(h)(2) for those subsequent plan years.
(2)
Waiver amortization base
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a waiver amortization base is established for each plan year for which a waiver of the minimum funding standard has been granted in accordance with section 412(c). The amount of the waiver amortization base is equal to the waived funding deficiency under section 412(c)(3) for the plan year.
(ii)
Transition rule.
See paragraph (h)(3) of this section for the treatment of funding waivers granted for plan years beginning before 2008.
(e)
Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target.
In any case in which the funding shortfall for a plan year is zero, for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution for that plan year and subsequent plan years—
(1) The shortfall amortization bases for all preceding plan years (and all shortfall amortization installments determined with respect to those bases) are reduced to zero; and
(2) The waiver amortization bases for all preceding plan years (and all waiver amortization installments determined with respect to those bases) are reduced to zero.
(f)
Definitions
—(1)
In general.
The definitions set forth in this paragraph (f) apply for purposes of this section.
(2)
Funding shortfall.
The term
funding shortfall
means the excess (if any) of—
(i) The funding target for a plan year; over
(ii) The value of plan assets for the plan year (as reduced to reflect the subtraction of the funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance to the extent provided under § 1.430(f)-1(c), but not below zero).
(3)
Funding target.
The term
funding target
means the plan's funding target for a plan year determined under § 1.430(d)-1(b)(2), § 1.430(i)-1(c), or § 1.430(i)-1(e)(1), whichever applies to the plan for the plan year.
(4)
Target normal cost.
The term
target normal cost
means the plan's target normal cost for a plan year determined under § 1.430(d)-1(b)(1), § 1.430(i)-1(d), or § 1.430(i)-1(e)(2), whichever applies to the plan for the plan year.
(5)
Termination date
—(i)
Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA.
In the case of a plan subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), the termination date means the plan's termination date established under section 4048(a) of ERISA.
(ii)
Other plans
—(A)
In general.
In the case of a plan not subject to Title IV of ERISA, the termination date means the plan's termination date established by the plan administrator, provided that the termination date may be no earlier than the date on which all actions necessary to effect the plan termination (other than the distribution of plan assets) are taken.
(B)
Requirement for prompt distribution.
A plan is not treated as terminated on the applicable date described in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(A) of this section if the assets are not distributed as soon as administratively feasible after that date. Whether distribution of plan assets is made as soon as administratively feasible is to be determined under all the relevant facts and circumstances. In general, distribution of plan assets is deemed to have been made as soon as administratively feasible to the extent that any delay in distribution was because of circumstances outside the control of the plan administrator. However, distribution of plan assets that was delayed merely for the purpose of obtaining a higher value than current market value is generally not deemed to have been made as soon as administratively feasible.
(C)
Presumption applicable to prompt distribution requirement.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(D) of this section, distribution of plan assets which is not completed within one year following the applicable date described in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(A) of this section is presumed not to have been made as soon as administratively feasible.
(D)
Exception to prompt distribution presumption for obtaining determination letter from Commissioner.
A plan is not treated as failing to meet the requirement to distribute plan assets as soon as administratively feasible after the proposed termination date if the delay is attributable to the period of time necessary to obtain a determination letter from the Commissioner on the plan's qualified status upon its termination, provided that the request for a determination letter is timely and the distribution of plan assets is made as soon as administratively feasible after the letter is obtained.
(6)
Transition funding shortfall
—(i)
In general.
The term
transition funding shortfall
means the excess, if any, of—
(A) The applicable percentage of the funding target for a plan year; over
(B) The value of plan assets for the plan year (as reduced to reflect the subtraction of the funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance to the extent provided under § 1.430(f)-1(c), but not below zero).
(ii)
Applicable percentage.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(6), the applicable percentage is determined in accordance with the following table:
Calendar year in which the plan year begins
Applicable percentage
2008
92
2009
94
2010
96
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. Unless otherwise indicated, these examples are based on the following assumptions: Section 430 applies to determine the minimum required contribution for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008; the plan year is the calendar year; the valuation date is January 1; the plan's prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance are equal to $0; the plan sponsor did not elect any funding relief under section 430(c)(2)(D) for any plan year; and the plan has not received any funding waivers for any relevant time periods.

# Example 1.
(i) Plan A has a funding target of $2,500,000 and assets totaling $1,800,000 as of January 1, 2016. For purposes of this example, the segment interest rates used for the January 1, 2016 valuation are assumed to be 5.26% for the first segment interest rate and 5.82% for the second segment interest rate. No shortfall or waiver amortization bases have been established for prior plan years.
(ii) A $700,000 shortfall amortization base is established for 2016, which is equal to the $2,500,000 funding target less $1,800,000 of assets.
(iii) With respect to the new shortfall amortization base of $700,000, there is a shortfall amortization installment of $116,852 (which is the amount necessary to amortize the $700,000 shortfall amortization base over 7 years) for each year from 2016 through 2022. The amount of this shortfall amortization installment is determined by discounting the
first five installments using the first segment interest rate of 5.26%, and by discounting the sixth and seventh installments using the second segment rate of 5.82%.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
, except that the plan was granted a funding waiver for 2014, resulting in five annual waiver amortization installments of $70,000 each, beginning with the 2015 plan year.
(ii) As of January 1, 2016, the present value of the remaining waiver amortization installments is $259,702, which is determined by discounting the remaining four waiver amortization installments of $70,000 each to January 1, 2016, using the first segment rate of 5.26%. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iii) A $440,298 shortfall amortization base is established for 2016, which is equal to the $2,500,000 funding target, less $1,800,000 of assets, less $259,702 (which is the present value of the remaining four waiver amortization installments).
(iv) With respect to this shortfall amortization base of $440,298, there is a shortfall amortization installment of $73,500 (which is equal to the $440,298 shortfall amortization base amortized over 7 years) for each year from 2016 through 2022.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 2
. Plan A has a $100,000 target normal cost for the 2016 plan year and was granted a funding waiver for 2016 to the largest extent permitted under section 412(c).
(ii) If the funding waiver for 2016 had not been granted, the minimum required contribution for 2016 would have been $243,500. This is equal to the $100,000 target normal cost, plus the $70,000 waiver amortization installment from the 2014 waiver, plus the $73,500 January 1, 2016 shortfall amortization installment.
(iii) In accordance with section 412(c)(1)(C), the portion of the minimum required contribution attributable to the amortization of the 2014 funding waiver cannot be waived. Therefore, the maximum amount of the January 1, 2016 minimum required contribution that can be waived is $173,500.
(iv) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, a waiver amortization base of $173,500 is established as of January 1, 2016 to be amortized over 5 years beginning with the 2017 plan year. Although the waiver amortization installments for the 2016 funding waiver are not included in the minimum required contribution until 2017, the amount of those installments is determined based on the interest rates used for the 2016 plan year.
(v) The waiver amortization installments with respect to the 2016 funding waiver are calculated using the first segment interest rate of 5.26% for the first four installments (calculated as of January 1, 2017 through January 1, 2020) and the second segment interest rate of 5.82% for the final installment payable as of January 1, 2021. Accordingly, the waiver amortization installments with respect to the 2016 funding waiver are $40,554 each, payable beginning January 1, 2017.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3
. As of January 1, 2017, Plan A has a funding target of $2,750,000 and assets totaling $1,900,000. For purposes of this example, the first segment rate used for the 2017 valuation is assumed to be 5.50%, the second segment rate is assumed to be 6.00%, and the third segment rate is assumed to be 6.50%.
(ii) As of January 1, 2017, the present value of the remaining three waiver amortization installments with respect to the 2014 waiver is $199,242, which is determined using the first segment rate of 5.50%.
(iii) As of January 1, 2017, the present value of the remaining five waiver amortization installments with respect to the 2016 waiver is $182,701, which is determined using the first segment rate of 5.50%.
(iv) As of January 1, 2017, the present value of the remaining six shortfall amortization installments with respect to the 2016 shortfall amortization base is $386,052, which is determined using the first segment rate of 5.50% for the first five installments and the second segment rate of 6.00% for the sixth installment.
(v) A shortfall amortization base of $82,005 is established for 2017, which is equal to the $2,750,000 funding target, reduced by the sum of $1,900,000 of assets, $199,242 (the present value of the remaining waiver amortization installments with respect to the 2014 waiver), $182,701 (the present value of the remaining waiver amortization installments with respect to the 2016 waiver), and $386,052 (the present value of the remaining installments with respect to the 2016 shortfall amortization base).
(vi) With respect to this shortfall amortization base of $82,005, there is a shortfall amortization installment of $13,766 (which is the amount necessary to amortize the $82,005 shortfall amortization base over 7 years) for each year from 2017 through 2023.

# Example 5.
(i) As of January 1, 2016, a plan has a funding target of $2,500,000, a target normal cost of $175,000, and assets totaling $2,450,000. As of January 1, 2016, there are six remaining installments of $60,000 each with respect to the only shortfall amortization base for the plan, which was established for the 2015 plan year. Also as of January 1, 2016, there are five remaining installments of $25,000 each with respect to the only waiver amortization base for the plan, which was established for the 2015 plan year. For purposes of this example, the segment interest rates used for the January 1, 2016, valuation are assumed to be 5.26% for the first segment interest rate and 5.82% for the second segment interest rate.
(ii) A shortfall amortization base of −$379,812 is established for 2016, which is
equal to the $2,500,000 funding target, reduced by the sum of $2,450,000 of assets, $316,696 (the present value of the remaining installments with respect to the 2015 shortfall amortization base) and $113,116 (the present value of the remaining installments with respect to the 2015 funding waiver).
(iii) The shortfall amortization installment for the 2016 shortfall amortization base is −$63,403, which is the amount necessary to amortize the −$379,812 shortfall amortization base over seven years. The first five shortfall amortization installments are discounted using the first segment rate of 5.26% and the sixth and seventh shortfall amortization installments are discounted using the second segment rate of 5.82%.
(iv) The sum of the shortfall amortization installments is equal to −$3,403 ($60,000 plus −$63,403). However, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution for a plan year, the total of the shortfall amortization installments for a plan year is limited so that it is not less than zero.
(v) The minimum required contribution as of January 1, 2016 is $200,000. This is equal to the sum of the target normal cost of $175,000, the total of the shortfall amortization installments (as limited) of $0, and the waiver amortization installment of $25,000.
(vi) The shortfall amortization bases are not set to zero as of January 1, 2016, even though the sum of the shortfall amortization installments was set to zero for the 2016 plan year. Therefore, as of January 1, 2017 (unless the plan has a funding shortfall of zero as of that date), the shortfall amortization base established as of January 1, 2015 will have five remaining installments of $60,000 each and the shortfall amortization base established as of January 1, 2016 will have six remaining installments of −$ 63,403 each. Similarly, the waiver amortization base will have four remaining installments of $25,000 each.

# Example 6.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 5
, except that Plan A has assets totaling $2,550,000 as of January 1, 2016.
(ii) Because the assets of $2,550,000 exceed the funding target of $2,500,000, no new shortfall amortization base is established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(iii) Furthermore, under paragraph (e) of this section, all shortfall amortization bases and waiver amortization bases (and all shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments associated with those bases) are reduced to zero as of January 1, 2016.
(iv) The minimum required contribution for the 2016 plan year is $125,000, which is equal to the $175,000 target normal cost less the excess of the assets over the funding target ($2,550,000 minus $2,500,000).

# Example 7.
(i) The actuarial valuation for Plan B as of January 1, 2016, based on a 12-month plan year, results in a target normal cost of $110,000 and a shortfall amortization installment for 2016 of $185,000, attributable to a shortfall amortization base established January 1, 2016. There are no other shortfall or waiver amortization bases for Plan B as of January 1, 2016. The plan year for Plan B is changed to April 1 through March 31, effective April 1, 2016, resulting in a short plan year beginning January 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2016.
(ii) The target normal cost for the short plan year is redetermined in order to reflect the fact that there is a short plan year. An actuarial valuation shows that the target normal cost is $25,000 for the short plan year based on the accruals for that short plan year (determined in accordance with 29 CFR 2530.204-2(e)).
(iii) In accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the shortfall amortization base is prorated to reflect the three months covered by the short plan year. Accordingly, the shortfall amortization installment for the short plan year is $46,250 (that is, $185,000 multiplied by 3/12).
(iv) The total minimum required contribution for the short plan year is $71,250 (that is, the sum of the target normal cost of $25,000 plus the shortfall amortization installment of $46,250).

# Example 8.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7
. For purposes of this example, assume that the first segment rate for the plan year beginning April 1, 2016 is 5.30%, and the second segment rate is 5.80%.
(ii) The present value of the remaining shortfall amortization installments with respect to the January 1, 2016 shortfall amortization base is equal to $1,074,937. This is determined by discounting the remaining installments (6 full-year installments of $185,000 each due April 1, 2016 through April 1, 2021, and a final 9-month installment of $138,750 due April 1, 2022) using the first segment rate of 5.30% for the first five installments and the second segment rate of 5.80% for the remaining installments.

# Example 9.
(i) As of January 1, 2016, Plan C has a funding target of $1,100,000, a target normal cost of $20,000, and an actuarial value of assets of $1,150,000. Prior to establishing any shortfall amortization base for 2016, the total of the shortfall amortization installments for 2016 is $30,000 and the present value of the remaining shortfall amortization installments (including installments for the 2016 plan year) is $150,000. Based on the segment rates used for the 2016 plan year, the 7-year amortization factor for any shortfall amortization base established for 2016 is 5.9887. The funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2016 is $40,000 and the
prefunding balance is $60,000. The plan sponsor intends to use both balances to offset the minimum required contribution for 2016.
(ii) In accordance with sections 430(c) and 430(f)(4)(A), the test to determine whether Plan C is exempt from establishing a new shortfall amortization base for 2016 is initially applied based on assets reduced by the prefunding balance, because the plan sponsor intends to use the prefunding balance to offset the minimum required contribution. Therefore, the actuarial value of assets used for this purpose is $1,150,000 minus $60,000, or $1,090,000. This is less than the funding target of $1,100,000, so a new shortfall amortization base is established for 2016.
(iii) The funding shortfall as of January 1, 2016 is the difference between the funding target and the actuarial value of assets, where the actuarial value of assets is reduced by both the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance. Accordingly, the value of assets used for this calculation is $1,050,000 (that is, $1,150,000 − $40,000 − $60,000), and the funding shortfall is $50,000 (that is, $1,100,000 − $1,050,000).
(iv) The shortfall amortization base established as of January 1, 2016 is the difference between the funding shortfall of $50,000 and the $150,000 present value of remaining shortfall amortization installments for bases established in prior years (that is, −$100,000). The shortfall amortization installment attributable to this base is −$100,000 ÷ 5.9887, or −$16,698.
(v) The preliminary minimum required contribution is the sum of the target normal cost, the shortfall amortization installments for bases established prior to 2016, and the shortfall amortization installment for the new base established for 2016, or $33,302 (that is, $20,000 + $30,000−$16,698). However, this amount is less than the funding standard carryover balance. Because section 430(f)(3)(B) and § 1.430(f)-1(d)(2) require that the funding standard carryover balance be used before using the prefunding balance, this means that the full minimum required contribution will be offset without using the prefunding balance. Accordingly, the plan sponsor will not be electing to use any portion of the prefunding balance to offset the minimum required contribution for 2016.
(vi) Because the plan sponsor is not using the prefunding balance to offset the minimum required contribution, the test to determine whether Plan C is exempt from establishing a new shortfall amortization base for 2016 must be applied without subtracting the prefunding balance from the actuarial value of plan assets. Because the full actuarial value of assets of $1,150,000 is higher than the funding target of $1,100,000, the plan is exempt from establishing a new shortfall amortization base for 2016. However, the actuarial value of plan assets is reduced by both balances when determining the funding shortfall, which is used to determine whether the shortfall amortization bases established prior to 2016 are reduced to zero. Because the funding shortfall is greater than zero as of January 1, 2016 (as calculated in paragraph (iii) of this
Example 9
), the shortfall amortization bases established before the 2016 plan year are retained.
(vii) The minimum required contribution for 2016 is the sum of the target normal cost and the shortfall amortization installments, or $50,000 ($20,000 + $30,000). Because this is larger than the funding standard account carryover balance of $40,000, the plan sponsor can only offset $40,000 of the minimum required contribution and must contribute $10,000 to meet the minimum funding requirements. The prefunding balance cannot be used to offset the remaining $10,000 minimum funding requirement because doing so would require recalculating the minimum required contribution as illustrated in paragraphs (ii) through (v) of this
Example 9
and the minimum required contribution would be too small to use the prefunding balance.

# Example 10.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 9
, except that, in lieu of making the cash contribution required in
Example 9
, the plan sponsor elects to reduce the funding standard carryover balance by $9,000.
(ii) Because the plan sponsor intends to use the prefunding balance to offset the minimum required contribution, the test to determine whether Plan C is exempt from establishing a shortfall amortization base for 2016 is based on the actuarial value of assets reduced by the prefunding balance. The actuarial value of assets reduced for the prefunding balance ($1,090,000) is less than the funding target ($1,100,000), so a new shortfall amortization base is established for 2016.
(iii) The remaining funding standard carryover balance is $31,000 (that is, $40,000 minus the elected reduction of $9,000). The funding shortfall as of January 1, 2016 is the difference between the funding target and the actuarial value of assets, where the actuarial value of assets is reduced by both the remaining funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance. Accordingly, the value of assets used for this calculation is $1,059,000 (that is, $1,150,000−$31,000−$60,000), and the funding shortfall is $41,000 (that is, $1,100,000−$1,059,000).
(iv) The shortfall amortization base established as of January 1, 2016 is the difference between the funding shortfall of $41,000 and the $150,000 present value of remaining shortfall amortization installments for bases established in prior years (that is, −$109,000). The shortfall amortization installment attributable to this base is −$109,000 ÷ 5.9887, or −$18,201.
(v) The minimum required contribution is the sum of the target normal cost, the shortfall amortization installments for bases established prior to 2016, and the shortfall amortization installment for the new base established for 2016, or $31,799 (that is, $20,000 + $30,000−$18,201). This amount is larger than the remaining funding standard carryover balance of $31,000. Therefore, the plan sponsor can offset the full minimum required contribution using the remaining $31,000 of the funding standard carryover balance and $799 of the prefunding balance. Because a portion of the prefunding balance is used to offset the minimum required contribution, the test under section 430(c)(5) is applied by subtracting the prefunding balance from the actuarial value of assets as illustrated in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 10
, and no further adjustments are required to the minimum required contribution.

# Example 11.
(i) An amendment to Plan D was adopted during 2015, scheduled to be effective February 1, 2016. The actuary determines that, as of January 1, 2016, the amendment would increase Plan D's funding target by $300,000, if the amendment is permitted to take effect. As of February 1, 2016, prior to taking into account the amendment, the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage (AFTAP) for Plan D is less than 80% but not less than 60%. Plan D's sponsor makes a section 436 contribution (under section 436(c)(2)(A)) of $300,000, adjusted for interest as required under § 1.436-1(f)(2)(i)(A)(
2
), to allow the amendment to take effect.
(ii) Because the plan amendment was adopted prior to the valuation date for 2016 and becomes effective during the 2016 plan year, under § 1.430(d)-1(d)(1)(i), the plan amendment must be taken into account in the funding target as of January 1, 2016. However, because the section 436 contribution is made for the 2016 plan year, it is not included in Plan D's actuarial value of assets as of January 1, 2016.
(iii) The funding shortfall as of January 1, 2016 is calculated as the amount of the funding target (taking into account the plan amendment) minus the actuarial value of assets, where the value of assets is reduced by any funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance as of that date. Because the funding target takes into account the increase of $300,000 attributable to the plan amendment but the actuarial value of assets does not include the section 436 contribution, the funding shortfall is $300,000 higher than it would have been had the plan amendment not been allowed to take effect.
(iv) The funding shortfall as of January 1, 2017 will reflect both the cost of the plan amendment and the value of the section 436 contribution made during 2016. Therefore, in the absence of any other factors affecting the shortfall amortization base, it is expected that a negative shortfall amortization base will be established as of January 1, 2017 as a result of the section 436 contribution made during 2016.

# Example 12.
(i) Plan E has a calendar year plan year and in 2015 had 97 participants. Plan E has a valuation date of July 1. A shortfall amortization base of $300,000 was established with the July 1, 2016 valuation. The plan had no other shortfall or waiver amortization bases. For purposes of this example, assume that the first segment rate for the 2016 plan year is 5.50% and the second segment rate is 6.00%. Accordingly, the shortfall amortization installments are determined as seven annual installments of $50,358 each, payable as of each July 1 beginning July 1, 2016.
(ii) Sometime after January 1, 2016, the number of participants in Plan E increased to over 100 during 2016, and therefore the valuation date was changed to January 1 effective with the 2017 plan year. As of January 1, 2017, Plan E has a funding target of $2,000,000, plan assets of $1,600,000, and a zero funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance. For purposes of this example, assume that as of January 1, 2017, the first segment rate is 5.75% and the second segment rate is 6.25%.
(iii) In accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount of the shortfall amortization installments for the base established July 1, 2016 is not adjusted for the change in valuation date. As of January 1, 2017, the outstanding balance of the shortfall amortization base established as of July 1, 2016 is $263,047, determined as the present value of the remaining shortfall amortization installments, calculated as if the shortfall amortization installments of $50,358 are payable annually on January 1 instead of July 1.
(iv) A new shortfall amortization base of $136,953 is established effective January 1, 2017 equal to the difference between the funding shortfall of $400,000 and the outstanding balance of the shortfall amortization base established as of July 1, 2016 ($263,047). The shortfall amortization installment for this base is calculated as $23,139.
(v) The total shortfall amortization installment for the 2017 plan year is $73,497, equal to the sum of the installments for the shortfall amortization base established July 1, 2016 ($50,358) and the base established January 1, 2017 ($23,139). The total amortization installment is determined as an amount payable as of January 1 regardless of the fact that the installment for the first base was initially calculated as an amount payable on July 1.

# Example 13.
(i) A funding waiver of $300,000 was granted for Plan F for the 2006 plan year. The valuation interest rate for the January 1, 2007 actuarial valuation is 8.50% (which exceeds 150% of the applicable federal mid-
term rate). The first segment rate for the January 1, 2008 valuation of Plan F is 5.26%.
(ii) The waiver amortization charge for the plan year beginning January 1, 2007 is $70,166, which is equal to the $300,000 funding waiver base amortized over 5 years at the valuation interest rate of 8.50%.
(iii) The annual waiver amortization installment for 2008 and later years is equal to the amortization charge for the 2007 plan year, or $70,166. As of January 1, 2008, the present value of the remaining waiver amortization installments is $260,318, which is determined by discounting the remaining four waiver amortization installments of $70,166 to January 1, 2008, using the first segment rate of 5.26%.

# Example 14.
(i) As of January 1, 2008, Plan G has a funding target of $2,500,000, plan assets of $1,800,000 and a funding standard carryover balance of $100,000. Plan G has not received a funding waiver for any past plan year. Plan G was in existence during 2007, and in the 2007 plan year was not subject to the deficit reduction contribution in section 412(l) of the Code as it existed prior to PPA '06.
(ii) Plan G qualifies for the transition rule in section 430(c)(5) of the Code (as in effect prior to amendments made by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, Public Law 113-295, 128 Stat. 4010) and paragraph (h)(4) of this section. Because Plan G's assets are less than 92% of its funding target, a shortfall amortization base must be established as of January 1, 2008.
(iii) Under the transition rule in paragraph (h)(4) of this section, the shortfall amortization base for 2008 is determined using only 92% of Plan G's funding target, or $2,300,000. For purposes of this calculation, the value of assets is reduced by the funding standard carryover balance for a net asset figure of $1,700,000 (that is, $1,800,000 minus $100,000). Accordingly, the shortfall amortization base as of January 1, 2008 is equal to $600,000.
(h)
Effective/applicability dates and transition rules
—(1)
Statutory effective date/applicability date.
Section 430 generally applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The applicability of section 430 for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution is delayed for certain plans in accordance with sections 104 through 106 of PPA '06.
(2)
Effective date/applicability date of regulations.
This section applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2016. For plan years beginning before January 1, 2016, plans are permitted to rely on the provisions set forth in this section for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 430(a).
(3)
Treatment of pre-PPA '06 funding waivers.
In the case of a plan that has received a funding waiver under section 412 for a plan year for which section 430 was not yet effective with respect to the plan for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution, the waiver is treated as giving rise to a waiver amortization base and the amortization charges with respect to that funding waiver are treated as waiver amortization installments as described in paragraph (d) of this section. With respect to such a pre-existing funding waiver, the amount of the waiver amortization installment is equal to the amortization charge with respect to that waiver determined using the interest rate or rates that applied for the pre-effective plan year.
(4)
Transition rule for determining shortfall amortization base
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section, in the case of plan years beginning after December 31, 2007 and before January 1, 2011, for purposes of applying the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section—
(A) The applicable percentage (as described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section) of the funding target is substituted for the funding target; and
(B) The transition funding shortfall is substituted for the funding shortfall.
(ii)
Transition rule not available for new plans or deficit reduction plans.
The transition rule of paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to a plan—
(A) That was not in effect for a plan year beginning in 2007; or
(B) That was subject to section 412(l) for the last plan year beginning during 2007, determined after the application of sections 412(l)(6) and (9) (regardless of whether the deficit reduction contribution for that plan year was equal to zero).
(5)
Pre-effective plan year
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the pre-effective plan year for a plan is the last plan year beginning before section 430 applies to the plan to determine the minimum required contribution. Thus, except for plans with a delayed effective date as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the pre-effective plan year for a plan is the last plan year beginning before January 1, 2008.
(ii)
Eligible charity plans.
An eligible charity plan (as described in section 104(d) of PPA '06, which reflects amendments made by section 202(b)(2) of PRA 2010, Public Law 111-192, 124 Stat. 1280 (June 25, 2010)) that applies section 430 to the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2008 has a pre-effective plan year that is the last plan year beginning before January 1, 2008 and a second pre-effective plan year that is the last plan year that precedes the plan year for which section 430 again applies to the plan. (Section 430 does not apply to such a plan for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2017, unless the plan ceases to be an eligible charity plan, or an election under section 104(d)(2) or 104(d)(4) of PPA '06 is made for the plan not to be treated as an eligible charity plan, as of an earlier date.)

§ 1.430(d)-1
Determination of target normal cost and funding target.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
This section sets forth rules for determining a plan's target normal cost and funding target under sections 430(b) and 430(d), including guidance relating to the rules regarding actuarial assumptions under sections 430(h)(1), 430(h)(4), and 430(h)(5). Section 430 and this section apply to single employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans as defined in section 413(c)) that are subject to section 412, but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section 414(f)). For further guidance on actuarial assumptions,
see
§ 1.430(h)(2)-1 (relating to interest rates) and §§ 1.430(h)(3)-1 and 1.430(h)(3)-2 (relating to mortality tables).
See
also § 1.430(i)-1 for the determination of the funding target and the target normal cost for a plan that is in at-risk status.
(2)
Organization of regulation.
Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth certain definitions that apply for purposes of section 430. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules regarding which benefits are taken into account in determining a plan's target normal cost and funding target. Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the rules regarding the plan provisions that are taken into account in making these determinations, and paragraph (e) of this section provides rules on the plan population that is taken into account for this purpose. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules relating to the actuarial assumptions and the plan's funding method that are used to determine present values. Paragraph (g) of this section contains effective/applicability dates and transition rules.
(3)
Special rules for multiple employer plans.
In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules of section 430 and this section are applied separately for each employer under the plan, as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, the plan's funding target and target normal cost are computed separately for each employer under such a multiple employer plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430 and this section are applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Target normal cost
—(i)
In general.
For a plan that is not in at-risk status under section 430(i) for a plan year, subject to the adjustments described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the
target normal cost
of the plan for the plan year is the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of all benefits under the plan that accrue during, are earned during, or are otherwise allocated to service for the plan year under the applicable rules of this section, including paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B), (C), or (D) of this section.
See
§ 1.430(i)-1(d) and (e)(2) for the determination of the target normal cost for a plan that is in at-risk status.
(ii)
Benefits allocated to a plan year.
The benefits that accrue, are earned, or are otherwise allocated to service for the plan year are based on the actual benefits accrued, earned, or otherwise allocated to service for the plan year through the valuation date and benefits expected to accrue, be earned, or be otherwise allocated to service for the
plan year for the period from the valuation date through the end of the plan year. The benefits that are allocated to the plan year under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section include any increase in benefits during the plan year that is attributable to increases in compensation for the current plan year even if that increase in benefits is with respect to benefits attributable to service performed in a preceding plan year. In addition, the benefits that are allocated to the plan year under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section include any increase in benefits during the plan year that arises on account of mandatory employee contributions (within the meaning of § 1.411(c)-1(c)(4)) that are made during the plan year.
(iii)
Special adjustments
—(A)
In general.
The target normal cost of the plan for the plan year (determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) is adjusted (not below zero) by adding the amount of plan-related expenses expected to be paid from plan assets during the plan year and subtracting the amount of mandatory employee contributions (within the meaning of § 1.411(c)-1(c)(4)) that are expected to be made during the plan year.
(B)
Plan-related expenses.
[Reserved]
(2)
Funding target.
For a plan that is not in at-risk status under section 430(i) for a plan year, the funding target of the plan for the plan year is the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of all benefits under the plan that have been accrued, earned, or otherwise allocated to years of service prior to the first day of the plan year under the applicable rules of this section, including paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B), (C), or (D) of this section.
See
§ 1.430(i)-1(c) and (e)(1) for the determination of the funding target for a plan that is in at-risk status.
(3)
Funding target attainment percentage
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3), the funding target attainment percentage of a plan for a plan year is a fraction (expressed as a percentage)—
(A) The numerator of which is the value of plan assets for the plan year (determined under the rules of § 1.430(g)-1) after subtraction of the prefunding balance and the funding standard carryover balance under section 430(f)(4)(B) and § 1.430(f)-1(c); and
(B) The denominator of which is the funding target of the plan for the plan year (determined without regard to the at-risk rules of section 430(i) and § 1.430(i)-1).
(ii)
Determination of funding target attainment percentage for plans with delayed effective dates.
If section 430 does not apply for purposes of determining the plan's minimum required contribution for a plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2008 (as is the case for a plan described in section 104, 105, or 106 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA '06), Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780)), then the funding target attainment percentage is determined for that plan year in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in the same manner as for a plan to which section 430 applies to determine the plan's minimum required contribution, except that the value of plan assets that forms the numerator under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section is determined without subtraction of the funding standard carryover balance or the credit balance under the funding standard account.
(iii)
Special rule for plans with zero funding target.
If the funding target of the plan is equal to zero for a plan year, then the funding target attainment percentage under this paragraph (b)(3) is equal to 100 percent for the plan year.
(4)
Present value.
The present value of a benefit (including a portion of a benefit) with respect to a participant that is taken into account under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section is determined as of the valuation date by multiplying the amount of that benefit by the probability that the benefit will be paid at a future date and then discounting the resulting product using the appropriate interest rate under § 1.430(h)(2)-1. The probability that the benefit will be paid with respect to the participant at such future date is determined using the actuarial assumptions that satisfy the standards of paragraph (f) of this section as to the probability of future service, advancement in age, and other events (such as death, disability, termination of employment, and selection of optional
form of benefit) that affect whether the participant or beneficiary will be eligible for the benefit and whether the benefit will be paid at that future date.
(c)
Benefits taken into account
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Benefits earned or accrued.
The benefits taken into account in determining the target normal cost and the funding target under paragraph (b) of this section are all benefits earned or accrued under the plan that have not yet been paid as of the valuation date, including retirement-type and ancillary benefits (within the meaning of § 1.411(d)-3(g)). The benefits taken into account are based on the participant's or beneficiary's status (such as active employee, vested or partially vested terminated employee, or disabled participant) as of the valuation date, and those benefits are allocated to the funding target or the target normal cost under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Allocation of benefits
—(A)
In general.
To the extent that the amount of a participant's benefit that is expected to be paid is a function of the accrued benefit, the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made using the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. To the extent that the amount of a participant's benefit that is expected to be paid is not a function of the accrued benefit, but is a function of the participant's years of service (or is the excess of a function of the participant's years of service over a function of the participant's accrued benefit), the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made using the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. To the extent that the amount of a participant's benefit that is expected to be paid is not allocated under the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made using the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section.
(B)
Benefits that are based on accrued benefits.
If the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B), then the portion of a participant's benefit that is taken into account in the funding target for a plan year is determined by applying the function to the accrued benefit as of the first day of the plan year, and the portion of the benefit that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the plan year is determined by applying that function to the increase in the accrued benefit during the plan year. For example, a benefit that is assumed to be payable at a particular early retirement age in the amount of 90 percent of the accrued benefit is taken into account in the funding target in the amount of 90 percent of the accrued benefit as of the beginning of the plan year, and that benefit is taken into account in the target normal cost in the amount of 90 percent of the increase in the accrued benefit during the plan year.
(C)
Benefits that are based on service.
If the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C), then the portion of a participant's benefit that is taken into account in determining the funding target for a plan year is determined by applying the function to the participant's years of service as of the first day of the plan year, and the portion of the benefit that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the plan year is determined by applying that function to the increase in the participant's years of service during the plan year. For example, if a plan provides a post-retirement death benefit of $500 per year of service, then the funding target is determined based on a death benefit of $500 multiplied by a participant's years of service at the beginning of the year, and if the participant earns or is expected to earn a full year of service during the plan year, the target normal cost is based on the additional $500 in death benefits attributable to that additional year of service.
(D)
Other benefits.
If the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made under this paragraph
(c)(1)(ii)(D), then the portion of a participant's benefit that is taken into account in determining the funding target for a plan year is equal to the total benefit multiplied by the ratio of the participant's years of service as of the first day of the plan year to the years of service the participant will have at the time of the event that causes the benefit to be payable (whether the benefit is expected to be paid at the time of that decrement or at a future time), and the portion of the benefit that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the plan year is the increase in the proportionate benefit attributable to the increase in the participant's years of service during the plan year. For example, if a plan provides a Social Security supplement for a participant who retires after 30 years of service that is equal to a participant's Social Security benefit, the funding target with respect to the benefit payable beginning at a particular age (which reflects the probability of retirement at that age) is determined based on the projected Social Security benefit payable at the particular age multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's years of service as of the first day of the plan year and the denominator of which is the participant's projected years of service at the particular age. In such a case, if the participant earns or is expected to earn a full year of service during the plan year, the target normal cost is determined based on the projected Social Security benefit payable at the particular age multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the participant's projected years of service at the particular age.
(iii)
Application of section 436 limitations to funding target and target normal cost determination
—(A)
Effect of limitation on unpredictable contingent event benefits.
The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account any limitation on unpredictable contingent event benefits under section 436(b) with respect to unpredictable contingent events which occurred before the valuation date, but must not take into account anticipated funding-based limitations on unpredictable contingent event benefits under section 436(b) with respect to unpredictable contingent events which are expected to occur on or after the valuation date.
(B)
Effect of limitation on applicability of plan amendments.
See paragraph (d) of this section for rules regarding the treatment of plan amendments that take effect during the plan year taking into account the restrictions under section 436(c).
(C)
Effect of limitation on prohibited payments.
The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account any limitation on prohibited payments under section 436(d) with respect to any annuity starting date that was before the valuation date, but must not take into account any limitation on prohibited payments under section 436(d) for any annuity starting date on or after the valuation date (however, the determination must take into account benefit distributions under plan provisions that allow new annuity starting dates with respect to distributions that were limited under section 436(d)).
(D)
Effect of limitation on benefit accruals.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(D), the determination of the funding target of a plan for a plan year must take into account any limitation on benefit accruals under section 436(e) applicable before the valuation date. However, if the plan terms provide for the automatic restoration of benefit accruals as permitted under § 1.436-1(a)(4)(ii)(B), and the restoration of benefits as of the valuation date will not be treated as resulting from a plan amendment under the rules of § 1.436-1(c)(3) (because the period of limitation as of the valuation date does not exceed 12 months and the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan would not be less than 60 percent taking into account the restored benefit accruals), then the determination of the funding target of a plan for a plan year must not take into account the limitation on benefit accruals under section 436(e) for that period. The determination of the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must not take into account any limitation on benefit
accruals under section 436(e). Thus, if an employer wishes to take a plan freeze into account in determining the target normal cost, the plan must be specifically amended to cease accruals.
(iv)
Effect of other limitations of benefits
—(A)
Liquidity shortfalls.
The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account any restrictions on payments under section 401(a)(32) on account of a liquidity shortfall (as defined in section 430(j)(4)) for periods preceding the valuation date. The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost must not take into account any restrictions on payments under section 401(a)(32) on account of a liquidity shortfall or possible liquidity shortfall for any period on or after the valuation date.
(B)
High 25 limitation.
The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account any restrictions on payments under § 1.401(a)(4)-5(b) to highly compensated employees to the extent that benefits were not paid or will not be paid because of a limitation that applied prior to the valuation date. If a benefit that was otherwise restricted was paid prior to the valuation date but with suitable security (such as an escrow account) provided to the plan in the event of a plan termination, the benefit is treated as distributed for purposes of section 430 and this section. Accordingly, the funding target does not include any liability for the benefit and the plan assets do not include the security. The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must not take into account any restrictions on payments under § 1.401(a)(4)-5(b) to highly compensated employees that are anticipated with respect to annuity starting dates on or after the valuation date on account of the funded status of the plan.
(2)
Benefits provided by insurance
—(i)
General rule.
A plan generally is required to reflect in the plan's funding target and target normal cost the liability for benefits that are funded through insurance contracts held by the plan, and to include the corresponding insurance contracts in plan assets. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section sets forth an alternative to this general approach. A plan's treatment of benefits funded through insurance contracts pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2) is part of the plan's funding method. Accordingly, that treatment can be changed only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(ii)
Separate funding of insured benefits.
As an alternative to the treatment described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, in the case of benefits that are funded through insurance contracts, the liability for benefits provided under such contracts is permitted to be excluded from the plan's funding target and target normal cost, provided that the corresponding insurance contracts are excluded from plan assets. This treatment is only available with respect to insurance purchased from an insurance company licensed under the laws of a State and only to the extent that a participant's or beneficiary's right to receive those benefits is an irrevocable contractual right under the insurance contracts, based on premiums paid to the insurance company prior to the valuation date. For example, in the case of a retired participant receiving benefits from an annuity contract in pay status under which no premiums are required on or after the valuation date, the liability for benefits provided by the contract is permitted to be excluded from the plan's funding target provided that the value of the contract is also excluded from the value of plan assets. Similarly, in the case of an active or deferred vested participant whose benefits are funded by a life insurance or annuity contract under which further premiums are required on or after the valuation date, the liability for benefits, if any, that would be paid from the contract if no further premiums were to be paid (for example, if the contract were to go on reduced paid-up status) is permitted to be excluded from the plan's funding target and target normal cost, provided that the value of the contract is excluded from the value of plan assets. By contrast, if the plan trustee can surrender a contract to the insurer for its cash value, then the participant's or beneficiary's right to receive those benefits is not an irrevocable contractual right and, therefore, the liability
for benefits provided under the contract must be taken into account in determining the plan's funding target and target normal cost and the contracts cannot be excluded from plan assets.
(d)
Plan provisions taken into account
—(1)
General rule
—(i)
Plan provisions adopted by valuation date.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), a plan's funding target and target normal cost for a plan year are determined based on plan provisions that are adopted no later than the valuation date for the plan year and that take effect on or before the last day of the plan year. For example, in the case of a plan amendment adopted on or before the valuation date for the plan year that has an effective date occurring in the current plan year, the plan amendment is taken into account in determining the funding target and the target normal cost for the current plan year if it is permitted to take effect under the rules of section 436(c) for the current plan year, but the amendment is not taken into account for the current plan year if it does not take effect until a future plan year.
(ii)
Plan provisions adopted after valuation date.
If a plan administrator makes the election described in section 412(d)(2) with respect to a plan amendment, then the plan amendment is treated as having been adopted on the first day of the plan year for purposes of this paragraph (d). Section 412(d)(2) applies to any plan amendment adopted no later than 2
1/2
months after the close of the plan year, including an amendment adopted during the plan year. Thus, if an amendment is adopted after the valuation date for a plan year (and no later than 2
1/2
months after the close of the plan year), but takes effect by the last day of the plan year, the amendment is taken into account in determining the plan's funding target and target normal cost for the plan year if the plan administrator makes the election described in section 412(d)(2) with respect to such amendment.
(iii)
Determination of when an amendment takes effect.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), the determination of whether an amendment that increases benefits takes effect and when it takes effect is determined in accordance with the rules of section 436(c) and § 1.436-1(c)(5). For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), in the case of an amendment that decreases benefits, the amendment takes effect under a plan on the first date on which the benefits of any individual who is or could be a participant or beneficiary under the plan would be less than those benefits would be under the pre-amendment plan provisions if the individual were on that date to satisfy the applicable conditions for the benefits. In either case, the determination of when an amendment takes effect is unaffected by an election under section 412(d)(2).
(2)
Special rule for certain amendments increasing liabilities.
In the case of a plan amendment that is not required to be taken into account under the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because it is adopted after the valuation date for the plan year, the plan amendment must be taken into account in determining a plan's funding target and target normal cost for the plan year if the plan amendment—
(i) Takes effect by the last day of the plan year;
(ii) Increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accrual, or changing the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable; and
(iii) Would not be permitted to take effect under the rules of section 436(c) if those rules were applied—
(A) By treating the increase in the target normal cost for the plan year attributable to the amendment (and all other amendments that must be taken into account solely because of the application of the rules in this paragraph (d)(2)) as if the increase were an increase in the funding target for the plan year; and
(B) By taking into account all unpredictable contingent event benefits permitted to be paid for unpredictable contingent events that occurred during the current plan year and all plan amendments that took effect in the current plan year (including all amendments to which this paragraph (d)(2) applies for the plan year).
(3)
Allocation of benefits attributable to plan amendments.
If a plan amendment
is taken into account for a plan year under the rules of this paragraph (d), then the allocation of benefits that is used to determine the funding target and the target normal cost for that plan year is based on the plan as amended. Thus, if an amendment that is taken into account for a plan year increases a participant's accrued benefit for service prior to the beginning of the plan year, then the present value of that increase is included in the funding target for the plan year.
(e)
Plan population taken into account
—(1)
In general.
In making any determination of the funding target or target normal cost under paragraph (b) of this section, the plan population is determined as of the valuation date. The plan population must include three classes of individuals—
(i) Participants currently employed in the service of the employer;
(ii) Participants who are retired under the plan or who are otherwise no longer employed in the service of the employer; and
(iii) All other individuals currently entitled to benefits under the plan.
(2)
Assumption regarding rehiring of former employees
—(i)
Special exclusion for “rule of parity” cases.
Certain individuals may be excluded from the class of individuals described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. The excludable individuals are those former employees who, prior to the valuation date for the plan year, have terminated service with the employer without vested benefits and whose service might be taken into account in future years because the “rule of parity” of section 411(a)(6)(D) does not permit that service to be disregarded. However, if the plan's experience as to separated employees returning to service has been such that the exclusion described in this paragraph (e)(2) would be unreasonable, then no such exclusion is permitted.
(ii)
Application to partially vested participants.
Whether former employees who are terminated with partially vested benefits are assumed to return to service is determined under the same rules that apply to former employees without vested benefits under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Anticipated future participants.
In making any determination of the funding target or target normal cost under paragraph (b) of this section, the actuarial assumptions and funding method used for the plan must not anticipate the affiliation with the plan of future participants not employed in the service of the employer on the plan's valuation date. However, any such determination may anticipate the affiliation with the plan of current employees who have not yet satisfied the participation (age and service) requirements of the plan as of the valuation date.
(f)
Actuarial assumptions and funding method used in determination of present value
—(1)
Selection of actuarial assumptions and funding method
—(i)
General rules.
The determination of any present value or other computation under section 430 and this section must be made on the basis of actuarial assumptions and a funding method. Except as otherwise specifically provided (for example, in § 1.430(h)(2)-1(b)(6) or section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iv) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA)), the same actuarial assumptions and funding method must be used for all computations under sections 430 and 436. For example, the actuarial assumptions and the funding method used in making a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year must be the same as those disclosed on the actuarial report under section 6059 (Schedule SB, “Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Information” of Form 5500, “Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan”).
(ii)
Changes in actuarial assumptions and funding method.
Actuarial assumptions established for a plan year cannot subsequently be changed for that plan year unless the Commissioner determines that the assumptions that were used are unreasonable. Similarly, a funding method established for a plan year cannot subsequently be changed for that plan year unless the Commissioner determines that the use of that funding method for that plan year is impermissible.
(iii)
Procedures for establishing actuarial assumptions and funding method.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1), in the case of a plan for which an actuarial report under section 6059 (Schedule SB of Form 5500) is required to be filed for a plan year, actuarial assumptions and the funding method are established by the filing of the actuarial report if it is filed no later than the due date (with extensions) for the report. In the case of a plan for which an actuarial report for a plan year is not required to be filed, actuarial assumptions and the funding method are established by the delivery of the completed report to the employer if it is delivered no later than what would be the due date (with extensions) for filing the actuarial report were such a filing required. If the actuarial report is not filed or delivered by the applicable date described in the two preceding sentences, then the same actuarial assumptions (such as the same interest rate and mortality table elections) and funding method as were used for the preceding plan year apply for all computations under sections 430 and 436 for the current plan year, unless the Commissioner permits or requires other actuarial assumptions or another funding method permitted under section 430 to be used for the current plan year.
(iv)
Scope of funding method.
A plan's funding method includes not only the overall funding method used by the plan but also each specific method of computation used in applying the overall method. However, the choice of which actuarial assumptions are appropriate to the overall method or to the specific method of computation is not a part of the funding method. The assumed earnings rate used for purposes of determining the actuarial value of assets under section 430(g)(3)(B) is treated as an actuarial assumption, rather than as part of the funding method.
(2)
Interest and mortality rates.
Section 430(h)(2) and § 1.430(h)(2)-1 set forth the interest rates, and section 430(h)(3) and §§ 1.430(h)(3)-1 and 1.430(h)(3)-2 set forth the mortality tables, that must be used for purposes of determining any present value under this section. However, notwithstanding the requirement to use the mortality tables, in the case of a plan which has fewer than 100 participants and beneficiaries who are not in pay status, the actuarial assumptions may assume no pre-retirement mortality, but only if that assumption would be a reasonable assumption.
(3)
Other assumptions.
In the case of actuarial assumptions other than those specified in sections 430(h)(2), 430(h)(3), and 430(i), each of those actuarial assumptions must be reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations). In addition, the actuarial assumptions (other than those specified in sections 430(h)(2), 430(h)(3), and 430(i)) must, in combination, offer the plan's enrolled actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan based on information determined as of the valuation date.
See
paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section for special rules for determining the present value of a single-sum and similar distributions.
(4)
Probability of benefit payments in single sum or other optional forms
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (f)(4) provides rules relating to the probability that benefit payments will be paid as single sums or other optional forms under a plan and the impact of that probability on the determination of the present value of those benefit payments under section 430.
(ii)
General rules of application.
Any determination of present value or any other computation under this section must take into account—
(A) The probability that future benefit payments under the plan will be made in the form of any optional form of benefit provided under the plan (including single-sum distributions), determined on the basis of the plan's experience and other related assumptions, in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section; and
(B) Any difference in the present value of future benefit payments that results from the use of actuarial assumptions in determining the amount of benefit payments in any such optional form of benefit that are different from those prescribed by section 430(h).
(iii)
Single-sum and similar distributions
—(A)
Distributions using section 417(e) assumptions.
In the case of a distribution that is subject to section 417(e)(3) and that is determined using the applicable interest rates and applicable mortality table under section
417(e)(3), for purposes of applying paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, the computation of the present value of that distribution is treated as having taken into account any difference in present value that results from the use of actuarial assumptions that are different from those prescribed by section 430(h) (as required under paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section) if and only if the present value of the distribution is determined in accordance with this paragraph (f)(4)(iii).
(B)
Substitution of annuity form.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f)(4)(iii), the present value of a distribution is determined in accordance with this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) if that present value is determined as the present value, using special actuarial assumptions, of the annuity (either the deferred or immediate annuity) which is used under the plan to determine the amount of the distribution. Under these special assumptions, for the period beginning with the expected annuity starting date for the distribution, the current applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) that would apply to a distribution with an annuity starting date occurring on the valuation date is substituted for the mortality table under section 430(h)(3) that would otherwise be used. In addition, under these special assumptions, the valuation interest rates under section 430(h)(2) are used for purposes of discounting the projected annuity payments from their expected payment dates to the valuation date (as opposed to the interest rates under section 417(e)(3) which the plan uses to determine the amount of the benefit).
(C)
Optional application of generational mortality and phase-in of interest rates.
In determining the present value of a distribution under this paragraph (f)(4)(iii), if a plan uses the generational mortality tables under § 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(4) or § 1.430(h)(3)-2, the plan is permitted to use a 50-50 male-female blend of the annuitant mortality rates under the § 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(4) generational mortality tables in lieu of the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) that would apply to a distribution with an annuity starting date occurring on the valuation date. Similarly, a plan is permitted to make adjustments to the interest rates in order to reflect differences between the phase-in of the section 430(h)(2) segment rates under section 430(h)(2)(G) and the adjustments to the segment rates under section 417(e)(3)(D)(iii).
(D)
Distributions subject to section 417(e)(3) using other assumptions.
In the case of a distribution that is subject to section 417(e)(3) but that is determined on a basis other than using the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3), for purposes of applying paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the computation of present value must take into account the extent to which the present value of the distribution is different from the present value determined using the rules of paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, based on actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If the plan provides that the amount of the benefit is based on a comparison of the section 417(e)(3) benefit (that is, the benefit determined using the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3)) with another benefit determined using some other basis, then paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section is applied as of the valuation date by comparing the present value of the section 417(e)(3) benefit determined under the rules of paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section with the present value of the other benefit. The rule of this paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(D) applies, for example, where a distribution that is subject to section 417(e)(3) is determined as the greater of the benefit determined using the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) and the benefit determined using some other basis, or where the amount of a distribution that is subject to section 417(e)(3) is determined using an interest rate other than the applicable interest rates as required under section 415(b)(2)(E)(ii) (
see
§ 1.417(e)-1(d)(1)).
(5)
Distributions from applicable defined benefit plans under section 411(a)(13)(C)
—(i)
In general.
In the case of an applicable defined benefit plan described in section 411(a)(13)(C), if the amount of a
future distribution is based on an interest adjustment applied to the current accumulated benefit, then the amount of that distribution is determined by projecting the future interest credits or equivalent amount under the plan's interest crediting rules using actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Thus, if a plan provides for a single-sum distribution equal to the balance of a participant's hypothetical account under a cash balance plan, then the amount of that future distribution is equal to the projected account balance at the expected date of payment determined using actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Annuity distributions
—(A)
General rule.
In the case of an applicable defined benefit plan described in section 411(a)(13)(C), if the amount of an annuity distribution is based on either the balance of a hypothetical account maintained for a participant or the accumulated percentage of a participant's final average compensation, then the amount of that annuity distribution is calculated by converting the projected account balance (or accumulated percentage of final average compensation), in accordance with paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, to an annuity by applying the plan's annuity conversion provisions using the rules of this paragraph (f)(5)(ii).
(B)
Use of current annuity factors.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, if the plan bases the conversion of the projected account balance (or accumulated percentage of final average compensation) to an annuity using the applicable interest rates and applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3), then the amount of the annuity distribution is determined by dividing the projected account balance (or accumulated percentage of final average compensation) by an annuity factor corresponding to the assumed form of payment using, for the period beginning with the annuity starting date, the current applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) that would apply to a distribution with an annuity starting date occurring on the valuation date (in lieu of the mortality table under section 430(h)(3) that would otherwise be used) and the valuation interest rates under section 430(h)(2) (as opposed to the interest rates under section 417(e)(3) which the plan uses to determine the amount of the annuity).
(C)
Optional application of generational mortality and phase-in of segment rates.
In determining the amount of an annuity distribution under paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, a plan is permitted to apply the options described in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C) of this section.
(D)
Distributions using assumptions other than assumptions under section 417(e)(3).
In applying this paragraph (f)(5)(ii), in the case of a plan that determines an annuity using a basis other than the applicable interest rates and applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3), the amount of the annuity distribution must be based on actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(6)
Unpredictable contingent event benefits.
Any determination of present value or any other computation under this section must take into account, based on information as of the valuation date, the probability that future benefits (or increased benefits) will become payable under the plan due to the occurrence of an unpredictable contingent event (as described in § 1.436-1(j)(9)). For this purpose, this probability with respect to an unpredictable contingent event may be assumed to be zero if there is not more than a de minimis likelihood that the unpredictable contingent event will occur.
(7)
Reasonable techniques permitted
—(i)
Determination of benefits to be paid during the plan year.
Any reasonable technique can be used to determine the present value of the benefits expected to be paid during a plan year, based on the interest rates and mortality assumptions applicable for the plan year. For example, the present value of a monthly retirement annuity payable at the beginning of each month can be determined—
(A) Using the standard actuarial approximation that reflects 13/24ths of the discounted expected payments for the year as of the beginning of the year
and 11/24ths of the discounted expected payments for the year as of the end of the year;
(B) By assuming a uniform distribution of death during the year; or
(C) By assuming that the payment is made in the middle of the year.
(ii)
Determination of target normal cost.
In the case of a participant for whom there is a less than 100 percent probability that the participant will terminate employment during the plan year, for purposes of determining the benefits expected to accrue, be earned, or otherwise allocated to service during the plan year which are used to determine the target normal cost, it is permissible to assume the participant will not terminate during the plan year, unless using this method of calculation would be unreasonable.
(8)
Approval of significant changes in actuarial assumptions for large plans
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(8)(iii) of this section, any actuarial assumptions used to determine the funding target of a plan for a plan year during which the plan is described in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section cannot be changed from the actuarial assumptions that were used for the preceding plan year without the approval of the Commissioner if the changes in assumptions result in a decrease in the plan's funding shortfall (within the meaning of section 430(c)(4)) for the current plan year (disregarding the effect on the plan's funding shortfall resulting from changes in interest and mortality assumptions under sections 430(h)(2) and (h)(3)) that either exceeds $50,000,000, or exceeds $5,000,000 and is 5 percent or more of the funding target of the plan before such change.
(ii)
Affected plans.
A plan is described in this paragraph (f)(8)(ii) for a plan year if—
(A) The plan is a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to which title IV of ERISA applies; and
(B) The aggregate unfunded vested benefits used to determine variable-rate premiums for the plan year (as determined under section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii) of ERISA) of the plan and all other plans maintained by the contributing sponsors (as defined in section 4001(a)(13) of ERISA) and members of such sponsors' controlled groups (as defined in section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) which are covered by title IV of ERISA (disregarding multiemployer plans and disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000.
(iii)
Automatic approval to resume use of previously used assumptions upon exiting at-risk status during phase-in.
A plan that is not in at-risk status for the current plan year and that was in at-risk status for the prior plan year (but not for a period of 5 or more consecutive plan years) is granted automatic approval to use the actuarial assumptions that were applied before the plan entered at-risk status and that were used in combination with the required at-risk assumptions during the period the plan was in at-risk status.
(9)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. Unless otherwise indicated, these examples are based on the following assumptions: The normal retirement age is 65, the minimum required contribution for the plan is determined under the rules of section 430 starting in 2008, the plan year is the calendar year, the valuation date is January 1, no plan-related expenses are paid or expected to be paid from plan assets, and the plan does not provide for mandatory employee contributions. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) Plan P provides an accrued benefit equal to 1.0% of a participant's highest 3-year average compensation for each year of service. Plan P provides that an early retirement benefit can be received at age 60 equal to the participant's accrued benefit reduced by 0.5% per month for early commencement. On January 1, 2010, Participant A is age 60 and has 12 years of past service. Participant A's compensation for the years 2007 through 2009 was $47,000, $50,000, and $52,000, respectively. Participant A's rate of compensation at December 31, 2009, is $54,000 and A's rate of compensation for 2010 is assumed not to increase at any point during 2010. Decrements are applied at the beginning of the plan year.
(ii) Participant A's annual accrued benefit as of January 1, 2010, is $5,960 [0.01 × 12 × ($47,000 + $50,000 + $52,000) ÷ 3]. Participant A's expected benefit accrual for 2010 is $800 [0.01 × 13 × ($50,000 + $52,000 + $54,000) ÷ 3 − $5,960], to the extent that Participant A is expected to continue in employment for the full 2010 plan year.
(iii) Because the early retirement benefit is a function of the participant's accrued
benefit, the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the target normal cost and funding target is made under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Accordingly, for Participant A, the early retirement benefit that is taken into account with respect to the decrement at age 60 when determining the 2010 funding target is $4,172 [$5,960 accrued benefit × (1 − 0.005 × 60 months)]. The expected accrual of the early retirement benefit during 2010 that is taken into account for Participant A with respect to the decrement at age 60 when determining the 2010 target normal cost is zero, because in this example the age-60 decrement would be applied as of January 1, 2010, before Participant A would earn any additional benefits. (But see paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section for an alternative approach for determining the expected accrual with respect to the decrement at age 60.)
(iv) The early retirement benefit for Participant A with respect to the decrement at age 61 that is taken into account in determining the funding target for the 2010 plan year is $4,529.60 [$5,960 accrued benefit × (1 − 0.005 × 48 months)]. The portion of the early retirement benefit that is taken into account for Participant A with respect to the decrement at age 61 that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the 2010 plan year is $608 [$800 expected annual accrual × (1 − 0.005 × 48 months)].

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
In addition, the plan offers a $500 temporary monthly supplement to participants who complete 15 years of service and retire from active employment after attaining age 60. The temporary supplement is payable until the participant turns age 62. In addition, the supplement is limited so that it does not exceed the participant's Social Security benefit payable at age 62. On January 1, 2010, Participant B is age 55 and has 20 years of past service, and Participant C is age 60 and has 14 years of past service. For Participants B and C, the projected Social Security benefit is greater than $500 per month.
(ii) Because the temporary supplement is not a function of the participant's accrued benefit or service, the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the target normal cost and funding target is made under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. The portion of the annual temporary supplement for Participant B with respect to the early retirement decrement occurring at age 60 that is taken into account in determining the funding target for the 2010 plan year is $4,800 [($500 × 12 months) × 20 years of past service ÷ 25 years of service at assumed early retirement age]. The portion of the annual temporary supplement for Participant B with respect to the early retirement decrement occurring at age 61 that is taken into account in determining the funding target for the 2010 plan year is $4,615 [($500 × 12 months) × 20 years of past service ÷ 26 years of service at assumed early retirement age]. In each case, the allocable portion of the benefit is assumed to be payable until age 62 (or the participant's death, if earlier).
(iii) For Participant B, the portion of the annual temporary supplement with respect to the early retirement decrement occurring at age 60 that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the 2010 plan year is $240 [($500 × 12 months) × 1 year of service expected to be earned during the plan year ÷ 25 years of service at assumed early retirement age]. The portion of the annual temporary supplement with respect to the early retirement decrement occurring at age 61 that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the 2010 plan year is $230.77 [($500 × 12 months) × 1 year of service expected to be earned during the plan year ÷ 26 years of service at assumed early retirement age]. The present value of these amounts reflects a payment period beginning with the decrement at age 60 or 61, as applicable, until age 62 (or assumed death, if earlier).
(iv) For Participant C, the portion of the annual temporary supplement with respect to the early retirement decrement occurring at age 61 (when the participant is first eligible for the benefit) that is taken into account in determining the funding target for the 2010 plan year is $5,600 [($500 × 12 months) × 14 years of past service ÷ 15 years of service at assumed early retirement age]. The present value of this amount reflects a payment period beginning with the decrement at age 61 until age 62 (or death if earlier).

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
The plan also provides a single-sum death benefit (in addition to the qualified pre-retirement spouse's benefit) equal to the greater of the participant's annual accrued benefit at the time of death, or $10,000. The benefit is limited as necessary to ensure that the plan meets the incidental death benefit requirements of section 401(a).
(ii) The determination of the portion of the death benefit that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost and funding target is made under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section to the extent that it is a function of the participant's accrued benefit and under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section to the extent that it relates to the part of the death benefit that is not a function of the participant's accrued benefit.
(iii) The portion of the single-sum death benefit corresponding to the accrued benefit, or $5,960, is taken into account when determining the 2010 funding target for Participant A.
(iv) The excess of the death benefit over Participant A's accrued benefit is $4,040 (that is, $10,000 − $5,960). Because this part of the
death benefit is not a function of the participant's accrued benefit nor is it a function of service, the determination of the corresponding portion of the death benefit taken into account in determining the target normal cost and funding target for 2010 is made under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. For example, for Participant A, the portion of this benefit with respect to the death decrement occurring at age 64 that is taken into account for purposes of determining the funding target for the 2010 plan year is $3,030 ($4,040 × 12 years of past service ÷ 16 years of service at assumed age of death).
(v) The total single-sum death benefit for Participant A with respect to the death decrement at age 64 that is taken into account in determining the funding target for the 2010 plan year is $8,990 ($5,960 + $3,030).
(vi) Similarly, the portion of the single-sum death benefit for Participant A that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the 2010 plan year is equal to the sum of the expected increase in the accrued benefit during 2010, and the expected change in the allocable portion of the excess death benefit attributable to service during 2010 as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. As described in
Example 1,
the expected increase in Participant A's accrued benefit during 2010 is $800, to the extent that Participant A is expected to continue in employment for the full 2010 plan year.
(vii) At the end of 2010, Participant A's accrued benefit is expected to be $6,760 ($5,960 + $800). The excess portion of the single-sum death benefit to be allocated in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section is $3,240 ($10,000 − $6,760), and the allocable portion of the excess benefit for Participant A as of December 31, 2010, with respect to the death decrement at age 64, is $2,632.50 ($3,240 × 13 years of service as of December 31, 2010 ÷ 16 years of service at assumed age of death). The change in the allocable portion of Participant A's excess death benefit due to an additional year of service, with respect to the death decrement at age 64, is a decrease of $397.50. Therefore, the target normal cost for the 2010 plan year attributable to Participant A, with respect to the death decrement at age 64, will reflect a single-sum death benefit of $402.50 ($800 expected increase in Participant A's accrued benefit minus a $397.50 expected decrease in the allocable portion of the death benefit in excess of the accrued benefit).

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that the plan provides a single-sum death benefit equal to the greater of the present value of the qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity or 100 times the amount of the participant's monthly retirement benefit with service projected to normal retirement age. The valuation is based on the assumption that all surviving spouses choose to receive their benefit in the form of a single sum. For Participant A, the value of the qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity is less than 100 times Participant A's projected monthly retirement benefit.
(ii) The allocation of the death benefit that is a function of Participant A's accrued benefit is based on service and compensation to the first day of the plan year for purposes of determining the funding target, and the allocation of the death benefit that is a function of the increase in Participant A's accrued benefit during the plan year for purposes of determining the target normal cost is made in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. As described in
Example 1,
Participant A's accrued benefit based on service and compensation as of January 1, 2010, is $5,960, or $496.67 per month. Accordingly, the portion of the single-sum death benefit corresponding to the accrued benefit, or $49,667 (100 times $496.67), is taken into account when determining the 2010 funding target for Participant A.
(iii) In addition, the funding target and the target normal cost reflect a portion of Participant A's death benefit in excess of the amount based on Participant A's accrued benefit. Based on Participant A's average compensation as of the first day of the plan year, Participant A's accrued benefit with service projected to normal retirement is $8,443 [.01 × 17 years of service at age 65 × ($47,000 + $50,000 + $52,000) ÷ 3], or $703.61 per month. The corresponding death benefit is $70,361.
(iv) The excess of the death benefit over Participant A's accrued benefit as of January 1, 2010, is $20,694 (that is, $70,361 − $49,667). Because this part of the death benefit is not a function of Participant A's accrued benefit or service, the portion that is taken into account in determining the funding target is determined under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. For Participant A, the portion of this benefit with respect to the death decrement occurring at age 64 that is taken into account when determining the funding target for the 2010 plan year is $15,521 ($20,694 × 12 years of past service ÷ 16 years of service at assumed age of death). The total single-sum death benefit for Participant A with respect to the death decrement at age 64 reflected in the funding target for the 2010 plan year is $65,188 ($49,667 + $15,521).
(v) Similarly, the portion of the single-sum death benefit for Participant A that is taken into account when determining the target normal cost for 2010 is equal to the sum of the death benefit based on the expected increase in the accrued benefit during 2010 and the expected change in the allocable portion of the excess death benefit attributable to
service during 2010 as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section.
(vi) At the end of 2010, Participant A's accrued benefit is expected to be $6,760 ($5,960 + $800), or $563.33 per month, and the associated death benefit is $56,333. The expected increase in the amount of the death benefit attributable to the increase in Participant A's accrued benefit is therefore $6,666 ($56,333 − $49,667).
(vii) Participant A's projected accrued benefit at normal retirement based on average compensation as of the end of 2010 is $8,840 [.01 × 17 years of service at age 65 × ($50,000 + $52,000 + $54,000) ÷ 3], or $736.67 per month. The corresponding death benefit is $73,667. The excess portion of the single-sum death benefit to be allocated in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section is $17,334 ($73,667 − $56,333), and the allocable portion of the excess benefit for Participant A as of December 31, 2010, with respect to the death decrement at age 64, is $14,084 ($17,334 × 13 years of service as of December 31, 2010 ÷ 16 years of service at assumed age of death).
(viii) The change in the allocable portion of Participant A's excess death benefit during 2010, with respect to the death decrement at age 64, is a decrease of $1,437 ($14,084 − $15,521). Therefore, the target normal cost for the 2010 plan year attributable to Participant A, with respect to the death decrement at age 64, will reflect a single-sum death benefit of $5,229 ($6,666 expected increase in Participant A's death benefit based on the expected increase in the accrued benefit, minus an expected decrease of $1,437 in the amount of the death benefit in excess of the amount attributable to the accrued benefit).

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
In addition, the plan provides a disability benefit to participants who become disabled after completing 15 years of service. The disability benefit is payable at normal retirement age or an earlier date if elected by a participant. For purposes of calculating the disability benefit, service continues to accrue until normal retirement age (unless recovery or commencement of retirement benefits occurs earlier). Further, compensation is deemed to continue at the same rate as when the disability began.
(ii) Participant A will be eligible for the disability benefit at age 63 after completion of 15 years of service. Participant A's annual disability benefit at normal retirement age is $9,180 (that is, 1% of highest 3-year average compensation of $54,000 multiplied by 17 years of deemed service at normal retirement age).
(iii) The portion of the disability benefit based on the participant's accrued benefit as of the valuation date that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost and funding target is determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Accordingly, the portion of the disability benefit corresponding to Participant A's accrued benefit as of January 1, 2010, or $5,960, is taken into account when determining the 2010 funding target.
(iv) The excess of Participant A's disability benefit over the accrued benefit as of January 1, 2010, is $3,220 ($9,180 − $5,960). Because this portion of the disability benefit is not based on Participant A's accrued benefit or service, the portion that is taken into account in determining the funding target is determined under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. The portion of Participant A's excess disability benefit with respect to the disability decrement occurring at age 63 that is taken into account when determining the 2010 funding target is $2,576 [$3,220 × (12 years of past service ÷ 15 years of service at assumed date of disability)]. The total disability benefit for Participant A, with respect to the disability decrement occurring at age 63, that is taken into account in determining the funding target for the 2010 plan year is $8,536 ($5,960 + $2,576).
(v) The portion of Participant A's disability benefit with respect to the disability decrement occurring at age 64 that is taken into account when determining the 2010 funding target is $8,375 [$5,960 + $3,220 × (12 years of past service ÷ 16 years of service at assumed date of disability)].
(vi) If in fact Participant A becomes disabled at age 63, the funding target will reflect the full disability benefit to which Participant A will be entitled at normal retirement age, based on service projected to normal retirement age (17 years) and final average compensation reflecting compensation projected to normal retirement age at the rate Participant A was earning at the time of disablement.

# Example 6.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 5,
except that the disability benefit is based on the accrued benefit calculated using service and compensation earned to the date of disability.
(ii) Because the disability benefit is a function of the participant's accrued benefit, the portion of Participant A's disability benefit that is taken into account when determining the funding target for the 2010 plan year is Participant A's annual accrued benefit as of January 1, 2010, or $5,960, as determined in
Example 1.
This amount is taken into account for both the disability decrement occurring at age 63 and the disability decrement occurring at age 64.
(iii) Similarly, the benefit accrual for Participant A with respect to the disability decrements occurring at age 63 and age 64 that is taken into account when determining the target normal cost for the 2010 plan year is equal to Participant A's expected benefit accrual for 2010 determined in
Example 1,
or $800.

# Example 7.
(i) Retiree D, a participant in Plan P, is a male age 72 and is receiving a $100 monthly straight life annuity. The 2009 actuarial valuation is performed using the segment rates applicable for September 2008 (determined without regard to the transition rule of section 430(h)(2)(G)), and the 2009 annuitant and nonannuitant (male and female) mortality tables (published in Notice 2008-85). See § 601.601(d)(2) relating to objectives and standards for publishing regulations, revenue rulings and revenue procedures in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(ii) The present value of Retiree D's straight life annuity on the valuation date is $10,535.79. This is equal to the sum of: $5,029.99, which is the present value of payments expected to be made during the first 5 years, using the first segment interest rate of 5.07%; $5,322.26, which is the present value of payments expected to be made during the next 15 years, using the second segment interest rate of 6.09%; and $183.54, which is the present value of payments expected to be made after 20 years, using the third segment interest rate of 6.56%.

# Example 8.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7.
Plan P does not provide for early retirement benefits or single-sum distributions. The actuary assumes that no participants terminate employment prior to age 50 (other than by death), there is a 5% probability of withdrawal at age 50, and that those participants who withdraw receive a deferred annuity starting at age 65. Participant E is a male age 46 on January 1, 2009, and has an annual accrued benefit of $23,000 beginning at age 65.
(ii) Before taking into account the 5% probability of withdrawal, the funding target associated with Participant E's assumed age 50 withdrawal benefit in the 2009 actuarial valuation is $68,396.75. This is equal to the sum of: $6,925.29, which is the present value of payments expected to be made during the year the participant turns age 65 (the 20th year after the valuation date), using the second segment interest rate of 6.09%; and $61,471.46, which is the present value of payments expected to be made after the 20th year, using the third segment interest rate of 6.56%.
(iii) Taking the 5% probability of withdrawal into account, the funding target for the 2009 plan year associated with Participant E's assumed age 50 withdrawal benefit is $3,419.84 ($68,396.75 × 5%).

# Example 9.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 8,
except the plan offers a single-sum distribution payable at normal retirement age (age 65) determined based on the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3). The actuary assumes that 70% of the participants will elect a single sum upon retirement and the remaining 30% will elect a straight life annuity.
(ii) Before taking into account the 5% probability of withdrawal or the 70% probability of electing a single-sum payment, the portion of the 2009 funding target that is attributable to Participant E's assumed single-sum payment, deferred to age 65, is $70,052.30. This is calculated in the same manner as the present value of annuity payments, except that, for the period after the annuity starting date, the 2009 applicable mortality rates are substituted for the 2009 male annuitant mortality rates. This portion of the funding target for the 2009 plan year is equal to the sum of: $6,929.00, which is the present value of annuity payments expected to be made between age 65 and 66 (during the 20th year after the valuation date), using the second segment interest rate of 6.09%; and $63,123.30, which is the present value of annuity payments expected to be made after the 20th year following the valuation date, using the third segment interest rate of 6.56%. These present value amounts reflect the 2009 male nonannuitant mortality rates prior to the assumed commencement of benefits at age 65 and the 100% probability of retiring at age 65.
(iii) Taking the 5% probability of withdrawal and the 70% probability of electing a single-sum payment into account, the portion of the 2009 funding target attributable to Participant E's assumed single-sum payment based on withdrawal at age 50 is $2,451.83 ($70,052.30 × 5% × 70%). After taking into account the 5% probability of withdrawal and the 30% probability of electing a straight life annuity, the portion of the 2009 funding target that is attributable to Participant E's assumed straight life annuity (based on assumed withdrawal at age 50), deferred to age 65, is equal to 30% of the result obtained in
Example 8.

# Example 10.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 9,
except the plan offers an immediate single sum upon withdrawal at age 50 determined based on the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3). The actuary assumes that 70% of the participants will elect to receive a single-sum distribution upon withdrawal.
(ii) Before taking into account the 5% probability of withdrawal and the 70% probability of electing a single-sum payment, the portion of the funding target for the 2009 plan year that is attributable to Participant E's assumed single-sum payment based on withdrawal at age 50 is $68,908.39. This is calculated in the same manner as the present value of annuity payments, except that the 2009 applicable mortality rates are substituted for the 2009 male annuitant and nonannuitant mortality rates after the annuity starting date. This portion of the 2009 funding target is equal to the sum of $6,815.85, which is the present value of annuity payments expected to be made between age 65
and 66 (during the 20th year after the valuation date), using the second segment interest rate of 6.09%, and $62,092.54, which is the present value of annuity payments expected to be made after the 20th year following the valuation date, using the third segment interest rate of 6.56%. These present value amounts reflect the 2009 male nonannuitant mortality rates prior to the assumed single-sum distribution age of 50.
(iii) Applying the 5% probability of withdrawal at age 50 and the 70% probability of electing a single-sum payment, the portion of the funding target for the 2009 plan year that is attributable to Participant E's assumed single-sum payment (based on withdrawal at age 50) is $2,411.79 ($68,908.39 × 5% × 70%).

# Example 11.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 8,
except that the plan sponsor elects under section 430(h)(2)(D)(ii) to use the monthly corporate bond yield curve instead of segment rates. The enrolled actuary assumes payments are made monthly throughout the year and uses the interest rate from the middle of the monthly corporate bond yield curve because this mid-year yield rate most closely matches the average timing of benefits paid. In accordance with § 1.430(h)(2)-1(e)(4), the applicable monthly corporate bond yield curve is the yield curve derived from December 2008 rates.
(ii) Before taking into account the 5% probability of withdrawal, the funding target associated with Participant E's assumed age 50 withdrawal benefit in the 2009 actuarial valuation is $67,394.12. This reflects the sum of each year's expected payments, discounted at the yield rates described in paragraph (i) of this

(iii) Applying the 5% probability of withdrawal, the portion of the funding target for the 2009 plan year attributable to Participant E's assumed withdrawal at age 50 is $3,369.71 ($67,394.12 × 5%).

# Example 12.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 10,
except that the plan determines the amount of the immediate single-sum distribution upon withdrawal at age 50 based on the applicable interest rates under section 417(e)(3) or an interest rate of 6.25%, whichever produces the higher amount. The applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) is used for both calculations.
(ii) Before taking into account the 5% probability of withdrawal and the 70% probability of electing a single-sum payment, the present value of Participant E's single-sum distribution as of January 1, 2009, using an interest rate of 6.25%, based on withdrawal at age 50, is $77,391.88. This amount is determined by calculating the projected single-sum distribution at age 50 using the applicable mortality rate under section 417(e)(3) and an interest rate of 6.25%, or $94,789.10, and discounting the result to the January 1, 2009, valuation date using the first segment rate of 5.07% (because the single-sum distribution is assumed to be paid 4 years after the valuation date) and the male non-annuitant mortality rates for 2009.
(iii) Before taking into account the 5% probability of withdrawal and the 70% probability of electing a single-sum payment, the present value as of January 1, 2009, of Participant E's age-50 single-sum distribution using the applicable interest rates and applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) is $68,908.39, as developed in
Example 10.
Corresponding to plan provisions, the present value reflected in the funding target is the larger of this amount or the present value of the amount based on a 6.25% interest rate, or $77,391.88.
(iv) Applying the 5% probability of withdrawal at age 50 and the 70% probability of electing a single-sum payment, the portion of the funding target for the 2009 plan year that is attributable to Participant E's assumed single-sum payment (based on withdrawal at age 50) is $2,708.72 ($77,391.88 × 5% × 70%).

# Example 13.
(i) Plan Q is a cash balance plan that permits an immediate payment of a single sum equal to the participant's hypothetical account balance upon termination of employment. Plan Q's terms provide that the hypothetical account is credited with interest at a market-related rate, based on a specified index. The January 1, 2009, actuarial valuation is performed using the 24-month average segment rates applicable for September 2008 (determined without regard to the transition rule of section 430(h)(2)(G)). Participant F is a male age 61 on January 1, 2009, and has a hypothetical account balance equal to $150,000 on that date. In the 2009 actuarial valuation, the enrolled actuary assumes that the hypothetical account balances will increase with annual interest
credits of 7% until the participant commences receiving his or her benefit, corresponding to the actuary's best estimate of future interest rates credited under the terms of the plan. The actuary also assumes that all participants will retire on the first day of the plan year in which they attain age 65 (that is, no participant will terminate employment prior to age 65 other than by death), and that 100% of participants will elect a single sum upon retirement.
(ii) Participant F's hypothetical account balance projected to January 1, 2013 (the plan year in which F attains age 65) is $196,619.40 based on the assumed annual interest crediting rate of 7%. The funding target for the 2009 plan year attributable to Participant F's benefit at age 65 is $158,525.81, which is calculated by discounting the projected hypothetical account balance of $196,619.40 using the first segment rate of 5.07% and the male non-annuitant mortality rates.

# Example 14.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 13,
except that the actuary assumes that 10% of the participants will choose to collect their benefits in the form of a straight life annuity. The plan provides that the participant's account balance at retirement is converted to an annuity using the applicable interest rates and applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3).
(ii) Participant F's hypothetical account balance projected to January 1, 2013 (the plan year in which F attains age 65) is $196,619.40, as outlined in
Example 13.
This amount is converted to an annuity payable commencing at age 65 by dividing the projected account balance by an annuity factor based on the applicable mortality table for 2009 under section 417(e)(3) (corresponding to the valuation date) and the interest rates used for the valuation. The resulting annuity factor is 10.8321, reflecting one year of interest at the first segment rate (5.07%) corresponding to the first year of the expected annuity payments (the fifth year after the valuation date), 15 years of interest at the second segment rate (6.09%) and all remaining years at the third segment rate (6.56%). The projected future annuity is therefore $196,619.40 divided by 10.8321, or $18,151.55 per year.
(iii) Before taking into account the 10% probability that the participant will elect to take the distribution in the form of a lifetime annuity, the funding target associated with the future annuity payout for Participant F is $149,120.41. This is equal to the sum of $14,242.79, which is the present value of the annuity payment expected to made during the year the participant turns age 65 (the 5th year after the valuation date), using the first segment interest rate of 5.07%; $116,321.72, which is the present value of payments expected to be made during the 6th through the 20th years following the valuation date, using the second segment interest rate of 6.09%; and $18,555.90, which is the present value of payments expected to be made after the 20th year following the valuation date, using the third segment interest rate of 6.56%.
(iv) Applying the 10% probability of electing a lifetime annuity, the portion of the 2009 funding target attributable to Participant F's assumed lifetime annuity payable at age 65 is $14,912.04. The portion of the 2009 funding target attributable to Participant F's assumed single-sum payment is 90% of the result obtained in
Example 13.

# Example 15.
(i) Plan H provides a monthly benefit of $50 times service for all participants. Plan H has a funding target of $1,000,000 and an actuarial value of assets of $810,000 as of January 1, 2010. No annuity contracts have been purchased, and Plan H has no funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance as of January 1, 2010. The enrolled actuary certifies that the January 1, 2010, AFTAP is 81%. Effective July 1, 2010, Plan H is amended on June 14, 2010, to increase the plan's monthly benefit to $55 for years of service earned on or after July 1, 2010. The present value of the increase in plan benefits during 2010 (reflecting benefit accruals attributable to the six months between July 1, 2010, and December 31, 2010) is $25,000.
(ii) The amendment increases benefits for future service only, and so the funding target is unaffected. Since section 436(c) only restricts plan amendments that increase plan liabilities, the plan amendment can take effect.
(iii) If the $25,000 present value of the increase in plan benefits during 2010 were included in Plan H's funding target of $1,000,000, the total would be $1,025,000, and the AFTAP would be 79.02% (that is, $810,000/$1,025,000). Since this is less than 80%, the amendment would not have been permitted to take effect if the 2010 increase were included in the funding target instead of target normal cost.
(iv) Because the amendment was adopted after the January 1, 2010, valuation date, the plan sponsor would generally have the option of deciding whether to reflect this amendment in the January 1, 2010, valuation or defer recognition of the amendment to the January 1, 2011, valuation. However, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, because the plan amendment would not have been permitted to take effect under the provisions of section 436 if the increase in the target normal cost for the plan year had been taken into account in the funding target, the actuary must take into account the amendment in the January 1, 2010, valuation for purposes of section 430. Thus, the target normal cost for the plan year includes the $25,000 that results from the plan amendment.
(g)
Effective/applicability dates and transition rules
—(1)
Statutory effective date/applicability date
—(i)
In general.
Section 430 generally applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The applicability of section 430 for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution is delayed for certain plans in accordance with sections 104 through 106 of PPA '06.
(ii)
Applicability of special adjustments.
The special adjustments of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section (relating to adjustments to the target normal cost for plan-related expenses and mandatory employee contributions) apply to plan years beginning after December 31, 2008. In addition, a plan sponsor may elect to make the special adjustments of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for a plan year beginning in 2008. This election must take into account both adjustments described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. This election is subject to the same rules that apply to an election to add an amount to the plan's prefunding balance pursuant to § 1.430(f)-1(f), and it must be made in the same manner as the election made under § 1.430(f)-1(f). Thus, the election can be made no later than the last day for making the minimum required contribution for the plan year to which the election relates.
(2)
Effective date/applicability date of regulations.
This section applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2010, regardless of whether section 430 applies to determine the minimum required contribution for the plan year. For plan years beginning before January 1, 2010, plans are permitted to rely on the provisions set forth in this section for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 430.
(3)
Approval for changes in funding method
—(i)
2008 plan year.
Any changes in a plan's funding method that are made for the first plan year beginning in 2008 that are not inconsistent with the requirements of section 430 are treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and do not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval.
(ii)
Application of this section
—(A)
First plan year for which regulations are effective.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, any change in a plan's funding method for the first plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2010, is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval.
(B)
Optional earlier application of regulations.
For the first plan year that a plan applies all the provisions of this section, §§ 1.430(f)-1, 1.430(g)-1, 1.430(i)-1, and 1.436-1, any change in a plan's funding method for that plan year is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval. For example, if the change in funding method includes a change in the valuation software, the change in the valuation software is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval. If that plan year begins before January 1, 2010, the automatic approval for a change in funding method under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply to the plan.
(C)
Special rule for changes in allocation.
Any change in a plan's funding method for a plan year earlier than the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2010, that is necessary to apply the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval.
(iii)
First plan year for which section 430 applies to determine minimum funding.
For a plan for which the minimum required contribution is not determined under section 430 for the first plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2008, pursuant to sections 104 through 106 of PPA '06, any change in a plan's funding method for the first plan year to which section 430 applies to determine the plan's minimum required contribution is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval.
(4)
Approval for changes in actuarial assumptions.
The Commissioner's specific prior approval is not required with respect to any actuarial assumptions that are adopted for the first plan year
for which section 430 applies to determine the minimum required contribution for the plan and that are not inconsistent with the requirements of section 430.
(5)
Transition rule for determining funding target attainment percentage for the 2007 plan year
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2008, the funding target attainment percentage for the plan's prior plan year (the 2007 plan year) is determined as the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the value of plan assets determined under paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, and the denominator of which is the plan's current liability determined pursuant to section 412(l)(7) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06) as of the valuation date for the 2007 plan year.
(ii)
Determination of value of plan assets
—(A)
In general.
The value of plan assets for the 2007 plan year under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(A) is determined as the value of plan assets as described in paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, reduced by the plan's funding standard account credit balance for the 2007 plan year as described in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section except to the extent provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Value of plan assets.
The value of plan assets for the 2007 plan year under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is determined under section 412(c)(2) as in effect for the 2007 plan year, except that the value of plan assets prior to subtracting the plan's funding standard account credit balance described in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section must be adjusted so that it is neither less than 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets nor greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date for that plan year. If the value of plan assets prior to adjustment under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is less than 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date, then the value of plan assets under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is equal to 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets. If the value of plan assets determined under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date, then the value of plan assets under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is equal to 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets.
(iii)
Subtraction of credit balance
—(A)
In general.
If a plan has a funding standard account credit balance as of the valuation date for the 2007 plan year, then, except as described in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, that balance is subtracted from the value of plan assets described in paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) of this section as of that valuation date to determine the value of plan assets for the 2007 plan year. However, the value of plan assets is not reduced below zero.
(B)
Effect of funding standard carryover balance reduction for the 2008 plan year.
Notwithstanding the rules of paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, for the first plan year beginning in 2008, if the employer has made an election to reduce some or all of the funding standard carryover balance as of the first day of that year in accordance with § 1.430(f)-1(e), then the present value (determined as of the valuation date for the 2007 plan year using the valuation interest rate for that 2007 plan year) of the amount so reduced is not treated as part of the funding standard account credit balance when that balance is subtracted from the value of plan assets pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.
[T.D. 9467, 74 FR 53035, Oct. 15, 2009]
§ 1.430(f)-1
Effect of prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
This section provides rules relating to the application of prefunding and funding standard carryover balances under section 430(f). Section 430 and this section apply to single employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans) that are subject to section 412, but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section 414(f)). Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth rules regarding a plan's prefunding balance and a plan sponsor's election to maintain a funding standard carryover balance. Paragraph (c) of this section
provides rules under which those balances must be subtracted from plan assets. Paragraph (d) of this section describes a plan sponsor's election to use those balances to offset the minimum required contribution. Paragraph (e) of this section describes a plan sponsor's election to reduce those balances (which will affect the determination of the value of plan assets for purposes of sections 430 and 436). Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth rules regarding elections under this section. Paragraph (g) of this section contains examples. Paragraph (h) of this section contains effective/applicability dates and transition rules.
(2)
Special rules for multiple employer plans.
In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules of this section are applied separately for each employer under the plan, as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, each employer under such a multiple employer plan may have a separate funding standard carryover balance and a prefunding balance for the plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of this section are applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.
(b)
Maintenance of balances
—(1)
Prefunding balance
—(i)
In general.
A plan sponsor is permitted to elect to maintain a prefunding balance for a plan. A prefunding balance maintained for a plan consists of a beginning balance of zero, increased by the amount of excess contributions to the extent the employer elects to do so as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, and decreased to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. The plan sponsor's initial election to add to the prefunding balance under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section constitutes an election to maintain a prefunding balance. The prefunding balance is adjusted further for investment return and interest as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Increases
—(A)
In general.
If the plan sponsor of a plan elects to add to the plan's prefunding balance, as of the first day of a plan year following the first effective plan year for the plan, the prefunding balance is increased by the amount so elected by the plan sponsor for the plan year. The amount added to the prefunding balance cannot exceed the present value of the excess contributions for the preceding plan year determined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, increased for interest in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.
(B)
Present value of excess contribution.
The present value of the excess contribution for the preceding plan year is the excess, if any, of—
(
1
) The present value (determined under the rules of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B) of this section) of the employer contributions (other than contributions to avoid or terminate benefit limitations described in § 1.436-1(f)(2)) to the plan for such preceding plan year; over
(
2
) The minimum required contribution for such preceding plan year.
(C)
Treatment of unpaid minimum required contributions.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), a contribution made during a plan year to correct an unpaid minimum required contribution (within the meaning of section 4971(c)(4)) for a prior plan year is not treated as a contribution for the current plan year.
(iii)
Decreases.
As of the first day of each plan year, the prefunding balance of a plan is decreased (but not below zero) by the sum of—
(A) Any amount of the prefunding balance that was used under paragraph (d) of this section to offset the minimum required contribution of the plan for the preceding plan year; and
(B) Any reduction in the prefunding balance under paragraph (e) of this section for the plan year.
(iv)
Adjustments for interest
—(A)
Adjustment of excess contribution.
The present value of the excess contribution for the preceding year (as determined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section) is increased for interest accruing for the period between the valuation date for the preceding plan year and the first day of the current
plan year. For this purpose, interest is determined by using the plan's effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the preceding plan year, except to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
(B)
Determination of present value.
The present value of the contributions described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section is determined as of the valuation date for the preceding plan year, using the plan's effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the preceding plan year.
(2)
Funding standard carryover balance
—(i)
In general.
A funding standard carryover balance is automatically established for a plan that had a positive balance in the funding standard account under section 412(b) (as in effect prior to amendment by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA '06), Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780)) as of the end of the pre-effective plan year for the plan. The funding standard carryover balance as of the beginning of the first effective plan year for the plan is the positive balance in the funding standard account under section 412(b) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06) as of the end of the pre-effective plan year for the plan. After that date, the funding standard carryover balance is decreased to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and adjusted further for investment return and interest as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Decreases.
As of the first day of each plan year, the funding standard carryover balance of a plan is decreased (but not below zero) by the sum of—
(A) Any amount of the funding standard carryover balance that was used under paragraph (d) of this section to offset the minimum required contribution of the plan for the preceding plan year; and
(B) Any reduction in the funding standard carryover balance under paragraph (e) of this section for the plan year.
(3)
Adjustments for investment experience
—(i)
In general.
A plan's prefunding balance under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and a plan's funding standard carryover balance under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as of the first day of a plan year must be adjusted to reflect the actual rate of return on plan assets for the preceding plan year. For this purpose, the actual rate of return on plan assets for the preceding plan year is determined on the basis of fair market value and must take into account the amount and timing of all contributions, distributions, and other plan payments made during that period.
(ii)
Ordering rules for adjustments.
In general, the adjustment for actual rate of return on plan assets is applied to the balance after any reduction of prefunding and funding standard carryover balances for that preceding plan year under paragraph (e) of this section and after subtracting amounts used to offset the minimum required contribution for the preceding plan year pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. However, see paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(D) of this section for a special ordering rule when adjusting for investment experience.
(iii)
Special rule for excess contributions attributable to use of funding balances.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, to the extent that a contribution is included in the present value of excess contributions solely because the minimum required contribution has been offset under paragraph (d) of this section, the contribution is adjusted for investment experience under the rules of this paragraph (b)(3).
(4)
Valuation date other than the first day of the plan year
—(i)
In general.
If a plan's valuation date is not the first day of the plan year, then, solely for purposes of applying paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, the plan's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances (if any) determined under this paragraph (b) are increased from the first day of the plan year to the valuation date using the plan's effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year.
(ii)
Special rule for adjustments for investment experience.
In the case of a plan with a valuation date that is not the first day of the plan year, for purposes of applying the subtraction under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section for amounts used to offset the minimum required contribution for the preceding
plan year and the decreases under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance that is used to offset the minimum required contribution under paragraph (d) of this section or reduced under paragraph (e) of this section is discounted from the valuation date to the first day of the plan year using the effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year.
(5)
Special rule for quarterly contributions
. For purposes of applying a prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance to required installments described in section 430(j)(3), the respective balances are increased from the beginning of the year to the date of the election (using the plan's effective interest rate for the plan year) to determine the amount available to offset the required quarterly installment. The amounts used to offset required quarterly installments are then discounted from that date to the first day of the plan year for purposes of the subtraction under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and the decreases under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section, using the effective interest rate for the plan year. However, see paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section for a special rule regarding late quarterly installments when determining the amount that is used to offset the minimum required contribution for the plan year.
(c)
Effect of balances on the value of plan assets
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any plan with a prefunding balance or a funding standard carryover balance, the amount of those balances is subtracted from the value of plan assets for purposes of sections 430 and 436, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (d)(3) of this section and § 1.436-1(j)(1)(ii)(B).
(2)
Subtraction of balances in determining new shortfall amortization base
—(i)
Prefunding balance.
For purposes of determining whether a plan is exempt from the requirement to establish a new shortfall amortization base under section 430(c)(5), the amount of the prefunding balance is subtracted from the value of plan assets only if an election under paragraph (d) of this section to use the prefunding balance to offset the minimum required contribution is made for the plan year.
(ii)
Funding standard carryover balance.
For purposes of determining whether a plan is exempt from the requirement to establish a new shortfall amortization base under section 430(c)(5), the funding standard carryover balance is not subtracted from the value of plan assets regardless of whether any portion of either the funding standard carryover balance or the prefunding balance is used to offset the minimum required contribution for the plan year under paragraph (d) of this section.
(3)
Special rule for certain binding agreements with PBGC.
If there is in effect for a plan year a binding written agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) which provides that all or a portion of the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance (or both balances) is not available to offset the minimum required contribution for a plan year, that specified amount is not subtracted from the value of plan assets for purposes of determining the funding shortfall under section 430(c)(4). For example, if a plan has no prefunding balance and a $20 million funding standard carryover balance, a PBGC agreement provides that $5 million of a plan's funding standard carryover balance is unavailable to offset the minimum required contribution for a plan year, and the plan's assets are $100 million, then the value of plan assets for purposes of determining the funding shortfall under section 430(c)(4) is reduced by $15 million ($20 million less $5 million) to $85 million. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), an agreement with the PBGC is taken into account with respect to a plan year only if the agreement was executed prior to the valuation date for the plan year.
(d)
Election to apply balances against minimum required contribution
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Amount of offset to minimum required contribution
—(A)
Effect of use of balances.
Subject to the limitations provided in this paragraph (d), in the case of any plan year with respect to which the plan sponsor elects to use all or a portion of the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance to offset the minimum required
contribution for the plan year, the minimum required contribution for the plan year (determined after taking into account any waiver under section 412(c)) is offset as of the valuation date for the plan year by the amount so used.
(B)
Special rule for late election with respect to quarterly contributions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section, if the plan sponsor elects to use all or a portion of the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance to satisfy a required installment under section 430(j)(3), the amount used to offset the minimum required contribution for the plan year is the portion of the balance so used, adjusted in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b)(5) of this section, unless the date of the election is after the due date of the required installment. If the election to use all or a portion of the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance to satisfy the required installments under section 430(j)(3) is made after the due date for the required installment, then the amount used to offset the minimum required contribution for the plan year is the portion of the balance so used, discounted from the date of the election to the due date of the required installment at the effective interest rate plus 5 percentage points, and then further adjusted from the installment due date to the valuation date at the effective interest rate. For example, if a quarterly installment of $20,250 is due on April 15 for a calendar year plan with a valuation date on January 1 and an effective interest rate of 6 percent, and the installment is satisfied by an election to apply the funding standard carryover balance that is made on July 1 (2
1/2
; months after the April 15 due date), then the amount used to offset the minimum required contribution under this paragraph (d)(1)(i) is $19,481 (that is, $20,250 ÷ 1.11(
2.5/12
) ÷ 1.06(
3.5/12
). However, the amount by which the funding standard carryover balance is reduced under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is $19,669 (that is, $20,250 ÷ 1.06(
6/12
).
(ii)
Maximum amount of available balances and coordination of elections
—(A)
General requirement to follow chronology.
In general, the amount of prefunding and funding standard carryover balances that may be used to offset the minimum required contribution for a plan year must take into account any decrease in those balances which results from a prior election either to use the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance under section 430(f)(3) and this paragraph (d) or to reduce those balances under section 430(f)(5) and paragraph (e) of this section (including deemed elections under section 436(f)(3) and § 1.436-1(a)(5)). For example, for a calendar plan year with a January 1 valuation date, a deemed election under section 436(f)(3) and § 1.436-1(a)(5) on April 1, 2010 (the first day of the 4th month of the plan year) will reduce the available prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance that can be used with respect to an election made after April 1, 2010.
(B)
Exception to chronological rule.
Notwithstanding the general rule of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, all elections under section 430(f)(5) and paragraph (e) of this section to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance for the current plan year (including deemed elections under section 436(f)(3) and § 1.436-1(a)(5)) are deemed to occur on the valuation date for the plan year and before any election under section 430(f)(3) and this paragraph (d) to offset the minimum required contribution for the current plan year. Accordingly, if an election to use the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance to offset the minimum required contribution for the plan year (including an election to satisfy the quarterly contribution requirement) has been made prior to the election to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance, then the amount available for use to offset the otherwise applicable minimum required contribution for the plan year under this paragraph (d) will be retroactively reduced. However, an election to reduce a prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance for a plan year does not affect a prior election to use a prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance to offset a minimum required contribution for a prior plan year.
(C)
Investment experience.
In addition to reflecting any decrease in the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance which results from a prior election for the previous year either to use the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance under section 430(f)(3) and this paragraph (d) to offset the minimum required contribution for such prior plan year or to reduce those balances under section 430(f)(5) and paragraph (e) of this section (including deemed elections under section 436(f)(3) and § 1.436-1(a)(5)), the prior plan year's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances must be adjusted under the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section for investment experience for that prior plan year before determining the amount of those balances available for such an election for the current plan year.
(D)
Special rule for current year elections that are made before prior year elections.
This paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(D) sets forth a special rule that applies if, for the current plan year, a plan sponsor makes an election under this paragraph (d) or paragraph (e) of this section (including a deemed election under section 436(f)(3) and § 1.436-1(a)(5)), and then subsequently makes an election under this paragraph (d) to offset the minimum required contribution for the prior plan year. This special rule applies solely for purposes of determining the amount of prefunding and funding standard carryover balances available for that subsequent election. Under this special rule, in lieu of decreasing the funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance as of the valuation date for the current year to take into account the current year election, the funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance as of the valuation date for the prior plan year is decreased by the amount of the prior year equivalent of the current year election. The prior year equivalent of the current year election is determined by dividing the amount of the current year election (as of the first day of the current plan year) by a number equal to 1 plus the rate of investment return for the prior plan year determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. If this paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(D) applies for a plan year, then the funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance are nonetheless adjusted in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, after the application of the rules of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(D). Thus, the amount used to offset the minimum required contribution for the earlier plan year is subtracted from the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance as of the valuation date for that year prior to the adjustment for investment return under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for that plan year, and the amount by which the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance is decreased for the second year is based on the elections made for the second year.
(2)
Requirement to use funding standard carryover balance before prefunding balance.
To the extent that a plan has a funding standard carryover balance greater than zero, no amount of the plan's prefunding balance may be used to offset the minimum required contribution. Thus, a plan's funding standard carryover balance must be exhausted before the plan's prefunding balance may be applied under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to offset the minimum required contribution.
(3)
Limitation for underfunded plans
—(i)
In general.
An election to use the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance to offset the minimum required contribution under this paragraph (d) is not available for a plan year if the plan's prior plan year funding ratio is less than 80 percent. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(3) or paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the plan's prior plan year funding ratio is the fraction (expressed as a percentage)—
(A) The numerator of which is the value of plan assets on the valuation date for the preceding plan year, reduced by the amount of any prefunding balance (but not the amount of any funding standard carryover balance); and
(B) The denominator of which is the funding target of the plan for the preceding plan year (determined without
regard to the at-risk rules of section 430(i)(1)).
(ii)
Special rule for second year of a new plan with no past service.
In the case of a new plan that was neither the result of a merger nor involved in a spinoff, if the prior plan year was the first year of the plan and the funding target for the prior plan year was zero, then the plan's prior plan year funding ratio is deemed to be 80 percent for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3).
(iii)
Special rule for plans that are the result of a merger.
[Reserved]
(iv)
Special rules for plans that are involved in a spinoff.
[Reserved]
(e)
Election to reduce balances
—(1)
In general.
A plan sponsor may make an election for a plan year to reduce any portion of a plan's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances under this paragraph (e). If such an election is made, the amount of those balances that must be subtracted from the value of plan assets pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be smaller and, accordingly, the value of plan assets taken into account for purposes of sections 430 and 436 will be larger. Thus, this election to reduce a plan's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances is taken into account in the determination of the value of plan assets for the plan year and applies for all purposes under sections 430 and 436, including for purposes of determining the plan's prior plan year funding ratio under paragraph (d)(3) of this section for the following plan year.
See also
section 436(f)(3) and § 1.436-1(a)(5) for a rule under which the plan sponsor is deemed to make the election described in this paragraph (e). The rules of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section also apply for purposes of determining the maximum amount of prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance that is available for an election under this paragraph (e).
(2)
Requirement to reduce funding standard carryover balance before prefunding balance.
To the extent that a plan has a funding standard carryover balance greater than zero, no election under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is permitted to be made that reduces the plan's prefunding balance. Thus, a plan must exhaust its funding standard carryover balance before it is permitted to make an election under paragraph (e)(1) of this section with respect to its prefunding balance.
(f)
Elections
—(1)
Method of making elections
—(i)
In general.
Any election under this section by the plan sponsor must be made by providing written notification of the election to the plan's enrolled actuary and the plan administrator. The written notification must set forth the relevant details of the election, including the specific dollar amount involved in the election (except as provided in this paragraph (f)(1). Thus, except as provided in this paragraph (f)(1), a conditional or formula-based election generally does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (f).
(ii)
Standing elections to increase or use balances.
A plan sponsor may provide a standing election in writing to the plan's enrolled actuary to use the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance to offset the minimum required contribution for the plan year to the extent needed to avoid an unpaid minimum required contribution under section 4971(c)(4) taking into account any contributions that are or are not made. In addition, a plan sponsor may provide a standing election in writing to the plan's enrolled actuary to add the maximum amount possible each year to the prefunding balance. Any election made pursuant to a standing election under this paragraph (f)(1)(ii) is deemed to occur on the last day available to make the election for the plan year as provided under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Any standing election under this paragraph (f)(1)(ii) remains in effect for the plan with respect to the enrolled actuary named in the election, unless—
(A) The standing election is revoked under the rules of paragraph (f)(3) of this section; or
(B) The enrolled actuary who signs the actuarial report under section 6059 (Schedule SB, “Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Information” of Form 5500, “Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan”) for the plan for the plan year is not the enrolled actuary named in the standing election.
(iii)
Standing election to satisfy installments through use of funding balances
—
(A)
In general.
A plan sponsor may provide a standing election in writing to the plan's enrolled actuary to use (to the extent available) the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance to satisfy any otherwise unpaid portion of a required installment under section 430(j)(3). Any use pursuant to a standing election under this paragraph (f)(1)(iii) is deemed to occur on the later of the last date for making the required installment and the date the standing election is provided to the enrolled actuary.
(B)
Otherwise unpaid portion of a required installment.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the otherwise unpaid portion of a required installment equals the amount necessary to satisfy the required installment rules under section 430(j) based on the installment amounts determined as if the required annual payment were the amount described in § 1.430(j)-1(c)(5)(ii)(B). Thus, the amount of the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances used under a standing election is the amount that is needed to satisfy an installment in the amount of 25 percent of the minimum required contribution for the prior plan year, plus installments in that amount with respect to all earlier required installment due dates for the plan year, taking into account prior contributions for the plan year and prior elections to use the funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance for the plan year.
(C)
Duration of standing election.
Generally, any standing election under this paragraph (f)(1)(iii) remains in effect for the plan with respect to the enrolled actuary named in the election, unless either of the events described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section occurs with respect to the standing election. However, a plan sponsor may suspend application of a standing election for the remaining installments with respect to a plan year by providing, in writing to the plan's enrolled actuary, notice that the standing election is not to apply for the remainder of the plan year. In addition, once the current year's minimum required contribution has been determined, a plan sponsor may modify application of a standing election for the remaining installments with respect to a plan year by providing, in writing to the plan's enrolled actuary, a replacement formula election to use the funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance (to the extent available) so that the otherwise unpaid portions of the remaining required installments satisfy the required installment rules under section 430(j), taking into account the determination of the current year's minimum required contribution pursuant to § 1.430(j)-1(c)(5)(ii)(A), prior contributions for the plan year and prior elections to use the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances.
(2)
Timing of elections
—(i)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section, any election under this section with respect to a plan year must be made no later than the last date for making the minimum required contribution for the plan year as described in section 430(j)(1), or such later date as prescribed in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. For this purpose, an election to add to the prefunding balance relates to the plan year for which excess contributions were made. For example, an election to add to the prefunding balance as of the first day of the plan year that begins on January 1, 2010 (in an amount not in excess of the present value of the excess contribution as of the valuation date in 2009, adjusted for interest under the rules of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section), must be made no later than September 15, 2010, even though the election is reported on the 2010 Schedule SB of Form 5500, which is not due until 2011. Except for the standing elections covered by paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, an election under this section may not be made prior to the first day of the plan year to which the election relates.
(ii)
Special rule for standing election revoked by a change in enrolled actuary.
If there is a change in enrolled actuary for the plan year which would result in a revocation of the standing election under the rule of paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, then the plan sponsor may reinstate the revoked standing election by providing a replacement to
the new enrolled actuary by the due date of the Schedule SB of Form 5500.
(iii)
Election to reduce balances.
Any election under paragraph (e) of this section to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance for a plan year (for example, in order to avoid or terminate a benefit restriction under section 436) must be made by the end of the plan year to which the election relates.
(iv)
Earlier elections.
This paragraph (f)(2) sets forth the latest date that an election can be made. A plan sponsor is permitted to make an earlier election, and in certain circumstances may need to make such an election in order to timely satisfy a quarterly contribution requirement under section 430(j)(3).
(3)
Irrevocability of elections
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f)(3) or in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, a plan sponsor's election under this section with respect to the plan's prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance is irrevocable (and must be unconditional). A standing election by the plan sponsor may be revoked by providing written notification of the revocation to the plan's enrolled actuary and the plan administrator on or before the date the corresponding election is deemed to occur pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Exception for certain elections.
An election to use the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance to offset the minimum required contribution for a plan year (including an election to satisfy the quarterly contribution requirements for a plan year) is permitted to be revoked to the extent the amount the plan sponsor elected to use to offset the minimum contribution requirements (including an election used to satisfy the quarterly contribution requirements) exceeds the minimum required contribution for a plan year (determined without regard to the election under paragraph (d) of this section) if and only if the election is revoked by providing written notification of the revocation to the plan's enrolled actuary and the plan administrator by the deadline set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section. If no such revocation is made, then, under paragraph (b) of this section, the funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance is decreased by the entire amount that the plan sponsor elected to use to offset the minimum required contribution for a plan year (including an election to satisfy the quarterly contribution requirements for a plan year).
(iii)
Deadline for revoking election.
The deadline for revoking the election described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section is generally the end of the plan year. However, for plans with a valuation date other than the first day of the plan year, the deadline for the revocation is the deadline for contributions for the plan year as described in section 430(j)(1). In addition, for the first plan year beginning in 2008, the deadline for the revocation for all plans is deferred to the due date (including extensions) of the Schedule SB, “Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Information” of Form 5500, “Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan”.
(4)
Plan sponsor
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the elections described in this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, any reference to the plan sponsor means the employer or employers responsible for making contributions to or under the plan.
(ii)
Certain multiple employer plans.
For purposes of the elections described in this section, in the case of plans that are multiple employer plans to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply, any reference to the plan sponsor means the plan administrator within the meaning of section 414(g).
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) Plan P is a defined benefit plan with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1. The funding standard carryover balance of Plan P is $25,000 and the prefunding balance is zero as of the beginning of the 2010 plan year. The sponsor of Plan P, Sponsor S, does not elect to use any portion of the balance to offset the minimum required contribution for 2010 pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or to reduce any portion of the funding standard carryover balance prior to the determination of the value of plan assets for 2010, pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The actual rate of return on Plan P's
assets for 2010 is 2%. Plan P's effective interest rate for 2010 is 6%. The minimum required contribution for Plan P under section 430 for 2010 is $100,000, and no quarterly installments are required for Plan P for the 2010 plan year. As of January 1, 2010, the value of plan assets is $1,100,000 and the funding target is $1,000,000. Therefore, the prior plan year funding ratio for Plan P for 2010, as determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, is 110%.
(ii) Sponsor S makes a contribution to Plan P of $150,000 on December 1, 2010, for the 2010 plan year and makes no other contributions for the 2010 plan year. Because this contribution was made on a date other than the valuation date for the 2010 plan year, the contribution must be adjusted to reflect interest that would otherwise have accrued between the valuation date and the date of the contribution, at the effective interest rate for the 2010 plan year. The amount of the contribution after adjustment is $142,198, determined as $150,000 discounted for 11 months of compound interest at an effective annual interest rate of 6%.
(iii) The excess of employer contributions for 2010 over the minimum required contribution for 2010, as of the valuation date, is $42,198 ($142,198 less $100,000). Accordingly, the increase in Plan P's prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, cannot exceed $44,730 (which is the present value of the excess contribution of $42,198 adjusted for 12 months of interest at an effective interest rate of 6%).
(iv) Plan P's funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2011, is $25,500 (which is the funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2010, adjusted for investment experience during 2010 at a rate of 2%).

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the contribution of $150,000 is made on February 1, 2011, for the 2010 plan year.
(ii) The amount of the contribution after adjustment is $140,824, which is determined as $150,000 discounted for 13 months of interest at an effective interest rate of 6%. Accordingly, the increase in Plan P's prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, cannot exceed $43,273 (which is the present value of the excess contribution of $40,824 adjusted for 12 months of interest at an effective interest rate of 6%).
(iii) Plan P's funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2011, is $25,500, as developed in
Example 1
of this section. If Sponsor S elects to increase the prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, by the present value of the excess contribution adjusted for interest, or $43,273, the total of the funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, is $68,773.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that Sponsor S contributes $90,539 to Plan P on February 1, 2011, for the 2010 plan year and makes no other contributions to Plan P for the 2010 plan year. In addition, on February 1, 2011, Sponsor S elects to use $15,000 of the funding standard carryover balance to offset P's minimum required contribution for 2010, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This is permitted because Plan P's prior-year funding ratio determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section is 110%, and is therefore not less than 80%.
(ii) Because the contribution was made on a date other than the valuation date for the 2010 plan year, the contribution must be adjusted to reflect interest that would otherwise have accrued between the valuation date and the date of the contribution, at the effective interest rate for the 2010 plan year. The amount of the contribution after adjustment is $85,000, determined as $90,539 discounted for 13 months of compound interest at an effective interest rate of 6%. The adjusted contribution of $85,000 plus the $15,000 of the funding standard carryover balance used to offset the minimum required contribution equals the minimum required contribution for the 2010 plan year of $100,000. Therefore, no excess contributions are available to increase the prefunding balance, and the prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, remains zero.
(iii) The funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2011, is adjusted for investment experience during the 2010 plan year, in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The amount of the adjustment is $200, determined as the actual rate of return on plan assets for 2010 as applied to the 2010 funding standard carryover balance after reduction for the amount of that balance used under paragraph (d)(1) of this section (that is, $25,000 less $15,000, multiplied by the actual rate of return of 2%).
(iv) The funding standard carryover balance, as of January 1, 2011, is $10,200, determined as the 2010 funding standard carryover balance less the amount used to offset the 2010 minimum required contribution, adjusted for investment experience during the 2010 year ($25,000 less $15,000 plus $200).

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that Sponsor S contributes $150,000 (instead of $90,539) to Plan P on February 1, 2011, for the 2010 plan year.
(ii) Because the contribution was made on a date other than the valuation date for the 2010 plan year, the contribution must be adjusted to reflect interest that would otherwise have accrued between the valuation date and the date of the contribution, at the effective interest rate for the 2010 plan year. The amount of the contribution after adjustment is $140,824, determined as $150,000 discounted for 13 months of interest at an effective interest rate of 6%.
(iii) Because Sponsor S elected to use $15,000 of the funding standard carryover balance to offset the minimum required contribution for 2010 of $100,000, the cash contribution requirement for 2010, adjusted with interest to January 1, 2010, is $85,000. The adjusted contribution of $140,824 exceeds this amount by $55,824. Of this amount, $15,000 exceeds the minimum required contribution only because of Sponsor S's election to use the funding standard carryover balance to offset the minimum required contribution as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The remaining $40,824 ($140,824 minus $100,000) results from cash contributions made in excess of the minimum required contribution before offset by the funding standard carryover balance.
(iv) The portion of the excess contribution resulting solely because the minimum required contribution was offset by a portion of the funding standard carryover balance is adjusted for investment experience during 2009, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, this portion of the present value of the excess contribution adjusted for interest as of January 1, 2011, is $15,300 ($15,000 adjusted for investment experience during 2010 at a rate of 2%).
(v) The excess contribution resulting from cash contributions in excess of the minimum required contribution before offset by the funding standard carryover balance is adjusted for interest at the effective interest rate for 2010, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section. Accordingly, this portion of the present value of the excess contribution adjusted for interest as of January 1, 2011, is $43,273 ($40,824 increased by the effective interest rate of 6%). The increase in Plan P's prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, cannot exceed the total present value of the excess contribution adjusted for interest of $58, 573 ($15,300 plus $43,273).
(vi) The funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2011, is $10,200, determined as the 2010 funding standard carryover balance less the $15,000 used to offset the 2010 minimum required contribution, adjusted for investment experience during the 2010 plan year as developed in
Example 3
($25,000 less $15,000 plus $200).
(vii) Sponsor S elects to increase the prefunding balance by the maximum amount of the present value of the excess contribution adjusted for interest of $58,573, resulting in a total of the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, of $68,773, the same amount as that developed in
Example 2.

# Example 5.
(i) Plan Q is a defined benefit plan with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of July 1. The funding standard carryover balance of Plan Q is $50,000 as of January 1, 2010, the beginning of the 2010 plan year. The prefunding balance of Plan Q as of the beginning of the 2010 plan year is $0. The actual rate of return on Plan Q's assets for 2010 is 10%. Plan Q's effective interest rate for 2010 is 6.25%. The funding ratio for Plan Q for 2009 (the prior plan year funding ratio with respect to 2010, as determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section) is 85%, which is not less than 80%. The minimum required contribution for Plan Q for 2010 is $200,000. Sponsor T makes a contribution to Plan Q of $190,000 on July 1, 2010, for the 2010 plan year, and makes no other contributions for the 2010 plan year. Sponsor T elects to use $10,000 of the funding standard carryover balance to offset Plan Q's minimum required contribution in 2010.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the funding standard carryover balance is increased to $51,539 as of July 1, 2010 (that is, an increase to reflect 6 months of interest at an effective interest rate of 6.25%) for the purpose of adjusting plan assets under paragraph (c) of this section, and for applying any election to use or reduce Plan Q's funding standard carryover balance under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section. However, Sponsor T does not elect in 2010 to reduce any portion of the funding standard carryover balance pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The funding standard carryover balance ($51,539) is subtracted from the value of plan assets, as of July 1, 2010, prior to the determination of the minimum funding contribution, and $51,539 is the maximum amount that may applied against the minimum required contribution.
(iii) The value of the funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2011, is determined by first discounting the amount used to offset the minimum required contribution for 2010 from July 1, 2010, to January 1, 2010, using the effective interest rate of 6.25%, and subtracting the discounted amount from the January 1, 2010, funding standard carryover balance. The resulting amount is adjusted for investment experience to January 1, 2011, using a rate equal to the actual rate of return on plan assets of 10% during 2010. Thus, the $10,000 used to offset Plan Q's minimum required contribution as of July 1, 2010, is discounted for 6 months of interest, at an effective interest rate of 6.25%, to obtain an amount of $9,701 as of January 1, 2010. The remaining funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2010, solely for purposes of determining the adjustment for investment experience during 2010, is $40,299 ($50,000—$9,701), and the adjustment for investment experience is $4,030 ($40,299 × 10%). The value of the funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2011, is $44,329 (that is, $50,000 − $9,701 + $4,030).

# Example 6.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 5,
except that Sponsor T contributes $200,000 on July 1, 2010, for the 2010 plan year.
(ii) The cash contribution required for 2010, after offsetting the minimum required contribution by $10,000 of the funding standard
carryover balance in accordance with T's election, is $190,000. The difference, or $10,000, must be adjusted to January 1, 2011, to determine the maximum amount that can be added to the prefunding balance as of that date.
(iii) The excess contribution is first adjusted to January 1, 2010, by discounting for 6 months of interest using the effective interest rate for 2010 of 6.25%. This results in an excess contribution of $9,701 ($10,000 ÷ 1.0625
0.5
). Because this amount is an excess contribution solely because of Sponsor T's election to offset the minimum required contribution for 2010 by a portion of the funding standard carryover balance, the amount is then adjusted for investment experience during 2010 at a rate of 10%, in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, for a present value of the excess contribution adjusted for interest of $10,671 ($9,701 × 1.10) as of January 1, 2011.

# Example 7.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 4.
Plan P's effective interest rate for 2011 is 6.5%, and the rate of return on investments during 2011 is 7%. All required quarterly installments for the 2011 plan year were made by the applicable due dates. On February 1, 2012, Sponsor S elects to use $50,000 of Plan P's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances to offset the minimum required contribution for the 2011 plan year. On April 15, 2012, Sponsor S elects to use Plan P's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances to offset the 2012 minimum required contribution by $20,000, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, in order to offset the required quarterly installment then due.
(ii) When adjusting Plan P's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances to reflect Sponsor S's election to use them to offset the 2011 minimum required contribution, the remaining $10,200 in the funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2011, must be used before any portion of the prefunding balance. The prefunding balance is reduced by the remaining $39,800 ($50,000 total election minus $10,200 from the funding standard carryover balance).
(iii) The amount available for Sponsor S's election to use Plan P's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances to offset the 2012 minimum required contribution is determined by reducing the January 1, 2011, prefunding and funding standard carryover balances to reflect the election to use the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances to offset the 2011 minimum required contribution, and by adjusting the resulting amount to January 1, 2012, using the rate of investment return for Plan P during 2011. Accordingly, the available amount in Plan P's funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2012, is zero. The available amount in Plan P's prefunding balance as of January 1, 2012, is $20,087 ($58,573 minus $39,800, increased by 7%). Therefore, Sponsor S has $20,087 available to offset the minimum required contribution for the 2012 plan year.

# Example 8.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7,
except that based on the enrolled actuary's certification of the AFTAP on July 1, 2012, Sponsor S is deemed to elect to reduce the January 1, 2012, prefunding balance by $15,000 under section 436(f)(3).
(ii) In accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the deemed election to reduce the prefunding balance is deemed to occur on the first day of the plan year, and before the date of any election to offset the minimum required contribution for the 2012 plan year. The deemed election does not affect Sponsor S's election to offset the 2011 minimum contribution because that election was made on February 1, 2012, before the date of the deemed election, July 1, 2012.
(iii) As shown in
Example 7,
the available prefunding balance as of January 1, 2012, after reflecting the February 1, 2012, election to offset the 2011 minimum required contribution but before reflecting the April 15, 2012, election to offset the 2012 minimum required contribution, is $20,087. Adjusting this amount to reflect the deemed election to reduce the prefunding balance by $15,000 leaves a balance of $5,087 available to offset the minimum required contribution for 2012.
(iv) The portion of the quarterly installment due April 15, 2012 that was not covered by the remaining $5,087 prefunding balance is considered unpaid retroactive to April 15, 2012.

# Example 9.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 8,
except that Sponsor S does not make the election to offset the 2011 minimum required contribution until August 1, 2012, and the deemed election as of July 1, 2012, reduces Plan P's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances as of January 1, 2012, by $68,500. Sponsor S does not elect to use Plan P's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances to offset the 2012 minimum contribution.
(ii) In accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the July 1, 2012, deemed election to reduce Plan P's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances must be taken into account before determining the amount available to offset the 2011 minimum required contribution because the election to offset the 2011 minimum required contribution was made after the date of the deemed election, July 1, 2012.
(iii) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, the January 1, 2011, prefunding and funding standard carryover balances are adjusted to January 1, 2012, using Plan P's rate of investment return for 2011 of 7%. This results in an available funding standard carryover balance of $10,914 ($10,200 × 1.07) and an available prefunding balance of $62,673 (58,573 × 1.07) as of January 1, 2012.
(iv) Paragraph (d)(2) of this section requires that the funding standard carryover balance must be used before reducing Plan P's prefunding balance. Accordingly, the funding standard carryover balance is eliminated, and the prefunding balance is reduced by the remaining $57,586 ($68,500 − $10,914), resulting in an available prefunding balance of $5,087 ($62,673 − $57,586) as of January 1, 2012.
(v) In accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, the remaining balance is adjusted to January 1, 2011, to determine the amount available to offset the 2011 minimum required contribution. This adjustment is done by dividing the remaining balance by 1 plus the rate of investment return for 2011. Accordingly, the amount available to offset the 2011 minimum required contribution is $4,754 ($5,087 ÷ 1.07).
(vi) If the plan sponsor elects to use the $4,754 available balance to offset the 2011 minimum required contribution, the funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2012 (prior to the deemed reduction under section 436(f)(3)) is $5,827 ($10,200 less $4,754, plus $381 for investment experience at a rate of 7%). The prefunding balance as of January 1, 2012 (prior to the deemed reduction under section 436(f)(3)) is $62,673 (that is, $58,573 × 1.07). The deemed election to reduce Plan P's balance is first applied to eliminate the funding standard carryover balance, and the remaining $62,673 ($68,500 less $5,827) reduces the January 1, 2012, prefunding balance to zero.

# Example 10.
(i) Plan V is a defined benefit plan with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of December 31. The valuation is based on the fair market value of plan assets, which amounts to $1,000,000 as of December 31, 2010, before any adjustments. As of January 1, 2010, Plan V's funding standard carryover balance is $0 and its prefunding balance is $125,000. Plan V's effective interest rate for 2010 is 5.5%. The enrolled actuary's certification of AFTAP for 2010 on March 31, 2010, results in a deemed reduction of $15,000 in the plan's prefunding balance as of January 1, 2010. Plan V's sponsor elected to use the prefunding balance to offset any portion of the minimum required contribution for 2010 not covered by cash contributions.
(ii) In accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the amount of the prefunding balance subtracted from plan assets is increased from the first day of the plan year to the valuation date using the effective interest rate of 5.5% for 2009. Accordingly, the prefunding balance used for this purpose is $116,050 [($125,000 − $15,000 deemed reduction) × 1.055].
(iii) The fair market value of plan assets used for the December 31, 2010, valuation is $883,950 ($1,000,000 − $116,050).

# Example 11.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 10.
The minimum contribution for Plan V for the 2010 plan year is $45,000; no quarterly installments are required for Plan V for 2010. Plan V's sponsor makes a contribution of $20,000 for the 2010 plan year on July 1, 2011. The actual rate of return on assets for Plan V during 2010 is 10%.
(ii) The contribution of $20,000 is discounted to December 31, 2010, using the effective interest rate of 5.5% to determine the remaining balance of the 2010 minimum required contribution. Accordingly, the contribution is adjusted to $19,472 ($20,000 ÷ 1.055
0.5
) as of December 31, 2010, and the balance of the minimum required contribution is $25,528 ($45,000 − $19,472). This balance will be covered by the plan sponsor's election to use the prefunding balance to offset any portion of the minimum required contribution not covered by cash contributions.
(iii) Under section (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the amount used to offset the 2010 minimum required contribution for the purpose of adjusting the prefunding balance is discounted to January 1, 2010, using the effective interest rate for 2010. This amount is calculated as $24,197 ($25,528 ÷ 1.055).
(iv) The prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, is reduced by the deemed election of $15,000 and the discounted amount used to offset the 2010 minimum required contribution ($24,197), and adjusted for investment experience for 2010 using the actual rate of return of 10%. Accordingly, the prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011 is $94,383 [($125,000 − $15,000 − $24,197) × 1.10].

# Example 12.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 11,
except that the enrolled actuary's certification of the AFTAP as of March 31, 2011, results in a deemed reduction of the prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, of $75,000.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the deemed reduction of the prefunding balance is applied before the election to use the prefunding balance to offset the balance of the minimum required contribution for 2010. To determine the amount of the prefunding balance available to cover the remaining minimum required contribution for 2010, the deemed reduction is adjusted for investment experience to January 1, 2010, using the actual rate of return of 10% for 2010. Accordingly, the adjusted deemed reduction is $68,182 ($75,000 ÷ 1.10) and the available prefunding balance as of January 1, 2010, is $41,818 ($125,000 − $15,000 adjusted deemed reduction for 2010 − $68,182 adjusted deemed reduction for 2011).
(iii) This amount is then adjusted to December 31, 2010, using the effective interest rate of 5.5%. The amount of the prefunding balance available to offset the 2009 minimum required contribution as of December 31, 2010, is $44,118 ($41,818 × 1.055). This amount is larger than the election made by Plan V's
sponsor to offset the minimum required contribution for 2010 ($25,528) and so the election remains valid.
(h)
Effective/applicability date and transition rules
—(1)
Statutory effective date/applicability date.
Section 430 generally applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The applicability of section 430 for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution is delayed for certain plans in accordance with sections 104 through 106 of PPA '06.
(2)
Effective date/applicability date of regulations.
This section applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2010. For plan years beginning before January 1, 2010, plans are permitted to rely on the provisions set forth in this section for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 430.
(3)
Special lookback rule for 2007 plan year's funding ratio
—(i)
Plan assets.
For purposes of determining a plan's prior plan year funding ratio under paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2008, the value of plan assets on the valuation date of the preceding plan year (the “2007 plan year”) is determined under section 412(c)(2) as in effect for the 2007 plan year, except that, for this purpose—
(A) If the value of plan assets is less than 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets for the 2007 plan year on that date, such value is considered to be 90 percent of the fair market value; and
(B) If the value of plan assets is greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets for the 2007 plan year on that date, such value is considered to be 110 percent of the fair market value.
(ii)
Funding target.
For purposes of determining a plan's prior plan year funding ratio under paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2008, the funding target of the plan for the preceding plan year is equal to the plan's current liability under section 412(l)(7) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06) on the valuation date for the 2007 plan year.
(iii)
Special rules for new plans, mergers, and spinoffs.
In the case of a plan described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), or (d)(3)(iv) of this section, the plan's prior plan year funding ratio with respect to the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2008 is determined using rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), and (d)(3)(iv) of this section.
(4)
First effective plan year.
For purposes of this section, the term
first effective plan year
means the first plan year beginning on or after the date section 430 applies for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution for the plan.
(5)
Pre-effective plan year.
For purposes of this section, the term
pre-effective plan year
means the plan year immediately preceding the first effective plan year.
[T.D. 9467, 74 FR 54046, Oct. 15, 2009, as amended by T.D. 9732, 80 FR 54389, Sept. 9, 2015]
§ 1.430(g)-1
Valuation date and valuation of plan assets.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
This section provides rules relating to a plan's valuation date and the valuation of a plan's assets for a plan year under section 430(g). Section 430 and this section apply to single employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans as defined in section 413(c)) that are subject to the rules of section 412, but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section 414(f)). Paragraph (b) of this section describes valuation date rules. Paragraph (c) of this section describes rules regarding the determination of the asset value for purposes of a plan's actuarial valuation. Paragraph (d) of this section contains rules for taking employer contributions into account in the determination of the value of plan assets. Paragraph (e) of this section contains examples. Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth effective/applicability dates and transition rules.
(2)
Special rules for multiple employer plans.
In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules of section 430 and this section are applied separately for each employer under the plan as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, in such a case, the value of plan assets is determined separately for each employer under the
plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430 and this section are applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.
(b)
Valuation date
—(1)
In general.
The determination of the funding target, target normal cost, and value of plan assets for a plan year is made as of the valuation date for that plan year. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the valuation date for any plan year is the first day of the plan year.
(2)
Exception for small plans
—(i)
In general.
If, on each day during the preceding plan year, a plan had 100 or fewer participants determined by applying the rules of § 1.430(d)-1(e)(1) and (2) (including active and inactive participants and all other individuals entitled to future benefits), then the plan may designate any day during the plan year as its valuation date for that plan year and succeeding plan years. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), all defined benefit plans (other than multiemployer plans as defined in section 414(f)) maintained by an employer are treated as one plan, but only participants with respect to that employer are taken into account.
(ii)
Employer determination.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the employer includes all members of the employer's controlled group determined pursuant to section 414(b), (c), (m), and (o) and includes any predecessor of the employer that, during the prior year, employed any employees of the employer who are covered by the plan.
(iii)
Application of exception in first plan year.
In the case of the first plan year of any plan, the exception for small plans under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is applied by taking into account the number of participants that the plan is reasonably expected to have on each day during the first plan year.
(iv)
Valuation date is part of funding method.
The selection of a plan's valuation date is part of the plan's funding method and, accordingly, may only be changed with the consent of the Commissioner. A change of a plan's valuation date that is required by section 430 is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's prior specific approval. Thus, if a plan that ceases to be eligible for the small plan exception under this paragraph (b)(2) for a plan year because the number of participants exceeded 100 in the prior plan year, then the resulting change in the valuation date to the first day of the plan year is automatically approved by the Commissioner.
(c)
Determination of asset value
—(1)
In general
—(i)
General use of fair market value.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the value of plan assets for purposes of section 430 is equal to the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date. Prior year contributions made after the valuation date and current year contributions made before the valuation date are taken into account to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii)
Fair market value.
The fair market value of an asset is determined as the price at which the asset would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. Except as otherwise provided by the Commissioner, any guidance on the valuation of insurance contracts under Subchapter D of Chapter 1 the Internal Revenue Code applies for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii).
(2)
Averaging of fair market values
—(i)
In general.
Subject to the plan asset corridor rules of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, a plan is permitted to determine the value of plan assets on the valuation date as the average of the fair market value of assets on the valuation date and the adjusted fair market value of assets determined for one or more earlier determination dates (adjusted using the method described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section). The method of determining the value of assets is part of the plan's funding method and, accordingly, may only be changed with the consent of the Commissioner.
(ii)
Adjusted fair market value
—(A)
Determination dates.
The period of time between each determination date (treating the valuation date as a determination date) must be equal and that period of time cannot exceed 12 months. In addition, the earliest determination date with respect to a plan year cannot be earlier than the last day of the 25th month before the valuation date of the plan year (or a similar period in the case of a valuation date that is not the first day of a month). In a typical situation, the earlier determination dates will be the two immediately preceding valuation dates. However, these rules also permit the use of more frequent determination dates. For example, monthly or quarterly determination dates may be used.
(B)
Adjustments for contributions and distributions.
The adjusted fair market value of plan assets for a prior determination date is the fair market value of plan assets on that date, increased for contributions included in the plan's asset balance on the valuation date that were not included in the plan's asset balance on the earlier determination date, reduced for benefits and all other amounts paid from plan assets during the period beginning with the prior determination date and ending immediately before the valuation date, and adjusted for expected earnings as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. For this purpose, the fair market value of assets as of a determination date includes any contribution for a plan year that ends with or prior to the determination date that is receivable as of the determination date (but only if the contribution is actually made within 8
1/2
months after the end of the applicable plan year). If the contribution that is receivable as of the determination date is for a plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2008, then only the present value as of the determination date (determined using the effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year for which the contribution is made) is included in the fair market value of assets.
(C)
Treatment of spin-offs and plan-to-plan transfers.
For purposes of determining the adjusted fair market value of plan assets, assets spun-off from a plan as a result of a spin-off described in § 1.414(l)-1(b)(4) are treated as an amount paid from plan assets. Except as otherwise provided by the Commissioner, for purposes of determining the adjusted fair market value of plan assets, assets that are added to a plan as a result of a plan-to-plan transfer described in § 1.414(l)-1(b)(3) are treated in the same manner as contributions.
(D)
Adjustments for expected earnings.

(E)
Assumed rate of return.

(F)
Limitation on the assumed rate of return for periods within plan years for which the three segment rates were used.

(G)
Limitation on the assumed rate of return for periods within plan years for which the full yield curve was used.
[Reserved]
(iii)
Restriction to 90-110 percent corridor
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (c)(2)(iii) provides rules for applying the 90 to 110 percent corridor set forth in section 430(g)(3)(B)(iii). The rules for accounting for contribution receipts under paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section are applied prior to the application of the 90 to 110 percent corridor under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii).
(B)
Asset value less than 90 percent of fair market value.
If the value of plan assets determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is less than 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets, then the value of plan assets under this paragraph (c)(2) is equal to 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets.
(C)
Asset value greater than 110 percent of fair market value.
If the value of plan assets determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets, then the value of plan assets under this paragraph (c)(2) is equal to 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets.
(3)
Qualified transfers to health benefit accounts.
In the case of a qualified transfer (as defined in section 420), any assets so transferred are not treated as plan assets for purposes of section 430 and this section.
(d)
Accounting for contribution receipts
—(1)
Prior year contributions
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining
the value of plan assets under paragraph (c) of this section, if an employer makes a contribution to the plan after the valuation date for the current plan year and the contribution is for an earlier plan year, then the present value of the contribution determined as of that valuation date is taken into account as an asset of the plan as of the valuation date, but only if the contribution is made before the deadline for contributions as described in section 430(j)(1) for the plan year immediately preceding the current plan year. For this purpose, the present value is determined using the effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year for which the contribution is made.
(ii)
Special rule for contributions for the 2007 plan year
—(A)
Timely contributions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, if the employer makes a contribution to the plan after the valuation date for the first plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2008, and the contribution is for the immediately preceding plan year and is made by the deadline for contributions for that preceding plan year under section 412(c)(10) (as in effect before amendment by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA '06), Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780)), then the contribution is taken into account as a plan asset under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section without applying any present value discount.
(B)
Late contributions.
If a contribution is for the plan year that immediately precedes the first plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2008, and is not described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, then the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(i) apply to the contribution except that the present value is determined using the valuation interest rate under section 412(c)(2) for that plan year.
(iii)
Ordering rules.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), the ordering rules of section 4971(c)(4)(B) apply for purposes of determining the plan year for which a contribution is made.
(2)
Current year contributions made before valuation date.
In the case of a plan with a valuation date that is not the first day of the plan year, for purposes of determining the value of plan assets under paragraph (c) of this section, if an employer makes a contribution for a plan year before that year's valuation date, that contribution (and any interest on the contribution for the period between the contribution date and the valuation date, determined using the effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year) must be subtracted from plan assets in determining the value of plan assets as of the valuation date. If the result of this subtraction is a number less than zero, the value of plan assets as of the valuation date is equal to zero.
(e)
Examples.
[Reserved]
(f)
Effective/applicability dates and transition rules
—(1)
Statutory effective date/applicability date.
Section 430 generally applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The applicability of section 430 for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution is delayed for certain plans in accordance with sections 104 through 106 of PPA '06.
(2)
Effective date/applicability date of regulations
—(i)
In general.
This section applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2010, regardless of whether section 430 applies to determine the minimum required contribution for the plan year. For plan years beginning before January 1, 2010, plans are permitted to rely on the provisions set forth in this section for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 430.
(ii)
Permission to use averaging for 2008.
For purposes of determining the actuarial value of assets for a plan year beginning during 2008 using the averaging rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a plan is permitted to apply an assumed earnings rate of zero under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section (even if zero is not the actuary's best estimate of the anticipated annual rate of return on plan assets).
(3)
Approval for changes in the valuation date and valuation method.
Any change in a plan's valuation date or asset valuation method that satisfies the rules of this section and is made for either the first plan year beginning in 2008, the first plan year beginning in 2009, or the first plan year beginning in 2010 is treated as having been approved
by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval. In addition, a change in a plan's valuation date or asset valuation method for the first plan year to which section 430 applies to determine the plan's minimum required contribution (even if that plan year begins after December 31, 2010) that satisfies the rules of this section is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval.

§ 1.430(h)(2)-1
Interest rates used to determine present value.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
This section provides rules relating to the interest rates to be applied for a plan year under section 430(h)(2). Section 430(h)(2) and this section apply to single employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans as defined in section 413(c)) that are subject to section 412 but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section 414(f)). Paragraph (b) of this section describes how the segment interest rates are used for a plan year. Paragraph (c) of this section describes those segment rates. Paragraph (d) of this section describes the monthly corporate bond yield curve that is used to develop the segment rates. Paragraph (e) of this section describes certain elections that are permitted to be made under this section. Paragraph (f) of this section describes other rules related to interest rates. Paragraph (g) of this section contains examples. Paragraph (h) of this section contains effective/applicability dates.
(2)
Special rules for multiple employer plans.
In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules of section 430 and this section are applied separately for each employer under the plan as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, each employer under such a multiple employer plan may make elections with respect to the interest rate rules under this section that are independent of the elections of other employers under the plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430 and this section are applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.
(b)
Interest rates for determining plan liabilities
—(1)
In general.
The interest rates used in determining the present value of the benefits that are included in the target normal cost and the funding target for the plan for a plan year are determined as set forth in this paragraph (b).
(2)
Benefits payable within 5 years.
In the case of benefits expected to be payable during the 5-year period beginning on the valuation date for the plan year, the interest rate used in determining the present value of the benefits that are included in the target normal cost and the funding target for the plan is the first segment rate with respect to the applicable month, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Benefits payable after 5 years and within 20 years.
In the case of benefits expected to be payable during the 15-year period beginning after the end of the period described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the interest rate used in determining the present value of the benefits that are included in the target normal cost and the funding target for the plan is the second segment rate with respect to the applicable month, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Benefits payable after 20 years.
In the case of benefits expected to be payable after the period described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the interest rate used in determining the present value of the benefits that are included in the target normal cost and the funding target for the plan is the third segment rate with respect to the applicable month, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(5)
Applicable month.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the term
applicable month
for purposes of this paragraph (b) means the month that includes the valuation date of the plan for the plan year.
(6)
Special rule for certain airlines
—(i)
In general.
Pursuant to section 6615 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans'
Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, Public Law 110-28 (121 Stat. 112), for a plan sponsor that makes the election described in section 402(a)(2) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA '06), Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780), the interest rate required to be used to determine the plan's funding target for each of the 10 years under that election is 8.25 percent (rather than the segment rates otherwise described in this paragraph (b) or the full yield curve as permitted under paragraph (e)(4) of this section).
(ii)
Special interest rate not applicable for other purposes.
The special interest rate described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section does not apply for other purposes such as the determination of the plan's target normal cost.
(c)
Segment rates
—(1)
Overview.
This paragraph (c) sets forth rules for determining the first, second, and third segment rates for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section. The first, second, and third segment rates are set forth in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
See
§ 601.601(d)(2) relating to objectives and standards for publishing regulations, revenue rulings and revenue procedures in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(2)
Definition of segment rates
—(i)
First segment rate.
For purposes of this section, except as otherwise provided under the interest rate stabilization rules in section 430(h)(2)(C)(iv), the
first segment rate
is, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest determined by the Commissioner on the basis of the average of the monthly corporate bond yield curves (described in paragraph (d) of this section) for the 24-month period ending with the month preceding that month, taking into account only the first 5 years of each of those yield curves.
(ii)
Second segment rate.
For purposes of this section, except as otherwise provided under the interest rate stabilization rules in section 430(h)(2)(C)(iv), the
second segment rate
is, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest determined by the Commissioner on the basis of the average of the monthly corporate bond yield curves (described in paragraph (d) of this section) for the 24-month period ending with the month preceding that month, taking into account only the portion of each of those yield curves corresponding to the 15-year period that follows the end of the 5-year period described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Third segment rate.
For purposes of this section, except as otherwise provided under the interest rate stabilization rules in section 430(h)(2)(C)(iv), the
third segment rate
is, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest determined by the Commissioner on the basis of the average of the monthly corporate bond yield curves (described in paragraph (d) of this section) for the 24-month period ending with the month preceding that month, taking into account only the portion of each of those yield curves corresponding to the 40-year period that follows the end of the 15-year period described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(d)
Monthly corporate bond yield curve
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Construction of monthly corporate bond yield curve.
For purposes of this section, the monthly corporate bond yield curve for a month is defined as the set of spot rates at specified durations. The specified durations are at 6-month intervals ranging from 6 months through 100 years and the spot rate at a duration is the yield (when compounded semiannually) for a bond that matures at that duration with a single payment at maturity. The monthly corporate bond yield curve is constructed as the average of the spot rates from the set of daily corporate bond yield curves as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Each daily corporate bond yield curve is constructed using the methodology set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section based on the data described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The yield curve for each month will be published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. See § 601.601(d) of this chapter.
(ii)
Monthly corporate bond yield curve constructed through averaging.
Each spot rate at a specified duration on the monthly corporate bond yield curve for a month is equal to the arithmetic average, for each business day of that month, of the spot rates at that duration on the daily corporate bond yield curves.
(2)
Construction of the daily corporate bond yield curve
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Calculation of spot rates.
The spot rate at duration of
1/2
year on the daily corporate bond yield curve is set equal to the yield at maturity of
1/2
year from the daily par yield curve described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section. The spot rate for any later duration on the daily corporate bond yield curve is determined by applying an iterative process based on the spot rates at earlier durations and the daily par yield curve.
(B)
Calculation of par yield curve.
The daily par yield curve (that is, the curve in which the rate at maturity
t
on the curve is equal to the yield for a bond with maturity of
t
for which the price is the same as the principal amount) is calculated from the discount function described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section and the hump adjustment variable described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(D) of this section.
(C)
Derivation of discount function.
The discount function for a day at duration
t
(denoted d(t)) is derived from the forward interest rate function as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section (denoted
f(z)
) using the following equation:
ER12JA24.072
(ii)
Determination of forward interest rates
—(A)
In general.
The forward interest rate function used to derive the discount function is determined as a series of cubic polynomials (referred to as a cubic spline) that have a smooth junction at specified knot points (maturities of 0, 1.5, 3, 7, 15, and 30 years). The requirement that the polynomials have a smooth junction at a knot point is satisfied if the two polynomials that are meeting at the knot have the same value, the same derivative, and the same second derivative at that knot point.
(B)
Constraints on the forward interest function.
The following three constraints are placed on the forward interest rate function—
(
1
) The second derivative of the function is set to 0 at maturity 0.
(
2
) The value of the forward interest rate function at and after 30 years is constrained to equal its average value from 15 to 30 years.
(
3
) The derivative of the forward interest rate function is set to 0 at maturity 30 years.
(iii)
Parameters for daily bond price model
—(A)
B-spline coefficients.
The assumed cubic spline for the forward interest rate function can be described as a linear combination of B-splines, with five parameters, which are determined taking into account the two coefficients for the bond-quality adjustment variables described in paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section and the coefficient for the hump adjustment variable described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(D) of this section. The five parameters and three coefficients are determined using the bond data weighted as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. After this weighting of the bond data, the five parameters and three coefficients are chosen to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the bid price for each of the bonds (or ask price for commercial paper) and the price estimated for each of those bonds determined using the specified parameters and coefficients, and taking into account the bond's coupon rate, number of years until maturity, and rating.
(B)
Adjustment factor for share of bonds that are AA-rated.
The first adjustment variable is based on the proportion of bonds that are rated AA within the universe of bonds in the data set that are rated AA or AAA, weighted by par value. In the case of an AAA-rated bond the adjustment variable described in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) is equal to the product of the proportion described in the preceding sentence and the number of years until maturity for the bond. In the case of an AA-rated bond the adjustment variable described
in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) is equal to the product of (1- that proportion) and the number of years until maturity for the bond. In the case of an A-rated bond, the adjustment variable described in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) is 0.
(C)
Adjustment factor for share of bonds that are A-rated.
The second adjustment variable is based on the proportion of bonds rated A within the universe of bonds in the data set, weighted by par value. In the case of an AAA-rated bond or an AA-rated bond, the adjustment variable described in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(C) is equal to the product of the proportion described in the preceding sentence and the number of years until maturity for the bond. In the case of an A-rated bond, the adjustment variable described in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(C) is equal to the product of (1- that proportion) and the number of years until maturity for the bond.
(D)
Hump adjustment variable.
The hump adjustment variable is a mathematical function that is a cubic spline in the interval from 10 years maturity through 30 years maturity made up of two polynomials with a smooth junction (as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) at 20 years maturity. The spline rises from 0 at 10 years maturity to 1.0 at 20 years maturity, then falls back down to 0 at 30 years maturity. The hump adjustment variable is 0 for maturities less than 10 years and maturities greater than 30 years.
(iv)
Weighting of bond data.
The bond data are weighted in three steps. In the first step, equal weights are assigned to the commercial paper rates at the short end of the curve, and the par amounts outstanding of all the bonds are rescaled so that their sum equals the sum of the weights for commercial paper. In the second step, the squared price difference for each commercial paper rate is multiplied by the commercial paper weight, and the squared price difference for each bond is multiplied by the bond's rescaled par amount outstanding. In the third step, applicable for bonds with duration greater than 1, the weighted squared price difference for each bond from the second step is divided by the bond's duration.
(3)
Data used
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(3), the bonds that are used to construct the daily corporate bond yield curve for a business day are bonds with maturities longer than
1/2
year, with at least two payment dates, and that:
(A) Are designated as corporate;
(B) Have high quality ratings (AAA, AA, or A) as of that business day from the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations;
(C) Have at least $250 million in par amount outstanding on at least one day during the month;
(D) Pay fixed nominal semiannual coupons and the principal amount at maturity; and
(E) Mature not later than 30 years after that business day.
(ii)
Excluded bonds.
The following types of bonds are not used to construct the daily corporate bond yield curve for a date:
(A) Bonds not denominated in U.S. dollars;
(B) Bonds not issued by U.S. corporations;
(C) Bonds that are capital securities (sometimes referred to as hybrid preferred stock);
(D) Bonds with variable coupon rates;
(E) Convertible bonds;
(F) Bonds issued by a government-sponsored enterprise (such as the Federal National Mortgage Association);
(G) Asset-backed bonds;
(H) Callable bonds, unless the call feature is make-whole or the call feature is exercisable only during the last year before maturity;
(I) Putable bonds;
(J) Bonds with sinking funds; and
(K) Bonds with an outstanding par amount below $250 million for the day for which the daily yield curve is constructed.
(iii)
Durations equal to or below
1/2
year.
The data for durations equal to or below
1/2
year that is used to construct the daily corporate bond yield curve consists of AA financial and AA nonfinancial commercial paper rates, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board.
(e)
Elections
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (e) describes elections for a plan year that a plan sponsor can make to
use alternative interest rates under this section. Any election under this paragraph (e) must be made by providing written notification of the election to the plan's enrolled actuary. Any election in this paragraph (e) may be adopted for a plan year without obtaining the consent of the Commissioner, but, once adopted, that election will apply for that plan year and all future plan years and may be changed only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(2)
Election for alternative applicable month.
As an alternative to defining the applicable month as the month that includes the valuation date for the plan year, a plan sponsor that is using segment rates as provided under paragraph (b) of this section may elect to use one of the 4 months preceding that month as the applicable month.
(3)
Election to use full yield curve
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining the plan's funding target and target normal cost, and for all other purposes under section 430 (including the determination of shortfall amortization installments, waiver installments, and the present values of those installments as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section), the plan sponsor may elect to use interest rates under the monthly corporate bond yield curve described in paragraph (d) of this section for the month preceding the month that includes the valuation date in lieu of the segment rates determined under paragraph (c) of this section. In order to address the timing of benefit payments during a year, reasonable approximations are permitted to be used to value benefit payments that are expected to be made during a plan year.
(ii)
Reasonable techniques permitted.
In the case of a plan sponsor using the monthly corporate bond yield curve under this paragraph (e)(3), if with respect to a decrement the benefit is only expected to be paid for one-half of a year (because the decrement was assumed to occur in the middle of the year), the interest rate for that year can be determined as if the benefit were being paid for the entire year. See § 1.430(d)-1(f)(7) for additional reasonable techniques that can be used in determining present value.
(4)
Plan sponsor.
For purposes of the elections described in this section, any reference to the plan sponsor generally means the employer or employers responsible for making contributions to or under the plan. In the case of plans that are multiple employer plans to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply, any reference to the plan sponsor means the plan administrator within the meaning of section 414(g).
(f)
Interest rates used for other purposes
—(1)
Effective interest rate
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the effective interest rate determined under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year is the single interest rate that, if used to determine the present value of the benefits that are taken into account in determining the plan's funding target for the plan year, would result in an amount equal to the plan's funding target determined for the plan year under section 430(d) as described in § 1.430(d)-1(b)(2) (without regard to calculations for plans in at-risk status under section 430(i)).
(ii)
Zero funding target.
If, for the plan year, the plan's funding target is equal to zero, then the effective interest rate determined under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year is the single interest rate that, if used to determine the present value of the benefits that are taken into account in determining the plan's target normal cost for the plan year, would result in an amount equal to the plan's target normal cost determined for the plan year under section 430(b) as described in § 1.430(d)-1(b)(1) (without regard to calculations for plans in at-risk status under section 430(i)).
(2)
Interest rates used for determining shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments.
The interest rates used to determine the amount of shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments and the present value of those installments are determined based on the dates those installments are assumed to be paid, using the same timing rules that apply in determining target normal cost as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Thus, for a plan that uses the segment rates described in paragraph (c) of this section,
the first segment rate applies to the installments assumed to be paid during the first 5-year period beginning on the valuation date for the plan year, and the second segment rate applies to the installments assumed to be paid during the subsequent 15-year period. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), the shortfall amortization installments for a plan year are assumed to be paid on the valuation date for that plan year. For example, for a plan that uses the segment rates described in paragraph (c) of this section, the shortfall amortization installment for the fifth plan year following the current plan year (the sixth installment) is assumed to be paid on the valuation date for that year so that such shortfall amortization installment will be determined using the second segment rate.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) The January 1, 2009, valuation of Plan P is performed using the segment rates applicable for September 2008 (determined without regard to the transition rule of section 430(h)(2)(G)), and the 2009 annuitant and nonannuitant (male and female) mortality tables as published in Notice 2008-85. See § 601.601(d)(2) relating to objectives and standards for publishing regulations, revenue rulings and revenue procedures in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Plan P provides for early retirement benefits as early as age 50, and offers a single-sum distribution payable immediately at retirement. The single-sum payment is equal to the present value of the participant's accrued benefit, based on the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3). Participant E is the only participant in the plan, and is a male age 46 as of January 1, 2009, with an annual accrued benefit of $23,000 payable beginning at age 65. The actuary assumes a 100% probability that Participant E will terminate at age 50 and will elect to receive his benefit in the form of a single-sum payment.
(ii) Plan P's funding target is $68,908 as of January 1, 2009. This figure is based on the male nonannuitant rates for ages prior to age 50, the applicable mortality rates under section 417(e)(3) for ages 50 and later, and segment interest rates of 5.07% for the first 5 years after the valuation date, 6.09% for the next 15 years, and 6.56% for periods more than 20 years after the valuation date. (See § 1.430(d)-1(f)(9),
Example 10,
for additional details.)
(iii) The present value of Participant E's benefits as of January 1, 2009, is $68,908 if a single interest rate of 6.52805% is substituted for the segment interest rates but all other assumptions remain the same. Thus (rounded), the effective interest rate for Plan P is 6.53% for 2009.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as for
Example 1,
except that Plan P offers a single-sum distribution equal to the present value of the accrued benefit based on the applicable interest rates under section 417(e)(3) or an interest rate of 6.25%, whichever produces the higher amount. The applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) is used for both calculations.
(ii) The present value of Participant E's age-50 single-sum distribution as of January 1, 2009 (when Participant E is age 46) is $77,392. This amount is determined by calculating the projected single-sum distribution at age 50 using the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) and an interest rate of 6.25%, and discounting the result to January 1, 2009, using the first segment rate of 5.07% and male nonannuitant mortality rates for 2009. Because this amount is larger than the present value of Participant E's single-sum payment based on the applicable interest rates under section 417(e)(3) (that is, $68,908), the funding target for Plan P is $77,392 as of January 1, 2009. (See § 1.430(d)-1(f)(9),
Example 12
for additional details.)
(iii) The effective interest rate is the single interest rate that will produce the same funding target if substituted for the segment interest rates keeping all other assumptions the same, including the fixed interest rate used by the plan to determine single-sum payments. The only segment interest rate used to develop the funding target of $77,392 was the first segment rate of 5.07%. Therefore, considering only this calculation, the single interest rate that would produce the same funding target would be 5.07%.
(iv) However, the effective interest rate must also reflect the fact that the single-sum payment under Plan P is equal to the greater of the present value of Participant E's accrued benefit based on the fixed rate of 6.25% or the applicable interest rates under section 417(e)(3). If the single rate of 5.07% is substituted for the segment rates used to calculate the present value of the single-sum payment based on the applicable interest rates, the resulting funding target would be higher than $77,392.
(v) Using a single interest rate of 6.0771%, the January 1, 2009, present value of Participant E's single-sum payment based on the applicable interest rates is $77,392, and the present value of Participant E's single sum payment based on the plan's interest rate of 6.25% is $74,494. Plan P's funding target is the larger of the two, or $77,392, which is the same as the funding target based on the segment interest rates used for the 2009 valuation. Therefore, Plan P's effective interest rate for 2009 (rounded) is 6.08%.

Applicability date.
This section applies for months that begin on or after February 1, 2024. For rules that apply for earlier periods, see 26 CFR 1.430(h)(2)-1 revised as of April 1, 2023.
[T.D. 9467, 74 FR 53055, Oct. 15, 2009; T.D. 9732, 80 FR 54390, Sept. 9, 2015; T.D. 9986, 89 FR 2130, Jan. 12, 2024]
§ 1.430(h)(3)-1
Mortality tables used to determine present value.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
Standard mortality tables.
This section sets forth rules for the mortality tables to be used in determining present value or making any computation under section 430. These mortality tables include—
(i) Generational mortality tables described in paragraph (b) of this section; and
(ii) Static mortality tables for small plans described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Alternative tables
—(i)
Plan-specific mortality tables.
In lieu of using the mortality tables provided under this section, plan-specific substitute mortality tables are permitted to be used for purposes of section 430 pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(C), provided that the requirements of § 1.430(h)(3)-2 are satisfied.
(ii)
Disabled individuals.
In lieu of using the mortality tables provided under this section, mortality tables for disabled individuals are permitted to be used pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(D). These tables are provided in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. See § 601.601(d) of this chapter.
(3)
Individuals not identified as either male or female.
The mortality tables in this section are applied for an individual based on the individual's gender. With respect to the portion of a plan's population for which male or female gender is not identified (for example, because an individual identifies as nonbinary or because the gender information for an individual is not available), the plan's actuary must use a reasonable approach for determining liability. Some reasonable approaches for these individuals include—
(i) Determining the liability for an individual for whom male or female gender is not identified as the weighted average of the liability calculated as if the individual were male and the liability calculated as if the individual were female, with an appropriate weighting that takes into account the distribution of gender for individuals in the plan's population for whom gender is identified; and
(ii) Assigning either male or female status randomly to an individual for whom male or female gender is not identified in a manner that is expected to result in an appropriate proportion of males and females for the plan's population that takes into account the distribution of gender for individuals in the plan's population for whom gender is identified.
(b)
Generational mortality tables
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Construction of generational mortality tables.
The generational mortality tables that are permitted to be used under section 430(h)(3)(A) and paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section are constructed from the base mortality tables described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and the mortality improvement rates described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section.
(ii)
Base mortality tables.
The base mortality tables are set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(iii)
Mortality improvement rates
—(A)
Mortality improvement rates for valuation dates occurring on or after January 1, 2024.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(1)(iii), the mortality improvement rates for valuation dates occurring on or after January 1, 2024, are the 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates as incorporated by reference pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.
(B) [Reserved.]

(2)
Application of mortality improvement rates
—(i)
In general.
Under the generational mortality tables described in this paragraph (b), the probability of an individual's death at a particular age in the future is determined as the individual's base mortality rate that applies at that age (that is, the applicable mortality rate from the tables set forth in paragraph (d) of this section for that age, gender, and status as an annuitant or a non-annuitant) multiplied by the cumulative mortality improvement factor for the individual's gender and for that age for the period from the base year for those mortality tables through the calendar year in which the individual is projected to reach the particular age. Paragraph (b)(3) of this section provides an example that shows how the base mortality tables in paragraph (d) of this section and the mortality improvement rates for valuation dates occurring during 2024 are combined to determine projected mortality rates.
(ii)
Cumulative mortality improvement factor.
The cumulative mortality improvement factor for an age and gender for a period is the product of the annual mortality improvement factors for that age and gender for each year within that period.
(iii)
Annual mortality improvement factor.
The annual mortality improvement factor for an age and gender for a year is 1 minus the mortality improvement rate that applies for that age and gender for that year. If that annual mortality improvement rate is greater than 1 (corresponding to a negative mortality improvement rate), then the projected mortality rate for that age and gender for that year is greater than the projected mortality rate for the same age and gender for the preceding year.
(3)
Example of calculation
—(i)
Calculation of mortality rate.
The mortality rate for 2024 that is applied to a male annuitant who is age 68 in 2024 is equal to the product of the mortality rate under paragraph (d) of this section for a male annuitant who was age 68 in 2012 (0.01418) and the cumulative mortality improvement factor calculated from the 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates for an age 68 male from 2012 to 2024. The cumulative mortality improvement factor for age 68 males for the period from 2012 to 2024 is 0.9827, and the mortality rate for 2024 for male annuitants who are age 68 in that year is 0.01393, as shown in the following table.

(ii)
Probability of survival for an individual.
After the projected mortality rates are derived for each age for each year, the rates are used to calculate the present value of a benefit stream that depends on the probability of survival year-by-year. For example, for purposes of calculating the present value (for a 2024 valuation date) of future payments in a benefit stream payable for a male annuitant who is age 68 in 2024, the probability of survival for the annuitant is based on the mortality rate for a male annuitant who is age 68 in 2024 (0.01393), and the projected mortality rate for a male annuitant who will be age 69 in 2025 (0.01507), age 70 in 2026 (0.01635), and so on.
(4)
Use of the tables
—(i)
Separate tables for annuitants and non-annuitants.
Separate mortality tables are provided for use with respect to annuitants and non-annuitants. The non-annuitant mortality tables are applied to determine the probability of survival for a non-annuitant for the period before the non-annuitant is projected to commence receiving benefits. The annuitant mortality tables are applied to determine the present value of benefits for each annuitant. In addition, the annuitant mortality tables are applied for each non-annuitant with respect to each assumed commencement of benefits for the period beginning with that assumed commencement. For purposes of this section, an annuitant means a plan participant who has commenced receiving benefits and a non-annuitant means a plan participant who has not yet commenced receiving benefits (for example, an active employee or a terminated vested participant). A participant whose benefit has partially commenced is treated as an annuitant with respect to the portion of the benefit that has commenced and treated as a non-annuitant with respect to the balance of the benefit. In addition, with respect to a beneficiary of a participant, the annuitant mortality tables apply for the period beginning with each assumed commencement of benefits for the participant. If the participant has died (or to the extent the participant is assumed to die before commencing benefits), the annuitant mortality tables apply with respect to the beneficiary for the period beginning with each assumed commencement of benefits for the beneficiary.
(ii)
Examples of calculation using separate non-annuitant and annuitant tables.
With respect to a 45-year-old active participant who is projected to commence receiving an annuity at age 55, the funding target is determined using the non-annuitant mortality tables for the period before the participant attains age 55 and using the annuitant mortality tables for the period ages 55 and above. Similarly, for a 45-year-old terminated vested participant who is projected to commence an annuity at age 65, the funding target is determined using the non-annuitant mortality tables for the period before the participant attains age 65 and using the annuitant mortality tables for ages 65 and above.
(c)
Static mortality tables
—(1)
Availability of alternative tables for small plans
—(i)
In general.
As an alternative to the generational mortality tables defined in paragraph (b) of this section, static mortality tables may be used for a small plan. The static mortality tables described in this paragraph (c) are constructed from the separate non-annuitant and annuitant static mortality tables described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, combined using the procedure described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Definition of small plan.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), a small plan is defined as a plan with 500 or fewer total participants (including both active and inactive participants and beneficiaries of deceased participants) on the valuation date.
(iii)
Use of static mortality tables.
The static mortality tables that are used for a valuation date are the static mortality tables for the calendar year that includes the valuation date.
(iv)
Publication of mortality tables.
The static mortality tables for the 2024 calendar year are set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.

# Note 1 to paragraph (c)(1)(iv):
The static mortality tables for valuation dates occurring in later calendar years will be published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
See
§ 601.601(d) of this chapter.
(2)
Development of static mortality tables
—(i)
Non-annuitant and annuitant mortality tables.
The non-annuitant and annuitant static mortality tables are
determined using the base mortality tables described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The rates in those base mortality tables are adjusted using the mortality improvement rates described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, in accordance with the rules set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Combined static mortality tables.
The static mortality tables described in this paragraph (c) are constructed from the separate non-annuitant and annuitant static mortality tables pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, blended using the weighting factors in paragraph (d) of this section. The weighting factors are applied to develop these combined static tables using the following equation: Combined mortality rate = [non-annuitant rate * (1 − weighting factor)] + [annuitant rate * weighting factor].
(3)
Projection of mortality improvements
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the static mortality tables for a calendar year are determined by multiplying the applicable mortality rate for each age from the base mortality tables by both—
(A) The cumulative mortality improvement factor (determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) for the period from 2012 through that calendar year; and
(B) The cumulative mortality improvement factor (determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) for the period beginning in that calendar year and continuing beyond that calendar year for the number of years in the projection period described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Projection period for static mortality tables
—(A)
In general.
The projection period is 8 years for males and 9 years for females, as adjusted based on age as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Age adjustment.
For ages below 80, the projection period is increased by 1 year for each year below age 80. For ages above 80, the projection period is reduced (but not below zero) by
1/3
year for each year above 80.
(iii)
Fractional projection periods.
If for an age the number of years in the projection period determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section is not a whole number, then the mortality rate for that age is determined by using linear interpolation between—
(A) The mortality rate for that age that would be determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section if the number of years in the projection period were the next lower whole number; and
(B) The mortality rate for that age that would be determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section if the number of years in the projection period were the next higher whole number.
(iv)
Example.
For example, at age 85 the projection period for a male is 6
1/3
years (8 years minus
1/3
year for each of the 5 years above age 80). For a valuation date in 2024, the mortality rate in the static mortality table for an 85-year-old male is based on a projection of mortality improvement for 6
1/3
years beyond 2024. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the mortality rate for an 85-year-old male annuitant in the static mortality table for 2024 is
2/3
times the projected mortality rate for a male annuitant that age in 2030 plus
1/3
times the projected mortality rate for a male annuitant that age in 2031. Accordingly, the mortality rate for an 85-year-old male annuitant in the static mortality table for 2024 is 0.08126 (
2/3
times the projected mortality rate for an 85-year-old male annuitant in 2030 (0.08146) plus
1/3
times the projected mortality rate for an 85-year-old male annuitant in 2031 (0.08086)).
(d)
Base mortality tables.
The following are the base mortality tables. The base year for these tables is 2012.

[T.D. 9983, 88 FR 72361, Oct. 20, 2023]
§ 1.430(h)(3)-2
Plan-specific substitute mortality tables used to determine present value.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for the use of substitute mortality tables under section 430(h)(3)(C) in determining any present value or making any computation under section 430 in accordance with § 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(1). To use substitute mortality tables for a plan, a plan sponsor must first obtain approval to use the tables in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for the development of substitute mortality tables, including guidelines providing that a plan must have either
fully or partially credible mortality information in order to use substitute mortality tables. Paragraph (d) of this section describes the requirements for full credibility. Paragraph (e) of this section describes the requirements for partial credibility. Paragraph (f) of this section provides special rules for newly-affiliated plans. Paragraph (g) of this section specifies the effective date and applicability date of this section. The Commissioner may, in revenue rulings and procedures, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), provide additional guidance regarding approval and use of substitute mortality tables under section 430(h)(3)(C) and related matters.
(b)
Procedures for obtaining approval to use substitute mortality tables
—(1)
Written request for approval to use substitute mortality tables
—(i)
General requirements.
To use substitute mortality tables, a plan sponsor must first submit a written request to the Commissioner demonstrating that those substitute mortality tables meet the requirements of section 430(h)(3)(C) and this section. This request must specify the first plan year, and the term of years (not more than 10), for which the tables are to apply.
(ii)
Time for written request.
Substitute mortality tables may not be used for a plan year unless the plan sponsor submits the written request described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section at least 7 months before the first day of the first plan year for which the substitute mortality tables are to apply.
(2)
Commissioner's review of request
—(i)
In general.
During the 180-day period that begins on the date the plan sponsor submits a request for approval to use substitute mortality tables for a plan pursuant to this section, the Commissioner will determine whether the request for approval to use substitute mortality tables satisfies the requirements of this section (including any published guidance issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section), and will either approve or deny the request. The Commissioner will deny a request if the request fails to meet the requirements of this section or if the Commissioner determines that a substitute mortality table does not reflect the actual mortality experience of the applicable population.
(ii)
Request for additional information.
The Commissioner may request additional information with respect to the submission and deny a request to use substitute mortality tables if the additional information is not provided in a timely manner.
(iii)
Deemed approval.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, if the Commissioner does not issue a denial within the 180-day review period, the request is deemed to have been approved.
(iv)
Extension of time permitted.
The Commissioner and a plan sponsor may, before the expiration of the 180-day review period, agree in writing to extend that period.
(c)
Development of substitute mortality tables
—(1)
Substitute mortality tables must be used for all plans in controlled group
—(i)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), substitute mortality tables are permitted to be used for a plan for a plan year only if, for that plan year (or any portion of that plan year), substitute mortality tables are also approved and used for each other pension plan subject to the requirements of section 430 that is maintained by the plan sponsor and by each member of the plan sponsor's controlled group. For purposes of this section, the term controlled group means any group that is treated as a single employer under paragraph (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414. See paragraph (c)(7) of this section for special rules applicable to multiple-employer plans.
(ii)
Treatment of plans without credible mortality information.
The rule of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section does not prohibit use of substitute mortality tables for one plan for a plan year if the only other plan or plans maintained by the plan sponsor (or by a member of the plan sponsor's controlled group) for which substitute mortality tables are not used are too small to have fully or partially credible mortality information for the plan year. For this purpose, the demonstration that neither males nor females under a plan have credible mortality information for a plan year must be made by analyzing
the actual number of deaths over a period that is the same length as the longest experience study period used for any plan within the controlled group and that ends less than three years before the first day of the plan year.
(2)
Mortality experience requirements
—(i)
In general.
Substitute mortality tables must reflect the actual mortality experience of the pension plan for which the tables will be used, and that mortality experience must consist of credible mortality information as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Separate substitute mortality tables must be established for each gender and, except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, a substitute mortality table is permitted to be established for a gender only if the plan has credible mortality information for that gender. See paragraph (d)(5) of this section for rules permitting the use of substitute mortality tables for separate populations within a gender in certain circumstances.
(ii)
Credible mortality information
—(A)
In general.
A plan has credible mortality information for a gender if and only if the mortality experience with respect to that gender satisfies the requirement for either full credibility (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) or partial credibility (as described in paragraph (e) of this section).
(B)
Simplified rule.
Whether there is credible mortality information for a gender may be determined by only taking into account people who are at least age 50 and less than age 100. If there is credible mortality information for a gender using this simplified rule, the entire gender (not just those who are at least age 50 and less than age 100) has credible mortality information.
(iii)
Gender without credible mortality information
—(A)
In general.
If, for the first plan year substitute mortality tables will be used for a plan, one gender has credible mortality information but the other gender does not have credible mortality information, then substitute mortality tables are established for the gender that has credible mortality information, and the mortality tables under § 1.430(h)(3)-1 are used for the gender that does not have credible mortality information. For a subsequent plan year, the plan sponsor may continue to use substitute mortality tables for the gender with credible mortality information without using substitute mortality tables for the other gender only if the other gender continues to lack credible mortality information for that subsequent plan year.
(B)
Demonstration of lack of credible mortality information for a gender.
The demonstration that a gender does not have credible mortality information (that is, the individuals of that gender had fewer than the minimum number of actual deaths to have partial credibility, as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) for a plan year must be made by analyzing the actual number of deaths over a period that is the same length as the period for the experience study on which the substitute mortality tables are based and that ends less than three years before the first day of the plan year.
(3)
Determination of substitute mortality tables
—(i)
Requirement to use generational mortality table.
A plan's substitute mortality tables must be generational mortality tables. A plan's substitute mortality tables are determined using the plan's base substitute mortality tables developed pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this section and the mortality improvement factors described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Determination of mortality improvement factors.
The mortality improvement factor for an age and gender is the cumulative mortality improvement factor determined under § 1.430(h)(3)-1(b)(2)(ii) for that age and gender for the applicable period. The applicable period is the period beginning with the base year for the base substitute mortality table determined under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section and ending in the calendar year in which the individual attains the age for which the probability of death is being determined. The base year for the base substitute mortality table is the calendar year that contains the day before the midpoint of the experience study period.
(4)
Disabled individuals.
Under section 430(h)(3)(D), separate mortality tables are permitted to be used for certain disabled individuals. If the separate mortality tables issued under section 430(h)(3)(D) for certain disabled individuals are used, then those disabled individuals are disregarded for all purposes under this section. Thus, if the mortality tables under section 430(h)(3)(D) are used for disabled individuals under a plan, mortality experience with respect to those individuals must be excluded in developing mortality rates for substitute mortality tables under this section.
(5)
Aggregation
—(i)
Permissive aggregation of plans.
A plan sponsor may use the same substitute mortality tables for two or more of its plans provided that the rules of this section are applied by treating those plans as a single plan. In such a case, the substitute mortality tables must be based on data collected with respect to those aggregated plans.
(ii)
Required aggregation of plans.
In general, plans are not required to be aggregated for purposes of applying the rules of this section. However, for purposes of this section, a plan is required to be aggregated with any plan that was previously spun off from that plan if a purpose of the spinoff is to avoid the use of substitute mortality tables for any of the plans that were involved in the spinoff.
(iii)
Special rule regarding experience study if aggregated plans have different plan years.
If two or more plans are aggregated pursuant to this paragraph (c)(5) and not all of the plans have the same plan year, then the experience study period may be a period that is not a multiple of 12 months, provided that—
(A) The period over which mortality experience is collected for each plan (the data study period) is a multiple of 12 months and is based on the plan year for that plan;
(B) The data study periods for all of the plans consist of the same number of years;
(C) The data study periods for all of the plans satisfy the experience study period requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section; and
(D) The data study periods for all of the plans have been selected to minimize the total period of time covered by the experience study period by overlapping (to the greatest extent possible) those data study periods.
(6)
Duration of use of tables
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in this paragraph (c)(6), substitute mortality tables are used for a plan for the term of consecutive plan years specified in the plan sponsor's written request for approval to use such tables under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and approved by the Commissioner, or a shorter period prescribed by the Commissioner in the approval to use substitute mortality tables. Following the end of the approved term of use, or following any early termination of use described in this paragraph (c)(6), the mortality tables specified in § 1.430(h)(3)-1 must be used for the plan unless approval under paragraph (b)(1) of this section has been received by the plan sponsor to use substitute mortality tables based on an updated experience study for a further term.
(ii)
Early termination of use of tables.
A plan's substitute mortality tables must not be used beginning with the earliest of—
(A) For a plan using a substitute mortality table for only one gender because of a lack of credible mortality information with respect to the other gender, the first plan year for which there is credible mortality information with respect to the gender that had lacked credible mortality information (unless an approved substitute mortality table is used for that gender);
(B) The first plan year for which the plan fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section (regarding use of substitute mortality tables for all plans in the controlled group), taking into account the rules of paragraph (f)(3) of this section (regarding the transition period for newly-affiliated plans);
(C) The second plan year following the plan year for which there is a significant change in individuals covered by the plan as described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section;
(D) The first plan year following the plan year for which a substitute mortality table used for a population is no
longer accurately predictive of future mortality of that population, as determined by the Commissioner or as certified by the plan's actuary to the satisfaction of the Commissioner; or
(E) The date specified in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d) of this chapter) in conjunction with a replacement of mortality tables specified under section 430(h)(3)(A) and § 1.430(h)(3)-1 (other than changes to the mortality improvement rates under § 1.430(h)(3)-1(b)(1)(iii) or annual updates to the static mortality tables issued as noted in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(c)(1)(iv)).
(iii)
Significant change in coverage
—(A)
Change in coverage from time of experience study.
For purposes of applying the rules of paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section, a significant change in the individuals covered by a substitute mortality table for a plan year occurs if the number of individuals covered by the substitute mortality table for the plan year is less than 80 percent or more than 120 percent of the average number of individuals in that population over the years covered by the experience study on which the substitute mortality tables are based. However, a change in coverage is not treated as significant if the plan's actuary certifies in writing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the substitute mortality tables used for the population continue to be accurately predictive of future mortality of that population (taking into account the effect of the change in the population).
(B)
Change in coverage from time of certification.
For purposes of applying the rules of paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section, a significant change in the individuals covered by a substitute mortality table for a plan year occurs if the number of individuals covered by the substitute mortality table for the plan year is less than 80 percent or more than 120 percent of the number of individuals covered by the substitute mortality table in a plan year for which a certification described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A) of this section was made on account of a prior change in coverage. However, a change in coverage is not treated as significant if the plan's actuary certifies in writing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the substitute mortality tables used by the plan with respect to the covered population continue to be accurately predictive of future mortality of that population (taking into account the effect of the change in the population).
(7)
Multiple-employer plans
—(i)
General rule.
In the case of a multiple-employer plan described in section 413(c), the plan administrator (as described in section 414(g)) is treated as the plan sponsor for purposes of this section. If approval is received to use substitute mortality tables by a plan, those tables must apply on a plan-wide basis (even if the plan is subject to the rules of section 413(c)(4)(A)).
(ii)
Application of controlled group consistency rules.
In the case of an employer that participates in a multiple-employer plan, if the proportion of the plan's funding target attributable to the employees and former employees of the employer and members of its controlled group represents more than 50 percent of the plan's funding target, then the employer is treated as maintaining the plan for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Thus, for a multiple-employer plan with credible mortality information that is treated as maintained by an employer under this paragraph (c)(7), unless substitute mortality tables are used for that plan, substitute mortality tables may not be used for any plan maintained by that employer or a member of its controlled group (and if substitute mortality tables are used for any other plan maintained by any member of the employer's controlled group, they must be used for the multiple-employer plan). By contrast, if the proportion of the plan's funding target attributable to the employees and former employees of the employer and members of its controlled group represents 50 percent or less of the funding target for a multiple-employer plan in which it participates, then the employer is not treated as maintaining the plan for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Accordingly, whether substitute mortality tables may be used for other plans in such an employer's controlled group is independent of whether substitute mortality tables are used for the multiple-employer plan.
(d)
Full credibility
—(1)
In general.
The mortality experience with respect to a gender or other population within a plan has full credibility if the actual number of deaths for that population during the experience study period described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is at least the full credibility threshold described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Paragraph (d)(4) of this section provides rules for the creation of a base substitute mortality table from the experience study, which apply if the mortality experience for the population has full credibility. Paragraph (d)(5) of this section provides rules regarding the use of separate substitute mortality tables for plan populations within a gender. Paragraph (d)(6) of this section provides an option to use the combined mortality experience of both genders to determine the existence and extent of credible mortality information and to develop a single mortality ratio for use in constructing substitute mortality tables.
(2)
Experience study period requirements
—(i)
General rule.
The base substitute mortality table for a gender or other population must be developed from an experience study of the mortality experience of that population that is collected over an experience study period. The experience study period must consist of 2, 3, 4, or 5 consecutive 12-month periods, and must be the same period for all populations except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Requirement to use recent experience data
—(A)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the last day of the experience study period must be less than 3 years before the first day of the first plan year for which the substitute mortality tables are to apply. For example, if January 1, 2019, is the first day of the first plan year for which the substitute mortality tables will be used, then an experience study using calendar year data generally must include data collected for a period that ends no earlier than December 31, 2016.
(B)
Exception for submission between 1 and 2 years before effective date of table.
If the plan sponsor submits a request for approval to use of substitute mortality tables more than 1 year (and less than 2 years) before the first day of the first plan year for which the substitute mortality tables are to apply, then the experience study is not treated as failing to satisfy the rule in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section if the last day of the final year reflected in the experience data is less than 2 years before the date of submission. For example, if an application for approval to use of substitute mortality tables that would apply for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2019 is submitted in 2017, then an experience study using calendar year data may be based on data collected for a period that ends as early as December 31, 2015.
(iii)
Experience study based on benefit amount.
As provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the mortality rates under the base substitute mortality tables are amounts-weighted mortality rates that are derived from the experience study. An individual's benefit amount (which is used to determine amounts-weighted mortality rates and for other purposes under this paragraph (d)) is the individual's accrued benefit expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age (or at the current age, if later) if an individual has not commenced benefits and the individual's annual payment if the individual has commenced benefits. Because amounts-weighted mortality rates for a plan are determined using benefit amounts, the experience study used to develop a base substitute mortality table may not include periods before the plan was established.
(3)
Full credibility threshold
—(i)
Threshold number of deaths.
The full credibility threshold for a gender or other population is the product of 1,082 and the population's benefit dispersion factor. In calculating the population's benefit dispersion factor, for purposes of paragraphs (d)(3)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section, the population is adjusted, as appropriate, for individuals who leave the population on account of a reason other than death.
(ii)
Population's benefit dispersion factor.
The population's benefit dispersion factor is equal to—
(A) The number of expected deaths for the population during the experience study period (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section); multiplied by
(B) The sum of the mortality-weighted squares of the benefits (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section); divided by
(C) The square of the sum of the mortality-weighted benefits (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section).
(iii)
Number of expected deaths.
For a population, the number of expected deaths during the experience study period is equal to the sum, for all years in the experience study period, of the expected number of deaths in the population during the year using the mortality rates from the standard mortality tables determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section. This amount is equal to:
ER05OC17.000
Where E is equal to the number of years in the experience study period, t represents each year during the experience study period, x represents an individual in the population during year t, q
xt
is the mortality rate for that individual's age and gender for the calendar year in which year t begins under the applicable standard mortality table determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, and N
t
is equal to the number of individuals in the population in year t.
(iv)
Sum of the mortality-weighted squares of the benefits
—(A)
Determination.
For a population, the sum of the mortality-weighted squares of the benefits is the sum, for all years in the experience study period, for all individuals in the population at the beginning of the year, of the product of—
(
1
) The probability of death for the individual using the mortality rate for the individual's age and gender from the standard mortality table determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section; and
(
2
) The square of the benefit amount for the individual.
(B)
Expression as formula.
The sum of the mortality-weighted squares of the benefits for a population determined pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section is equal to:
ER05OC17.001
Where E is equal to the number of years in the experience study period, t represents each year during the experience study period, x represents an individual in the population during year t, q
xt
is the mortality rate for that individual's age and gender for the calendar year in which year t begins under the applicable standard mortality table determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, b
xt
is equal to the benefit amount for that individual for year t, and N
t
is equal to the number of individuals in the population in year t.
(v)
Square of the sum of the mortality-weighted benefits
—(A)
Determination.
For a population, the square of the sum of the mortality-weighted benefits is equal to the square of the sum, for all years in the experience study period, for all individuals in the population at the beginning of the year, of the product of—
(
1
) The probability of death of the individual using the mortality rate for the individual's age and gender from the standard mortality table determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section; and
(
2
) The benefit amount for the individual.
(B)
Expression as formula.
The square of the sum of the mortality-weighted benefits for a population determined pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(v)(A) of this section is equal to:
ER05OC17.002
Where E is equal to the number of years in the experience study period, t represents each year during the experience study period, x represents an individual in the population during year t, q
xt
is the mortality rate for that individual's age and gender for the calendar year in which t begins under the applicable standard mortality table determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, b
xt
is equal to the benefit amount for that individual for year t, and N
t
is equal to the number of individuals in the population in year t.
(4)
Development of mortality rates
—(i)
In general.
The mortality rates under the base substitute mortality tables must be amounts-weighted mortality rates that are derived from the experience study. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, the mortality rate for an age and gender is determined by multiplying the mortality rate for that age and gender from the standard mortality table determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section by the mortality ratio determined under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. If the simplified rule of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section is used for the population, then the mortality ratio is determined only taking into account people who are at least 50 years old and less than 100 years old, but the mortality ratio is applied to all ages.
(ii)
Mortality ratio
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, a mortality ratio is determined for a gender or other population within a gender, and is equal to the quotient determined by dividing—
(
1
) The sum, for all years in the experience study period, of the benefit amount for all individuals in the population at the beginning of the year who died during the year, by
(
2
) The sum, for all years in the experience study period, for all individuals in the population at the beginning of the year (adjusted, as appropriate, for individuals who leave on account of reason other than death), of the product of—
(
i
) The probability of death of the individual using the mortality rate for the individual's age and gender from the standard mortality table determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section; and
(
ii
) The benefit amount for the individual.
(B)
Expression as formula.
For purposes of determining a mortality ratio as described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the amount described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section is equal to:
ER05OC17.003
Where E is equal to the number of years in the experience study period, t represents each year during the experience study period, x represents an individual in the population during year t, q
xt
is the mortality rate for that individual's age and gender for the calendar year in which t begins under the applicable standard mortality table determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, b
xt
is equal to the benefit amount for that individual for year t, and N
t
is equal to the number of individuals in the population in year t.
(iii)
Standard mortality table
—(A)
Projection of base table.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(4)(iii), the standard mortality table for a year is the mortality table determined by applying cumulative mortality improvement factors determined under § 1.430(h)(3)-1(b)(2)(ii) to the base mortality table under § 1.430(h)(3)-1(d) for the period beginning with the base year for that mortality table and ending in the base year for the base substitute mortality table determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the cumulative mortality improvement factors are determined using the mortality improvement rates described in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(b)(1)(iii) that apply for the calendar year during which the plan sponsor submits the request for approval to use substitute mortality tables.
(B)
Adjustments to standard mortality table for 2020, 2021, and 2022.
If a 12-month period in the experience study period begins after December 31, 2019,
and before January 1, 2023, the probability of death for an individual under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A)(
2
)(
i
) of this section is determined as the mortality rate for the individual's age (at the beginning of the year) and gender from the standard mortality table determined under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section multiplied by the adjustment factor in Table 1 for the calendar year that includes the first day of the 12-month period. For example, for an experience study period that begins April 1, 2019, and ends March 31, 2023, the probability of death for the year beginning April 1, 2022, for a male annuitant who is age 65 as of that date is the probability of death from the base mortality table (0.01087), multiplied by the cumulative mortality improvement factor for the period from 2012 to 2021 (1.02292) and by the adjustment factor for the 2022 calendar year of 1.075, resulting in a probability of death of 0.01195.

Selection of base table.
If the population consists solely of annuitants, the annuitant base mortality table set forth in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(d) must be used for purposes of paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. If the population consists solely of nonannuitants, the nonannuitant base mortality table set forth in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(d) must be used for that purpose. If the population includes both annuitants and nonannuitants, a combination of the annuitant and nonannuitant base tables set forth in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(d) must be used for that purpose. The combined table is constructed using the weighting factors for small plans that are set forth in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(d). The weighting factors are applied to develop the combined table using the following equation:
Combined mortality rate = [nonannuitant rate * (1−weighting factor)] + [annuitant rate * weighting factor].
(iv)
Modification for ages 96 and older.
Mortality rates for ages 96 and older under the base substitute mortality table are determined using the rules of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section but substituting a modified mortality ratio for the mortality ratio determined under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. The modified mortality ratio is determined as follows—
(A) For ages 96 through 109, if the mortality ratio is greater than 1.0, the modified mortality ratio is equal to the mortality ratio for the population reduced by 1/15th of the excess of the mortality ratio over 1.0 for each year that the age exceeds 95.
(B) For ages 96 through 109, if the mortality ratio is less than 1.0, the modified mortality ratio is equal to the mortality ratio for the population increased by 1/15th of the excess of 1.0 over the mortality ratio for each year that the age exceeds 95.
(C) For ages 110 and older, the modified mortality ratio is equal to 1.0.
(v)
Change in number of individuals covered by table.
Experience data may not be used to develop a base table if the number of individuals in the population covered by the table (for example, the male annuitant population) as of the last day of the plan year before the year the request for approval to use the substitute mortality table is made is less than 80 percent or more than 120 percent of the average number of individuals in that population over the years covered by the experience study on which the substitute mortality tables are based, unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the experience data is accurately predictive of future mortality of that population (taking into account the effect of the change in individuals) after appropriate adjustments to the data are made (for example, excluding data from individuals with respect to a spun-off portion of the plan). For this purpose, a reasonable estimate of the number of individuals in the population covered by the table may be used.
(5)
Separate tables for specified populations
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (d)(5), separate substitute mortality tables are permitted to be used for separate populations within a gender only if—
(A) All individuals of that gender are divided into separate populations;
(B) Each separate population has mortality experience that has full credibility as determined under the rules of paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section; and
(C) The separate base substitute mortality table for each separate population is developed applying the rules of paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section using an experience study that takes into account solely members of that population.
(ii)
Annuitant and nonannuitant separate populations.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section, a gender may be separated into separate populations of annuitants and nonannuitants for the purpose of developing and using substitute mortality tables, even if only one of those separate populations has credible mortality information. Similarly, if separate populations that satisfy paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section are established, then any of those populations may be further subdivided into separate annuitant and nonannuitant subpopulations, provided that at least one of the two resulting subpopulations has credible mortality information. The standard mortality tables under § 1.430(h)(3)-1 are used for a resulting subpopulation that does not have credible mortality information. For example, if the male hourly and salaried populations under a plan each have mortality experience with full credibility and the male salaried annuitant population has credible mortality information, then substitute mortality tables may be used for the plan with respect to the male salaried annuitant population even if the standard mortality tables under § 1.430(h)(3)-1 are used with respect to the male salaried nonannuitant population (because that nonannuitant population does not have credible mortality information).
(iii)
Credible mortality information for separate populations.
In determining whether the mortality experience for a separate population within a gender has full credibility, the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be applied to that separate population. In demonstrating that an annuitant (or nonannuitant) population within a gender or within a separate population does not have credible mortality information, the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section are applied by substituting the annuitant (or nonannuitant) population for the gender.
(6)
Option to determine a single mortality ratio for both genders.
Base substitute mortality tables for a plan may be constructed by developing and applying a single mortality ratio for both genders, but only if the substitute mortality tables used for all plans maintained by members of the plan sponsor's controlled group (except for plans for which both the male and female populations, considered separately, have mortality experience with full credibility) are constructed in this manner. If the option under this paragraph (d)(6) is applied for a plan then, for all plans maintained by members of the plan sponsor's controlled group, whether both the male and female populations within the plan have credible mortality information (and, if that combined population's mortality experience does not have full credibility, the partial credibility weighting factor for the plan) is determined using the combined mortality experience for both genders.
(e)
Partial credibility
—(1)
In general.
The mortality experience with respect to a population has partial credibility if the actual number of deaths for that population during the experience study period described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is at least equal to 100 and is less than the full credibility threshold described for the population in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If the mortality experience for the population has partial credibility, then in lieu of creating a base substitute mortality table as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the base substitute mortality table is created as the sum of—
(i) The product of—
(A) The partial credibility weighting factor determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and
(B) The mortality rates that are derived from the experience study determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, and
(ii) The product of—
(A) One minus the partial credibility weighting factor described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and
(B) The mortality rate from the standard mortality tables described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.
(2)
Partial credibility weighting factor.
The partial credibility weighting factor is equal to the square root of the fraction—
(i) The numerator of which is the actual number of deaths for the population during the experience study period, and
(ii) The denominator of which is the full credibility threshold for the population described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(f)
Special rules for newly-affiliated plans
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (f) provides special rules that provide temporary relief from certain rules in this section in the case of a controlled group that includes a newly-affiliated plan (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section). Paragraph (f)(3) of this section provides a transition period during which the requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section (that is, the requirement that all plans within the controlled group that have credible mortality information must use substitute mortality tables) is not applicable. Paragraph (f)(4) of this section provides special rules that permit the use of a shorter experience study period in the case of a newly-affiliated plan that excludes the mortality experience data for the period before the date the plan becomes a newly-affiliated plan.
(2)
Definition of newly-affiliated plan.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), a plan is a newly-affiliated plan if the plan sponsor becomes a member of the new controlled group in connection with a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction described in § 1.410(b)-2(f). A plan also is treated as a newly-affiliated plan for purposes of this section if the plan is established in connection with a transfer of assets and liabilities from another employer's plan in connection with a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction described in § 1.410(b)-2(f).
(3)
Transition period for newly-affiliated plans.
The use of substitute mortality tables for a plan within a controlled group is not prohibited merely because, during the transition period, substitute mortality tables are not used for a newly-affiliated plan that fails to demonstrate a lack of credible mortality information during that period. Similarly, during the transition period, the use of substitute mortality tables for a newly-affiliated plan is not prohibited merely because substitute mortality tables are not used for another plan within the controlled group that fails to demonstrate a lack of credible mortality information during that period. The transition period begins on the date of the transaction that results in the plan becoming a newly-affiliated plan and ends on the last day of the plan year that immediately follows the latest ending period described in section 410(b)(6)(C)(ii) with respect to that transaction for any of the plans in the controlled group.
(4)
Experience study period for newly-affiliated plan
—(i)
In general.
The mortality experience data for a newly-affiliated plan may either include or exclude mortality experience data for the period before the date the plan becomes a newly-affiliated plan. If a plan sponsor excludes mortality experience data for the period before the date the plan becomes a newly-affiliated plan, the exclusion must apply for all populations within the plan.
(ii)
Demonstration relating to lack of credible mortality information.
If the experience study for a newly-affiliated plan excludes mortality experience data for the period prior to the date the plan becomes a newly-affiliated plan, then the demonstration that the plan does not have credible mortality information for a plan year that begins after the transition period can be made using a shorter experience study period than would otherwise be permitted under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, provided that the experience study period begins with the date the plan becomes a newly-affiliated plan and ends not more than one year and one day before the first day of the plan year.
(iii)
Demonstration relating to credible mortality information.
If the experience study for a newly-affiliated plan excludes mortality experience data for the period before the date the plan becomes a newly-affiliated plan and the
plan fails to demonstrate that it does not have credible mortality information for the plan year under the rules of paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, then other plans within the controlled group may continue to use substitute mortality tables only if substitute mortality tables are used for the newly-affiliated plan for the plan year. In such a case, the experience study period for the newly-affiliated plan may consist of a 12-month period.
(g)
Applicability date
—(1)
General rule.
This section applies for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) or (3) of this section, the substitute mortality table used for a plan for such a plan year must comply with the rules of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
(2)
Transition rule for previously approved substitute mortality tables.
If a plan sponsor has received approval from the Commissioner to use substitute mortality tables for a plan year beginning in 2025, then the plan's base substitute mortality tables that were approved are treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable, for that plan year.
(3)
Transition rule for requests for approval to use substitute mortality tables.
A written request described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section to use substitute mortality tables for a plan year that begins during 2025 does not fail to satisfy the timing requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section if it is submitted no later than October 31, 2024, provided that the plan sponsor agrees to a 90-day extension of the 180-day review period in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.
[T.D. 9826, 82 FR 46404, Oct. 5, 2017, as amended by T.D. 9983, 88 FR 72366, Oct. 20, 2023; T.D. 10005, 89 FR 61345, July 31, 2024]
§ 1.430(i)-1
Special rules for plans in at-risk status.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
This section provides special rules related to determining the funding target and making other computations for certain defined benefit plans that are in at-risk status for the plan year. Section 430(i) and this section apply to single employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans) but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section 414(f)). Paragraph (b) of this section describes rules for determining whether a plan is in at-risk status for a plan year, including the determination of a plan's funding target attainment percentage and at-risk funding target attainment percentage. Paragraph (c) of this section describes the funding target for a plan in at-risk status. Paragraph (d) of this section describes the target normal cost for a plan in at-risk status. Paragraph (e) of this section describes rules regarding how the funding target and the target normal cost are determined for a plan that has been in at-risk status for fewer than 5 consecutive plan years. Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth effective/applicability dates and transition rules.
(2)
Special rules for multiple employer plans.
In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules of section 430 and this section are applied separately for each employer under the plan, as if each employer maintained a separate plan. For example, at-risk status is determined separately for each employer under such a multiple employer plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430 and this section are applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.
(b)
Determination of at-risk status of a plan
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a plan is in at-risk status for a plan year if—
(i) The funding target attainment percentage for the preceding plan year (determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section) is less than 80 percent; and
(ii) The at-risk funding target attainment percentage for the preceding plan year (determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section) is less than 70 percent.
(2)
Small plan exception.
If, on each day during the preceding plan year, a
plan had 500 or fewer participants (including both active and inactive participants), determined in accordance with the same rules that apply for purposes of § 1.430(g)-1(b)(2)(ii), then the plan is not treated as being in at-risk status for the plan year.
(3)
Funding target attainment percentage.
For purposes of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the funding target attainment percentage of a plan for a plan year is the funding target attainment percentage as defined in § 1.430(d)-1(b)(3).
(4)
At-risk funding target attainment percentage.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the at-risk funding target attainment percentage of a plan for a plan year is a fraction (expressed as a percentage)—
(i) The numerator of which is the value of plan assets for the plan year after subtraction of the prefunding balance and the funding standard carryover balance under section 430(f)(4)(B); and
(ii) The denominator of which is the at-risk funding target of the plan for the plan year (determined under paragraph (c) of this section, but without regard to the loading factor imposed under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section).
(5)
Special rules
—(i)
Special rule for new plans.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, in the case of a new plan that was neither the result of a merger nor involved in a spinoff, the funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (b)(3) of this section and the at-risk funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (b)(4) of this section are equal to 100 percent for years before the plan exists.
(ii)
Special rule for plans with zero funding target.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, if the funding target of the plan is equal to zero for a plan year, then the funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (b)(3) of this section and the at-risk funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (b)(4) of this section are equal to 100 percent for that plan year.
(iii)
Exception when plan has predecessor plan that was in at-risk status.
[Reserved]
(iv)
Special rules for plans that are the result of a merger.
[Reserved]
(v)
Special rules for plans that are involved in a spinoff.
[Reserved]
(6)
Special rule for determining at-risk status of plans of specified automobile manufacturers.
See section 430(i)(4)(C) for special rules for determining the at-risk status of plans of specified automobile and automobile parts manufacturers.
(c)
Funding target for plans in at-risk status
—(1)
In general.
If the plan has been in at-risk status for 5 consecutive years, including the current plan year, then the funding target for the plan is the at-risk funding target determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. See paragraph (e) of this section for the determination of the funding target where the plan is in at-risk status for the plan year but was not in at-risk status for one or more of the 4 preceding plan years.
(2)
At-risk funding target
—(i)
Use of modified actuarial assumptions.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(2), the at-risk funding target of the plan under this paragraph (c)(2) for the plan year is equal to the present value of all benefits accrued or earned under the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, as determined in accordance with § 1.430(d)-1 but using the additional actuarial assumptions described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Funding target includes load.
The at-risk funding target is increased by the sum of—
(A) $700 multiplied by the number of participants in the plan (including active participants, inactive participants, and beneficiaries); plus
(B) Four percent of the funding target (determined under § 1.430(d)-1(b)(2) as if the plan was not in at-risk status) of the plan for the plan year.
(iii)
Minimum amount.
Notwithstanding any otherwise applicable provisions of this section, the at-risk funding target of a plan for a plan year is not less than the plan's funding target for the plan year determined without regard to this section.
(3)
Additional actuarial assumptions
—(i)
In general.
The actuarial assumptions used to determine a plan's at-risk funding target for a plan year are the actuarial assumptions that are applied under section 430, with the modifications described in this paragraph (c)(3).
(ii)
Special retirement age assumption
—(A)
Participants eligible to retire and collect benefits within 11 years.
Subject to paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, if a participant would be eligible to commence an immediate distribution by the end of the 10th plan year after the current plan year (that is, the end of the 11th plan year beginning with the current plan year), that participant is assumed to commence an immediate distribution at the earliest retirement age under the plan, or, if later, at the end of the current plan year. The rule of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) does not affect the application of plan assumptions regarding an employee's termination of employment prior to the employee's earliest retirement age.
(B)
Participants otherwise assumed to retire immediately.
The special retirement age assumption of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply to a participant to the extent the participant is otherwise assumed to commence benefits during the current plan year under the actuarial assumptions for the plan. For example, if generally applicable retirement assumptions would provide for a 25 percent probability that a participant will commence benefits during the current plan year, the special retirement age assumption of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section requires the plan's enrolled actuary to assume a 75 percent probability that the participant will commence benefits at the end of the plan year.
(C)
Definition of earliest retirement date.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), a plan's earliest retirement date for an employee is the earliest date on which the employee can commence receiving an immediate distribution of a fully vested benefit under the plan.
See
§ 1.401(a)-20, Q
A-17(b).
(iii)
Requirement to assume most valuable benefit.
All participants and beneficiaries who are assumed to retire on a particular date are assumed to elect the optional form of benefit available under the plan that would result in the highest present value of benefits commencing at that date.
(iv)
Reasonable techniques permitted.
The plan's actuary is permitted to use reasonable techniques in determining the actuarial assumptions that are required to be used pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3). For example, the plan's actuary is permitted to use reasonable assumptions in determining the optional form of benefit under the plan that would result in the highest present value of benefits for this purpose.
(d)
Target normal cost of plans in at-risk status
—(1)
General rule.
If the plan has been in at-risk status for 5 consecutive years, including the current plan year, then the target normal cost for the plan is the at-risk target normal cost determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
See
paragraph (e) of this section for the determination of the target normal cost where the plan is in at-risk status for the plan year but was not in at-risk status for one or more of the 4 preceding plan years.
(2)
At-risk target normal cost
—(i)
Use of modified actuarial assumptions
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2), the at-risk target normal cost of a plan for the plan year is equal to the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of all benefits that accrue during, are earned during, or are otherwise allocated to service in the plan year, as determined in accordance with § 1.430(d)-1 but using the additional actuarial assumptions described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(B)
Special adjustments.
The target normal cost of the plan for the plan year (determined under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section) is adjusted (not below zero) by adding the amount of plan-related expenses expected to be paid from plan assets during the plan year and subtracting the amount of any mandatory employee contributions expected to be made during the plan year.
(C)
Plan-related expenses.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), plan-related expenses are determined using the rules of § 1.430(d)-1(b)(1)(iii)(B).
(ii)
Loading factor.
The at-risk target normal cost is increased by a loading factor equal to 4 percent of the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of all benefits under the plan that accrue, are earned, or are otherwise allocated to service for the plan year under the applicable rules of § 1.430(d)-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (C), or (D), determined as if the plan were not in at-risk status.
(iii)
Minimum amount.
The at-risk target normal cost of a plan for a plan year is not less than the plan's target normal cost determined without regard to section 430(i) and this section.
(e)
Transition between applicable funding targets and applicable target normal costs
—(1)
Funding target.
If a plan that is in at-risk status for the plan year has not been in at-risk status for one or more of the preceding 4 plan years, the plan's funding target for the plan year is determined as the sum of—
(i) The funding target determined without regard to section 430(i) and this section; plus
(ii) The phase-in percentage for the plan year multiplied by the excess of—
(A) The at-risk funding target determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section (determined taking into account paragraph (e)(4) of this section); over
(B) The funding target determined without regard to section 430(i) and this section.
(2)
Target normal cost.
If a plan that is in at-risk status for the plan year has not been in at-risk status for one or more of the preceding 4 plan years, the plan's target normal cost for the plan year is determined as the sum of—
(i) The target normal cost determined without regard to section 430(i) and this section; plus
(ii) The phase-in percentage for the plan year multiplied by the excess of—
(A) The at-risk target normal cost determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section (determined taking into account paragraph (e)(4) of this section); over
(B) The target normal cost determined without regard to section 430(i) and this section.
(3)
Phase-in percentage.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the phase-in percentage is 20 percent multiplied by the number of consecutive plan years that the plan has been in at-risk status (including the current plan year) and not taking into account years before the first effective plan year for a plan.
(4)
Transition funding target and target normal cost determined without load.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if a plan has not been in at-risk status for 2 or more of the preceding 4 plan years (not taking into account years before the first effective plan year for a plan), then the plan's at-risk funding target that is used for purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (to calculate the plan's funding target where the plan has been in at-risk status for fewer than 5 plan years) is determined without regard to the loading factor set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Similarly, if a plan has not been in at-risk status for 2 or more of the preceding 4 plan years (not taking into account years before the first effective plan year for a plan), then the plan's at-risk target normal cost that is used for purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (to calculate the plan's target normal cost where the plan has been in at-risk status for fewer than 5 plan years) is determined without regard to the loading factor set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
(f)
Effective/applicability dates and transition rules
—(1)
Statutory effective date/applicability date
—(i)
General rule.
Section 430 generally applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The applicability of section 430 for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution is delayed for certain plans in accordance with sections 104 through 106 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA '06), Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780).
(ii)
Applicability of special adjustments to target normal cost.
The special adjustments of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section (relating to adjustments to the target normal cost for plan-related expenses and mandatory employee contributions) apply to plan years beginning after December 31, 2008. In addition, a plan sponsor may elect to make the special adjustments of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section for plan years beginning in 2008. This election is made in the same manner and is subject to the same rules as an election to add an
amount to the plan's prefunding balance pursuant to § 1.430(f)-1(f). Thus, the election can be made no later than the last day for making the minimum required contribution for the plan year to which the election relates.
(2)
Effective date/applicability date of regulations.
This section applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2010. For plan years beginning before January 1, 2010, plans are permitted to rely on the provisions set forth in this section for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 430.
(3)
First effective plan year.
For purposes of this section, the first effective plan year for a plan is the first plan year to which section 430 applies to the plan for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution.
(4)
Transition rule for determining at-risk status.
In the case of plan years beginning in 2008, 2009, and 2010, paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is applied by substituting the following percentages for “80 percent”—
(i) 65 percent in the case of 2008;
(ii) 70 percent in the case of 2009; and
(iii) 75 percent in the case of 2010.
[T.D. 9467, 74 FR 53058, Oct. 15, 2009]
§ 1.430(j)-1
Payment of minimum required contributions.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
This section provides rules related to the payment of minimum required contributions, including the payment of required installments. Section 430(j) and this section apply to single-employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans as defined in section 413(c)) but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section 414(f)). Paragraph (b) of this section describes the general timing requirement for minimum required contributions. Paragraph (c) of this section describes the accelerated required installment schedule for plans with a funding shortfall in the preceding plan year. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules regarding liquidity requirements. Paragraph (e) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (f) of this section provides examples that illustrate the rules of this section. Paragraph (g) of this section sets forth effective/applicability dates and transition rules.
(2)
Special rules for multiple employer plans
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules of section 430 and this section are applied separately for each employer under the plan, as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, for example, required installments are determined separately for each employer under such a multiple employer plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430 and this section are applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.
(ii)
CSEC plans.
A CSEC plan (that is, a plan that fits within the definition of a CSEC plan in section 414(y) for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and for which the election under section 414(y)(3)(A) has not been made) is not subject to the rules of section 430. See section 433 for the minimum funding rules that apply to CSEC plans.
(3)
Applicability of section 430(j) to plans of commercial passenger airlines
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rules of section 430(j) and this section apply to a plan for which an election described in section 402 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780 (2006)), as amended (PPA '06), has been made in the same manner as those rules apply to any other plan subject to section 430.
(ii)
Special rules for plans for which election was made pursuant to section 402(a)(1) of PPA '06.
For purposes of applying the rules of section 430(j) and this section to a plan with respect to which the election under section 402(a)(1) of PPA '06 has been made, the effective interest rate for the plan is deemed to be 8.85 percent during the period for which the election applies. In addition, see paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section for a special determination of the funding shortfall for a plan for which the election in section 402(a)(1) of PPA '06 has been made.
(b)
General timing requirement for minimum required contributions
—(1)
Earliest
date for contributions.
A payment made before the first day of the plan year cannot be applied toward the minimum required contribution under section 430 for that plan year.
(2)
Deadline for contributions.
The deadline for any payment of any minimum required contribution for a plan year is 8
1/2
months after the close of the plan year. See section 4971 and the regulations thereunder regarding an excise tax that applies with respect to minimum required contributions not paid by this deadline. For additional rules that may apply in the case of a failure to pay minimum required contributions by this deadline, see also section 430(k) of the Code and sections 101(d) and 4043 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).
(3)
Allocation of contribution to a plan year
—(i)
Plans with unpaid minimum required contributions that have not been corrected.
If a plan has unpaid minimum required contributions within the meaning of § 54.4971(c)-1(c) of this chapter that have not yet been corrected within the meaning of § 54.4971(c)-1(d)(2) of this chapter at the time a contribution is made, then the contribution is treated as a late contribution for the earliest plan year for which there is an unpaid minimum required contribution (to the extent necessary to correct that unpaid minimum required contribution). To the extent the contribution exceeds the amount necessary to correct the earlier unpaid minimum required contribution, the excess is treated as a late contribution for the next earliest plan year for which there is an unpaid minimum required contribution (to the extent necessary to correct that next earliest unpaid minimum required contribution). The allocation of the contribution under the preceding sentence is repeated until all unpaid minimum required contributions have been corrected, or until the entire contribution is allocated, whichever comes first.
(ii)
Plans without unpaid minimum required contributions.
If a contribution is made during the current plan year but before the deadline under paragraph (b)(2) of this section for contributions for a prior plan year, and the plan has no unpaid minimum required contribution for any plan year at the time the contribution is made, then the contribution may be designated as a contribution for either that prior plan year or the current plan year. Similarly, if a contribution made during the current plan year but before the deadline under paragraph (b)(2) of this section for contributions for a prior plan year is more than enough to correct a plan's unpaid minimum required contributions for all plan years, the portion of a contribution that was not used to correct unpaid minimum required contributions may be designated as a contribution for either that prior plan year or the current plan year.
(iii)
Method of allocating contributions
—(A)
Reporting for contributions to correct unpaid minimum required contributions.
The allocation of a contribution under the rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section to correct unpaid minimum required contributions is automatic and must be shown on the actuarial report (Schedule SB, “Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Information” of Form 5500, “Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan”) for the earliest plan year with respect to which, as of the date of the contribution, the deadline for making contributions under paragraph (b)(2) of this section has not passed. See § 1.430(g)-1(d)(1) for the rules for determining the plan year for which these contributions are taken into account in determining the value of plan assets.
(B)
Designation of plan year if no unpaid minimum contribution.
In the case of a contribution described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the designation is established by the completion (and filing, if required) of the actuarial report (Schedule SB, “Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Information” of Form 5500, “Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan”) for the plan year for which the contribution is designated and cannot be changed after the actuarial report that reflects the contribution is completed (and filed, if required) except as provided in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Thus, a contribution that has been designated for a plan year on an actuarial report pursuant to this paragraph
(b)(3)(iii)(B) generally cannot be redesignated as a contribution for either an earlier or later plan year.
(4)
Adjustment for interest
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (b)(4), any payment toward the minimum required contribution under section 430 for a plan year that is paid on a date other than the valuation date for that plan year is adjusted for interest for the period between the valuation date and the payment date, at the plan's effective interest rate for that plan year determined pursuant to § 1.430(h)(2)-1(f)(1). The direction of the adjustment depends on whether the contribution is paid before or after the valuation date for the plan year. If the contribution is paid after the valuation date for the plan year, the contribution is discounted to the valuation date using the plan's effective interest rate. By contrast, if the contribution is paid before the valuation date for the plan year (which could only occur in the case of a small plan described in section 430(g)(2)(B)), the contribution is increased for interest using the plan's effective interest rate.
(ii)
Interest adjustment for late quarterly installments.
In the case of a plan that must make required installments under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section, to the extent a contribution for a plan year constitutes a late required installment, the adjustment for interest for the period between the valuation date and the payment date is made in two steps. In the first step, the portion of the contribution that constitutes a late required installment is adjusted for interest from the date of the contribution to the due date for the installment by discounting it using the plan's effective interest rate for that plan year determined pursuant to § 1.430(h)(2)-1(f)(1) plus 5 percentage points. In the second step, this discounted amount is treated as if it were contributed on the installment due date for purposes of the interest adjustment under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. However, a contribution made toward the unpaid liquidity amount (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) that is made before the close of the quarter in which it is due is adjusted under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Interest adjustment for unpaid liquidity amounts.
In the case of a plan that is subject to the liquidity requirement rules of paragraph (d) of this section, to the extent a contribution made during a quarter constitutes a payment of the unpaid liquidity amount for that quarter as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the adjustment for interest for the period between the valuation date and the payment date is made in two steps. In the first step, the portion of the contribution that constitutes a payment of the unpaid liquidity amount is increased for interest from the date of the contribution to the last day of the quarter, at the plan's effective interest rate for that plan year determined pursuant to § 1.430(h)(2)-1(f)(1). In the second step, this adjusted amount is treated as if it were contributed on the last day of that quarter for purposes of the interest adjustment for late required installments under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section. See paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section for an increase to the minimum required contribution that gives effect to this interest adjustment for unpaid liquidity amounts in the event a portion of the required installment is no longer treated as unpaid after the close of the quarter under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section.
(c)
Accelerated quarterly installments required for underfunded plans
—(1)
Plans subject to quarterly installment requirement.
The plan sponsor of a plan that has a funding shortfall for the preceding plan year is required to pay the installments described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section by the due dates described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. See paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, section 430(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) (regarding the imposition of a lien), and sections 101(d) and 4043 of ERISA (regarding notice to participants and beneficiaries and to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) for examples of consequences that generally apply following a failure to make required installments.
(2)
Satisfaction of quarterly installment requirement.
A plan sponsor may satisfy the requirement to pay an installment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section
by one or a combination of the following—
(i) Making a contribution for the plan year which is allocated among the required installments under the rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
(ii) Making an election to use some or all of the plan's prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance in accordance with the rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(3)
Satisfaction of quarterly installment requirement with contributions
—(i)
Contributions allocated to earliest quarterly installments.
For purposes of this section, a contribution for a plan year is allocated among the required installments for the plan year under the rules of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section, whichever is applicable. Which rule applies depends on whether, at the time the contribution is made, the plan sponsor has unpaid required installments (that is, the plan sponsor has not fully satisfied all required installments for which the due date has passed, taking into account the special rule with respect to the unpaid liquidity amounts in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section).
(ii)
Early contributions increased with interest.
If a plan has no unpaid required installments for a plan year at the time a contribution for the plan year is made, then the contribution is allocated to the required installments (if any) for the plan year due on or after the date of the contribution under the rules of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii). The contribution is allocated in the order in which those installments occur, and the amount allocated to each required installment is limited to the amount necessary to satisfy the required installment (including satisfaction of the liquidity requirement under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, taking into account the special rule with respect to the unpaid liquidity amounts in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section) taking into account any interest as described in the next sentence. If the contribution is made before the due date of the installment to which it is allocated, then the amount credited toward the installment includes interest on the contribution from the date of the contribution to the due date of the required installment (except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section). This interest adjustment is made using an interest rate equal to the plan's effective interest rate under § 1.430(h)(2)-1(f)(1) for the plan year.
(iii)
Allocation of contributions to late required installments without interest
—(A)
In general.
If a plan has any unpaid required installments for a plan year at the time a contribution for the plan year is made, then the contribution is allocated to those unpaid required installments under the rules of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii). The contribution is allocated in the order in which those unpaid required installments occur, and the amount allocated to each required installment is limited to the amount that satisfies the required installment without any adjustment for interest. If a contribution is allocated to an unpaid required installment under this paragraph (c)(3)(iii), then that contribution is adjusted for interest under the rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section (regarding interest adjustments for late quarterly installments) for purposes of determining the extent to which that contribution satisfies the minimum required contribution for the plan year.
(B)
Bifurcation of contributions that exceed unpaid required installments.
Any amount of a contribution described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section that is not used to satisfy the unpaid required installments for the plan year is allocated toward any remaining required installments for the plan year under the rules of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Satisfaction of quarterly installment requirements through use of funding balances.
A plan sponsor may satisfy the requirement to pay an installment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by making an election to use some or all of the plan's prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance under section 430(f). Such an election is subject to the rules of § 1.430(f)-1 and cannot exceed the available amount of the plan's prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance determined under § 1.430(f)-1(d)(1)(ii) as of the date of the election. The amount elected is allocated toward satisfaction of the required installments in the
same manner as a contribution made on the date of the election. Thus, the amount of an election to use the plan's prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance is increased with interest under the rules of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section or is credited against the earliest unpaid required installment under the rules of paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. See § 1.430(f)-1(f)(1)(iii) for rules permitting the use of a standing election for purposes of satisfying required installments through use of funding balances. See § 1.430(f)-1(d)(1)(i)(B) for rules relating to late elections to use the funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance to satisfy the required installment rules.
(5)
Amount of required installment
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the amount of any required installment due for a plan year is equal to 25 percent of the required annual payment for the plan year as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Required annual payment.
The required annual payment for a plan year is equal to the lesser of—
(A) 90 percent of the minimum required contribution under section 430 for the plan year; or
(B) 100 percent of the minimum required contribution under section 430 (determined without regard to any funding waiver under section 412) for the preceding plan year.
(iii)
Treatment of funding balances.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the minimum required contribution for a plan year is determined without regard to the use of the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance for the current year or the prior year. However, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section regarding a plan sponsor's election to use the plan's prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance for the current year in order to satisfy the requirement to pay an installment.
(iv)
Disregard of certain amounts.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the minimum required contribution for a plan year is determined without regard to the installment acceleration amount for the plan year determined under section 430(c)(7) or any increase to the minimum required contribution under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section (relating to an unpaid liquidity amount).
(6)
Due dates for installments.
For purposes of this section, there is a required installment for each quarter of the plan year, and the due dates for the required installments with respect to a full plan year are set forth in the following table:
Installment
Due date
First required installment
15th day of 4th plan month.
Second required installment
15th day of 7th plan month.
Third required installment
15th day of 10th plan month.
Fourth required installment
15th day after the end of the plan year.
(7)
Special rules for short plan years
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a short plan year, the rules of this paragraph (c) are modified as provided in this paragraph (c)(7).
(ii)
Current plan year is short plan year
—(A)
Amount of required annual payment.
In determining the required annual payment pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for a short plan year, the amount otherwise determined under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section (based on the prior year's minimum required contribution) is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the duration of the short plan year and the denominator of which is 1 year. This rule applies to the year that contains the plan's termination date if that date is before the date that would otherwise be the end of the plan year (because the plan is treated as having a short plan year for purposes of section 430 pursuant to § 1.430(a)-1(b)(5)).
(B)
Number and due dates of installments.
If the plan has a short plan year, then an installment is due 15 days after the end of that short plan year. In addition, an installment is required for each due date determined under paragraph (c)(6) of this section that falls within the short plan year. Thus, for example, if the short plan year ends before the 15th day of the 4th plan month of the plan year, there will be only one installment for that short plan year, and that installment will be due on the 15th day after the end of the short plan year.
(C)
Amount of installments.
The amount of each installment required to be paid for the short plan year is equal
to the required annual payment determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section (as modified by paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A) of this section) divided by the number of installments determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(B) of this section.
(D)
No increase in prior required installments.
If a plan is amended to have a short plan year (including as a result of plan termination) and the required installments determined under paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(C) of this section are greater than the required installments determined without regard to the amendment, then—
(
1
) The required installments for which the due dates occur before the end of the short plan year are determined without regard to the amendment, and
(
2
) The required installment due on the 15th day after the end of the short plan year is increased to the extent necessary so that the total of the required installments for the year is the required annual payment determined under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, determined taking into account the rules of paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A) of this section.
(iii)
Prior plan year is short plan year.
If the prior plan year is a short plan year, the amount otherwise determined under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section (based on the prior year's minimum required contribution) is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is 1 year and the denominator of which is the duration of the short plan year.
(d)
Liquidity requirement in connection with quarterly installments
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Additional requirement with respect to quarterly installments.
Except as provided in this paragraph (d)(1), if a plan sponsor is required to pay the installments described in paragraph (c) of this section, then the plan sponsor is treated as failing to pay the full amount of the required installment for a quarter to the extent that the value of the liquid assets paid in the required installment after the end of that quarter and on or before the due date for the installment is less than the liquidity shortfall for that quarter. If the amount of any required installment is increased by reason of this paragraph (d)(1)(i), in no event shall this increase exceed the amount which, when added to the current required installment (determined without regard to the increase) and prior required installments for the plan year (not including any portion of a required installment that is no longer treated as unpaid under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section), is necessary to increase the funding target attainment percentage for the plan year to 100 percent (taking into account the expected increase in the funding target due to benefits accruing or earned during the plan year).
(ii)
Small plan exception.
The liquidity requirement of this paragraph (d) does not apply to a plan for any plan year for which the plan is a small plan described in § 1.430(g)-1(b)(2).
(2)
Satisfaction of liquidity requirement.
The additional requirement with respect to a required installment under paragraph (d)(1) of this section can be satisfied only with an actual contribution of liquid assets that, after application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, is allocated to satisfy the required installment for the quarter. The liquidity requirement cannot be satisfied through the use of funding balances, and satisfaction of this requirement is determined without taking into account the increase for interest for early contributions set forth in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Any contribution of liquid assets that is allocated to satisfy the required installment for a quarter applies for purposes of determining whether the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are satisfied, even if the contribution is less than the total amount needed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section for the quarter (taking into account any increase in the required installment under this paragraph (d)).
(3)
Failure to satisfy liquidity requirement
—(i)
Treatment as failure to satisfy quarterly installment.
If an employer fails to satisfy the additional requirement with respect to a required installment for a quarter under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of that required installment that is treated as not paid by reason of paragraph (d)(1) of this section (the unpaid liquidity amount for that quarter) is treated
as an underpayment of the required installment. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section for examples of consequences of underpayment of a required installment.
(ii)
Late satisfaction of liquidity requirement.
The rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to determine whether a contribution made after the deadline for a required installment satisfies the liquidity requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. However, pursuant to section 430(j)(4)(C), the unpaid liquidity amount is treated as unpaid until the end of the quarter in which the due date for that installment occurs, even if liquid assets in that amount are contributed during that quarter (but after the due date for the installment). See paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section for the application of this rule for purposes of applying the additional interest for late required installments.
(iii)
Additional consequences of failure to pay liquidity shortfall.
See section 206(e) of ERISA and section 401(a)(32) of the Code (regarding suspension of accelerated distributions for a plan with an unpaid liquidity amount). See also section 4971(f) regarding an excise tax imposed in the event of a failure to pay a liquidity shortfall.
(iv)
Treatment in subsequent quarter
—(A)
Adjustment to required installment.
After the close of the quarter in which the due date of a required installment occurs, any portion of the installment that was treated as unpaid solely by reason of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and that was not satisfied with a contribution of liquid assets during that quarter, is no longer treated as unpaid (but any portion of the installment that would be treated as unpaid without regard to paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be satisfied in accordance with the rules of paragraph (c) of this section).
(B)
Increase to minimum required contribution for additional interest.
If a portion of the required installment is no longer treated as unpaid by reason of paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, then the minimum required contribution for the plan year for which the installment was due is increased by an amount equal to—
(
1
) The portion of the required installment that is no longer treated as unpaid by reason of paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, discounted for interest for the period from the last day of the quarter that includes the due date of the required installment to the valuation date, using the plan's effective interest rate for the plan year (determined pursuant to § 1.430(h)(2)-1(f)(1)); minus
(
2
) The portion of the required installment that is no longer treated as unpaid by reason of paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, discounted for interest for the period from the last day of the quarter that includes the due date of the required installment to the due date of the installment, using the plan's effective interest rate for the plan year plus 5 percentage points, and further discounted for interest for the period from the due date of the required installment to the valuation date using the plan's effective interest rate for the plan year.
(e)
Definitions
—(1)
In general.
The definitions set forth in this paragraph (e) apply for purposes of this section.
(2)
Adjusted disbursements
—(i)
In general.
The term
adjusted disbursements
means, with respect to a time period, the amount described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section if the time period is within a single plan year, or the amount described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section if the time period spans more than one plan year.
(ii)
Period within a single plan year.
With respect to a period within a plan year, the adjusted disbursements are the disbursements from the plan during that period reduced by the product of—
(A) The plan's funding target attainment percentage determined under section 430(d)(2) for the plan year that contains that period; and
(B) The sum of the purchases of annuities and payments of single sums for that period.
(iii)
Period spanning more than one plan year.
With respect to a period of time that spans more than one plan year, the adjusted disbursements are the sum of the adjusted disbursements determined separately under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section for each portion of a plan year that is included in the
time period for which adjusted disbursements are determined.
(3)
Disbursements from the plan.
The term
disbursements from the plan
means all disbursements from the plan's trust, including purchases of annuities, payments of single sums and other benefits, and payments of administrative expenses.
(4)
Funding shortfall
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(4), the term
funding shortfall
has the same meaning as under § 1.430(a)-1(f)(2).
(ii)
Special rule for plans of commercial passenger airlines.
In the case of a plan year for which an election described in section 402(a)(1) of PPA '06 is in effect, the term
funding shortfall
means the unfunded liability for that plan year determined under § 1.430(a)-1(b)(4)(ii).
(iii)
Special rule for first effective plan year.
See paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section for a calculation of the funding shortfall for the plan's pre-effective plan year.
(iv)
Special rule for plan spinoffs and mergers.
[Reserved]
(5)
Liquid assets
—(i)
In general.
The term
liquid assets
means cash, marketable securities, and other assets described in this paragraph (e)(5)(i). For this purpose, marketable securities include financial instruments such as stocks and other equity interests, evidences of indebtedness (including certificates of deposit), options, futures contracts, and other derivatives, for which there is a liquid financial market, and other interests in entities (such as partnerships, trusts, or regulated investment companies) for which there is a liquid financial market. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a liquid financial market is an established financial market described in § 1.1092(d)-1(b) (other than an interbank market or an interdealer market described in § 1.1092(d)-1(b)(1)(v) and (vi), respectively). Any security that is issued or guaranteed by the government of the United States or an agency or instrumentality thereof for which there is an established financial market described in § 1.1092(d)-1(b) is a marketable security. Finally, any financial instrument or other interest in an entity that, under its terms, contains a right by which the instrument or other interest may immediately be redeemed, exchanged, or converted into cash or a marketable security, is a marketable security, provided there are no restrictions on the exercise of that right.
(ii)
Insurance and annuity contracts.
Other assets that are treated as liquid assets of a plan are insurance, annuity, or other contracts issued by an insurance company that is licensed to do business under the laws of any State, but only if the insurance, annuity, or other contract—
(A) Contains an unrestricted right by which the insurance, annuity or other contract may immediately be redeemed, exchanged, or converted into cash or a marketable security;
(B) Provides for substantially equal monthly disbursements to the extent provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section; or
(C) Is benefit responsive within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section.
(iii)
Insurance and annuity contracts providing for substantially equal periodic payments.
If the contract provides for substantially equal monthly disbursements (for example, an annuity contract in pay status), the only portion of the contract that may be treated as liquid assets for a quarter is the amount equal to 36 times the monthly disbursement (in the month containing the last day of the quarter) which is available under the terms of the contract, provided there are no restrictions on the right to disbursements.
(iv)
Benefit responsive insurance and annuity contracts.
A contract is considered benefit responsive if, under applicable law and contractual provisions, the plan has the right to receive disbursements from the contract in order to pay plan benefits for any participant in the plan, without restrictions on that right.
(v)
Restrictions.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(5), a restriction on a redemption, exchange, or conversion right, or a restriction on a right to receive a disbursement, may result not only from applicable law or contractual provisions, but also from rehabilitation, conservatorship, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar proceedings.
(6)
Liquidity shortfall
—(i)
In general.
Except as modified in paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section with respect to multiple employer plans, the term
liquidity shortfall
means, with respect to any required installment, an amount equal to the excess (as of the last day of the quarter for which that installment is due) of—
(A) The base amount with respect to the quarter, over
(B) The value (as of the last day of the quarter) of the plan's liquid assets.
(ii)
Base amount
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(6), the term
base amount
means, with respect to any quarter, an amount equal to 3 times the sum of the adjusted disbursements from the plan for the 12 months ending on the last day of that quarter.
(B)
Special rule.
If the generally applicable base amount for a quarter (as determined under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section) exceeds an amount equal to 2 times the sum of the adjusted disbursements from the plan for the 36 months ending on the last day of the quarter and the enrolled actuary for the plan certifies to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such excess is the result of nonrecurring circumstances, then the base amount with respect to that quarter is determined without regard to amounts related to those nonrecurring circumstances.
(iii)
Multiple employer plans
—(A)
Satisfaction of liquidity requirement as if plan were not a multiple employer plan.
For a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the liquidity requirement of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section is satisfied if the liquidity requirement would be satisfied if the plan were a single-employer plan that is not a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies.
(B)
Failure to satisfy the liquidity requirement on a plan-wide basis.
For a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, if the plan does not satisfy the liquidity requirement in accordance with paragraph (e)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, then the liquidity requirement must be applied separately for each employer under the plan, as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, the value of plan assets as of the end of each quarter under such a multiple employer plan must be allocated among the employers sponsoring the plan, and the liquidity shortfall must be determined for each employer based on that allocation. See section 413(c)(7)(B) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(7)
Plan month
—(i)
Plan year begins on the first day of a calendar month.
For a plan year that begins with the first day of a calendar month, the term
plan month
means any calendar month that begins during the plan year.
(ii)
Plan year begins on a date other than the first day of a calendar month.
For a plan year that begins on a date other than the first day of a calendar month, the first day of each plan month is the day of the calendar month that corresponds to the day of the calendar month that is the first day of the plan year. Thus, for example, if the first day of a plan year is January 15, then a plan month starts on the 15th of each calendar month. However, if a calendar month does not contain a day that corresponds to the day of the calendar month that is the first day of the plan year (for example, if a calendar month has only 30 days and the first day of the plan year is the 31st day of a calendar month), then the first day of the plan month that begins during that calendar month is the last day of that calendar month.
(8)
Quarter.
The term
quarter
means, with respect to any required installment, the 3-plan-month period preceding the plan month in which the due date for that installment occurs.
(9)
Short plan year.
The term
short plan year
means a plan year that is shorter than 12 months (and is not a 52-week plan year of a plan that uses a 52-53 week plan year).
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. Unless otherwise indicated, these examples are based on the following assumptions: section 430 applies to determine the minimum required contribution for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008; the plan year is the calendar year; the valuation date is January 1; the plan sponsor is required to pay the installments described in paragraph (c) of this section; the plan does not have a liquidity shortfall; and the
plan sponsor has not elected any funding relief under section 430(c)(2)(D) for any plan year. In addition, these examples assume that, under the funding method used for the plan, interest adjustments are calculated to the nearest half month (rather than days) for transactions that occur on the 1st and 15th of a calendar month.

# Example 1.
(i) Plan A has a funding standard carryover balance of $15,000 and a prefunding balance of zero as of January 1, 2016, and the plan's funding ratio for 2015 (determined under § 1.430(f)-1(d)(3)) was over 80%. The minimum required contribution for Plan A (determined prior to any offset for the funding standard carryover balance) is $100,000 for 2016 and is $125,000 for 2017. The effective interest rate for the 2017 plan year is 5.90%.
(ii) The required annual payment for 2017 is equal to the lesser of (a) 100% of the 2016 minimum required contribution ($100,000) or (b) 90% of the 2017 minimum required contribution (90% of $125,000, or $112,500). Therefore, each required installment for 2017 is 25% of $100,000, or $25,000.
(iii) Installments of $25,000 each are due by April 15, 2017, July 15, 2017, October 15, 2017, and January 15, 2018. The final contribution for the 2017 plan year is due by September 15, 2018. The amount of this final contribution is equal to $125,000, less the contributions made prior to that date, with all contributions adjusted to the valuation date using the effective interest rate for the 2017 plan year. If the plan sponsor makes each required installment on the date due, the remaining amount due is determined as follows:
(A) The contribution paid April 15, 2017 is adjusted by discounting the contribution amount for 3
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($25,000 ÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
= $24,585).
(B) The contribution paid July 15, 2017 is discounted for 6
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($25,000 ÷ 1.0590
(6.5/12)
= $24,236).
(C) The contribution paid October 15, 2017 is discounted for 9
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($25,000 ÷ 1.0590
(9.5/12)
= $23,891).
(D) The contribution paid January 15, 2018 is discounted for 12
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($25,000 ÷ 1.0590
(12.5/12)
= $23,551).
(E) The sum of the above contributions for the 2017 plan year paid through January 15, 2018, adjusted for interest to the valuation date, is $96,263. The remaining amount due for the 2017 plan year is $125,000 minus $96,263, or $28,737, as of January 1, 2017.
(iv) If the final contribution is made on September 15, 2018, the remaining amount due must be increased for interest at the plan's effective interest rate for the 20
1/2
months between January 1, 2017 and September 15, 2018 (so that, when it is discounted with interest for those 20
1/2
months, the resulting amount will equal $28,737). Therefore, the remaining contribution due on September 15, 2018 is $28,737 × 1.0590
(20.5/12)
= $31,694.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the plan sponsor elects to use the $15,000 funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2016, to offset the minimum required contribution for the 2016 plan year. The plan sponsor makes a contribution on January 1, 2016 of $85,000, which satisfies the minimum contribution requirement for 2016.
(ii) The required installments for 2017 are unaffected by the plan sponsor's election to offset the minimum required contribution by the funding standard carryover balance for 2016. Therefore, the required annual payment for 2017 is $100,000 (determined as the lesser of (a) 100% of $100,000 or (b) 90% of $125,000) and the amount of each required installment for the 2017 plan year is 25% of the required annual payment, or $25,000.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
Plan A's funding standard carryover balance has increased to $17,000 as of January 1, 2017, based on the actual rate of return of plan assets during the 2016 plan year. Plan A's funding ratio for 2016 (determined under § 1.430(f)-1(d)(3)) is over 80%. On March 15, 2017, the plan sponsor elects to use the entire amount of the funding standard carryover balance to offset the minimum required contribution for 2017.
(ii) The plan sponsor's election to use the funding standard carryover balance to offset the minimum required contribution is treated as satisfying the requirement to make a required installment to the extent of the amount elected, adjusted with interest for the period from the beginning of the plan year to the due date of the installment using the plan's effective interest rate for the 2017 plan year. This adjustment is made for the 2.5-month period from the beginning of the plan year to the date of the election as provided in § 1.430(f)-1(b)(5), and for the one-month period from the date of the election to the due date for the installment, as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and (c)(4) of this section. Therefore, the $17,000 funding standard carryover balance as of January 1, 2017 offsets $17,000 × 1.0590
(2.5/12)
× 1.0590
(1/12)
or $17,287 of the $25,000 required installment due April 15, 2017, and the remaining contribution due on April 15, 2017 is $25,000 minus $17,287, or $7,713.
(iii) The interest adjustments in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 3
are based on the effective interest rate even if that rate is not determined by the time that the required installment is due. If the plan's effective interest rate for the plan year has not been determined at the time that the required installment is due, the actual amount of the required installment satisfied by the use of the
funding standard carryover balance is determined after the effective interest rate is determined. If the extent to which the funding standard carryover balance satisfies the required installment is overestimated and the result is that the full amount of the required installment is not paid by the due date, the plan is subject to the consequences for late or unpaid required installments as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3.
The plan sponsor makes a contribution of $7,713 (which is equal to the remaining portion of the first required installment) on April 15, 2017. For the 2017 plan year, the plan sponsor makes another contribution of $200,000 on June 30, 2017. No further contributions are made for the 2017 plan year.
(ii) The contributions made for the 2017 plan year are adjusted to the valuation date using the plan's effective interest rate for the 2017 plan year. The contribution paid April 15, 2017 is discounted for the 3
1/2
months between January 1, 2017 and the date of payment, using the effective interest rate of 5.90% ($7,713 ÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
= $7,585). The contribution paid June 30, 2017 is discounted for 6 months using the effective interest rate ($200,000 ÷ 1.0590
(6/12)
= $194,349), for a total interest-adjusted contribution of $201,934.
(iii) The present value of the excess contribution for 2017 is based on the net contribution required for that year, which is the minimum required contribution minus the offset for the funding standard carryover balance, or $108,000 (that is, $125,000 minus $17,000). Accordingly, the present value of the excess contribution for 2017 is $201,934 minus $108,000, or $93,934. All or a portion of this amount may be credited to the prefunding balance at the election of the plan sponsor.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3.
The plan sponsor pays the required installment of $7,713 on April 15, 2017 and installments of $25,000 each on July 15, 2017 and October 15, 2017. However, only $10,000 of the installment due on January 15, 2018 is paid. No additional contributions are made until the final contribution for the plan year of $55,000 is paid on September 15, 2018.
(ii) The 2017 Schedule SB shows that the contributions for the plan year exceed the minimum required contribution. This is determined by comparing the net contribution requirement of $108,000 (equal to the minimum required contribution of $125,000 offset by $17,000 for the amount of funding standard carryover balance used) and the interest-adjusted contributions made for the 2017 plan year, developed as shown:
(A) The contribution paid April 15, 2017 is adjusted by discounting the contribution amount for 3
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($7,713 ÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
= $7,585).
(B) The contribution paid July 15, 2017 is discounted for 6
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($25,000 ÷ 1.0590
(6.5/12)
= $24,236).
(C) The contribution paid October 15, 2017 is discounted for 9
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($25,000 ÷ 1.0590
(9.5/12)
= $23,891).
(D) The contribution paid January 15, 2018 is discounted for 12
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($10,000 ÷ 1.0590
(12.5/12)
= $9,420).
(E) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the interest rate used to adjust the $15,000 underpayment of the required installment due January 15, 2018 is increased by 5 percentage points for the 8-month period of underpayment (January 15, 2018 through September 15, 2018). Accordingly, $15,000 of the contribution paid on September 15, 2018 is discounted using a rate of 10.90% for 8 months to the due date of January 15, 2018, and is then further adjusted using the 5.90% effective interest rate for the 12
1/2
months between the required installment due date of January 15, 2018 and the valuation date of January 1, 2017. This portion of the September 15, 2018 contribution results in an adjusted amount of $13,189 as of January 1, 2017 ($15,000 ÷ 1.1090
(8/12)
÷ 1.0590
(12.5/12)
).
(F) The remaining $40,000 of the contribution paid on September 15, 2018 is discounted using the effective interest rate of 5.90% for the 20
1/2
-month period between the date of payment and the valuation date. This portion of the payment is therefore adjusted to $36,268 as of the valuation date (that is, $40,000 ÷ 1.0590
(20.5/12)
).
(G) The sum of the contributions (as calculated in paragraphs (ii)(A) through (F) of this
Example 5
) for the 2017 plan year paid through September 15, 2018, adjusted for interest to the valuation date, is $114,589. This is greater than the net contribution required for the 2017 plan year of $108,000.

# Example 6.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 5,
except that the plan sponsor does not make the contribution on September 15, 2018.
(ii) The 2017 Schedule SB shows an unpaid minimum required contribution of $42,868 as of January 1, 2017. This is equal to the difference between the net contribution required for 2017 of $108,000 (the minimum required contribution of $125,000, offset by $17,000 for the amount of the funding standard carryover balance used) and $65,132 (the interest-adjusted contributions made for the 2017 plan year before the 8
1/2
month deadline, as illustrated in paragraphs (ii)(A) through (ii)(D) of
Example 5
).

# Example 7.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the plan year is changed to an August 1-July 31 plan year effective August 1, 2017. This results in a short plan year beginning January 1, 2017 and ending July 31, 2017. The minimum required contribution for the 7-month period covered by the plan year is calculated as $72,917 in accordance with § 1.430(a)-1(b)(2)(ii).
(ii) As provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, a required installment is due 15 days after the end of the short plan year (August 15, 2017), and required installments are also due on the regularly scheduled due dates for required installments that occur within the short plan year (April 15, 2017 and July 15, 2017).
(iii) The required installments are determined based on the lesser of (a) 90% of the minimum required contribution for the short plan year ending July 31, 2017 (90% of $72,917, or $65,625) or (b) 7/12 of 100% of the 2016 minimum required contribution ($100,000 × 7/12, or $58,333). The required installments are thus based on $58,333 because that is the smaller amount.
(iv) The amount of each required installment is determined by dividing the amount determined in paragraph (iii) of this
Example 7
by the number of required installments for the short plan year. This calculation results in required installments of $19,444 each (that is, $58,333 divided by 3 installments).
(v) The deadline for the remaining payment is 8
1/2
months after the end of the short plan year, or April 15, 2018. If the plan sponsor pays the minimum required amount at each installment date, does not elect to offset any amounts by any funding standard carryover or prefunding balance, and makes a final payment on April 15, 2018, then the remaining payment is $17,429, determined as follows:
(A) The contribution paid April 15, 2017 is adjusted by discounting the contribution amount for 3
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($19,444 ÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
= $19,122).
(B) The contribution paid July 15, 2017 is discounted for 6
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($19,444 ÷ 1.0590
(6.5/12)
= $18,850).
(C) The contribution paid August 15, 2017 is discounted for 7
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($19,444 ÷ 1.0590
(7.5/12)
= $18,760).
(D) The sum of the contributions for the 2017 plan year paid through August 15, 2017, adjusted for interest to the valuation date, is $56,732. The remaining amount paid April 15, 2018 for the 2017 plan year is ($72,917−$56,732) × 1.059
(15.5/12)
= $17,429.

# Example 8.
(i) Plan B has an August 10 to August 9 plan year.
(ii) For the plan year that begins on August 10, 2017, a plan month begins on the 10th day of each calendar month. Accordingly, the due dates for the required installments for that plan year are November 24, 2017, February 24, 2018, May 24, 2018 and August 24, 2018. The deadline for the final contribution for the plan year is April 24, 2019.

# Example 9.
(i) Plan C has a funding standard carryover balance of $0 and a prefunding balance of $65,000 as of January 1, 2017. Plan C's funding ratio for 2016 (determined under § 1.430(f)-1(d)(3)) was over 80%. The minimum required contribution for Plan C (determined prior to any offset for the funding standard carryover balance) is $120,000 for 2016. Required installments for the 2016 plan year were made timely, and the final installment of the minimum required contribution for the 2016 plan year is due on September 15, 2017 in the amount of $40,000.
(ii) Prior to April 15, 2017, the plan sponsor makes a standing election to use Plan C's funding balances to offset any otherwise unpaid required installments and any otherwise unpaid minimum required contribution. On June 1, 2017, the actuary completes the 2017 valuation and notifies the plan sponsor that the minimum required contribution for the 2017 plan year is $100,000. The effective interest rate for the 2017 plan year is 5.90%. No contributions are made for the 2017 plan year until September 15, 2018.
(iii) The first required installment for the 2017 plan year is due on April 15, 2017. Under § 1.430(f)-1(f)(1)(iii)(B), the amount of the prefunding balance used as of April 15, 2017 pursuant to the standing election is 25% of the $120,000 required annual payment for the 2016 plan year ($30,000). The prefunding balance is reduced by this amount, adjusted for the 3
1/2
-month period between the January 1, 2017 valuation date and the April 15, 2017 due date, using the effective rate for Plan C for 2017 ($30,000 ÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
, or $29,503). The prefunding balance is available to offset the April 15, 2017 required installment even though the minimum required contribution for the 2016 plan year has not yet been made, because the standing election to use Plan C's balances to offset the minimum required contribution for the 2016 plan year does not take effect until the due date for that contribution, or September 15, 2017. Therefore, as of April 15, 2017, the prefunding balance still exists and may be used to offset the required installment due as of that date.
(iv) The second required installment for the 2017 plan year is due on July 15, 2017, after the actuary determined the minimum required contribution for the 2017 plan year. The required annual payment for 2017 is equal to the lesser of (a) 100% of the 2017 minimum required contribution ($120,000) or (b) 90% of the 2017 minimum required contribution (90% of $100,000, or $90,000). Therefore, each required installment for 2017 is 25% of $90,000, or $22,500.
(v) Although the amount of the required installments for 2017 ($22,500) is smaller than the amount based on the 2016 minimum required contribution ($30,000), under § 1.430(f)-1(f)(1)(iii)(B), the amount of the prefunding balance used under the standing election continues to be the $30,000 based on the minimum required contribution for the 2016 plan year. Alternatively, the plan sponsor can make a replacement formula election to use the prefunding balance to cover the remaining required installments for the 2017 plan year as described in § 1.430(f)-1(f)(1)(iii)(C),
based on required installments of $22,500 each.
(vi) The use of $30,000 of the prefunding balance as of April 15, 2017 pursuant to the standing election is irrevocable, and therefore the prefunding balance is not adjusted to reflect the fact that the first required installment for the 2017 plan year (based on the actual 2017 minimum required contribution) is lower than $30,000.
(vii) However, the excess of the $30,000 of prefunding balance used on April 15, 2017 over the first required installment is allocated toward the second required installment. In addition, if the plan sponsor makes a replacement formula election in accordance with § 1.430(f)-1(f)(1)(iii)(C), the amount of prefunding balance used pursuant to that election takes into account the actual required installment. In this case, the amount of the prefunding balance used to satisfy the July 15, 2017 required installment is $14,437. This amount is determined by (1) calculating the excess of the amount of the prefunding balance used on April 15, 2017 over the amount of the required installment due on that date ($30,000 − $22,500 = $7,500), and adjusting it for the 3 months from April 15, 2017 to July 15, 2017, using the effective interest rate ($7,500 × 1.0590
(3/12)
= $7,608), (2) deducting that amount from the required installment due July 15, 2017, to determine the net amount due as of that date ($22,500 − $7,608 = $14,892), and (3) adjusting the net amount to the valuation date of January 1, 2017 for the 6
1/2
-month period between the valuation date and the due date for the required installment, using the effective interest rate for Plan C for 2017 ($14,892 ÷ 1.0590
(6.5/12)
= $14,437).

# Example 10.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 9,
except that Plan C's prefunding balance as of January 1, 2017 is only $20,000, and Plan C's sponsor makes a contribution larger than the minimum required contribution for the 2016 plan year on March 1, 2017.
(ii) The amount of the April 15, 2017 required installment that is satisfied by the plan sponsor's election to offset the prefunding balance is calculated by increasing the January 1, 2017 prefunding balance with interest for 3
1/2
months to April 15, 2017, using the effective interest rate for Plan C for 2017. This results in an offset of $20,337 ($20,000 × 1.0590
(3.5/12)
). A cash contribution of $2,163 ($22,500 − $20,337) is needed to satisfy the required installment on that date.
(iii) The excess contribution made for the 2016 plan year cannot be used to offset the remainder of the April 15, 2017 required installment even though it was contributed prior to the date the installment is due, because the sponsor had not yet elected to credit the excess contribution to the prefunding balance. If the plan sponsor elects at a later date to credit the excess contribution to the prefunding balance, the amount can be used to offset required installments due on or after the date of that election. However, note that if Plan C's actuary reflected the excess contribution for 2016 in certifying the 2017 adjusted funding target attainment percentage (AFTAP) used to apply benefit restrictions under section 436, a later election to credit the excess contribution to the prefunding balance would reduce the AFTAP and could cause Plan C to violate section 436.

# Example 11.
(i) Plan D is not a small plan described in § 1.430(g)-1(b)(2). The valuation date for Plan D is January 1, and Plan D's funding target attainment percentage (FTAP) was 82% as of January 1, 2016 and is 90% as of January 1, 2017. The amount needed to increase the plan's FTAP for the 2017 plan year to 100% (including the expected increase in the funding target due to benefits accruing or earned during the plan year) is $500,000. Before taking the liquidity requirement of paragraph (d) of this section into account, the plan sponsor of Plan D is required to pay installments for the 2017 plan year in the amount of $50,000 each. During the 12-month period ending March 31, 2017, periodic annuity payments of $425,000 and single sum payments of $200,000 were made by Plan D. Of the single sum payments, $125,000 were made during the 2016 plan year and $75,000 were made during the 2017 plan year. None of these payments were due to nonrecurring circumstances. In addition, administrative expenses of $25,000 were paid from the plan trust during the 12-month period ending March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, the reported value of Plan D's assets is $1,500,000, and the fair market value of Plan D's liquid assets is $1,300,000.
(ii) The amount of the adjusted disbursements from Plan D for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2017 is calculated as the sum of the annuity benefits, single sum payments, and administrative expenses paid during the 12-month period, reduced by the product of the plan's FTAP and the sum of the single sum payments and any payments for annuities purchased during the plan year. This results in adjusted disbursements for the period of $480,000 (that is, $425,000 plus $200,000 plus $25,000, reduced by 82% of $125,000 in single sum payments during 2016 and 90% of $75,000 in single sum payments during 2017).
(iii) The base amount is calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section as three times the adjusted disbursements determined in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 11,
or $1,440,000.
(iv) The liquidity shortfall is the difference between the base amount of $1,440,000 determined in paragraph (iii) of this
Example 11
and the $1,300,000 in liquid assets as of March 31, 2017, or $140,000. The required installment due on April 15, 2017 is therefore $140,000, since this amount is larger than the $50,000
installment otherwise required, but less than the $500,000 needed to increase the plan's FTAP (including the expected increase in the funding target due to benefits accruing or earned during the plan year) to 100%.
(v) Note that any contributions of liquid assets made through March 31, 2017 are reflected for purposes of determining the fair market value of Plan D's liquid assets as of March 31, 2017 and are not applied toward satisfying the liquidity requirement as of April 15, 2017. Similarly, any funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance as of January 1, 2017 cannot be applied to offset the liquidity requirement. Only contributions made in cash or other liquid assets made after March 31, 2017 and by April 15, 2017 can be used to timely satisfy this requirement.

# Example 12.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 11.
The plan sponsor makes a cash contribution for the 2017 plan year of $30,000 on April 15, 2017, and makes an additional cash contribution for the 2017 plan year of $110,000 on April 30, 2017. The effective interest rate for Plan D for the 2017 plan year is 5.90%.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the underpayment of the required installment due April 15, 2017 is $110,000 (that is, $140,000 minus $30,000).
(iii) Because the $110,000 contribution was made after the due date for the required installment (which reflects an unpaid liquidity amount) but during the quarter in which the installment was due, and because that contribution does not exceed the unpaid liquidity amount for the quarter, the special interest adjustment under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section applies to the entire amount of the contribution. Accordingly, the contribution is adjusted for interest in two steps for the purpose of determining the portion of the minimum required contribution that is satisfied by the contribution. In the first step, the contribution is adjusted using the effective interest rate for the 2-month period from the payment date of April 30, 2017 to June 30, 2017, the last day of the quarter during which the liquidity requirement was due ($110,000 × 1.0590
(2/12)
= $111,056). In the second step, this amount is adjusted as if that amount had been paid on June 30, 2017. Accordingly, this amount ($111,056) is discounted for interest at a rate of 10.90% (the effective interest rate for the 2017 plan year of 5.90%, increased by 5 percentage points) for the 2
1/2
-month period from June 30, 2017 to the April 15, 2017 due date for the installment, and is further discounted using the effective interest rate of 5.90% for the 3
1/2
-month period between April 15, 2017 and the valuation date of January 1, 2017. Therefore, the April 30, 2017 contribution is adjusted to $106,886 as of January 1, 2017 ($111,056 ÷ 1.1090
(2.5/12)
÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
).
(iv) The $140,000 contributed during April 2017 is needed to satisfy the required installment due April 15, 2017 (determined taking into account the liquidity shortfall as of March 31, 2017), and so the full amount is applied to satisfy that installment. No portion of those contributions is applied to the required installments for subsequent quarters, and no additional payments are needed to satisfy the required installment due April 15, 2017 (because the $110,000 payment satisfies both the unpaid liquidity amount and the remaining amount of the required installment described under paragraph (c)(5) of this section).

# Example 13.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 12,
except that the plan sponsor does not make the second cash contribution of $110,000 on April 30, 2017, but instead makes a second cash contribution of $75,000 for the 2017 plan year on July 15, 2017. The base amount as of June 30, 2017 calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section is $1,500,000, and the fair market value of liquid assets as of that date is $1,400,000.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the underpayment of the required installment due April 15, 2017 is $110,000 (that is, $140,000 minus $30,000).
(iii) As of June 30, 2017, no portion of the $110,000 underpayment of the required installment due April 15, 2017 has been satisfied. Under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, to the extent that the amount due April 15, 2017 solely because of the liquidity requirement under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not satisfied with a contribution of liquid assets during the quarter, this amount is no longer considered unpaid. Of the $110,000 underpayment of the required installment that was due on April 15, 2017, $20,000 would have been due without regard to the liquidity requirement under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and $90,000 was due solely because of that liquidity requirement. Accordingly, as of July 1, 2017, $90,000 of the required installment due on April 15, 2017 is no longer treated as unpaid and $20,000 of that required installment continues to be treated as unpaid.
(iv) Under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, the interest adjustment in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section for the $90,000 portion of the installment due April 15, 2017 that is no longer treated as unpaid is given effect through an increase in the minimum required contribution. This increase to the minimum required contribution is $837, which is determined as the difference between:
(A) The $90,000 portion of the required installment that is no longer treated as unpaid by reason of paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, discounted for the 6-month period between June 30, 2017 (the last day of the quarter in which the liquidity amount was due) to January 1, 2017 (the valuation date)
using the plan's effective interest rate for 2017 (5.90%), resulting in $87,457 (that is, $90,000 ÷ 1.0590
(6/12)
), and
(B) The $90,000 portion of the required installment that is no longer treated as unpaid by reason of paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, discounted for the 2
1/2
-month period between June 30, 2017 and the April 15, 2017 due date using the plan's effective interest rate increased by 5 percentage points (10.90%), and further discounted for the 3
1/2
-month period between April 15, 2017 and January 1, 2017 valuation date using the plan's effective interest rate, for a result of $86,620 (that is, $90,000 ÷ 1.1090
(2.5/12)
÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
).
(v) The remainder of the required installment that was due on April 15, 2017 without regard to the liquidity requirement ($20,000) remains unpaid until the July 15, 2017 contribution is made. Under paragraph (c) of this section, $20,000 of the July 15, 2017 contribution must be allocated to the required installment due on April 15, 2017. The interest adjustment under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section applies to that $20,000 portion of the contribution because it is a late payment of a required installment. Accordingly, $20,000 of the July 15, 2017 contribution is adjusted to April 15, 2017, using an interest rate of 10.90% for the 3-month period between July 15, 2017 and the April 15, 2017 due date, and further adjusted using the effective interest rate of 5.90% for 3
1/2
months between April 15, 2017 and the January 1, 2017 valuation date. Therefore, the portion of the July 15, 2017 contribution attributable to the April 15, 2017 required installment is adjusted to $19,166 as of January 1, 2017 ($20,000 ÷ 1.1090
(3/12)
÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
).
(vi) The liquidity shortfall is recalculated as of June 30, 2017 as $100,000 (that is, the base amount of $1,500,000 minus the value of liquid assets of $1,400,000). This amount is larger than the $50,000 required installment otherwise applicable, and so the amount of the required installment due on July 15, 2017 is $100,000. Of the $75,000 contribution made on July 15, 2017, $20,000 is applied to satisfy the remainder of the required installment due April 15, 2017, and the remaining $55,000 is applied toward the required installment due July 15, 2017. An additional contribution of $45,000 in liquid assets is needed to satisfy the required installment due July 15, 2017.
(vii) If instead there were no liquidity shortfall as of June 30, 2017, the required installment due July 15, 2017 would be $50,000. Of the $75,000 contribution made on July 15, 2017, $20,000 would be applied to satisfy the remainder of the required installment due April 15, 2017, $50,000 would be applied to satisfy the required installment due on July 15, 2017, and the remaining $5,000 would be applied toward the next required installment.

# Example 14.
(i) Plan E, which is a small plan described in section 430(g)(2)(B), has a calendar year plan year and a valuation date of December 31. The required installments for the 2017 plan year are $30,000 each and each of the required installments is paid on the due date. The effective interest rate for Plan E for the 2017 plan year is 5.90%.
(ii) The total contributions made for the plan year and before the valuation date, adjusted with interest to the valuation date, equal $92,402. This is developed as shown below:
(A) The contribution paid April 15, 2017 is adjusted by increasing the contribution amount for 8
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($30,000 × 1.0590
(8.5/12)
= $31,243).
(B) The contribution paid July 15, 2017 is increased for 5
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($30,000 × 1.0590
(5.5/12)
= $30,799).
(C) The contribution paid October 15, 2017 is increased for 2
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($30,000 × 1.0590
(2.5/12)
= $30,360).
(iii) Pursuant to § 1.430(g)-1(d)(2), the interest-adjusted value of the contributions for the 2017 plan year that are made before the valuation date is subtracted from the December 31, 2017 plan assets in determining the value of plan assets for the December 31, 2017 actuarial valuation.

# Example 15.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 14,
except that the first contribution for the 2017 plan year is made on May 15, 2017 in the amount of $40,000. The remaining amount of each required installment is paid on the date it is due.
(ii) In accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the amount of the required installment due on April 15, 2017 remains at $30,000, even though the associated contribution was not paid until May 15, 2017. Therefore, $30,000 of the payment is allocated to the April 15, 2017 required installment and the remaining $10,000 is allocated to the installment due on July 15, 2017.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the portion of the May 15, 2017 contribution allocated to the July 15, 2017 required installment is increased for interest for the 2 months between the date of the contribution and the due date, using the effective interest rate for 2017. Therefore, the amount allocated to the July 15, 2017 installment is $10,096 (that is, $10,000 × 1.0590
(2/12)
). The remaining installment due July 15, 2017 is $30,000 minus $10,096, or $19,904.
(iv) The total amount credited against the minimum required contribution is $122,062 as of December 31, 2017. This amount is calculated as shown below:
(A) The portion of the May 15, 2017 contribution allocated to the April 15, 2017 required installment is first adjusted for the 1 month between the due date and the payment date using the effective interest rate plus 5% ($30,000 ÷ 1.1090
(1/12)
= $29,742). This amount is then adjusted using the effective interest rate, for the 8
1/2
months between the due date of April 15, 2017 and the valuation
date of December 31, 2017 ($29,742 × 1.0590
(8.5/12)
= $30,975).
(B) The remaining portion of the May 15, 2017 contribution ($10,000) is increased for the 7
1/2
months between the date of the contribution and the valuation date at the effective interest rate ($10,000 × 1.0590
(7.5/12)
= $10,365).
(C) The contribution paid July 15, 2017 is increased for 5
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($19,904 × 1.0590
(5.5/12)
= $20,434).
(D) The contribution paid October 15, 2017 is increased for 2
1/2
months at the effective interest rate ($30,000 × 1.0590
(2.5/12)
= $30,360).
(E) The contribution paid January 15, 2018 is discounted for
1/2
month at the effective interest rate ($30,000 ÷ 1.0590
(0.5/12)
= $29,928).
(v) The amount deducted from valuation assets as of December 31, 2017 for contributions made before the valuation date is determined without regard to the special interest adjustment for late payment of the required installment due April 15, 2017 (and without regard to the contribution paid on January 15, 2018).

# Example 16.
(i) Plan F has a required installment of $10,000 per quarter for the 2016 plan year. The plan sponsor makes a contribution of $9,993 on April 10, 2016. The effective interest rate for Plan F for the 2016 plan year is 5.90%.
(ii) In accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the contribution is increased for interest at the effective interest rate, for the 5 days between the contribution date and the due date for the required installment. Therefore, the amount credited against the required installment due April 15, 2016 is $10,001 ($9,993 × 1.0590
(5/365)
), and the required installment is satisfied.

# Example 17.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 16,
except that a contribution of $8,000 is made on April 20, 2016.
(ii) In accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the amount of the required installment due on April 15, 2016 remains at $10,000, even though the associated contribution was not paid until after the due date, and so $2,000 ($10,000 − $8,000) of the required installment remains unpaid as of April 20, 2016.
(iii) The amount of the April 20, 2016 contribution credited against the minimum required contribution for 2016 is $7,858. This amount is determined by first adjusting the contribution for the 5 days between the due date for the required installment and the date of the contribution using the effective interest rate for Plan F for the 2016 plan year, plus 5% ($8,000 ÷ 1.1090
(5/365)
= $7,989). The result is further adjusted for the 105 days from the due date for the required installment to the valuation date of January 1, 2016 using the effective interest rate of 5.90% ($7,989 ÷ 1.0590
(105/365)
= $7,858).
(iv) Alternatively, the amount of the April 20, 2016 contribution credited against the minimum required contribution for 2016 could be determined using 3
1/2
months between the due date for the required installment and the January 1, 2016 valuation date, as long as the calculation is done consistently for each contribution and for each plan year. Using this approach, the amount adjusted to the April 15, 2016 due date (using the effective interest rate for Plan F for the 2016 plan year plus 5%) is adjusted to January 1, 2016 for 3
1/2
months at the effective interest rate for Plan F for the 2016 plan year. Under this approach, the amount credited against the minimum required contribution is $7,856 ($8,000 ÷ 1.1090
(5/365)
÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
).

# Example 18.
(i) Plan G has a funding standard carryover balance of $15,000 and a prefunding balance of $50,000 as of January 1, 2016. Plan G's required installments are $25,000 each for the 2017 plan year, and the final installment of the minimum required contribution for the 2016 plan year is due on September 15, 2017, in the amount of $40,000. Plan G's funding ratios for both 2015 and 2016 (determined under § 1.430(f)-1(d)(3)) were over 80%. No elections were made to reduce or use Plan G's funding balances during 2016. The effective interest rate for Plan G for the 2016 and 2017 plan years are 5.40% and 5.90%, respectively.
(ii) On April 15, 2017, Plan G's sponsor elected to use the balances to offset the required installment due on that date. The amount of the required installment is adjusted to January 1, 2017, using the effective interest rate for 2017 to determine the amount by which the balances are reduced. Accordingly, this election results in a reduction of $24,585 ($25,000 ÷ 1.0590
(3.5/12)
in the funding balances as of January 1, 2017.
(iii) On September 15, 2017, Plan G's sponsor elected to use the balances to offset the remaining minimum required contribution for the 2016 plan year due on that date. This amount is adjusted to January 1, 2016, using the effective interest rate for 2016 to determine the amount by which the balances are reduced. Accordingly, this election results in a reduction of $36,563 ($40,000 ÷ 1.0540
(20.5/12)
in Plan G's funding balances as of January 1, 2016.
(iv) Section 430(f)(3)(B) and § 1.430(f)-1(d)(2) require that the funding standard carryover balance be exhausted before the prefunding balance is used to offset required contribution amounts. Although the due date for the April 15, 2017 required installment occurs earlier than the due date for the 2016 minimum required contribution, for this purpose contributions for the 2016 plan year are deemed to occur before those for the 2017 plan year. Therefore, the election to offset the 2016 minimum required contribution will eliminate Plan G's funding standard carryover balance, and the 2017 required installment due April 15, 2017 will be offset by the prefunding balance.
(g)
Effective/applicability dates and transition rules
—(1)
Statutory effective date/applicability date.
Section 430 generally applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The applicability of section 430 for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution is delayed for certain plans in accordance with sections 104 through 106 of PPA '06.
(2)
Effective date/applicability date of regulations.
This section applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2016. For plan years beginning before January 1, 2016, plans are permitted to rely on the provisions set forth in this section for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 430(j).
(3)
First effective plan year.
For purposes of this section, the
first effective plan year
for a plan is the first plan year after the pre-effective plan year.
(4)
Pre-effective plan year.
For purposes of this section, the
pre-effective plan year
is the plan year described in § 1.430(a)-1(h)(5).
(5)
Special rules relating to first effective plan year
—(i)
Determination of minimum required contribution for pre-effective plan year.
In the case of the plan's first effective plan year, the minimum required contribution for the preceding plan year for purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section is equal to the minimum required contribution under section 412 for the pre-effective plan year (determined without regard to any funding waiver under section 412), determined as of the last day of the pre-effective plan year and without regard to the plan's credit balance.
(ii)
Determination of funding shortfall for pre-effective plan year
—(A)
First effective plan year that begins during 2008.
In general, in the case of a plan with a first effective plan year that begins during 2008, the funding shortfall for the pre-effective plan year that precedes it is determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) of this section. However, for this purpose, the plan's current liability for the pre-effective plan year under section 412(l)(7) (as in effect for the pre-effective plan year) is permitted to be used in place of the plan's funding target for the pre-effective plan year. In addition, for this purpose, the value of plan assets that was used for the pre-effective plan year is permitted to be used in place of the value of plan assets computed pursuant to § 1.430(g)-1(c) for the pre-effective plan year, provided that the value of plan assets that was used for the pre-effective plan year was not less than 90 percent nor more than 110 percent of the value of plan assets computed pursuant to § 1.430(g)-1(c). If the value of plan assets that was used for the pre-effective plan year was less than 90 percent of the value of plan assets computed pursuant to § 1.430(g)-1(c), then 90 percent of the value of plan assets computed pursuant to § 1.430(g)-1(c) is permitted to be used as the value of plan assets for the pre-effective plan year. If the value of plan assets that was used for the pre-effective plan year was more than 110 percent of the value of plan assets computed pursuant to § 1.430(g)-1(c), then 110 percent of the value of plan assets computed pursuant to § 1.430(g)-1(c) is permitted to be used as the value of plan assets for the pre-effective plan year. Finally, for this purpose, the value of plan assets is permitted to be determined without subtraction for the plan's credit balance for the pre-effective plan year.
(B)
First effective plan year begins after 2008.
In the case of a plan with a first effective plan year that begins after December 31, 2008, the determination of the funding shortfall for the pre-effective plan year that immediately precedes it is made in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. Thus, the funding shortfall for the pre-effective plan year is based on the funding target for the pre-effective plan year and the value of plan assets is determined under § 1.430(g)-1(c) for the pre-effective plan year, even though section 430(g) did not apply to the plan for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution for the pre-effective plan year.

§ 1.431(c)(6)-1
Mortality tables used to determine current liability.
(a)
Mortality tables used to determine current liability.
In accordance with section 431(c)(6)(D), the mortality assumptions that apply to a single-employer defined benefit plan for the plan year pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(A) and (D) and §§ 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(1) and (a)(2)(ii) are
used to determine a multiemployer plan's current liability for purposes of applying the rules of section 431(c)(6). For purposes of this paragraph (a), either the generational mortality tables used pursuant to § 1.430(h)(3)-1(b) or the static mortality tables used pursuant to § 1.430(h)(3)-1(c) are permitted to be used without regard to whether the plan is a small plan. However, substitute mortality tables under §§ 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(2)(i) and 1.430(h)(3)-2 are not permitted to be used for purposes of this paragraph (a).
(b)
Applicability date.
This section applies for valuation dates occurring on or after January 1, 2024.

§ 1.432
[Reserved]
§ 1.432(e)(9)-1
Benefit suspensions for multiemployer plans in critical and declining status.
(a)
General rules on suspension of benefits
—(1)
General rule.
Subject to section 432(e)(9)(B) through (I) and this section, the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan that is in critical and declining status (within the meaning of section 432(b)(6)) for a plan year may, by plan amendment adopted in the plan year, implement a suspension of benefits that the plan sponsor deems appropriate. Such an amendment is permitted notwithstanding the anti-cutback provisions of section 411(d)(6). As amended, the terms of the plan must satisfy the requirements of section 401(a).
(2)
Adoption of plan terms inconsistent with suspension requirements
—(i)
General rule.
A plan may implement (or continue to implement) a reduction of benefits pursuant to a suspension of benefits only if the terms of the plan are consistent with the requirements of section 432(e)(9) and this section.
(ii)
Changes in level of suspension
—(A)
Phased-in suspension.
A plan's terms are consistent with the requirements of section 432(e)(9) even if the plan provides that, instead of a suspension of benefits occurring in full on a specified effective date, the amount of a suspension will phase in or otherwise change in a definite, pre-determined manner as of a specified future effective date or dates.
(B)
Level of suspension contingent on future events.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), a plan's terms are inconsistent with the requirements of section 432(e)(9) if they provide that the amount of a suspension will change contingent upon the occurrence of any other specified future event, condition, or development. For example, a plan is not permitted to provide that an additional or larger suspension of benefits is triggered if the plan's funded status deteriorates. Similarly, a plan is not permitted to provide that a suspension of benefits is decreased if the plan's funded status improves (except upon a failure to satisfy the annual plan sponsor determinations requirement of paragraph (c)(4) of this section).
(C)
Level of suspension contingent on future status of individual.
A plan's terms are not inconsistent with the requirements of section 432(e)(9) merely because they provide that, for a participant who has not commenced benefits before the effective date of the suspension, the amount of the suspension will change upon the occurrence of a specified future event, condition or development (such as retirement, death, or disability) with respect to the participant.
(3)
Organization of the regulation.
This paragraph (a) contains definitions and general rules relating to a suspension of benefits by a multiemployer plan under section 432(e)(9). Paragraph (b) of this section defines a suspension of benefits and describes the length of a suspension, the treatment of beneficiaries and alternate payees under this section, and the requirement to select a retiree representative. Paragraph (c) of this section prescribes certain rules for the actuarial certification and plan sponsor determinations that must be made in order for a plan to suspend benefits. Paragraph (d) of this section describes certain limitations on suspensions of benefits. Paragraph (e) of this section prescribes rules relating to benefit improvements. Paragraph (f) of this section describes the requirement to provide notice in connection with an application to suspend benefits. Paragraph (g) of this section describes certain requirements with respect to the approval or denial
of an application for a suspension of benefits. Paragraph (h) of this section contains certain rules relating to the vote on an approved suspension, systemically important plans, and the issuance of a final authorization to suspend benefits. Paragraph (j) of this section provides the effective/applicability date of this section.
(4)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section—
(i)
Pay status.
A person is in pay status under a multiemployer plan if, as described in section 432(j)(6), at any time during the current plan year, the person is a participant, beneficiary, or alternate payee under the plan and is paid an early, late, normal, or disability retirement benefit under the plan (or a death benefit under the plan related to a retirement benefit).
(ii)
Plan sponsor.
The term plan sponsor means the association, committee, joint board of trustees, or other similar group of representatives of the parties that establishes or maintains the multiemployer plan. However, in the case of a plan described in section 404(c), or a continuation of such a plan, the term plan sponsor means the association of employers that is the employer settlor of the plan.
(iii)
Effective date of suspension of benefits
—(A)
Individuals who are receiving benefits.
In the case of a suspension affecting an individual who is receiving benefits when the suspension is implemented, the effective date of a suspension of benefits is the first date as of which any portion of the individual's benefits are not paid as a result of the suspension.
(B)
Individuals who are not receiving benefits.
In the case of a suspension affecting individuals other than individuals described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the effective date of the suspension is the first date as of which the individual's entitlement to benefits is reduced as a result of the implementation of the suspension, regardless of whether the individual is eligible to commence benefits at that date.
(C)
Phased-in suspension.
If a suspension of benefits provides for more than one reduction in benefits over time, such that benefits are scheduled to be reduced by an additional amount after benefits are first reduced pursuant to the suspension, then each date as of which benefits are reduced is treated as a separate effective date of the suspension. However, if the effective date of the final scheduled reduction in benefits in a series of reductions pursuant to a suspension is less than three years later than the effective date of the first reduction, then the effective date of the first reduction will be treated as the effective date of all subsequent reductions pursuant to that suspension.
(D)
Effective date may not be retroactive.
The effective date of a suspension may not precede the date on which a final authorization to suspend benefits is issued pursuant to paragraph (h)(6) of this section.
(b)
Definition of suspension of benefits and related rules
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Definition.
For purposes of this section, the term suspension of benefits means the temporary or permanent reduction, pursuant to the terms of the plan, of any current or future payment obligation of the plan with respect to any plan participant. A suspension of benefits may apply with respect to a plan participant regardless of whether the participant, beneficiary, or alternate payee commenced receiving benefits before the effective date of the suspension of benefits.
(ii)
Plan not liable for suspended benefits.
If a plan pays a reduced level of benefits pursuant to a suspension of benefits that complies with the requirements of section 432(e)(9) and this section, then the plan is not liable for any benefits not paid as a result of the suspension.
(2)
Length of suspension
—(i)
In general.
A suspension of benefits may be of indefinite duration or may expire as of a date that is specified in the plan amendment implementing the suspension.
(ii)
Effect of a benefit improvement.
A plan sponsor may amend the plan to eliminate some or all of a suspension of benefits, provided that the amendment satisfies the requirements that apply to a benefit improvement under section 432(e)(9)(E), in accordance with the rules of paragraph (e) of this section.
(3)
Treatment of beneficiaries and alternate payees.
Except as otherwise specified in this section, all references to suspensions of benefits, increases in benefits, or resumptions of suspended benefits with respect to participants also apply with respect to benefits of beneficiaries or alternate payees (as defined in section 414(p)(8)) of participants.
(4)
Retiree representative
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Requirement to select retiree representative.
The plan sponsor of a plan that intends to submit an application for a suspension of benefits and that has reported a total of 10,000 or more participants as of the end of the plan year for the most recently filed Form 5500, Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan, must select a retiree representative. The plan sponsor must select the retiree representative at least 60 days before the date the plan sponsor submits an application to suspend benefits. The retiree representative must be a plan participant who is in pay status. The retiree representative may or may not be a plan trustee.
(B)
Role of retiree representative.
The role of the retiree representative is to advocate for the interests of the retired and deferred vested participants and beneficiaries of the plan, beginning when the retiree representative is selected and continuing throughout the suspension approval process. In the discretion of the plan sponsor, the retiree representative may continue in this role throughout the period of the benefit suspension.
(ii)
Reasonable expenses from plan.
The plan must pay reasonable expenses incurred by the retiree representative, including reasonable expenses for legal and actuarial support and communication with retired and deferred vested participants and beneficiaries, commensurate with the plan's size and funded status.
(iii)
Disclosure of information.
Upon request, the plan sponsor must promptly provide the retiree representative with relevant information, such as plan documents and data, that is reasonably necessary to enable the retiree representative to perform the role described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
(iv)
Special rules relating to fiduciary status.
See section 432(e)(9)(B)(v)(III) for rules relating to the fiduciary status of a retiree representative.
(v)
Retiree representative for other plans.
The plan sponsor of a plan that has reported fewer than 10,000 participants as of the end of the plan year for the most recently filed Form 5500, Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan is permitted to select a retiree representative. The rules in this paragraph (b)(4) (other than the rules in the first two sentences of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section concerning the size of the plan and the timing of the appointment of the retiree representative) apply to such a representative.
(c)
Conditions for suspension
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Actuarial certification and initial plan sponsor determinations.
The plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status for a plan year may suspend benefits only if the actuarial certification requirement in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the initial plan sponsor determinations requirement in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are met.
(ii)
Annual requirement to make plan sponsor determinations.
As provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the suspension will continue only if the plan sponsor continues to make the annual plan sponsor determinations described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(2)
Actuarial certification.
A plan satisfies the actuarial certification requirement of this paragraph (c)(2) if, taking into account the proposed suspension of benefits (and, if applicable, a proposed partition of the plan under section 4233 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Public Law 93-406 (88 Stat. 829 (1974)), as amended (ERISA)), the plan's actuary certifies that the plan is projected to avoid insolvency within the meaning of section 418E, assuming the suspension of benefits continues until it expires by its own terms or if no such expiration date is set, indefinitely.
(3)
Initial plan sponsor determinations
—(i)
General rule.
A plan satisfies the initial plan sponsor determinations requirement of this paragraph (c)(3) only if the plan sponsor determines that—
(A) All reasonable measures to avoid insolvency, within the meaning of section 418E, have been taken; and
(B) The plan would not be projected to avoid insolvency (determined using the standards described in paragraphs (d)(5)(ii), (iv), and (v) of this section) if no suspension of benefits were applied under the plan.
(ii)
Factors.
In making its determination that all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency, within the meaning of section 418E, have been taken, the plan sponsor may take into account the following non-exclusive list of factors—
(A) Current and past contribution levels;
(B) Levels of benefit accruals (including any prior reductions in the rate of benefit accruals);
(C) Prior reductions (if any) of adjustable benefits;
(D) Prior suspensions (if any) of benefits under this section;
(E) The impact on plan solvency of the subsidies and ancillary benefits available to active participants;
(F) Compensation levels of active participants relative to employees in the participants' industry generally;
(G) Competitive and other economic factors facing contributing employers;
(H) The impact of benefit and contribution levels on retaining active participants and bargaining groups under the plan;
(I) The impact of past and anticipated contribution increases under the plan on employer attrition and retention levels; and
(J) Measures undertaken by the plan sponsor to retain or attract contributing employers.
(iii)
Reliance on certification of critical and declining status.
For purposes of the insolvency projection under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section, a plan sponsor may rely on the actuarial certification made pursuant to section 432(b)(3)(A)(i) that the plan is in critical and declining status for the plan year in making the determination that the plan is projected to become insolvent unless benefits are suspended.
(4)
Annual plan sponsor determinations
—(i)
General rule.
A plan satisfies the annual plan sponsor determinations requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) for a plan year only if the plan sponsor determines, no later than the last day of the plan year, that—
(A) All reasonable measures to avoid insolvency have been and continue to be taken; and
(B) The plan would not be projected to avoid insolvency (determined using the standards described in paragraphs (d)(5)(ii), (iv), and (v) of this section, substituting the current plan year for the plan year that includes the effective date of the suspension) if no suspension of benefits were applied under the plan.
(ii)
Factors.
In making its determination that all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency have been and continue to be taken, the plan sponsor may take into account the non-exclusive list of factors in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Requirement to maintain written record.
The plan sponsor must maintain a written record of the annual plan sponsor determinations made under this paragraph (c)(4). The written record must be included in an update to the rehabilitation plan, whether or not there is otherwise an update for that year (or, if the plan is no longer in critical status, must be included in the documents under which the plain is maintained). The written record of the determinations must describe the plan sponsor's consideration of factors, as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
(5)
Failure to make annual plan sponsor determinations.
If a plan sponsor fails to satisfy the annual plan sponsor determinations requirement of paragraph (c)(4) of this section for a plan year (including maintaining the written record described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section), then the suspension of benefits will cease to be in effect beginning as of the first day of the next plan year.
(d)
Limitations on suspension
—(1)
In general.
Any suspension of benefits with respect to a participant made by a plan sponsor pursuant to this section is subject to the individual limitations of sections 432(e)(9)(D)(i) through (iii) and paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(4) of this section. After applying those provisions, the overall size and distribution
of the suspension is subject to the aggregate limitations of sections 432(e)(9)(D)(iv) and (vi) and paragraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this section. See section 432(e)(9)(D)(vii) and paragraph (d)(8) of this section for additional rules applicable to certain plans.
(2)
Guarantee-based limitation
—(i)
General rule.
The reduction with respect to a participant under a suspension of benefits must be limited so that, on and after the effective date of the suspension, the monthly benefit is not less than the guarantee-based limitation. The guarantee-based limitation is 110 percent of the monthly benefit payable to a participant, beneficiary, or alternate payee that would be guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) under section 4022A of ERISA if the plan were to become insolvent as of the effective date of the suspension.
(ii)
PBGC guarantee.
Under section 4022A of ERISA, the monthly benefit of a participant or beneficiary that would be guaranteed by PBGC with respect to a plan if the plan were to become insolvent as of the effective date of the suspension is generally based on section 4022A(c)(1) of ERISA. Under that section, the monthly benefit that would be guaranteed if the plan were to become insolvent as of the date as of which the guarantee is determined is the product of—
(A) 100 percent of the accrual rate up to $11, plus 75 percent of the lesser of—
(
1
) $33; or
(
2
) The accrual rate, if any, in excess of $11; and
(B) The number of the participant's years and months of credited service as of that date.
(iii)
Calculation of accrual rate.
The accrual rate, as defined in section 4022A(c)(2) of ERISA, is calculated by dividing—
(A) The participant's or beneficiary's monthly benefit, described in section 4022A(c)(2)(A) of ERISA; by
(B) The participant's years of credited service, described in section 4022A(c)(3) of ERISA, as of the effective date of the suspension.
(iv)
Special rule for non-vested participants.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), a participant's nonforfeitable benefits under section 4022A(a) of ERISA include benefits that are forfeitable as of the effective date of the suspension, provided that the participant would have a nonforfeitable right to those benefits if the participant continued to earn vesting service following that date.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the limitation on a suspension of benefits under this paragraph (d)(2). Unless otherwise stated, the amount of guarantee payable by PBGC in these examples is based on section 4022A(c) of ERISA, and the rules under section 4022A(d) of ERISA (guarantee for benefits reduced under section 411(a)(3)(E)), section 4022A(e) of ERISA (benefits ineligible for guarantee), and section 4022A(h) of ERISA (guarantee for benefits accrued as of July 30, 1980) do not apply. In these examples, unless otherwise stated, the monthly benefits are nonforfeitable, are based on benefits that have been in effect for at least 60 months as of the effective date of the suspension, and are no greater than the monthly benefit that would be payable at normal retirement age in the form of a single life annuity.

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
A participant is receiving a benefit of $1,500 per month immediately prior to the effective date of the suspension. The participant has 30 years of credited service under the plan.
(ii)
Calculation of accrual rate.
The participant's accrual rate is $50, calculated by dividing the participant's monthly benefit payment ($1,500) by the participant's years of credited service (30).
(iii)
Calculation of monthly PBGC-guaranteed benefit.
The first $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, and the next $33 of the accrual rate is 75% guaranteed ($33 × .75 = $24.75). The participant's monthly guaranteed benefit per year of credited service is $35.75 ($11 + $24.75 = $35.75). The PBGC guarantee formula is then applied to produce the amount of guarantee payable by PBGC, which is $1,072.50 ($35.75 × 30 years = $1,072.50).
(iv)
Calculation of guarantee-based limitation.
A suspension of benefits may not reduce the participant's benefits, determined on and after the effective date of the suspension, below the guarantee-based limitation, which is equal to 110% of the amount of guarantee payable by PBGC. That monthly amount is $1,179.75 ($1,072.50 × 1.1 = $1,179.75).

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the participant is deceased and, immediately prior to the effective date of the suspension, the participant's beneficiary is receiving a monthly
benefit of $750 under a 50% joint and survivor annuity.
(ii)
Calculation of accrual rate.
The beneficiary's accrual rate is $25, calculated by dividing the beneficiary's monthly benefit payment ($750) by the participant's years of credited service (30).
(iii)
Calculation of monthly PBGC-guaranteed benefit.
The first $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, and the next $14 ($25−$11 = $14) of the accrual rate is 75% guaranteed ($14 × .75 = $10.50). The beneficiary's monthly guaranteed benefit is $21.50 per year of credited service ($11 + $10.50 = $21.50). The PBGC guarantee formula is then applied to produce the amount of guarantee payable by PBGC, which is $645 ($21.50 × 30 years = $645).
(iv)
Calculation of guarantee-based limitation.
A suspension of benefits may not reduce the beneficiary's benefits, determined on and after the effective date of the suspension, below the guarantee-based limitation, which is equal to 110% of the monthly amount of guarantee payable by PBGC. That monthly guarantee-based limitation amount is $709.50 ($645 × 1.1 = $709.50).

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
A participant would be eligible for a monthly benefit of $1,000 payable as a single life annuity at normal retirement age, based on the participant's 25 years of credited service. The plan also permits a participant to receive a benefit on an unreduced basis as a single life annuity at a particular early retirement age and permits participants to receive an early retirement benefit beginning at that age in the form of a social security level income option. The participant has elected the social security level income option under which the participant receives a monthly benefit of $1,600 prior to normal retirement age (which is the plan's assumed social security retirement age) and $900 after normal retirement age.
(ii)
Calculation of accrual rate.
For purposes of calculating the accrual rate, the monthly benefit that is used to calculate the PBGC guarantee does not exceed the monthly benefit of $1,000 that would be payable at normal retirement age. In calculating the accrual rate, the amount of guarantee payable by PBGC would be based on a monthly benefit of $1,000 prior to normal retirement age and $900 after normal retirement age. Before normal retirement age, the participant's accrual rate is $40, determined by dividing the participant's monthly benefit payment ($1,000) by years of credited service (25). After normal retirement age, the participant's accrual rate is $36, calculated by dividing the participant's monthly benefit payment ($900) by the participant's years of credited service (25).
(iii)
Calculation of monthly PBGC-guaranteed benefit.
Before normal retirement age, the first $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, and the next $29 of the accrual rate is 75% guaranteed ($29 × .75 = $21.75). The participant's monthly guaranteed benefit per year of credited service is $32.75 ($11 + $21.75 = $32.75). The PBGC guarantee formula is then applied to produce the amount of guarantee payable by PBGC, which is $818.75 ($32.75 × 25 years = $818.75). After normal retirement age, the first $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, and the next $25 of the accrual rate is 75% guaranteed ($25 × .75 = $18.75). The participant's monthly guaranteed benefit per year of credited service is $29.75 ($11 + $18.75 = $29.75). The PBGC guarantee formula is then applied to produce the amount of guarantee payable by PBGC, which is $743.75 after normal retirement age ($29.75 × 25 years = $743.75).
(iv)
Calculation of guarantee-based limitation.
A suspension of benefits may not reduce the participant's benefits, determined on and after the effective date of the suspension, below the guarantee-based limitation, which is equal to 110% of the monthly amount of guarantee payable by PBGC. That monthly guarantee-based limitation amount is $900.63 ($818.75 × 1.1 = $900.63) before normal retirement age and $818.13 ($743.75 × 1.1 = $818.13) after normal retirement age.

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
A participant would be eligible for a monthly benefit of $1,000 payable as a single life annuity at normal retirement age, based on the participant's 20 years of credited service. The plan provides an actuarial increase for delaying benefits until after normal retirement age. The participant delays commencement of benefits until after normal retirement age and the monthly benefit the participant is receiving immediately before the effective date of the suspension is $1,200 instead of $1,000.
(ii)
Calculation of accrual rate.
For purposes of calculating the accrual rate, the monthly benefit that is used to calculate the PBGC guarantee does not exceed the monthly benefit of $1,000 that would be payable at normal retirement age. Thus, in determining the accrual rate, the PBGC guarantee would be based on a monthly benefit of $1,000, whether benefits are paid at or after normal retirement age. The participant's accrual rate is $50, calculated by dividing the participant's monthly benefit payment ($1,000) by the participant's years of credited service (20).
(iii)
Calculation of monthly PBGC-guaranteed benefit.
The first $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, and the next $33 of the accrual rate is 75% guaranteed ($33 × .75 = $24.75). The participant's monthly guaranteed benefit per year of credited service is $35.75 ($11 + $24.75 = $35.75). The PBGC guarantee formula is then applied to produce the amount of guarantee payable by PBGC, which is $715 ($35.75 × 20 years = $715).
(iv)
Calculation of guarantee-based limitation.
A suspension of benefits may not reduce the participant's benefits, determined on and after the effective date of the suspension, below the guarantee-based limitation, which
is equal to 110% of the monthly amount of guarantee payable by PBGC. That monthly guarantee-based limitation amount is $786.50 ($715 × 1.1 = $786.50).

# Example 5.
(i)
Facts.
A plan provides that a participant who has completed at least five years of service will have a nonforfeitable right to 100% of an accrued benefit (and will not have a nonforfeitable right to any portion of the accrued benefit prior to completing five years of service). The plan implements a suspension of benefits on January 1, 2017. As of that date, a participant has three years of vesting service, and none of the participant's benefits are nonforfeitable under the terms of the plan.
(ii)
Calculation of nonforfeitable benefits.
For purposes of applying the guarantee-based limitation, the participant is considered to have a nonforfeitable right to 100% of the accrued benefit under the plan as of January 1, 2017.
(3)
Age-based limitation
—(i)
No suspension for participants or beneficiaries who are age 80 and older.
Pursuant to the age-based limitation of this paragraph (d)(3), no suspension of benefits is permitted to apply to a participant or beneficiary who—
(A) Has commenced benefits as of the effective date of the suspension; and
(B) Has attained 80 years of age no later than the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension.
(ii)
Limited suspension for participants and beneficiaries between ages 75 and 80.
Pursuant to the age-based limitation of this paragraph (d)(3), no more than the applicable percentage of the maximum suspendable benefit may be suspended for a participant or beneficiary who—
(A) Has commenced benefits as of the effective date of the suspension; and
(B) Has attained 75 years of age no later than the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension.
(iii)
Maximum suspendable benefit
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), the maximum suspendable benefit with respect to a participant, beneficiary, or alternate payee is the portion of the individual's benefits that would otherwise be suspended pursuant to this section (that is, the amount that would be suspended without regard to the limitation of this paragraph (d)(3)).
(B)
Coordination of limitations.
An individual's maximum suspendable benefit is calculated after the application of the guarantee-based limitation under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and the disability-based limitation under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(iv)
Applicable percentage.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), the applicable percentage is the percentage obtained by dividing—
(A) The number of months during the period beginning with the month after the month in which the suspension of benefits is effective and ending with the month during which the participant or beneficiary attains the age of 80, by
(B) 60.
(v)
Applicability of age-based limitation to benefits paid to beneficiaries.
If the age-based limitation of this paragraph (d)(3) applies to a participant on the effective date of the suspension, then the age-based limitation also applies to the beneficiary of the participant, based on the age of the participant as of the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension.
(vi)
Rule for benefits that have not commenced at the time of the suspension.
If benefits have not commenced to either a participant or beneficiary as of the effective date of the suspension, then in applying this paragraph (d)(3)—
(A) If the participant is alive on the effective date of the suspension, the participant is treated as having commenced benefits on that date; and
(B) If the participant dies before the effective date of the suspension, the beneficiary is treated as having commenced benefits on that date.
(vii)
Rules for alternate payees.
The age-based limitation of this paragraph (d)(3) applies to a suspension of benefits in which an alternate payee has an interest, whether or not the alternate payee has commenced benefits as of the effective date of the suspension. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), the applicable percentage for an alternate payee is calculated by—
(A) Using the participant's age as of the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension, if the alternate payee's right to the suspended benefits derives from a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p)(1)(A) (QDRO) under which the alternate
payee shares in each benefit payment but the participant retains the right to choose the time and form of payment with respect to the benefit to which the suspension applies (shared payment QDRO); or
(B) Substituting the alternate payee's age as of the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension for the participant's age, if the alternate payee's right to the suspended benefits derives from a QDRO under which the alternate payee has a separate right to receive a portion of the participant's retirement benefit to be paid at a time and in a form different from that chosen by the participant (separate interest QDRO).
(viii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d)(3):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
The plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status is implementing a suspension of benefits, effective December 1, 2017, that generally would reduce all benefit payments under the plan by 30%. On that date, a retiree is receiving a monthly benefit of $1,500 (which is not a benefit based on disability) and has 28 years of credited service under the plan. If none of the limitations in section 432(e)(9)(D)(i), (ii), and (iii) were to apply, a 30% suspension would reduce the retiree's monthly benefit by $450, to $1,050. Under the guarantee-based limitation in section 432(e)(9)(D)(i), the retiree's monthly benefit could not be reduced by more than $398.90, to $1,101.10 (1.1 × (28 × ($11 + (.75 × $33)))). The retiree is 77 years old on the effective date of the suspension, turns 78 on December 10, 2017, and turns 80 on December 10, 2019.
(ii)
Maximum suspendable benefit.
Because the retiree is not receiving a benefit based on disability under section 432(e)(9)(D)(iii), the retiree's maximum suspendable benefit is $398.90 (which is equal to the lesser of the amount of reduction that would apply pursuant to the 30% suspension ($450) or the amount of reduction that would be permitted under the guarantee-based limitation ($398.90)).
(iii)
Applicable percentage.
Because the retiree is between ages 75 and 80 on the effective date of the suspension, the reduction is not permitted to exceed the applicable percentage of the retiree's maximum suspendable benefit. The number of months during the period beginning with January 2018 (the month after the month that includes the effective date of the suspension) and ending with December 2019 (the month in which the retiree turns 80) is 24. The applicable percentage is equal to 40% (24 months divided by 60).
(iv)
Age-based limitation.
The retiree's maximum suspendable benefit is $398.90 and the applicable percentage is 40%. Thus, under the age-based limitation, the retiree's benefit may not be reduced by more than $159.56 ($398.90 × .40 = $159.56). Because the retiree was receiving a monthly benefit of $1,500, the suspension of benefits may not reduce the retiree's monthly benefit below $1,340.44 ($1,500−$159.56 = $1,340.44).

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that the retiree is 79 years old on December 1, 2017, and turns 80 on December 20, 2017.
(ii)
Age-based limitation.
The suspension is not permitted to apply to the retiree because the retiree will turn 80 by the end of the month (December 2017) in which the suspension is effective.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 1,
but on the effective date of the suspension, the retiree is receiving a benefit in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity for himself and a contingent beneficiary who is age 71. The retiree dies in October 2018.
(ii)
Application of age-based limitation to contingent beneficiary.
Because the retiree had attained age 78 in the month that included the effective date of the suspension, the age-based limitation on the suspension of benefits for a 78-year-old individual applies to the retiree. The age-based limitation also applies to the contingent beneficiary, even though the contingent beneficiary had not commenced benefits under the plan as of the effective date of the suspension and had not attained age 75 by the end of the month containing the effective date of the suspension.
(iii)
Maximum suspendable benefit.
The contingent beneficiary's amount of guarantee payable by PBGC is based on the benefit the beneficiary would have received from the plan before the suspension ($750). The beneficiary's accrual rate is $26.7857 (calculated by dividing the monthly benefit payment ($750) by years of credited service (28)) and the beneficiary's amount of guarantee payable by PBGC is $639.50 (28 × ($11 + (.75 × $15.7857))). The beneficiary's maximum suspendable benefit is $46.55 (which is equal to the lesser of the amount of reduction that would apply pursuant to the 30% suspension ($225) or the amount of reduction that would be permitted under the guarantee-based limitation ($46.55, which is equal to ($750−1.1 × $639.50)).
(iv)
Applicable percentage.
The applicable percentage for the beneficiary is based on the retiree's age of 78 as of the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension. Accordingly, the applicable percentage for the beneficiary is 40%.
(v)
Age-based limitation.
The beneficiary's maximum suspendable benefit is $46.55 and
the applicable percentage is 40%. Thus, under the age-based limitation, the beneficiary's benefit may not be reduced by more than $18.62 ($46.55 × .40 = $18.62). Therefore, as a result of the retiree's age-based limitation, the suspension of benefits may not reduce the beneficiary's monthly benefit below $731.38 ($750−$18.62 = $731.38).

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 3,
except that on the effective date of the suspension the retiree is age 71 and the retiree's contingent beneficiary is age 77.
(ii)
Application of age-based limitation to contingent beneficiary.
Because the retiree had not reached age 75 as of the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension, the age-based limitation on the suspension of benefits does not apply to the retiree. The age-based limitation also does not apply to the retiree's contingent beneficiary, even though the contingent beneficiary had attained age 77 as of the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension, because the contingent beneficiary had not yet commenced benefits on that date. The beneficiary's post-suspension benefit may not be less than the minimum benefit payable pursuant to the guarantee-based limitation, which is $703.45 ($639.50 × 1.1 = $703.45).

# Example 5.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except that the retiree died in October 2017, prior to the December 1, 2017 effective date of the suspension of benefits. The retiree's beneficiary commenced benefits on November 1, 2017.
(ii)
Application of age-based limitation to contingent beneficiary.
Because the retiree's beneficiary had commenced benefits before the effective date of the suspension and had reached age 75 as of the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension, the age-based limitation applies to the beneficiary based on the beneficiary's age as of the end of the month that includes the effective date of the suspension.
(4)
Disability-based limitation
—(i)
General rule.
Pursuant to the disability-based limitation of this paragraph (d)(4), benefits based on disability (as defined under the plan) may not be suspended.
(ii)
Benefits based on disability
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this section, benefits based on disability means the entire amount paid to a participant pursuant to the participant becoming disabled, without regard to whether a portion of that amount would have been paid if the participant had not become disabled.
(B)
Rule for auxiliary or other temporary disability benefits.
If a participant begins receiving an auxiliary or other temporary disability benefit and the sole reason the participant ceases receiving that benefit is commencement of retirement benefits, then the benefit based on disability after commencement of retirement benefits is the lesser of—
(
1
) The periodic payment the participant was receiving immediately before the participant's retirement benefits commenced; or
(
2
) The periodic payment to the participant of retirement benefits under the plan.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the disability-based limitation on a suspension of benefits under this paragraph (d)(4):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
A participant with a vested accrued benefit of $1,000 per month, payable at age 65, becomes disabled at age 55. The plan applies a reduction to the monthly benefit for early commencement if the participant commences benefits before age 65. For a participant who commences receiving benefits at age 55, the actuarially adjusted early retirement benefit is 60% of the accrued benefit. However, the plan also provides that if a participant becomes entitled to an early retirement benefit on account of disability, as defined in the plan, the benefit is not reduced. On account of a disability, the participant commences an unreduced early retirement benefit of $1,000 per month at age 55 (instead of the $600 monthly benefit the participant would receive if the participant were not disabled). The participant continues to receive $1,000 per month after reaching age 65.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The participant's disability benefit payment of $1,000 per month commencing at age 55 is a benefit based on disability, even though the participant would have received a portion of these benefits at retirement regardless of the disability. Thus, both before and after attaining age 65, the participant's entire monthly payment amount ($1,000) is a benefit based on disability. A suspension of benefits is not permitted to apply to any portion of the participant's benefit at any time.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that the terms of the plan provide that when a disabled participant reaches age 65, the disability pension is discontinued by reason of reaching age 65, and the retirement benefits commence. In this case, the amount of the participant's retirement benefits is the same as the amount that the participant was receiving immediately before commencing retirement benefits, or $1,000.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Before age 65, the participant's disability benefit payment of $1,000 per month commencing at age 55 is a benefit based on disability. After age 65, the periodic retirement benefit of $1,000 per month is a benefit based on disability because it does not exceed the benefit based on disability that the participant was receiving immediately before commencing retirement benefits. Thus, both before and after attaining age 65, the participant's entire monthly payment amount ($1,000) is a benefit based on disability. A suspension of benefits is not permitted to apply to any portion of the participant's benefit at any time.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 2,
except that upon reaching age 65, the participant elects to commence payment of retirement benefits not in the form of a single life annuity payable in the amount of $1,000 per month but instead in the form of an actuarially equivalent joint and survivor annuity payable in the amount of $850 per month.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Before age 65, the participant's benefit based on disability is $1,000 per month. After age 65, the participant's entire retirement benefit of $850 per month is a benefit based on disability because it does not exceed the benefit based on disability that the participant was receiving immediately before commencing retirement benefits. Thus, a suspension of benefits is not permitted to apply to any portion of those benefits at any time.

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
A participant's disability pension is a specified amount unrelated to the participant's accrued benefit. The participant's disability benefit commencing at age 55 is $750 per month. Upon reaching age 65, the participant's disability pension is discontinued by reason of reaching age 65 and the participant elects to receive an accrued benefit payable in the amount of $1,000 per month.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Before age 65, the participant's benefit based on disability is $750 per month. After age 65, the participant's benefit based on disability continues to be $750 per month (even though the participant's payment is $1,000 per month), because the benefit based on disability is the lesser of the periodic disability pension the participant was receiving immediately before retirement benefits commenced ($750) and the periodic payment of retirement benefits to the participant under the plan determined without regard to the suspension ($1,000). Thus, a suspension of benefits is not permitted to reduce the participant's benefit based on disability ($750 per month) at any time.

# Example 5.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 2,
except that when the participant attains age 65, the participant's monthly benefit payment increases from $1,000 to $1,300 as a result of the plan providing additional accruals during the period of disability, as if the participant were not disabled.
(ii)
Conclusion.
As in
Example 2,
before age 65, the participant's benefit payment of $1,000 per month commencing at age 55 is a benefit based on disability. After age 65, the participant's benefit payment of $1,300 per month is a benefit based on disability because the $1,300 is payable based on additional accruals earned pursuant to the participant becoming disabled. Thus, both before and after attaining age 65, the participant's entire monthly payment amount is a benefit based on disability. A suspension of benefits is not permitted to apply to any portion of the participant's benefit at any time.

# Example 6.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 3
of paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, except that the social security level income option is only available to a participant who incurs a disability as defined in the plan.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Before normal retirement age, the participant's benefit payment of $1,600 per month is a benefit based on disability. After normal retirement age, the participant's benefit based on disability is $900, which is the lesser of the $1,600 periodic payment that the participant was receiving immediately before the participant's normal retirement benefit commenced and the participant's $900 periodic payment of retirement benefits determined without regard to the suspension. Thus, a suspension of benefits is not permitted to apply to any portion of those benefits ($1,600 per month before and $900 per month after normal retirement age) at any time.

# Example 7.
(i)
Facts.
A plan applies a reduction to the monthly benefit for early commencement if a participant commences benefits before age 65. The plan also provides that if a participant becomes disabled, as defined in the plan, the benefit that is paid before normal retirement age is not reduced for early retirement. Under the plan, when a disabled participant reaches age 65, the disability pension is discontinued by reason of reaching age 65 and the retirement benefits commence. A participant with a vested accrued benefit of $1,000 per month, payable at age 65, becomes disabled at age 55. On account of the disability, the participant commences benefits at age 55 in the amount of $1,000 per month (instead of the $600 monthly benefit the participant could have received at that age if the participant were not disabled). The participant recovers from the disability at age 60, and the participant's disability benefits cease. At age 60, the participant immediately elects to begin an early retirement benefit of $800.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The participant's disability benefit payment of $1,000 per month commencing at age 55 is a benefit based on disability, even though the participant would have received a portion of these benefits at
retirement regardless of the disability. Because the participant ceased receiving disability benefits on account of the participant no longer being disabled (and not solely on account of commencing retirement benefits), the participant's early retirement benefit of $800 per month that began after the disability benefit ended is not a benefit based on disability.
(5)
Limitation on aggregate size of suspension
—(i)
General rule.
Any suspension of benefits (considered, if applicable, in combination with a partition of the plan under section 4233 of ERISA (partition)) must be at a level that is reasonably estimated to—
(A) Enable the plan to avoid insolvency; and
(B) Not materially exceed the level that is necessary to enable the plan to avoid insolvency.
(ii)
Suspension sufficient to avoid insolvency
—(A)
General rule.
A suspension of benefits (considered, if applicable, in combination with a partition of the plan) will satisfy the requirement that it is at a level that is reasonably estimated to enable the plan to avoid insolvency if—
(
1
) For each plan year throughout an extended period (as described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(C) of this section) beginning on the first day of the plan year that includes the effective date of the suspension, the plan's solvency ratio is projected on a deterministic basis to be at least 1.0;
(
2
) Based on stochastic projections reflecting variance in investment return, the probability that the plan will avoid insolvency throughout the extended period is more than 50 percent; and
(
3
) Unless the plan's projected funded percentage (within the meaning of section 432(j)(2)) at the end of the extended period using the deterministic projection described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section exceeds 100 percent, that projection shows that, during each of the last five plan years of that period, neither the plan's solvency ratio nor its available resources (as defined in section 418E(b)(3)) is projected to decrease.
(B)
Solvency ratio.
For purposes of this section, a plan's solvency ratio for a plan year means the ratio of—
(
1
) The plan's available resources (as defined in section 418E(b)(3)) for the plan year; to
(
2
) The scheduled benefit payments under the plan for the plan year.
(C)
Extended period.
For purposes of this section, an extended period means a period of at least 30 plan years. However, in the case of a temporary suspension of benefits that is scheduled to cease as of a date that is more than 25 years after the effective date, the extended period must be lengthened so that it ends no earlier than five plan years after the cessation of the suspension.
(iii)
Suspension not materially in excess of level necessary to avoid insolvency
—(A)
General rule.
A suspension of benefits will satisfy the requirement under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section that the suspension be at a level that is reasonably estimated to not materially exceed the level necessary for the plan to avoid insolvency only if an alternative, similar but smaller suspension of benefits would not be sufficient to enable the plan to satisfy the requirement to avoid insolvency under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(A) of this section (determined using an extended period that is no shorter than the extended period used to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(5)(i)(A) of this section). The alternative suspension of benefits that is used for this purpose is a suspension of benefits under which, for each participant or beneficiary, the amount of the reduction in the periodic payment (determined after application of the individual limitations) is equal to the amount of the reduction proposed for that participant or beneficiary in the application submitted pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, decreased (but not below zero) by the greater of—
(
1
) Five percent of the amount of the reduction in the periodic payment proposed for that participant or beneficiary; or
(
2
) Two percent of the amount of the participant's or beneficiary's periodic payment determined without regard to the reduction proposed in the application.
(B)
Special rule for partitions.
If PBGC issues an order partitioning the plan,
then a suspension of benefits with respect to the plan will be deemed to satisfy the requirement under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section that the suspension be at a level that is reasonably estimated to not materially exceed the level necessary for the plan to avoid insolvency.
(iv)
Actuarial basis for projections
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (d)(5)(iv) sets forth rules for the actuarial projections that are required under this paragraph (d)(5). The projections must reflect the assumption that the suspension of benefits continues indefinitely (or, if the suspension expires on a specified date by its own terms, until that date).
(B)
Reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods.
Each of the actuarial assumptions and methods used for the actuarial projections that are required under this paragraph (d)(5), and the combination of those actuarial assumptions and methods, must be reasonable, taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations. To be reasonable, the actuarial assumptions and methods must also be appropriate for the purpose of the measurement (this means that factors specific to the measurements must be taken into account). The actuary's selection of assumptions about future covered employment and contribution levels (including contribution base units and average contribution rate) may be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, which must act in good faith in providing the information. In addition, to the extent that an actuarial assumption used for the deterministic projection in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section differs from that used to certify whether the plan is in critical and declining status pursuant to section 432(b)(3)(B)(iv), an explanation of the information and analysis that led to the selection of that different assumption must be provided. Similarly, to the extent that an actuarial assumption used for the stochastic projection in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section differs from that used for the deterministic projection, an explanation of the information and analysis that led to the selection of that different assumption must be provided.
(C)
Initial value of plan assets and cash flow projections.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(D) of this section, the cash flow projections must be based on—
(
1
) The fair market value of plan assets as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date the application is submitted;
(
2
) Projected benefit payments that are consistent with the projected benefit payments under the most recent actuarial valuation; and
(
3
) Appropriate adjustments to projected benefit payments to include benefits for new hires who are reflected in the projected contribution amounts.
(D)
Requirement to reflect significant events.
The projected cash flows relating to contributions, withdrawal liability payments, and benefit payments must also be adjusted to reflect significant events that occurred after the most recent actuarial valuation. Significant events include—
(
1
) A plan merger or transfer;
(
2
) The withdrawal or the addition of employers that changed projected cash flows relating to contributions, withdrawal liability payments, or benefit payments by more than five percent;
(
3
) A plan amendment, a change in a collective bargaining agreement, or a change in a rehabilitation plan that changed projected cash flows relating to contributions, withdrawal liability payments, or benefit payments by more than five percent; or
(
4
) Any other event or trend that resulted in a material change in those projected cash flows.
(v)
Simplified determination for smaller plans.
In the case of a plan that is not large enough to be required to select a retiree representative under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the determination of whether the benefit suspension (or a benefit suspension in combination with a partition of the plan) will satisfy the requirement that it is at a level that is reasonably estimated to enable the plan to avoid insolvency is permitted to be made without regard to paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section.
(vi)
Additional disclosure
—(A)
Disclosure of past experience for critical assumptions.
The application for suspension must include a disclosure of the total contributions, total contribution
base units and average contribution rate, withdrawal liability payments, and the rate of return on plan assets for each of the 10 plan years preceding the plan year in which the application is submitted.
(B)
Sensitivity of results to investment return assumptions.
The application must include deterministic projections of the plan's solvency ratio over the extended period using two alternative assumptions for the plan's rate of return. These alternatives are that the plan's future rate of return will be lower than the assumed rate of return used under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(B) of this section by—
(
1
) One percentage point; and
(
2
) Two percentage points.
(C)
Sensitivity of results to industry level assumptions.
The application must include deterministic projections of the plan's solvency ratio over the extended period using two alternative assumptions for future contribution base units. These alternatives are that future contribution base units—
(
1
) Continue under the same trend as the plan experienced over the past 10 years; and
(
2
) Continue under the trend identified in paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(C)(
1
) of this section reduced by one percentage point.
(D)
Projection of funded percentage.
The application must include an illustration, prepared on a deterministic basis, of the projected value of plan assets, the accrued liability of the plan (calculated using the unit credit funding method), and the funded percentage for each year in the extended period.
(E)
Permitted simplification of certain projections.
It is permissible for the projections described in paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(C) of this section to be made without reflecting any adjustments to the projected benefit payments that result from the alternative assumptions regarding future contribution base units.
(6)
Equitable distribution
—(i)
In general.
Any suspension of benefits must be equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population, taking into account factors, with respect to participants and beneficiaries and their benefits, that may include one or more of the factors described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section. If a suspension of benefits provides for different treatment for different participants and beneficiaries (other than as a result of application of the individual limitations), then the suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population only if—
(A) Under the suspension, the participants and beneficiaries are divided into separate categories or groups that are defined by the consistent treatment of individuals within each separate category or group;
(B) Any difference in treatment under the suspension of benefits among the different categories or groups is based on relevant factors reasonably selected by the plan sponsor, such as the factors described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section; and
(C) Any such difference in treatment is based on a reasonable application of those relevant factors.
(ii)
Factors that may be considered
—(A)
In general.
In accordance with paragraph (d)(6)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, if, under the suspension, there is any difference between the treatment of one category or group of participants and beneficiaries and another category or group of participants and beneficiaries, that difference must be based on a reasonable application of relevant statutory factors described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section and any other factors reasonably selected by the plan sponsor. For example, it would be reasonable for a plan sponsor to conclude that the statutory factor described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section (amount of benefit) is a factor that should be taken into account as justifying a lesser benefit reduction for participants or beneficiaries whose benefits are closer to the level of the PBGC guarantee than for others. In addition, it would be reasonable for a plan sponsor to conclude that the presumed financial vulnerability of certain participants or beneficiaries who are reasonably deemed to be in greater need of protection than other participants or beneficiaries is a factor that should be taken into account as justifying a lesser benefit reduction (as a percentage or
otherwise) for those participants or beneficiaries than for others.
(B)
Statutory factors.
Factors that may be selected as a basis for differences in treatment under a suspension of benefits include, when reasonable under the circumstances, the following statutory factors:
(
1
) The age and life expectancy of the participant or beneficiary;
(
2
) The length of time that benefits have been in pay status;
(
3
) The amount of benefits;
(
4
) The type of benefit, such as survivor benefit, normal retirement benefit, or early retirement benefit;
(
5
) The extent to which a participant or beneficiary is receiving a subsidized benefit;
(
6
) The extent to which a participant or beneficiary has received post-retirement benefit increases;
(
7
) The history of benefit increases and reductions for participants and beneficiaries;
(
8
) The number of years to retirement for active employees;
(
9
) Any differences between active and retiree benefits;
(
10
) The extent to which active participants are reasonably likely to withdraw support for the plan, accelerating employer withdrawals from the plan and increasing the risk of additional benefit reductions for participants in and out of pay status; and
(
11
) The extent to which a participant's or beneficiary's benefits are attributable to service with an employer that failed to pay its full withdrawal liability.
(iii)
Reasonable application of factors.
An application of a factor referred to in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section is unreasonable if it is inconsistent with the protections provided by the individual limitations described in paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(4) of this section. For example, it would constitute an unreasonable application of the factor described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section (amount of benefit) if that factor were used to justify a larger suspension for participants whose benefits are closer to the guarantee-based limitation. Similarly, it would constitute an unreasonable application of the factors described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (age and life expectancy of the participant or beneficiary) if those factors were used to justify a greater suspension for older participants.
(iv)
Special rule for identification of categories or groups
—(A)
New post-suspension benefit formula.
This paragraph (d)(6)(iv) applies in the case of a proposed suspension of benefits under which an individual's benefits after suspension are calculated under a new benefit formula (rather than by reference to the individual's benefits before suspension). In this case, the evaluation of whether the proposed suspension is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population is based on a comparison of an individual's pre-suspension benefit to the individual's post-suspension benefit (determined without regard to the application of the individual limitations). Accordingly, all individuals whose pre-suspension benefits are determined under a uniform pre-suspension benefit formula and whose post-suspension benefits are determined under a different uniform post-suspension benefit formula are treated as a single group.
(B)
Blended pre-suspension benefit formula.
If a plan applies different pre-suspension benefit formulas with respect to different plan years, then all individuals to whom more than one such formula applied may be treated as having a uniform pre-suspension benefit formula for purposes of paragraph (d)(6)(iv)(A) of this section (even though those individuals have different proportions of their pre-suspension benefits calculated under the different benefit formulas).
(C)
Changes in early retirement factors.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(6)(iv)(A) of this section, two individuals are not treated as having different pre-suspension or post-suspension benefit formulas merely because, as a result of the application of a uniform set of early retirement factors, their benefits differ because of retirement at different ages.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules on equitable distribution of a suspension of benefits of this paragraph (d)(6). As a simplifying assumption for purposes of these examples, it is assumed that the facts of each example describe all of the factors
that are included in the application discussed in the example (provided, however, that, in the case of a plan described in section 432(e)(9)(D)(vii), the examples are not intended to illustrate the application of section 432(e)(9)(D)(vii) or its effect on the analysis or conclusions in the examples).

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits on March 15, 2017. Under the plan terms applicable prior to the suspension, one group of participants benefitted only under Benefit Formula A and the remaining participants benefitted only under Benefit Formula B. Each of these benefit formulas is uniform. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, benefits for all participants are reduced so that a uniform post-suspension benefit formula (Benefit Formula C) applies to all participants.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because the reduction in benefits under the suspension formula is different for participants who benefitted only under Benefit Formula A than for participants who benefitted only under Benefit Formula B, the suspension of benefits provides for different treatment for different participants and beneficiaries (other than as a result of application of the individual limitations). In addition, the suspension of benefits provides for consistent treatment of participants within the following two categories: (1) Participants who benefitted only under Benefit Formula A; and (2) participants who benefitted only under Benefit Formula B. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (d)(6)(iv)(A) of this section, these two categories of participants are each treated as a single group for purposes of evaluating whether the proposed suspension is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population. In order to demonstrate that the distribution of the suspension satisfies the equitable distribution requirement, the plan sponsor must reasonably select and apply factors that are the basis for the different treatment of these two groups of participants.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the plan terms applicable prior to the suspension did not provide for different benefit formulas for different groups of participants at any given time. Instead, the plan terms provided that different uniform benefit formulas applied for service prior to January 1, 2000, and for service on or after January 1, 2000.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The reduction in benefits under the suspension formula is different for participants who had service only prior to January 1, 2000, participants who had service only after January 1, 2000, and participants who had service during both of those periods. The suspension of benefits provides for different treatment for different participants and beneficiaries (other than as a result of application of the individual limitations). In addition, the suspension of benefits provides for consistent treatment of participants within the following three categories of participants: (1) Participants whose entire service was prior to January 1, 2000, (2) participants whose entire service was on or after January 1, 2000, and (3) participants who have some service before January 1, 2000 and some service on or after January 1, 2000. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (d)(6)(iv)(A) of this section, the two categories of participants whose entire service was either before or on or after January 1, 2000 are each treated as a single group for purposes of evaluating whether the proposed suspension is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (d)(6)(iv)(B) of this section, the category of participants with some service before January 1, 2000 and some service on or after January 1, 2000 is treated as a single group for purposes of this evaluation. In order to demonstrate that the distribution of the suspension satisfies the equitable distribution requirement, the plan sponsor must reasonably select and apply factors that are the basis for the different treatment of these three categories of participants.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, benefits for all participants and beneficiaries are reduced by the same percentage, and the suspension application indicates the rationale for this reduction.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations.

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the age-based and disability-based limitations of section 432(e)(9)(D)(ii) and (iii), the portion of each participant's and beneficiary's benefit that exceeds the guarantee-based limitation of section 432(e)(9)(D)(i) is reduced by the same percentage, and the suspension application indicates the rationale for this reduction.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations. The result would be the same if, instead, the suspension of benefits applies only to benefits that exceed a multiple (in excess of 100%) of the guarantee-based limitation.

# Example 5.
(i)
Facts.
A plan was previously amended to provide an ad hoc 15% increase to the benefits of all participants and beneficiaries (including participants who, at the time, were no longer earning service under
the plan, which therefore included retirees and deferred vested participants). The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, benefits for all participants and beneficiaries who were no longer earning service under the plan at the time of the ad hoc amendment are reduced by eliminating the amendment for those individuals. The suspension application indicates why the benefit reduction is based on the statutory factors in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(
6
) of this section (the extent to which a participant or beneficiary has received post-retirement benefit increases), including application of the reduction to those who, at the time of the previous benefit increase, were either retired participants or deferred vested participants, and in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(
7
) of this section (the history of benefit increases and reductions), and why it is reasonable to apply the factors in this manner.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations. This is because the difference in treatment between the two groups of participants is based on whether a participant has received post-retirement benefit increases (in this case, whether a participant was earning service under the plan at the time of the benefit increase amendment), which under these facts is a relevant factor that may be reasonably selected by the plan sponsor, and the difference in treatment between the two groups of participants (eliminating the amendment only for benefits with respect to participants who were no longer earning service at the time of the amendment) is based on a reasonable application of that factor.

# Example 6.
(i)
Facts.
A plan contains a provision that provides a “thirteenth check” in plan years for which the investment return is greater than 7% (which was the assumed rate of return under the plan's actuarial valuation). The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, benefits for all participants and beneficiaries are reduced by eliminating the “thirteenth check” for all of those individuals. The suspension application indicates why the benefit reduction is based on the statutory factors in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(
6
) of this section (the extent to which a participant or beneficiary has received post-retirement benefit increases) and in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(
7
) of this section (the history of benefit increases and reductions), and why it is reasonable to apply the factors in this manner.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations.

# Example 7.
(i)
Facts.
A plan was previously amended to reduce future accruals from $60 per year of service to $50 per year of service. The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, the accrued benefits for all participants and beneficiaries are reduced to $50 per year of service (and the plan's generally applicable adjustments for early retirement and form of benefit apply). The suspension application indicates why the benefit reduction is based on the statutory factor in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(
7
) of this section (the history of benefit increases and reductions), and why it is reasonable to apply the factors in this manner.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations. This is because the difference in treatment among the different groups of participants is based on the history of benefit reductions and a discrepancy between active and retiree benefits, which under these facts are relevant factors that may be reasonably selected by the plan sponsor, and the difference in treatment between the three groups of participants (reducing the $60 benefit multiplier to $50 per year of service for two groups of participants—those who had accrued all of their benefits under the $60 multiplier and those who had accrued some of their benefits under the $60 multiplier—and not reducing benefits for the group of participants who had accrued all of their benefits under the $50 multiplier) is based on a reasonable application of those factors.

# Example 8.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 7,
except that no plan amendments have previously reduced future accruals or other benefits for active participants. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, benefits for deferred vested participants, retirees, and beneficiaries who have commenced benefits are reduced, but no reduction applies to active participants. The suspension of benefits is not accompanied by any reductions in future accruals or other benefits for active participants.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is not equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations. This is because, under these facts, no relevant factor (such as a previous reduction in benefits applicable only to active participants) has been reasonably selected by the plan sponsor to justify the proposed difference in treatment among the categories.

# Example 9.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 8,
except that the suspension of benefits provides for a reduction that applies to both active and inactive participants. However, the reduction that applies to active participants is smaller than the reduction that applies to inactive participants because
the plan sponsor concludes, as explained and supported in the application for suspension, that active participants are reasonably likely to withdraw support for the plan if any larger reduction is applied.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations. This is because the difference in treatment between the different groups of participants is based on the extent to which active participants are reasonably likely to withdraw support for the plan, which under these facts is a relevant factor that may reasonably be selected by the plan sponsor, and the difference in treatment between the two groups of participants (applying a greater suspension to inactive than to active participants) is based on a reasonable application of that factor.

# Example 10.
(i)
Facts.
The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, the benefits for participants and beneficiaries attributable to service with an employer that failed to pay its full withdrawal liability are reduced by 50%. As indicated in the suspension application, the present value of the benefit reduction with respect to the former employees of one such employer is significantly greater than the unpaid withdrawal liability for that employer. Benefits for participants and beneficiaries attributable to service with all other employers are reduced by 10%.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is not equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations. This is because, although the difference in treatment between the different groups of participants is based on a relevant factor that may reasonably be selected by the plan sponsor, the difference in treatment between the groups of participants is not based on a reasonable application of that factor.

# Example 11.
(i)
Facts.
The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, the benefits for all participants and beneficiaries are reduced by the same percentage, except that the fbenefits for employees and former employees of a particular employer that is actively represented on the plan's Board of Trustees are reduced by a specified lesser percentage.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is not equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations. This is because, under these facts, no relevant factor has been reasonably selected by the plan sponsor to justify the difference in treatment between the two groups of participants.

# Example 12.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 11,
except that the particular employer whose employees and former employees are subject to the lesser benefit reduction is the union that also participates in the plan.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is not equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations. This is because, under these facts, no relevant factor has been reasonably selected by the plan sponsor to justify the difference in treatment between the two groups of participants.

# Example 13.
(i)
Facts.
The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, the monthly benefit of all participants and beneficiaries is reduced to 110% of the monthly benefit that is guaranteed by PBGC under section 4022A of ERISA. As indicated in the suspension application, this is because the plan sponsor is applying to PBGC for a partition of the plan, which requires the plan sponsor to have implemented the maximum benefit suspensions under section 432(e)(9).
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations.

# Example 14.
(i)
Facts.
The plan sponsor applies for approval of a suspension of benefits. Under the suspension of benefits, subject to the individual limitations on benefit suspensions, benefits for all participants and beneficiaries are reduced by the same percentage, except that the protection for benefits based on disability goes beyond the required disability-based limitations and also includes payments to a beneficiary of a participant who had been receiving benefits based on disability at the time of death. The suspension application indicates the rationale for this protection from reduction.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations because this suspension design is a reasonable application of the statutory factor in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section (type of benefit).

# Example 15.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that the plan does not provide for benefits based on disability. Under the suspension of benefits, less of a reduction is applied to a participant who has become disabled within the meaning of title II of the Social Security Act than to otherwise similarly situated participants and the suspension application indicates the rationale for this reduction.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The suspension of benefits is equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary populations because a participant's disability within the meaning of title II of the Social Security Act is a factor that can reasonably be taken into account in designing a suspension of benefits
and applying less of a reduction to an individual in this group is a reasonable application of that factor.
(7)
Effective date of suspension made in combination with partition.
In any case in which a suspension of benefits with respect to a plan is made in combination with a partition of the plan, the suspension of benefits may not take effect prior to the effective date of the partition. This requirement will not be satisfied if the partition order under section 4233 of ERISA has not been provided to the Secretary of the Treasury by the last day of the 225-day period described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a conditional approval by PBGC (within the meaning of 29 CFR 4233.12(c)) of a partition application that is conditioned only on the Secretary's issuing a final authorization to suspend is treated as a partition order.
(8)
Additional rules for plans described in section 432(e)(9)(D)(vii)
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a plan that includes the benefits described in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C) of this section, any suspension of benefits under this section shall—
(A) First, be applied to the maximum extent permissible to benefits attributable to a participant's service for an employer that withdrew from the plan and failed to pay (or is delinquent with respect to paying) the full amount of its withdrawal liability under section 4201(b)(1) of ERISA or an agreement with the plan;
(B) Second, except as provided by paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C) of this section, be applied to all other benefits that may be suspended under this section; and
(C) Third, be applied to benefits under a plan that are directly attributable to a participant's service with any employer that has, prior to December 16, 2014—

) Withdrawn from the plan in a complete withdrawal under section 4203 of ERISA and paid the full amount of the employer's withdrawal liability under section 4201(b)(1) of ERISA or an agreement with the plan; and
(
2
) Pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, assumed liability for providing benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the plan under a separate, single-employer plan sponsored by the employer, in an amount equal to any amount of benefits for such participants and beneficiaries reduced as a result of the financial status of the plan.
(ii)
Application of suspensions to benefits that are directly attributable to a participant's service with certain employers
—(A)
Greater reduction in certain benefits not permitted.
A suspension of benefits under this section must not be applied to provide for a greater reduction in benefits described in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C) of this section than the reduction that is applied to benefits described in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(B) of this section. The requirement in the preceding sentence is satisfied if no individual's benefits that are directly attributable to service with an employer described in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C) of this section are reduced more than that individual's benefits would have been reduced if, holding the benefit formula, work history, and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits constant, those benefits were attributable to service with an employer that is not described in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C) of this section.
(B)
Application of limitation to benefits of participants with respect to which the employer has not assumed liability.
Benefits described in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C) of this section include all benefits of a participant or beneficiary that are directly attributable to service with an employer described in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C) of this section without regard to whether the employer has assumed liability for providing benefits to that participant or beneficiary that are reduced as a result of the financial status of the plan as described in paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section. Thus, the rule of paragraph (d)(8)(ii)(A) of this section limits the amount by which a suspension of benefits is permitted to reduce benefits under a plan that are directly attributable to a participant's service with such an employer, even if the employer has not, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(8)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section, assumed liability with respect to that participant's benefits.
(e)
Benefit improvements
—(1)
Limitations on benefit improvements.
This paragraph (e) sets forth rules for the application of section 432(e)(9)(E). A plan satisfies the criteria in section 432(e)(9)(E) only if, during the period that any suspension of benefits remains in effect, the plan sponsor does not implement any benefit improvement with respect to the plan except as provided in this paragraph (e). Paragraph (e)(2) of this section describes limitations on a benefit improvement for participants and beneficiaries who are not yet in pay status. Paragraph (e)(3) of this section describes limitations on a benefit improvement for participants and beneficiaries who are in pay status. Paragraph (e)(4) of this section provides that the limitations of this paragraph (e) generally apply in addition to other limitations on benefit increases that apply to a plan. Paragraph (e)(5) of this section defines benefit improvement.
(2)
Limitations on benefit improvements for those not in pay status
—(i)
Equitable distribution for those in pay status and solvency projection.
During the period that any suspension of benefits under a plan remains in effect, the plan sponsor may not increase the liabilities of the plan by reason of any benefit improvement for any participant or beneficiary who was not in pay status by the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement takes effect, unless—
(A) The present value of the total liabilities for a benefit improvement for participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement dates were before the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement takes effect is not less than the present value of the total liabilities for a benefit improvement for participants and beneficiaries who were not in pay status by that date;
(B) The plan sponsor equitably distributes the benefit improvement among the participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement dates were before the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvement is proposed to take effect; and
(C) The plan actuary certifies that after taking into account the benefit improvement, the plan is projected to avoid insolvency indefinitely.
(ii)
Rules of application
—(A)
Present value determination
—(
1
)
Actuarial assumptions and methods.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the present value of the total liabilities for a benefit improvement is the present value as of the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvement is proposed to take effect. The actuarial assumptions and methods used for the calculation for present values and the actuarial projections that are required under this paragraph (e)(2) must each be reasonable, and the combination of the actuarial assumptions and methods must be reasonable, taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations.
(
2
)
Increase in future accrual rate.
In the case of a benefit improvement that is an increase in the rate of future accrual, the present value determined under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section must take into account the increase in accruals for participants and beneficiaries not yet in pay status for all future years.
(B)
Factors relevant to equitable distribution.
The evaluation of whether a benefit improvement is equitably distributed for purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section must take into account the relevant factors described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section and the extent to which the benefits of the participants and beneficiaries were suspended.
(C)
Actuarial certification.
The certification in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C) of this section must be made using the standards described in paragraphs (d)(5)(ii), (iv), and (v) of this section, substituting the plan year that includes the effective date of the benefit improvement for the plan year that includes the effective date of the suspension.
(iii)
Special rule for certain benefit increases.
The limitations of this paragraph (e) do not apply to a resumption of suspended benefits or plan amendment that increases liabilities with respect to participants and beneficiaries not in pay status by the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvement took effect that—
(A) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, determines to be reasonable and which provides for only
de minimis
increases in the liabilities of the plan; or
(B) Is required as a condition of qualification under section 401 or to comply with other applicable law, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(3)
Limitation on resumption of suspended benefits only for those in pay status.
The plan sponsor may increase liabilities of the plan by eliminating some or all of the suspension that applies solely to participants and beneficiaries in pay status at the time of the resumption, provided that the plan sponsor equitably distributes the value of those resumed benefits among participants and beneficiaries in pay status, taking into account the relevant factors described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. A resumption of benefits that is described in this paragraph (e)(3) is not subject to the limitations on a benefit improvement under section 432(f) (relating to restrictions on benefit increases for plans in critical status).
(4)
Additional limitations.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the limitations on a benefit improvement under this paragraph (e) are in addition to the limitations in section 432(f) and any other applicable limitations on increases in benefits imposed on a plan.
(5)
Definition of benefit improvement
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term benefit improvement means, with respect to a plan, a resumption of suspended benefits, an increase in benefits, an increase in the rate at which benefits accrue, or an increase in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable, under the plan.
(ii)
Effect of expiration of suspension.
In the case of a suspension of benefits that expires as of a date that is specified in the plan amendment implementing the suspension, the resumption of benefits solely from the expiration of that period is not treated as a benefit improvement.
(f)
Notice requirements
—(1)
In general.
No suspension of benefits may be made pursuant to this section unless notice of the proposed suspension has been given by the plan sponsor to—
(i) All participants, beneficiaries of deceased participants, and alternate payees under the plan (regardless of whether their benefits are proposed to be suspended), except those who cannot be contacted by reasonable efforts;
(ii) Each employer who has an obligation to contribute (within the meaning of section 4212(a) of ERISA) under the plan; and
(iii) Each employee organization which, for purposes of collective bargaining, represents plan participants employed by an employer described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.

(ii)
Description of suspension of benefits.
The notice described under paragraph (f)(1) of this section will not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section unless it includes the following—
(A) To the extent that it is not possible to provide an individualized estimate on an annual or monthly basis of the quantitative effect of the suspension on a participant or beneficiary, such as in the case of a suspension that affects the payment of any future cost-of-living adjustment, that effect may be reflected in a narrative description;
(B) A statement that the plan sponsor has determined that the plan will become insolvent unless the proposed suspension takes effect, and the year in which insolvency is projected to occur without a suspension of benefits;
(C) A statement that insolvency of the plan could result in benefits lower than benefits paid under the proposed suspension and a description of the projected benefit payments upon insolvency;
(D) A description of the proposed suspension and its effect, including a description of the different categories or groups affected by the suspension, how those categories or groups are defined, and the formula that is used to calculate the amount of the proposed suspension for individuals in each category or group;

(F) A description of whether the suspension will remain in effect indefinitely, or the date the suspension expires if it expires by its own terms; and
(G) A statement describing the right to vote on the suspension application.
(iii)
Readability requirement.
A notice given under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be written in a manner so as to be understood by the average plan participant.
(iv)

The Secretary of the Treasury will provide a model notice. The use of the model notice will satisfy the content and readability requirements of this paragraph (f)(2) with respect to the language provided in the model.
(3)
Form and manner
—(i)
Timing
—(A)
In general.
A notice under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be given no earlier than four business days before the date on which an application is submitted and no later than two business days after the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the plan sponsor that it has submitted a complete application, as described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.
(B)
Timing for lost participants.
If additional individuals who are entitled to notice are located after the time period in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A) of this section has elapsed, then the plan sponsor must give notice to these individuals as soon as practicable thereafter.
(ii)
Method of delivery of notice
—(A)
Written or electronic delivery.
A notice given under paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be provided in writing. It may also be provided in electronic form to the extent that the form is reasonably accessible to persons to whom the notice is required to be provided. Permissible electronic methods include those permitted under regulations of the Department of Labor at 29 CFR 2520.104b-1(c) and those described at § 54.4980F-1, Q

A notice given under paragraph (f)(1) of this section is permitted to include information in addition to the information that is required under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, including, if applicable, information relating to an application for partition under section 4233 of ERISA (such as the model notice at Appendix A of 29 CFR part 4233), provided that the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section are satisfied.
(iv)
No false or misleading information.
A notice given under paragraph (f)(1) of this section may not include false or misleading information (or omit information in a manner that causes the information provided to be misleading).
(4)
Other notice requirement.
Any notice given under paragraph (f)(1) of this section satisfies the requirement for notice of a significant reduction in benefits described in section 4980F that would otherwise be required as a result of that suspension of benefits. To the extent that there are other reductions that accompany a suspension of benefits, such as a reduction in the future accrual rate described in section 4980F for active participants or a reduction in adjustable benefits under section
432(e)(8), notice that satisfies the requirements (including the applicable timing requirements) of section 4980F or section 432(e)(8), as applicable, must be provided.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the requirement in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section to give notice to all participants, beneficiaries of deceased participants, and alternate payees, except those who cannot be contacted by reasonable efforts.

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
A plan sponsor distributes notice of a proposed suspension of benefits to plan participants, beneficiaries of deceased participants, and alternate payees by mailing the notice to their last known mailing addresses, using the same information that it used to send the most recent annual funding notice. Of 5,000 such notices, 300 were returned as undeliverable. The plan sponsor takes no additional steps to contact the individuals for whom the notice was returned as undeliverable.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The plan sponsor did not make any effort beyond the initial mailing to locate the 300 individuals for whom the notice was returned as undeliverable. Therefore, the plan sponsor did not satisfy the requirement to provide notice to all participants, beneficiaries of deceased participants, and alternate payees under the plan (regardless of whether their benefits are proposed to be suspended), except those who cannot be contacted by reasonable efforts.

# Example 2.—
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 1,
but the plan sponsor contacts the bargaining parties for the plan and the plan administrators of any other employee benefit plans that the plan sponsor reasonably believes may have information useful for locating the missing individuals, and the plan sponsor requests contact information for the missing individuals. The plan sponsor then uses an Internet search tool, a credit reporting agency, and a commercial locator service to search for individuals for whom it was not able to obtain updated information from bargaining parties. Through these efforts, the plan sponsor locates the updated addresses of 250 of the 300 individuals whom it previously failed to contact. The plan sponsor mails notices to those individuals within one week of locating them.
(ii)
Conclusion.
By using effective search methods to find the previously missing individuals and promptly mailing the notice of suspension to them, the plan sponsor has satisfied the requirement to provide notice to all participants, beneficiaries of deceased participants, and alternate payees under the plan (regardless of whether their benefits are proposed to be suspended), except those who cannot be contacted by reasonable efforts.
(g)
Approval or denial of an application for suspension of benefits
—(1)
Application
—(i)
In general.
The plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status for a plan year that seeks to suspend benefits must submit an application for approval of the proposed suspension of benefits to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, will approve a complete application described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section upon finding that—
(A) The plan is eligible for the proposed suspension described in the application;
(B) The plan actuary and plan sponsor satisfy the requirements of section 432(e)(9)(C) in accordance with the rules of paragraph (c) of this section;
(C) The design of the proposed suspension described in the application satisfies the criteria of section 432(e)(9)(D) in accordance with the rules of paragraphs (d) of this section; and
(D) The plan sponsor satisfies the requirements of section 432(e)(9)(E) and (F) in accordance with the rules of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
(ii)
Complete application.
After receiving a submission, the plan sponsor will be notified within two business days whether the submission constitutes a complete application. A complete application will be treated as submitted on the date that it was originally submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury. If a submission is incomplete, the notification will inform the plan sponsor of the information that is needed to complete the submission and give the plan sponsor a reasonable opportunity to submit a complete application. In such a case, the complete application will be treated as submitted on the date on which the additional information needed to complete the application is submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury.
(iii)
Submission of application.
An application described in this paragraph (g)(1) must be submitted electronically in a searchable format.
(iv)
Requirements for application.
Additional guidance that may be necessary or appropriate with respect to applications described in this paragraph (g)(1),
including procedures for submitting applications and the information required to be included in a complete application, may be published in the form of revenue procedures, notices, or other guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(v)
Requirement to provide adequate time to process application
—(A)
General rule.
An application for suspension that is not submitted in combination with an application to PBGC for a plan partition under section 4233 of ERISA generally will not be accepted unless the proposed effective date of the suspension is at least nine months from the date on which the application is submitted.
(B)
Earlier effective date in appropriate circumstances.
Nothwithstanding paragraph (g)(1)(v)(A) of this section, in appropriate circumstances the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, may permit a proposed suspension to have an earlier effective date.
(vi)
Plan sponsors that also apply for partition.
See part 4233 of the PBGC regulations for a coordinated application process that applies in the case of a plan sponsor that is submitting an application for suspension in combination with an application to PBGC for a plan partition under section 4233 of ERISA.
(2)
Solicitation of comments
—(i)
In general.
Not later than 30 days after receipt of a complete application described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section—
(A) The application for approval of the suspension of benefits will be published on the Web site of the Department of the Treasury; and
(B) The Secretary of the Treasury will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
soliciting comments from contributing employers, employee organizations, and participants and beneficiaries of the plan for which an application was made, and other interested parties.
(ii)
Public comments.
The notice described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section will generally request that comments be submitted no later than 45 days after publication of that notice in the
Federal Register,
but the notice may specify a different deadline for comments in appropriate circumstances. Comments received in response to this notice will be made publicly available.
(3)
Special rules in the case of revision to proposed suspension
—(i)
Resubmission review available in certain circumstances.
The Secretary of the Treasury (in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor) has the discretion, in appropriate circumstances, to permit the plan sponsor to submit a revision of a proposed suspension that had been withdrawn for resubmission review. With respect to an application that is accepted for resubmission review—
(A) The rules of paragraph (g)(1)(v)(B) of this section will apply;
(B) The limitations of paragraph (d) of this section with respect to the revised proposed suspension may be applied using the same actuarial data (including the same fair market value of the plan assets) as was used in the initial application;
(C) The revision to the proposed suspension will be published, and comments solicited, in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section; and
(D) The plan sponsor must provide notice of the revised proposed suspension in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Requirement to provide updated notice to affected participants
—(A)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a plan sponsor that revises a proposed suspension in accordance with this paragraph (g)(3) must provide notice of the suspension in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f) of this section.
(B)
Treatment of participants who are not affected by the revision.
If the revision to the proposed suspension changes neither the amount of the suspension as initially proposed nor the effective date of the proposed suspension for an affected individual, then the Secretary of the Treasury (in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor) may permit the plan sponsor to provide a simplified version of the notice of the suspension to that individual. For this purpose, the effective date of a suspension is determined without taking into account the second
sentence of paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(C) of this section.
(4)
Approval or denial
—(i)
Deemed approval.
A complete application described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section will be deemed approved unless, within 225 days following the date that the complete application is submitted, the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the plan sponsor that its application does not satisfy one or more of the requirements described in this paragraph (g).
(ii)
Notice of denial.
If the Secretary of the Treasury denies a plan sponsor's application, the notification of the denial will detail the specific reasons for the denial, including reference to the specific requirement not satisfied.
(iii)
Special rules for systemically important plans.
If the Secretary of the Treasury approves a plan sponsor's application and the Secretary expects that the plan is or may be a systemically important plan (as defined in paragraph (h)(5)(iv) of this section), the Secretary will so notify the plan sponsor. In that case, and in the event of a vote to reject the suspension (as described in paragraph (h)(4) of this section), the plan sponsor may be required to supply individual participant data and any actuarial analyses that the Secretary may request, in order to assist the Secretary in determining whether to permit the implementation of the suspension that was approved by the Secretary but rejected by a majority of the eligible voters or the implementation of a modification of that suspension.
(iv)
Agreement to stay 225-day period.
The Secretary of the Treasury and the plan sponsor may mutually agree in writing to stay the 225-day period described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.
(5)
Consideration of certain factors.
In evaluating whether the plan sponsor has satisfied the requirement of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, will review the plan sponsor's consideration of each of the factors under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (and any other factor that the plan sponsor considered).
(6)
Standard for accepting plan sponsor determinations.
In evaluating the plan sponsor's application, the Secretary of the Treasury will accept the plan sponsor's determinations in paragraph (c)(3) of this section unless the Secretary concludes, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, that the determinations were clearly erroneous.
(7)
Plan sponsor certifications with respect to plan amendments.
The plan sponsor will not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) and (D) of this section unless the plan sponsor certifies that if the plan sponsor receives final authorization to suspend as described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section with respect to the proposed benefit suspension (or, in the case of a systemically important plan, a proposed or modified benefit suspension), the plan sponsor chooses to implement the suspension, and the plan sponsor adopts the amendment described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, then it will timely amend the plan to provide that—
(i) If the plan sponsor fails to make the annual determinations under section 432(e)(9)(C)(ii), then the suspension of benefits will cease as of the first day of the first plan year following the plan year in which the plan sponsor fails to make the annual plan sponsor determinations in paragraph (c)(4) of this section; and
(ii) Any future benefit improvement must satisfy the requirements of section 432(e)(9)(E).
(8)
Special Master.
The Secretary of the Treasury may appoint a Special Master for purposes of this section. If a Special Master is appointed, the Special Master will coordinate the implementation of this section and the review of applications for the suspension of benefits and other appropriate documents, and will provide recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to decisions required under this section.
(h)
Participant vote on proposed benefit reduction
—(1)
Requirement for vote
—(i)
In general.
If an application for suspension is approved under paragraph (g) of this section, then the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, will administer a vote as described in section
432(e)(9)(H) and this paragraph (h). A suspension of benefits may not take effect before the vote and may only take effect after a final authorization to suspend benefits under paragraph (h)(6) of this section.
(ii)
Communication by plan sponsor.
The plan sponsor must take reasonable steps to inform eligible voters about the proposed suspension. This includes all eligible voters who may be contacted by reasonable efforts in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Any eligible voter whom the plan sponsor has been able to locate through these means (or who has otherwise been located by the plan sponsor) must be—
(A) Included on the voting roster described in paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this section; and
(B) Sent a ballot described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

(B)
Voting roster.
The voting roster includes those eligible voters to whom the notices described in paragraph (f) of this section were sent. If there is a plan participant or beneficiary who did not receive a notice but who is subsequently located by the plan sponsor, that individual must be included on the roster. Similarly, if an individual becomes a plan participant after the date the notices were sent, then the individual must be included on the roster. If a plan sponsor learns after the date the notices described in paragraph (f) of this section were sent that an eligible voter has died, then that deceased individual must not be included on the roster (but if that participant has a beneficiary entitled to benefits under the plan, the beneficiary must be added to the roster).
(2)

Voting period.
The voting period is the period during which a vote received from an eligible voter will be counted. The voting period begins on the ballot distribution date. The voting period generally remains open until the 30th day following the date the Secretary of the Treasury has approved an application for a suspension of benefits under paragraph (g) of this section. However, the voting period will not close earlier than 21 days after the ballot distribution date. In addition, the Secretary (in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor) may specify a later date to end the voting period in appropriate circumstances.
(B)
Automated voting system must be provided.
An automated voting system
that meets the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(C) of this section must be made available to voters for casting their votes. In appropriate circumstances, the Secretary may, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, allow voters to cast votes by mail in lieu of using the automated voting system.
(C)
Automated voting system.
An automated voting system meets the requirements of this paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(C) only if the system—
(
1
) Collects votes cast by eligible voters both electronically (through a Web site) and telephonically (through a toll-free number allowing voters to cast their votes using both a touch-tone voting system and an interactive voice response system); and
(
2
) Accepts only votes cast during the voting period by an eligible voter who provides the eligible voter's identification code described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section.
(D)
Policies and procedures.
The Secretary of the Treasury (in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor) may establish such policies and procedures as may be necessary to facilitate the administration of the vote under this paragraph (h)(2). These policies and procedures may include, but are not limited to, establishing a process for an eligible voter to challenge the vote.
(v)
Determination of whether a majority of the eligible voters has voted to reject the suspension.
Within 7 calendar days after the end of the voting period, the Secretary of the Treasury (in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor) will—
(A) Certify that a majority of all eligible voters has voted to reject the suspension that was approved under paragraph (g) of this section, or
(B) Issue a final authorization to suspend as described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.
(3)
Ballots
—(i)
In general.
The plan sponsor must provide a ballot for the vote that includes the following—
(A) A description of the proposed suspension and its effect, including the effect of the suspension on each category or group of individuals affected by the suspension and the extent to which they are affected;
(B) A description of the factors considered by the plan sponsor in designing the benefit suspension, including but not limited to the factors in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section;
(C) A description of whether the suspension will remain in effect indefinitely or will expire by its own terms (and, if it will expire by its own terms, when that will occur);
(D) A statement from the plan sponsor in support of the proposed suspension;
(E) A statement in opposition to the proposed suspension compiled from comments received pursuant to the solicitation of comments pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section;
(F) A statement that the proposed suspension has been approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor;
(G) A statement that the plan sponsor has determined that the plan will become insolvent unless the proposed suspension takes effect (including the year in which insolvency is projected to occur without a suspension of benefits), and an accompanying statement that this determination is subject to uncertainty;
(H) A statement that insolvency of the plan could result in benefits lower than benefits paid under the proposed suspension and a description of the projected benefit payments in the event of plan insolvency;
(I) A statement that insolvency of PBGC would result in benefits lower than benefits otherwise paid in the case of plan insolvency;
(J) A statement that the plan's actuary has certified that the plan is projected to avoid insolvency, taking into account the proposed suspension of benefits (and, if applicable, a proposed partition of the plan), and an accompanying statement that the actuary's projection is subject to uncertainty;
(K) A statement that the suspension will go into effect unless a majority of all eligible voters vote to reject the suspension and that, therefore, a failure to vote has the same effect on the outcome of the vote as a vote in favor of the suspension;
(L) A copy of the individualized estimate described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)
of this section (or, if that individualized estimate is no longer accurate, a corrected version of that estimate); and
(M) A description of the voting procedures, including the deadline for voting.
(ii)
Additional rules
—(A)
Readability requirement.
A ballot provided under section 432(e)(9)(H)(iii), in accordance with the rules of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, must be written in a manner that is readily understandable by the average plan participant.
(B)
No false or misleading information.
A ballot provided under section 432(e)(9)(H)(iii), in accordance with the rules of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, may not include false or misleading information (or omit information in a manner that causes the information provided to be misleading).
(iii)
Ballot must be approved.
Any ballot provided under section 432(e)(9)(H)(iii), in accordance with the rules of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, must be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, before it is provided.
(iv)
Statement in opposition to the proposed suspension.
The statement in opposition to the proposed suspension that is prepared from comments received on the application, as required under section 432(e)(9)(H)(iii)(II), will be compiled by the Secretary of Labor and will be written in accordance with the rules of paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section. If no comments in opposition are received, the statement in opposition to the proposed suspension will include a statement indicating that there were no such comments.
(v)
Model ballot.
Model language for use in the ballot may be published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(4)
Implementing suspension following vote
—(i)
In general.
Unless a majority of all eligible voters vote to reject the suspension that was approved under paragraph (g) of this section, the suspension will be permitted to take effect. If a majority of all eligible voters vote to reject the suspension that was approved under paragraph (g) of this section, a suspension of benefits will not be permitted to take effect except as provided under paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of this section relating to the implementation of a suspension for a systemically important plan (as defined in paragraph (h)(5)(iv) of this section).
(ii)
Effect of not sending ballot.
Any eligible voters to whom ballots have not been provided (because the individuals could not be located) will be treated as voting to reject the suspension at the same rate (in other words, in the same percentage) as those to whom ballots have been provided.
(5)
Systemically important plans
—(i)
In general.
If a majority of all eligible voters vote to reject the suspension that was approved under paragraph (g) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury will consult with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor to determine if the plan is a systemically important plan. This determination will be made no later than 14 days after the results of the vote are certified.
(ii)
Recommendations from Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate.
If the plan is determined to be a systemically important plan, then, no later than 44 days after the results of the vote are certified, the Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate selected under section 4004 of ERISA may submit recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the suspension that was approved under paragraph (g) of this section or any modifications to the suspension.
(iii)
Implementation of original or modified suspension by systemically important plans.
If a plan is a systemically important plan for which a majority of all eligible voters vote to reject the suspension that was approved under paragraph (g) of this section, then the Secretary of the Treasury must determine whether to permit the implementation of the suspension that was approved under paragraph (g) of this section or whether to permit the implementation of a modification of that suspension. Under any such modification, the plan must be projected to avoid insolvency in accordance with section 432(e)(9)(D)(iv). No later than 60 days after the results of a vote to reject a suspension are certified, the Secretary of the Treasury will notify the plan sponsor that the suspension or modified suspension is permitted to be implemented.
(iv)
Systemically important plan defined
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(5), a systemically important plan is a plan with respect to which PBGC projects that the present value of its financial assistance payments will exceed $1.0 billion (adjusted in accordance with paragraph (h)(5)(iv)(B) of this section to the calendar year in which the application is submitted) if the suspension is not implemented.
(B)
Indexing.
For calendar years beginning after 2015, the dollar amount specified in paragraph (h)(5)(iv)(A) of this section will be replaced with an amount equal to the product of the dollar amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the contribution and benefit base (determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) for the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is the contribution and benefit base for calendar year 2014. If the amount otherwise determined under this paragraph (h)(5)(iv)(B) is not a multiple of $1.0 million, the amount will be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $1.0 million.
(6)
Final authorization to suspend
—(i)
In general.
In any case in which a suspension is permitted to take effect following a vote pursuant to section 432(e)(9)(H)(ii) and paragraph (h)(4) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, will issue a final authorization to suspend with respect to the suspension not later than seven days after the vote.
(ii)
Systemically important plans.
In any case in which a suspension is permitted to take effect following a determination under paragraph (h)(5) of this section that the plan is a systemically important plan, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, will issue a final authorization to suspend, at a time sufficient to allow the implementation of the suspension prior to the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date the results of the vote are certified.
(iii)
Plan partitions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in any case in which a suspension of benefits with respect to a plan is made in combination with a partition of the plan, the suspension of benefits is not permitted to take effect prior to the effective date of the partition.
(i) [Reserved].
(j)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies with respect to suspensions for which the approval or denial is issued on or after April 26, 2016 and, in the case of a systemically important plan, any modification described in paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of this section that is implemented on or after April 26, 2016.
[T.D. 9765, 81 FR 25557, Apr. 28, 2016, as amended by T.D. 9767, 81 FR 27015, May 5, 2016]
§ 1.433(h)(3)-1
Mortality tables used to determine current liability.
(a)
Mortality tables used to determine current liability.
In accordance with section 433(h)(3)(B), the mortality assumptions that apply to a single-employer defined benefit plan for the plan year pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(A) and (D) and §§ 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(1) and (a)(2)(ii) are used to determine a cooperative and small employer charity (CSEC) plan's current liability under section 433(h). For purposes of this paragraph (a), either the generational mortality tables used pursuant to § 1.430(h)(3)-1(b) or the static mortality tables used pursuant to § 1.430(h)(3)-1(c) are permitted to be used without regard to whether the plan is a small plan as defined in § 1.430(h)(3)-1(c)(1)(ii). However, substitute mortality tables under §§ 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(2)(i) and 1.430(h)(3)-2 are not permitted to be used for purposes of this paragraph (a).
(b)
Applicability date.
This section applies for valuation dates occurring on or after January 1, 2024.

§ 1.436-1
Limits on benefits and benefit accruals under single employer defined benefit plans.
(a)
General rules
—(1)
Qualification requirement.
Section 401(a)(29) provides that a defined benefit pension plan that is subject to section 412 and that is not a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of section 414(f)) is a qualified plan only if it satisfies the requirements of section 436. This section provides rules relating to funding-based limitations on certain benefits under section 436, and the requirements of section 436 are satisfied only if the plan meets the requirements of this section beginning with the plan's first effective plan year. This section applies to single employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans), but does not apply to multiemployer plans.
(2)
Organization of the regulation.
Paragraph (b) of this section describes limitations on shutdown benefits and other unpredictable contingent event benefits. Paragraph (c) of this section describes limitations on plan amendments increasing liabilities. Paragraph (d) of this section describes limitations on prohibited payments. Paragraph (e)
of this section describes limitations on benefit accruals. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules relating to methods to avoid or terminate benefit limitations. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules for the operation of the plan in relation to benefit limitations under section 436. Paragraph (h) of this section describes related presumptions regarding underfunding that apply for purposes of the benefit limitations under section 436 and requirements relating to certifications. Paragraph (j) of this section contains definitions. Paragraph (k) of this section contains effective/applicability date provisions.
(3)
Special rules for certain plans
—(i)
New plans.
The limitations described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section do not apply to a plan for the first 5 plan years of the plan. Except as otherwise provided by the Commissioner in guidance of general applicability, plan years of the plan include the following (in addition to plan years during which the plan was maintained by the employer or plan sponsor):
(A) Plan years when the plan was maintained by a predecessor employer within the meaning of § 1.415(f)-1(c)(1).
(B) Plan years of another defined benefit plan maintained by a predecessor employer within the meaning of § 1.415(f)-1(c)(2) within the preceding five years if any participants in the plan participated in that other defined benefit plan (even if the plan maintained by the employer is not the plan that was maintained by the predecessor employer).
(C) Plan years of another defined benefit plan maintained by the employer within the preceding five years if any participants in the plan participated in that other defined benefit plan.
(ii)
Application of section 436 after termination of a plan
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, any section 436 limitations in effect immediately before the termination of a plan do not cease to apply thereafter.
(B)
Exception for payments pursuant to plan termination.
The limitations under section 436(d) and paragraph (d) of this section do not apply to prohibited payments (within the meaning of paragraph (j)(6) of this section) that are made to carry out the termination of a plan in accordance with applicable law. For example, a plan sponsor's purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefit liabilities in connection with the standard termination of a plan in accordance with section 4041(b)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and in accordance with 29 CFR 4041.28, does not violate section 436(d) or this section.
(iii)
Multiple employer plans.
In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, this section applies separately with respect to each employer under the plan, as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, the benefit limitations under section 436 and this section could apply differently to participants who are employees of different employers under such a multiple employer plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), this section applies as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.
(4)
Treatment of plan as of close of prohibited or cessation period
—(i)
Application to prohibited payments and accruals
—(A)
Resumption of prohibited payments.
If a limitation on prohibited payments under paragraph (d) of this section applied to a plan as of a section 436 measurement date (as defined in paragraph (j)(8) of this section), but that limit no longer applies to the plan as of a later section 436 measurement date, then the limitation on prohibited payments under the plan does not apply to benefits with annuity starting dates (as defined in paragraph (j)(2) of this section) that are on or after that later section 436 measurement date. Any amendment to eliminate an optional form of benefit that contains a prohibited payment with respect to an annuity starting date during a period in which the limitations of section 436(d) and paragraph (d) of this section do not apply to the plan is subject to the rules of section 411(d)(6).
(B)
Resumption of benefit accruals.
If a limitation on benefit accruals under paragraph (e) of this section applied to a plan as of a section 436 measurement
date, but that limit no longer applies to the plan as of a later section 436 measurement date, then that limitation does not apply to benefit accruals that are based on service on or after that later section 436 measurement date, except to the extent that the plan provides that benefit accruals will not resume when the limitation ceases to apply. The plan must comply with the rules relating to partial years of participation and the prohibition on double proration under Department of Labor regulation 29 CFR 2530.204-2(c) and (d).
(ii)
Restoration of options and missed benefit accruals
—(A)
Option to amend plan.
A plan is permitted to be amended to provide participants who had an annuity starting date within a period during which a limitation under paragraph (d) of this section applied to the plan with the opportunity to make a new election under which the form of benefit previously elected is modified, subject to applicable qualification requirements. A participant who makes such a new election is treated as having a new annuity starting date under sections 415 and 417. Similarly, a plan is permitted to be amended to provide that any benefit accruals which were limited under the rules of paragraph (e) of this section are credited under the plan when the limitation no longer applies, subject to applicable qualification requirements. Any such plan amendment with respect to a new annuity starting date or crediting of benefit accruals is subject to the requirements of section 436(c) and paragraph (c) of this section.
(B)
Automatic plan provisions.
A plan is permitted to provide that participants who had an annuity starting date within a period during which a limitation under paragraph (d) of this section applied to the plan will be provided with the opportunity to have a new annuity starting date (which would constitute a new annuity starting date under sections 415 and 417) under which the form of benefit previously elected may be modified, subject to applicable qualification requirements, once the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section cease to apply. In addition, subject to the rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a plan is permitted to provide for the automatic restoration of benefit accruals that had been limited under section 436(e) as of the section 436 measurement date that the limitation ceases to apply.
(iii)
Shutdown and other unpredictable contingent event benefits.
If unpredictable contingent event benefits with respect to an unpredictable contingent event that occurs during the plan year are not permitted to be paid after the occurrence of the event because of the limitations of section 436(b) and paragraph (b) of this section, but are permitted to be paid later in the plan year as a result of additional contributions under paragraph (f)(2) of this section or pursuant to the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year that meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, then those unpredictable contingent event benefits must automatically become payable, retroactive to the period those benefits would have been payable under the terms of the plan (other than plan terms implementing the requirements of section 436(b)). If the benefits do not become payable during the plan year in accordance with the preceding sentence, then the plan is treated as if it does not provide for those benefits. However, all or any portion of those benefits can be restored pursuant to a plan amendment that meets the requirements of section 436(c) and paragraph (c) of this section and other applicable qualification requirements.
(iv)
Treatment of plan amendments that do not take effect.
If a plan amendment does not take effect as of the effective date of the amendment because of the limitations of section 436(c) and paragraph (c) of this section, but is permitted to take effect later in the plan year as a result of additional contributions under paragraph (f)(2) of this section or pursuant to the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year that meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, then the plan amendment must automatically take effect as of the first day of the plan year (or, if later, the original effective date of the amendment). If the plan amendment cannot take effect during the plan
year, then it must be treated as if it were never adopted, unless the plan amendment provides otherwise.
(v)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (a)(4):

# Example.
(i) Plan T is a non-collectively bargained defined benefit plan with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1. As of January 1, 2011, Plan T does not have a funding standard carryover balance or a prefunding balance. Plan T's sponsor is not in bankruptcy. Beginning January 1, 2011, Plan T is subject to the restriction on prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(3) of this section based on a presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage (AFTAP) of 75%.
(ii) U is a participant in Plan T. Participant U retires on February 1, 2011, and elects to receive benefits in the form of a single sum. Plan T may pay only a portion (generally, 50%) of the prohibited payment. Accordingly, U elects in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section to receive 50% of U's benefit in a single sum (up to the 2011 PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section) and the remainder as an immediately commencing straight life annuity.
(iii) On March 1, 2011, the enrolled actuary for the Plan certifies that the AFTAP for 2011 is 80%. Accordingly, beginning March 1, 2011, Plan T is no longer subject to the restriction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(iv) Effective March 1, 2011, Plan T is amended to provide that a participant whose benefits were restricted under paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to an annuity starting date between January 1, 2011, and February 28, 2011, may elect, within a specified period on or after March 1, 2011, a new annuity starting date and receive the remainder of his or her pension benefits in an accelerated form of payment. Plan T's enrolled actuary determines that the AFTAP, taking into account the amendment, would still be 80%. The amendment is permitted to take effect because Plan T would have an AFTAP of 80% taking into account the amendment and is therefore neither subject to the restriction on plan amendments in paragraph (c) of this section nor the restrictions on prohibited payments under paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(3) of this section. Accordingly, Participant U may elect, within the specified period and subject to otherwise applicable qualification rules, including spousal consent, to receive the remainder of U's benefits in the form of a single sum on or after March 1, 2011.
(5)
Deemed election to reduce funding balances
—(i)
Limitations on accelerated benefit payments.
If a benefit limitation under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(3) of this section would (but for this paragraph (a)(5)) apply to a plan, the employer is treated as having made an election under section 430(f) to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance by such amount as is necessary for the adjusted funding target attainment percentage to be at the applicable threshold (60 or 80 percent, as the case may be) in order for the benefit limitation not to apply to the plan. The determination of whether a benefit limitation under paragraph (d) of this section would apply to a plan is based on whether the plan provides for an optional form of benefit that would be limited under section 436(d) and is not based on whether any participant elects payment of benefits in such a form.
(ii)
Other limitations for collectively bargained plans
—(A)
General rule.
In the case of a collectively bargained plan to which a benefit limitation under paragraph (b), (c), or (e) of this section would (but for this paragraph (a)(5)) apply, the employer is treated as having made an election under section 430(f) to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance by such amount as is necessary for the adjusted funding target attainment percentage to be at the applicable threshold (60 or 80 percent, as the case may be) in order for the benefit limitation not to apply to the plan, taking into account the adjustments described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A), (g)(3)(ii)(A), or (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section, whichever applies.
(B)
Collectively bargained plans.
A plan is considered a collectively bargained plan for purposes of this paragraph (a)(5)(ii) if—
(
1
) At least 50 percent of the employees benefiting under the plan (within the meaning of § 1.410(b)-3(a)) are members of collective bargaining units for which the benefit levels under the plan are specified under a collective bargaining agreement; or
(
2
) At least 25 percent of the participants in the plan are members of collective bargaining units for which the benefit levels under the plan are specified under a collective bargaining agreement.
(iii)
Exception for insufficient funding balances
—(A)
In general.
Paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) of this section apply with respect to a benefit limitation for any plan year only if the application of those paragraphs would result in the corresponding benefit limitation not applying for such plan year. Thus, if the plan's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances were reduced to zero and the resulting increase in plan assets taken into account would still not increase the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage enough to reach the threshold percentage applicable to the benefit limitation, the deemed election to reduce those balances pursuant to paragraph (a)(5)(i) or (a)(5)(ii) of this section does not apply.
(B)
Presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage less than 60 percent.
During any period when a plan is presumed to have an adjusted funding target attainment percentage of less than 60 percent as a result of paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the plan is treated as if the prefunding balance and the funding standard carryover balance are insufficient to increase the adjusted funding target attainment percentage to the threshold percentage of 60 percent. Accordingly, the deemed election to reduce those balances pursuant to paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) of this section does not apply to the plan.
(iv)
Other rules
—(A)
Date of deemed election.
If an election is deemed to be made pursuant to this paragraph (a)(5), then the plan sponsor is treated as having made that election on the date as of which the applicable benefit limitation would otherwise apply.
(B)
Coordination with section 436 contributions.
The determination of whether one of the benefit limitations described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(A) of this section would otherwise apply is made without regard to any contribution described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Thus, the requirement to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section cannot be avoided through the use of a section 436 contribution.
(C)
Coordination with elections to offset minimum required contribution. See
§ 1.430(f)-1(d)(1)(ii) for rules on the coordination of elections to offset the minimum required contribution and the deemed election to reduce the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances under this paragraph (a)(5).
(v)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (a)(5):

# Example.
(i) Plan W is a collectively bargained, single employer defined benefit plan sponsored by Sponsor X, with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1.
(ii) The enrolled actuary for Plan W issues a certification on March 1, 2010, that the 2010 AFTAP is 81%. Sponsor X adopts an amendment on March 25, 2010, to increase benefits under a formula based on participant compensation, with an effective date of May 1, 2010. (Because the formula is based on compensation, the exception in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section does not apply.) The plan's enrolled actuary determines that the plan's AFTAP for 2010 would be 75% if the benefits attributable to the plan amendment were taken into account in determining the funding target.
(iii) Because the AFTAP would be below the 80% threshold if the benefits attributable to the plan amendment were taken into account in determining the funding target, Sponsor X is deemed pursuant to paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section to have made an election to reduce Plan W's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances by the amount necessary for the AFTAP to reach the 80% threshold (reflecting the increase in funding target attributable to the plan amendment), provided that the amount of those balances is sufficient for this purpose.
(iv) If the deemed election described in paragraph (iii) of this example occurs, the plan amendment takes effect on its effective date (May 1, 2010). See paragraph (f) of this section for other methods to avoid or terminate benefit limitations (where, for example, the amount necessary for a benefit limitation not to apply for a plan year exceeds the sum of the prefunding balance and the funding standard carryover balance).
(6)
Notice requirements.
See section 101(j) of ERISA for rules requiring the plan administrator of a single employer plan to provide a written notice to participants and beneficiaries within 30 days after certain specified dates, which depend on whether the plan has become subject to a restriction described in the ERISA provisions that are parallel to Internal Revenue Code sections 436(b), 436(d), and 436(e)
(ERISA sections 206(g)(1), 206(g)(3), and 206(g)(4), respectively).
(b)
Limitation on shutdown benefits and other unpredictable contingent event benefits
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), a plan satisfies section 436(b) and this paragraph (b) only if it provides that unpredictable contingent event benefits with respect to any unpredictable contingent events occurring during a plan year will not be paid if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year is—
(i) Less than 60 percent; or
(ii) 60 percent or more, but would be less than 60 percent if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage were redetermined applying an actuarial assumption that the likelihood of occurrence of the unpredictable contingent event during the plan year is 100 percent.
(2)
Exemption if section 436 contribution is made.
The prohibition on payment of unpredictable contingent event benefits under paragraph (b)(1) of this section ceases to apply with respect to benefits attributable to an unpredictable contingent event occurring during the plan year upon payment by the plan sponsor of the contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section with respect to that event. If the prior sentence applies with respect to an unpredictable contingent event, then all benefits with respect to the unpredictable contingent event must be paid, including benefits for periods prior to the contribution.
See
paragraph (f) of this section for additional rules.
(3)
Rules of application
—(i)
Participant-by-participant application.
The limitations of section 436(b) and this paragraph (b) apply on a participant-by-participant basis. Thus, whether payment or commencement of an unpredictable contingent event benefit under a plan is restricted with respect to a participant is determined based on whether the participant satisfies the plan's eligibility requirements (other than the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or the occurrence of death or disability) for such a benefit in a plan year in which the limitations of section 436(b) and this paragraph (b) apply.
(ii)
Multiple contingencies.
In the case of a plan that provides for a benefit that depends upon the occurrence of more than one unpredictable contingent event with respect to a participant, the unpredictable contingent event for purposes of section 436(b) and this paragraph (b) occurs upon the last to occur of those unpredictable contingent events.
(iii)
Cessation of benefits.
Cessation of a benefit under a plan upon the occurrence of a specified event is not an unpredictable contingent event for purposes of section 436(b) and this paragraph (b). Thus, section 436(b) and this paragraph (b) do not prohibit provisions of a plan that provide for cessation, suspension, or reduction of any benefits upon occurrence of any event. However, upon any subsequent recommencement of benefits (including any restoration of benefits), the rules of section 436 and this section will apply.
(4)
Prior unpredictable contingent event.
Unpredictable contingent event benefits attributable to an unpredictable contingent event that occurred within a period during which no limitation under this paragraph (b) applied to the plan are not affected by the limitation described in this paragraph (b) as it applies in a subsequent period. For example, if a plant shutdown occurs in 2010 and the plan's funded status is such that benefits contingent upon that plant shutdown are not subject to the limitation described in this paragraph (b) for that calendar plan year, this paragraph (b) does not apply to restrict payment of those benefits even if another plant shutdown occurs in 2012 that results in the restriction of benefits that are contingent upon that later plant shutdown under this paragraph (b) (where the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for 2012 would be less than 60 percent taking into account the liability attributable to those shutdown benefits).
(c)
Limitations on plan amendments increasing liability for benefits
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a plan satisfies section 436(c) and this paragraph (c) only if the plan provides that no amendment
to the plan that has the effect of increasing liabilities of the plan by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accrual, or changing the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable will take effect in a plan year if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year is—
(i) Less than 80 percent; or
(ii) 80 percent or more, but would be less than 80 percent if the benefits attributable to the amendment were taken into account in determining the adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
(2)
Exemption if section 436 contribution is made
—(i)
General rule.
The limitations on plan amendments in paragraph (c)(1) of this section cease to apply with respect to an amendment upon payment by the plan sponsor of the contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, so that the amendment is permitted to take effect as of the later of the first day of the plan year or the effective date of the amendment.
See
paragraph (f) of this section for additional rules.
(ii)
Amendments that do not increase funding target.
If the amount of the contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section is $0 (because the amendment increases benefits solely for future periods), the amendment is permitted to take effect without regard to this paragraph (c). However,
see
§ 1.430(d)-1(d)(2) for a rule that requires such an amendment to be taken into account in determining the funding target and the target normal cost in certain situations.
(3)
Rules of application regarding pre-existing plan provisions.
If a plan contains a provision that provides for the automatic restoration of benefit accruals that were not permitted to accrue because of the application of section 436(e) and paragraph (e) of this section, the restoration of those accruals is generally treated as a plan amendment that is subject to section 436(c). However, such a provision is permitted to take effect without regard to the limits of section 436(c) and this paragraph (c) if—
(i) The continuous period of the limitation is 12 months or less; and
(ii) The plan's enrolled actuary certifies that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan would not be less than 60 percent taking into account the restored benefit accruals for the prior plan year.
(4)
Exceptions
—(i)
Benefit increases based on compensation
—(A)
In general.
In accordance with section 436(c)(3), section 436(c) and this paragraph (c) do not apply to any amendment that provides for an increase in benefits under a formula that is not based on a participant's compensation, but only if the rate of increase in benefits does not exceed the contemporaneous rate of increase in average wages of participants covered by the amendment. The determination of the rate of increase in average wages is made by taking into consideration the net increase in average wages from the period of time beginning with the effective date of the most recent benefit increase applicable to all of those participants who are covered by the current amendment and ending on the effective date of the current amendment.
(B)
Application to participants who are not currently employed.
If an amendment applies to both currently employed participants and other participants, all participants to whom the amendment applies are included in determining the increase in average wages of the participants covered by the amendment for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(i). For this purpose, participants who are not employees at any time during the period from the effective date of the most recent earlier benefit increase applicable to all of the participants who are covered by the current amendment and ending on the effective date of the current amendment are treated as having no increase or decrease in wages for the period after severance from employment.
(C)
Separate amendments for different plan populations.
In lieu of a single amendment that applies to both currently employed participants and other participants as described in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the employer can adopt multiple amendments—such as one that increases benefits for participants currently employed on the effective date of the current amendment and another one that increases benefits
for other participants. In that case, the two amendments are considered separately in determining the increase in average wages, and the exception in this paragraph (c)(4)(i) applies separately to each amendment. Thus, the increase in benefits for currently employed participants takes effect if it satisfies the exception under this paragraph (c)(4), but the amendment increasing benefits for other participants who received no increase in wages from the employer during the period over which the increase in average wages is separately subject to the rules of this paragraph (c) without regard to the rules of this paragraph (c)(4).
(ii)
Plan provisions providing for accelerated vesting.
To the extent that any amendment provides for (or any pre-existing plan provision results in) a mandatory increase in the vesting of benefits under the Code or ERISA (such as vesting rate increases pursuant to statute, plan termination amendments or partial terminations under section 411(d)(3), and vesting increases required by the rules for top-heavy plans under section 416), that amendment (or pre-existing plan provision) does not constitute an amendment that changes the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable for purposes of section 436(c) and this paragraph (c). However, this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) applies only to the extent the increase in vesting is necessary to enable the plan to continue to satisfy the requirements for qualified plans.
(iii)
Authority for additional exceptions.
The Commissioner may, in guidance of general applicability, issue additional rules under which other amendments to a plan are not treated as amendments to which section 436(c) and this paragraph (c) apply. See § 601.601(d)(2) relating to objectives and standards for publishing regulations, revenue rulings and revenue procedures in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(5)
Rule for determining when an amendment takes effect.
For purposes of section 436(c) and this paragraph (c), in the case of an amendment that increases benefits, the amendment takes effect under a plan on the first date on which any individual who is or could be a participant or beneficiary under the plan would obtain a legal right to the increased benefit if the individual were on that date to satisfy the applicable requirements for entitlement to the benefit (such as the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or the occurrence of death, disability, or severance from employment).
(6)
Treatment of mergers, consolidations, and transfers of plan assets into a plan.
[Reserved]
(d)
Limitations on prohibited payments
—(1)
AFTAP less than 60 percent.
A plan satisfies the requirements of section 436(d)(1) and this paragraph (d)(1) only if the plan provides that, if the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year is less than 60 percent, a participant or beneficiary is not permitted to elect an optional form of benefit that includes a prohibited payment, and the plan will not pay any prohibited payment, with an annuity starting date on or after the applicable section 436 measurement date.
(2)
Bankruptcy.
A plan satisfies the requirements of section 436(d)(2) and this paragraph (d)(2) only if the plan provides that a participant or beneficiary is not permitted to elect an optional form of benefit that includes a prohibited payment, and the plan will not pay any prohibited payment, with an annuity starting date that occurs during any period in which the plan sponsor is a debtor in a case under title 11, United States Code, or similar Federal or State law, except for payments made within a plan year with an annuity starting date that occurs on or after the date on which the enrolled actuary of the plan certifies that the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for that plan year is not less than 100 percent.
(3)
Limited payment if AFTAP at least 60 percent but less than 80 percent
—(i)
In general.
A plan satisfies the requirements of section 436(d)(3) and this paragraph (d)(3) only if the plan provides that, in any case in which the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year is 60 percent or more but is less than 80 percent, a participant or beneficiary is not permitted to elect the payment of an optional form of benefit that includes a
prohibited payment, and the plan will not pay any prohibited payment, with an annuity starting date on or after the applicable section 436 measurement date, unless the present value, determined in accordance with section 417(e)(3), of the portion of the benefit that is being paid in a prohibited payment (which portion is determined under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section) does not exceed the lesser of—
(A) 50 percent of the present value (determined in accordance with section 417(e)(3)) of the benefit payable in the optional form of benefit that includes the prohibited payment; or
(B) 100 percent of the PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.
(ii)
Bifurcation if optional form unavailable
—(A)
Requirement to offer bifurcation.
If an optional form of benefit that is otherwise available under the terms of the plan is not available as of the annuity starting date because of the application of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, then the plan must permit the participant or beneficiary to elect to—
(
1
) Receive the unrestricted portion of that optional form of benefit (determined under the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section) at that annuity starting date, determined by treating the unrestricted portion of the benefit as if it were the participant's or beneficiary's entire benefit under the plan;
(
2
) Commence benefits with respect to the participant's or beneficiary's entire benefit under the plan in any other optional form of benefit available under the plan at the same annuity starting date that satisfies paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section; or
(
3
) Defer commencement of the payments to the extent described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(B)
Rules relating to bifurcation.
If the participant or beneficiary elects payment of the unrestricted portion of the benefit as described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, then the plan must permit the participant or beneficiary to elect payment of the remainder of the participant's or beneficiary's benefits under the plan in any optional form of benefit at that annuity starting date otherwise available under the plan that would not have included a prohibited payment if that optional form applied to the entire benefit of the participant or beneficiary. The rules of § 1.417(e)-1 are applied separately to the separate optional forms for the unrestricted portion of the benefit and the remainder of the benefit (the restricted portion).
(C)
Plan alternative that anticipates election of payment that includes a prohibited payment.
With respect to an optional form of benefit that includes a prohibited payment and that is not permitted to be paid under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, for which no additional information from the participant or beneficiary (such as information regarding a social security leveling optional form of benefit) is needed to make that determination, rather than wait for the participant or beneficiary to elect such optional form of benefit, a plan is permitted to provide for separate elections with respect to the restricted and unrestricted portions of that optional form of benefit. However, the rule in the preceding sentence applies only if—
(
1
) The plan applies the rule to all such optional forms; and
(
2
) The plan identifies the option that the bifurcation election replaces.
(iii)
Definitions applicable to limited payment option
—(A)
In general.
The definitions in this paragraph (d)(3)(iii) apply for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3).
(B)
Portion of benefit being paid in a prohibited payment.
If a benefit is being paid in an optional form for which any of the payments is greater than the amount payable under a straight life annuity to the participant or beneficiary (plus any social security supplements described in the last sentence of section 411(a)(9) payable to the participant or beneficiary) with the same annuity starting date, then the portion of the benefit that is being paid in a prohibited payment is the excess of each payment over the smallest payment during the participant's lifetime under the optional form of benefit (treating a period after the annuity starting date and during the participant's lifetime in which no payments are made as a payment of zero).
(C)
PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount.
The PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount described in this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) is the present value (determined under guidance prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, using the interest and mortality assumptions under section 417(e)) of the maximum benefit guarantee with respect to a participant (based on the participant's age or the beneficiary's age at the annuity starting date) under section 4022 of ERISA for the year in which the annuity starting date occurs.
(D)
Unrestricted portion of the benefit
—(
1
)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D), the unrestricted portion of the benefit with respect to any optional form of benefit is 50 percent of the amount payable under the optional form of benefit.
(
2
)
Special rule for forms which include social security leveling or a refund of employee contributions.
For an optional form of benefit that is a prohibited payment on account of a social security leveling feature (as defined in § 1.411(d)-3(g)(16)) or a refund of employee contributions feature (as defined in § 1.411(d)-3(g)(11)), the unrestricted portion of the benefit is the optional form of benefit that would apply if the participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit were 50 percent smaller.
(
3
)
Limited to PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount.
After the application of the preceding rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D), the unrestricted portion of the benefit with respect to the optional form of benefit is reduced, to the extent necessary, so that the present value (determined in accordance with section 417(e)) of the unrestricted portion of that optional form of benefit does not exceed the PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount (described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section).
(iv)
Other rules
—(A)
One time application.
A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (d)(3) only if the plan provides that, in the case of a participant with respect to whom a prohibited payment (or series of prohibited payments under a single optional form of benefit) is made pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, no additional prohibited payment may be made with respect to that participant during any period of consecutive plan years for which prohibited payments are limited under this paragraph (d).
(B)
Treatment of beneficiaries.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), benefits provided with respect to a participant and any beneficiary of the participant (including an alternate payee, as defined in section 414(p)(8)) are aggregated. If the only benefits paid under the plan with respect to the participant are death benefits payable to the beneficiary, then paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section is applied by substituting the lifetime of the beneficiary for the lifetime of the participant. If the accrued benefit of a participant is allocated to such an alternate payee and one or more other persons, then the unrestricted amount under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section is allocated among such persons in the same manner as the accrued benefit is allocated, unless a qualified domestic relations order (as defined in section 414(p)(1)(A)) with respect to the participant or the alternate payee provides otherwise. See paragraphs (j)(2)(ii) and (j)(6)(ii) of this section for other special rules relating to beneficiaries.
(C)
Treatment of annuity purchases and plan transfers.
This paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) applies for purposes of applying paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (iii)(D) of this section. In the case of a prohibited payment described in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (relating to purchase from an insurer), the present value of the portion of the benefit that is being paid in a prohibited payment is the cost to the plan of the irrevocable commitment and, in the case of a prohibited payment described in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(C) of this section (relating to certain plan transfers), the present value of the portion of the benefit that is being paid in a prohibited payment is the present value of the liabilities transferred (determined in accordance with section 414(l)). In addition, the present value of the accrued benefit is substituted for the present value of the benefit payable in the optional form of benefit that includes the prohibited payment in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section. (Further,
see
§ 1.411(d)-4, A-2(a)(3)(ii), for a rule under section 411(d)(6) that applies to
an optional form of benefit that includes a prohibited payment described in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section.)
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d)(3):

# Example 1.
(i) Plan A has a plan year that is the calendar year, and is subject to the restriction on prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(3) of this section for the 2010 plan year. Participant P is not married, and retires at age 65 during 2010, while the restriction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies to Plan A. P's accrued benefit is $10,000 per month, payable commencing at age 65 as a straight life annuity. Plan A provides for an optional single-sum payment (subject to the restrictions under section 436) equal to the present value of the participant's accrued benefit using actuarial assumptions under section 417(e). P's single-sum payment, determined without regard to this paragraph (d), is calculated to be $1,416,000, payable at age 65.
(ii) The PBGC guaranteed monthly benefit for a straight life annuity payable at age 65 in 2010 (for purposes of this example) is assumed to be $4,500. The PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount at age 65 is assumed to be $637,200 for 2010.
(iii) Because Participant P retires during a period when the restriction in paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies to Plan A, only a portion of the benefit can be paid in the form of a single sum. P elects a single-sum payment. Because a single-sum payment is a prohibited payment, a determination must be made whether the payment can be paid under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. In this case, because the present value of the portion of Participant P's benefit that is being paid in a prohibited payment exceeds the lesser of 50% of the benefit or the PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount, it cannot be paid under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the maximum single sum that P can receive is $637,200 (that is, the lesser of 50% of $1,416,000 or $637,200).
(iv) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, Plan A must offer P the option to bifurcate the benefit into unrestricted and restricted portions. The unrestricted portion is a monthly straight life annuity of $4,500, which can be paid in a single sum of $637,200. If P elects to receive the unrestricted portion of the benefit in the form of a single sum, then, with respect to the $5,500 restricted portion, Plan A must permit P to elect any form of benefit that would otherwise be permitted with respect to the full $10,000 and that is not a prohibited payment. Alternatively, Plan A may provide that P is permitted to elect to defer commencement of the restricted portion, subject to applicable qualification rules.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
In addition, Plan A provides an optional form of payment (subject to any benefit restrictions under section 436) that consists of a partial payment equal to the total return of employee contributions to the plan accumulated with interest, with an annuity payment for the remainder of the participant's benefit.
(ii) Participant Q is not married, and retires at age 65 during 2010, while Plan A is subject to the restriction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Participant Q has an accrued benefit equal to a straight life annuity of $3,000 per month. Under the optional form described in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2,
Q may elect a partial payment of $99,120 (representing the return of employee contributions accumulated with interest), plus a straight life annuity of $2,300 per month. The present value of Participant Q's accrued benefit, using actuarial assumptions under section 417(e), is $424,800.
(iii) Because the present value of the portion of Q's benefit that is being paid in a prohibited payment ($99,120) does not exceed the lesser of 50% of the present value of benefits (50% of $424,800) or 100% of the PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount ($637,200 at age 65 for 2010), the optional form described in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
is permitted to be paid under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
In addition, Plan A provides an optional form of payment under a social security leveling option (subject to any benefit restrictions under section 436) that consists of an increased temporary benefit payable until age 62, with reduced payments beginning at age 62. The benefit is structured so that the combination of the participant's pension benefit and Social Security benefit provides an approximately level income for the participant's lifetime. The PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount at age 55 is assumed to be $362,776 for 2010.
(ii) Participant R retires at age 55 in 2010 and is eligible to receive a level lifetime annuity of $1,200 per month beginning immediately. Instead, Participant R elects to receive a benefit under the social security leveling optional form of payment. Participant R's Social Security benefit payable at age 62 is projected, under the terms specified in Plan A, to be $1,500 per month. The Plan A adjustment factor for the social security leveling option using the minimum present value requirements of section 417(e)(3) is .590 at age 55. Therefore, Participant R's benefit payable from age 55 to age 62 is $2,085 per month ($1,200 + .590 × $1,500), and the benefit payable for Participant's lifetime, beginning after age 62, is $585 per month ($2,085−$1,500).
(iii) Because the optional form provides some payments which are greater than payments described in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(A) of
this section ($1,200), the portion of the benefit that is being paid in a prohibited payment is $1,500 per month which is payable from age 55 to age 62. Using the applicable interest and mortality rates under section 417(e) as in effect for Plan A at the time the benefit commences, the present value of a temporary benefit of $1,500 per month ($2,085−$585) payable from age 55 to age 62 is $106,417, and the present value of the entire benefit (a temporary benefit of $2,085 per month payable from age 55 to age 62 plus a deferred lifetime benefit of $585 commencing at age 62) is $207,468.
(iv) Because $106,417 is more than 50% of $207,468 (and because 50% of Participant R's benefit is less than $362,776, which is the PBGC maximum guaranteed benefit amount at age 55 for 2010), Participant R can only receive 50% of the benefit in the form of the social security leveling option. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, Plan A must offer Participant R the option to bifurcate the benefit into unrestricted and restricted portions. Participant R elects to receive the restricted portion of the early retirement benefit as a level lifetime annuity of $600 commencing at age 55.
(v) Participant R elects to receive the unrestricted portion of the early retirement benefit in the social security leveling form of payment. This portion of the benefit is determined under the social security leveling form of payment as if Participant R's benefit was one-half of the early retirement benefit, or $600. However, using a monthly level lifetime benefit of $600 and a monthly social security benefit of $1,500, Participant R would have a negative benefit after age 62 ($600 + .590 × $1,500 is only $1,485; offsetting $1,500 at age 62 would produce a negative amount). Plan A provides that in this situation, the benefit under the social security leveling option is an actuarially equivalent monthly annuity payable until age 62, with zero payable thereafter. Using the actuarial equivalence factor of .590 at age 55, the plan administrator determines that the unrestricted portion of Participant R's benefit is $1,463 per month, payable from age 55 to age 62 ($600 + .590 × $1,463 = $1,463 payable until age 62; $1,463−$1,463 = zero payable after age 62).
(vi) Combining the unrestricted and restricted portions of the benefit, Participant R will receive a total of $2,063 per month from age 55 to age 62 ($1,463 from the unrestricted portion of the benefit plus $600 from the restricted portion of the benefit), and $600 per month beginning at age 62 (zero from the unrestricted portion of the benefit plus $600 from the restricted portion of the benefit).
(4)
Exception for cessation of benefit accruals.
This paragraph (d) does not apply to a plan for a plan year if the terms of the plan, as in effect for the period beginning on September 1, 2005, provided for no benefit accruals with respect to any participants. If a plan that is described in this paragraph (d)(4) provides for benefit accruals during any time on or after September 1, 2005 (treating benefit increases pursuant to a plan amendment as benefit accruals), this paragraph (d)(4) ceases to apply for the plan as of the date any benefits accrue under the plan (or the date the amendment takes effect). For example, the exception in this paragraph (d)(4) does not apply to a plan after the plan increases benefits to take into account increases in the limitations under section 415(b) on or after September 1, 2005.
(5)
Right to delay commencement.
If a participant or beneficiary requests a distribution in an optional form of benefit that includes a prohibited payment that is not permitted to be paid under paragraph (d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3) of this section, the participant retains the right to delay commencement of benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan and applicable qualification requirements (such as sections 411(a)(11) and 401(a)(9)).
(6)
Plan alternative for special optional forms.
A plan is permitted to offer optional forms of benefit that are solely available during the period in which paragraph (d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3) of this section applies to limit prohibited payments under the plan. For example, a plan may permit participants or beneficiaries who commence benefits during the period in which paragraph (d)(1) of this section (or paragraph (d)(2) of this section) applies to limit prohibited payments under the plan to elect, within a specified period after the date on which that paragraph ceases to apply to limit prohibited payments under the plan, to receive the remaining benefit in the form of a single-sum payment equal to the present value of the remaining benefit, but only to the extent then permitted under this paragraph (d). As another example, during a period when paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies to a plan, the plan may permit participants and beneficiaries to elect payment in an optional form of benefit that provides for the current payment of the unrestricted portion of
the benefit, with a delayed commencement for the restricted portion of the benefit (subject to other applicable qualification requirements, such as sections 411(a)(11) and 401(a)(9)), or may satisfy paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section by permitting participants and beneficiaries to elect an optional form of benefit that combines an unsubsidized single-sum payment for over 50 percent of the accrued benefit with a subsidized early retirement life annuity for the remainder of the accrued benefit. Any such optional forms must satisfy this paragraph (d) and applicable qualification requirements, including satisfaction of section 417(e) and section 415 (at each annuity starting date).
(7)
Exception for distributions permitted without consent of the participant under section 411(a)(11).

(e)
Limitation on benefit accruals for plans with severe funding shortfalls
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), a plan satisfies the requirements of section 436(e) and this paragraph (e) only if it provides that, in any case in which the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year is less than 60 percent, benefit accruals under the plan will cease as of the applicable section 436 measurement date. If a plan is required to cease benefit accruals under this paragraph (e), then the plan is not permitted to be amended in a manner that would increase the liabilities of the plan by reason of an increase in benefits or establishment of new benefits. The preceding sentence applies regardless of whether an amendment would otherwise be permissible under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.
(2)
Exemption if section 436 contribution is made.
The prohibition on additional benefit accruals under a plan described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section ceases to apply with respect to a plan year, effective as of the first day of the plan year, upon payment by the plan sponsor of the contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section. See paragraph (f) of this section for additional rules.
(3)
Special rule under section 203 of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008.

(f)
Methods to avoid or terminate benefit limitations
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (f) sets forth rules relating to employer contributions and other methods to avoid or terminate the application of section 436 limitations under a plan for a plan year. In general, there are four methods a plan sponsor may utilize to avoid or terminate one or more of the benefit limitations under this section for a plan year. Two of these methods (where the plan sponsor elects to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance and where the plan sponsor makes additional contributions under section 430 for the prior plan year within the time period provided by section 430(j)(1) that are not added to the prefunding balance) involve increasing the amount of plan assets which are taken into account in determining the adjusted funding target attainment percentage. The other two methods (making a contribution that is specifically designated as a current year contribution to avoid or terminate application of a benefit limitation under paragraph (b), (c), or (e) of this section, and providing security under section 436(f)(1)) are described in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, respectively.
(2)
Current year contributions to avoid or terminate benefit limitations
—(i)
General rules
—(A)
Amount of contribution
—(
1
)
In general.
This paragraph (f)(2) sets forth rules regarding contributions to avoid or terminate the application of section 436 limitations under a plan for a plan year that apply to unpredictable contingent event benefits, plan amendments that increase liabilities for benefits, and benefit accruals.
(
2
)
Interest adjustment.
Any contribution made by a plan sponsor pursuant to this paragraph (f)(2) on a date other than the valuation date for the plan year must be adjusted with interest at the plan's effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year. If the plan's effective interest rate for the plan year has not been determined at the time of the contribution, then this interest adjustment must be made using the highest of the three segment rates as applicable for the plan year under section 430(h)(2)(C). In such a case, if the effective interest rate for
the plan year under section 430(h)(2)(A) is subsequently determined to be less than that highest rate, the excess is recharacterized as an employer contribution taken into account under section 430 for the current plan year.
(B)
Timing requirement for section 436 contributions.
Any contribution described in this paragraph (f)(2) must be paid before the unpredictable contingent event benefits are permitted to be paid, the plan amendment is permitted to take effect, or the benefit accruals are permitted to resume. In addition, any contribution described in this paragraph (f)(2) must be paid during the plan year.
(C)
Prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance may not be used.
No prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance under section 430(f) may be used as a contribution described in this paragraph (f)(2). However, a plan sponsor is permitted to elect to reduce the funding standard carryover balance or the prefunding balance in order to increase the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year. See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for a rule mandating such a reduction in certain situations.
(ii)
Section 436 contributions separate from minimum required contributions
—(A)
In general.
The contributions described in this paragraph (f)(2) are contributions described in sections 436(b)(2), 436(c)(2), and 436(e)(2), and are separate from any minimum required contributions under section 430. Thus, if a plan sponsor makes a contribution described in this paragraph (f)(2) for a plan year but does not make the minimum required contribution for the plan year, the plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements under section 430 for the plan year. In addition, a contribution described in this paragraph (f)(2) is disregarded in determining the maximum addition to the prefunding balance under section 430(f)(6) and § 1.430(f)-1(b)(1)(ii).
(B)
Designation requirement.
Any contribution made by a plan sponsor pursuant to this paragraph (f)(2) must be designated as such at the time the contribution is used to avoid or terminate the limitations under this paragraph (f)(2), including designation of the benefits or amendments to which the limits do not apply because of the contribution. Except as specifically provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(
2
), (g) or (h) of this section, such a contribution cannot be subsequently recharacterized with respect to any plan year as a contribution to satisfy a minimum required contribution obligation, or otherwise. The designation must be made in accordance with the rules and procedures that otherwise apply to elections under § 1.430(f)-1(f) with respect to the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances.
(C)
Requirement to recertify AFTAP.
If the plan's enrolled actuary has already certified the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year, a plan sponsor is treated as making the contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B), (f)(2)(iv)(B), or (f)(2)(v) of this section for the plan year only after the plan's enrolled actuary certifies an updated adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year that takes into account the increased liability for the unpredictable contingent event benefits, the plan amendments, or restored accruals, and the associated section 436 contribution, under the rules of paragraph (h)(4)(v) of this section. See also paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section for a requirement to modify the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage to take the liability for the unpredictable contingent event benefits or plan amendments, and the associated section 436 contribution, into account (if the contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B), (f)(2)(iv)(B), or (f)(2)(v) of this section is made before the plan's enrolled actuary certifies the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year).
(iii)
Contribution for unpredictable contingent event benefits.
In the case of a contribution to avoid or terminate the application of the limitation on benefits attributable to an unpredictable contingent event under section 436(b)—
(A) In the event that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year determined without taking into account the liability attributable to the unpredictable contingent event benefits is less than 60 percent, the amount of the contribution
under section 436(b)(2) is equal to the amount of the increase in the funding target of the plan for the plan year if the benefits attributable to the unpredictable contingent event were included in the determination of the funding target.
(B) In the event that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year determined without taking into account the liability attributable to the unpredictable contingent event benefits is 60 percent or more, the amount of the contribution under section 436(b)(2) is the amount that would be sufficient to result in an adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year of 60 percent if the contribution (and any prior section 436 contributions made for the plan year) were included as part of the plan assets and the funding target were to take into account the adjustments described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A), (g)(3)(ii)(A), or (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section, whichever applies.
(iv)
Contribution for plan amendments increasing liability for benefits.
In the case of a contribution to avoid or terminate the application of the limitation on benefits attributable to a plan amendment under section 436(c)—
(A) In the event that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year determined without taking into account the liability attributable to the plan amendment is less than 80 percent, the amount of the contribution under section 436(c)(2) is equal to the amount of the increase in the funding target of the plan for the plan year if the liabilities attributable to the amendment were included in the determination of the funding target.
(B) In the event that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year determined without taking into account the liability attributable to the plan amendment is 80 percent or more, the amount of the contribution under section 436(c)(2) is the amount that would be sufficient to result in an adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year of 80 percent if the contribution (and any prior section 436 contributions made for the plan year) were included as part of the plan assets and the funding target were to take into account the adjustments described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A), (g)(3)(ii)(A), or (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section, whichever applies.
(v)
Contribution required for continued benefit accruals.
In the case of a contribution to avoid or terminate the application of the limitation on accruals under section 436(e), the amount of the contribution under section 436(e)(2) is equal to the amount sufficient to result in an adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year of 60 percent if the contribution (and any prior section 436 contributions made for the plan year) were included as part of the plan assets and the funding target were to take into account the adjustments described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) or (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section, whichever applies.
(3)
Security to increase adjusted funding target attainment percentage
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of avoiding benefit limitations under section 436, a plan sponsor may provide security in the form described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. In such a case, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year is determined by treating as an asset of the plan any security provided by a plan sponsor by the valuation date for the plan year in a form meeting the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. However, this security is not taken into account as a plan asset for any other purpose, including section 430.
(ii)
Form of security.
The forms of security permitted under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section are limited to—
(A) A bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 412 of ERISA; or
(B) Cash, or United States obligations which mature in 3 years or less, held in escrow by a bank or an insurance company.
(iii)
Enforcement.
Any form of security provided under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section must provide—
(A) That it will be paid to the plan upon the earliest of—
(
1
) The plan termination date as defined in section 4048 of ERISA;
(
2
) If there is a failure to make a payment of the minimum required contribution for any plan year beginning
after the security is provided, the due date for the payment under section 430(j)(1) or 430(j)(3); or
(
3
) If the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage is less than 60 percent (without regard to any security provided under this paragraph (f)(3)) for a consecutive period of 7 plan years, the valuation date for the last plan year in the 7-year period; and
(B) That the plan administrator must notify the surety, bank, or insurance company that issued or holds the security of any event described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(A) of this section within 10 days of its occurrence.
(iv)
Release of security.
The form of security is permitted to provide that it will be released (and any amounts thereunder will be refunded to the plan sponsor together with any interest accrued thereon) as provided in the agreement governing the security, but such release is not permitted until the plan's enrolled actuary has certified that the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year is at least 90 percent (without regard to any security provided under this paragraph (f)(3)) or until replacement security has been provided in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(vi) of this section.
(v)
Contribution of security to plan.
Any security provided under this paragraph (f)(3) that is subsequently turned over to the plan (whether pursuant to the enforcement mechanism of paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section or after its release under paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section) is treated as a contribution by the plan sponsor taken into account under section 430 when contributed and, if turned over pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, is not a contribution under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(vi)
Replacement security.
If security has been provided to a plan pursuant to this paragraph (f)(3), the plan sponsor may provide new security to the plan and subsequently or simultaneously have the original security released, but only if—
(A) The new security is in a form that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section;
(B) The amount of the new security is no less than the amount of the original security, determined at the time the original security is released; and
(C) The period described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(A)(
3
) of this section with respect to the new security is the same as the period that applied under that paragraph to the original security.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (f):

# Example 1.
(i) Plan Z is a non-collectively bargained defined benefit plan with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1. Plan Z's sponsor is not in bankruptcy, and Plan Z did not purchase any annuities in 2009 or 2010. As of January 1, 2011, Plan Z does not have a funding standard carryover balance or a prefunding balance, and is not in at-risk status. As of that date, Plan Z has plan assets (and adjusted plan assets) of $2,000,000 and a funding target (and an adjusted funding target) of $2,550,000. On March 1, 2011, the enrolled actuary for the plan certifies that the AFTAP as of January 1, 2011, is 78.43%. The effective interest rate for Plan Z for the 2011 plan year is 5.5%.
(ii) On May 1, 2011, the plan sponsor amends Plan Z to increase benefits. The enrolled actuary for the plan determines that the present value, as of January 1, 2011, of the increase in the funding target due to the amendment is $400,000. Because the AFTAP prior to the plan amendment is less than 80%, Plan Z is subject to the restriction on plan amendments in paragraph (c) of this section, and the amendment cannot take effect unless the employer utilizes one of the methods described in paragraph (f) of this section to avoid benefit limitations.
(iii) In order for the amendment to be permitted to take effect, the plan sponsor makes a contribution described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Because the AFTAP prior to the amendment was less than 80%, the provisions of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section apply. The amount of the contribution as of January 1, 2011, needed to avoid the restriction on plan amendments under paragraph (c) of this section is equal to the amount of the increase in funding target attributable to the amendment, or $400,000. Under the provisions of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, this contribution is required even though, if the contribution were included as part of the plan assets and the liabilities attributable to the plan amendment were included in the funding target, the AFTAP would be 81.36% (that is, adjusted plan assets of $2,000,000 plus the contribution of $400,000 as of January 1, 2011; divided by the adjusted funding target of $2,550,000 increased to reflect the additional $400,000 in the funding target attributable to the plan amendment).
(iv) However, because the contribution is not paid until May 1, 2011, the necessary contribution amount must be adjusted to reflect interest from the valuation date to the date of the contribution, at Plan Z's effective interest rate for the 2011 plan year. The amount of the required contribution after adjustment is $407,203, determined as $400,000 increased for 4 months of compound interest at an effective annual interest rate of 5.5%.
(v) A contribution of $407,203 is made on May 1, 2011, and is designated as a contribution under paragraph (f)(2) of this section with respect to the May 1, 2011, plan amendment. Accordingly, the contribution is not applied toward minimum funding requirements under section 430, and is not eligible for inclusion in the prefunding balance under § 1.430(f)-1(b)(1). Since this contribution meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the plan amendment takes effect in accordance with its terms.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the plan is in at-risk status under section 430(i). The funding target determined under section 430(i) is $2,600,000, and the funding target determined without regard to section 430(i) is $2,550,000.
(ii) On May 1, 2011, the plan sponsor amends Plan Z to increase benefits. The plan's enrolled actuary determines that the present value as of January 1, 2011 of the increase in the funding target due to the amendment (taking into account the at-risk status of the plan) is $440,000. Because the AFTAP prior to the plan amendment is 78.43% (determined taking into account the at-risk status of Plan Z), Plan Z is subject to the restriction on plan amendments in paragraph (c) of this section, and the amendment cannot take effect unless the employer utilizes one of the methods described in this paragraph (f) to avoid benefit limitations.
(iii) In order for this amendment to be permitted to take effect, the plan sponsor makes a contribution described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Because the AFTAP prior to the amendment was less than 80%, the provisions of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section apply. The amount of the contribution as of January 1, 2011, needed to avoid the restriction on plan amendments under paragraph (c) of this section is equal to the amount of the increase in funding target attributable to the amendment, or $440,000. Under the provisions of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, this contribution is required even though, if the contribution were included as part of the plan assets and the liability attributable to the plan amendment were included in the funding target, the AFTAP would exceed 80%.
(iv) However, because the contribution is not paid until May 1, 2011, the necessary contribution amount must be adjusted to reflect interest from the valuation date to the date of the contribution, at Plan Z's effective interest rate for the 2011 plan year. The amount of the required contribution after adjustment is $447,923, determined as $440,000 increased for 4 months of compound interest at an effective annual interest rate of 5.5%.
(v) A contribution of $447,923 is made on May 1, 2011, and is designated as a contribution under paragraph (f)(2) of this section with respect to the May 1, 2011, plan amendment. Accordingly, the contribution is not applied toward minimum funding requirements under section 430, and is not eligible for inclusion in the prefunding balance under § 1.430(f)-1(b)(1). Since this contribution meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the plan amendment takes effect in accordance with its terms.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the enrolled actuary for the plan does not issue the certification of the 2011 AFTAP until September 1, 2011. Prior to October 1, 2010, the enrolled actuary had certified the 2010 AFTAP to be 82%. Other than this amendment, no other amendment or unpredictable contingent event has occurred that requires a recertification. As of May 1, 2011, the plan's effective interest rate for the 2011 plan year has not yet been determined. The highest of the three segment rates applicable to the 2011 plan year under section 430(h)(2)(C) is 6%.
(ii) Because the enrolled actuary has not certified the actual AFTAP as of January 1, 2011, and the amendment is scheduled to take effect after April 1, 2011, the rules of paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section apply. Accordingly, the AFTAP for 2011 (prior to reflecting the effect of the amendment) is presumed to be 10 percentage points lower than the 2010 AFTAP, or 72%. Because this presumed AFTAP is less than 80%, the restriction on plan amendments in paragraph (c) of this section applies, and the plan amendment cannot take effect.
(iii) In order to allow the plan amendment to take effect, the plan sponsor decides to make a contribution under paragraph (f)(2) of this section on May 1, 2011. Because the presumed AFTAP was less than 80% prior to reflecting the plan amendment, the rules of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section apply, and the amount of the contribution under section 436(c)(2) is the amount of the increase in the funding target for the year if the plan amendment were included in the determination of the funding target. Accordingly, an additional contribution of $400,000 is required as of January 1, 2011, to avoid the restriction on plan amendments under paragraph (c) of this section.
(iv) However, since the contribution is not made until May 1, 2011, the amount of the required contribution must be adjusted to reflect interest from the valuation date to the date of the contribution. Since the effective interest rate has not yet been determined,
the interest adjustment is based on the highest of the three segment rates applicable for the 2011 plan year under section 430(h)(2)(C), or 6%. The amount of the required contribution after adjustment is $407,845, determined as $400,000 increased for 4 months of compound interest at the highest segment interest rate for 2011, or 6%.
(v) A contribution of $407,845 is made on May 1, 2011, and is designated as a contribution under paragraph (f)(2) of this section with respect to the May 1, 2011, plan amendment. Accordingly, the contribution is not applied toward minimum funding requirements under section 430, and is not eligible for inclusion in the prefunding balance under § 1.430(f)-1(b)(1). Since this contribution meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the plan amendment takes effect in accordance with its terms.
(vi) After the plan's effective interest rate for 2011 has been determined to be 5.5%, the amount of excess interest previously contributed is recharacterized as an employer contribution taken into account under section 430 for 2011 (because that rate for the year is less than 6%).
(g)
Rules of operation for periods prior to and after certification
—(1)
In general.
Section 436(h) and paragraph (h) of this section set forth a series of presumptions that apply before the enrolled actuary for a plan issues a certification of the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year. This paragraph (g) sets forth rules for the application of limitations under sections 436(b), 436(c), 436(d), and 436(e) prior to and during the period those presumptions apply to the plan, and describes the interaction of those presumptions with plan operations after the plan's enrolled actuary has issued a certification of the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year. Paragraph (g)(2) of this section sets forth rules that apply to periods during which a presumption under section 436(h) and paragraph (h) of this section applies. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section sets forth rules that apply to periods during which no presumptions under section 436(h) and paragraph (h) of this section apply but which are prior to the enrolled actuary's certification of the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year. Paragraph (g)(4) of this section sets forth rules for modifying the plan's presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage in certain situations. Paragraph (g)(5) of this section sets forth rules that apply after the enrolled actuary's certification of the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year. Paragraph (g)(6) of this section sets forth examples illustrating the rules in this paragraph (g).
(2)
Periods prior to certification during which a presumption applies
—(i)
Plan must follow presumptions.
A plan must provide that, for any period during which a presumption under section 436(h) and paragraph (h)(1), (2), or (3) of this section applies to the plan, the limitations applicable under section 436 and paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section are applied to the plan as if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the year were the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage determined under the rules of section 436(h) and paragraph (h)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, as applicable, updated to take into account certain unpredictable contingent event benefits and plan amendments in accordance with section 436 and the rules of this paragraph (g).
(ii)
Determination of amount of reduction in balances
—(A)
In general.
During the period described in this paragraph (g)(2), the rules of paragraph (a)(5) of this section (relating to the deemed election to reduce the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance) must be applied based on the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage. This paragraph (g)(2)(ii) provides rules for the determination of the reduction that applies as of the first day of the plan year, and, in certain circumstances, that applies later in the plan year. Paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section provides additional rules that apply with respect to unpredictable contingent event benefits or plan amendments, which rules must be applied prior to the application of paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section relating to section 436 contributions. The reapplication of the rules under this paragraph (g)(2) regarding the deemed election in paragraph (a)(5) of this section may require an additional reduction in the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances if the amount of the reduction in those
balances that is necessary to reach the applicable threshold to avoid the application of a section 436 limitation exceeds the amount that was initially reduced. Prior reductions of the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances continue to apply.
(B)
Reduction in balances at the first day of plan year
—(
1
)
Plans with a certified AFTAP for the prior plan year.
If section 436(h)(1) and paragraph (h)(1) of this section apply to determine the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage as of the first day of the current plan year based on the plan's enrolled actuary certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year made during that prior plan year, then, in order to determine the amount of the reduction (if any) in the funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii), a presumed adjusted funding target must be established as of the first day of the plan year, and that amount is then compared to the interim value of adjusted plan assets as of that date. For this purpose, the interim value of adjusted plan assets is equal to the value of adjusted plan assets (within the meaning of paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section) as of the first day of the plan year, determined without regard to future contributions and future elections with respect to the plan's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances under section 430(f) (for example, elections to add to the prefunding balance for the prior plan year, elections to use the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances to offset the minimum required contribution for a year, and elections (including deemed elections under paragraph (a)(5) of this section) to reduce the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances for the current plan year), and the presumed adjusted funding target is equal to the interim value of adjusted plan assets for the plan year divided by the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage. As provided in § 1.430(f)-1(e)(1), the rules of § 1.430(f)-1(d)(1)(ii) apply for purposes of determining the amount of the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance that is available for reduction.
(
2
)
Plans with presumed AFTAP deemed under 60 percent.
If paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section does not apply to the plan for a plan year and the last day of the plan year is on or after the first day of the 10th month of the plan year, such that the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year is conclusively presumed to be less than 60 percent under section 436(h)(2) and paragraph (h)(3) of this section, then no reduction in the funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance is required under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B). However, see paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A) of this section for rules for determining the amount of a section 436 contribution that would permit unpredictable contingent event benefits to be paid in such a case.
(
3
)
Treatment of short plan years.
If paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section does not apply to the plan for a plan year but the last day of the plan year is before the first day of the 10th month of the plan year, such that section 436(h)(2) and paragraph (h)(3) of this section did not apply for that plan year, then paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section must be applied as of the first day of the next plan year based on the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage as of that last day of the prior short plan year.
(C)
Change in presumed AFTAP later in the plan year.
If the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year changes during the year, the rules regarding the deemed election to reduce the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section must be reapplied based on the new presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage. This will typically occur on the first day of the 4th month of a plan year, but could happen at a different date if the enrolled actuary certifies the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year during the current plan year. In order to determine the amount of any reduction in the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances that would apply in such a situation, a new presumed adjusted funding target must be established, which is then compared to the updated interim value
of adjusted plan assets. For this purpose, the updated interim value of adjusted plan assets for the plan year is determined as the interim value of adjusted plan assets as of the first day of the plan year updated to take into account contributions for the prior plan year and section 430(f) elections with respect to the plan's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances made before the date of the change in the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage, and the new presumed adjusted funding target is equal to the updated interim value of adjusted plan assets divided by the new presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
(D)
Plans funded below the threshold.
If, after application of paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii) is less than the 60 percent threshold under section 436(e), then no benefit accruals are permitted under the plan unless the plan sponsor makes a section 436 contribution as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.
See
paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section for rules that apply on and after the date the enrolled actuary for the plan issues a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year.
(iii)
Calculation of inclusive presumed AFTAP for application to unpredictable contingent event benefits and plan amendments
—(A)
Requirement to calculate inclusive presumed AFTAP.
For purposes of applying the limitations under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section during the period described in this paragraph (g)(2), an inclusive presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage must be calculated. The inclusive presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the interim value of adjusted plan assets (updated to take into account contributions for the prior plan year, any prior section 436 contributions made for the plan year to the extent not previously taken into account in the interim value of adjusted plan assets for the plan year, and section 430(f) elections with respect to the plan's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances made before the date of the unpredictable contingent event or the date the plan amendment would take effect) to the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target. The inclusive presumed adjusted funding target is calculated as the presumed adjusted funding target determined under paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, increased to take into account—
(
1
) The unpredictable contingent event benefits or plan amendment;
(
2
) Any unpredictable contingent event benefits that are permitted to be paid as a result of any unpredictable contingent event that occurred, or plan amendment that has taken effect, in the prior plan year to the extent not taken into account in the prior plan year adjusted funding target attainment percentage; and
(
3
) Any other unpredictable contingent event benefits that are permitted to be paid as a result of any unpredictable contingent event that occurred, or plan amendment that has taken effect, in the current plan year to the extent not previously taken into account in the presumed adjusted funding target for the plan year.
(B)
Mandatory reduction for collectively bargained plans.
During the period described in this paragraph (g)(2), the rules of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section (relating to the deemed election to reduce the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance) must be applied by treating the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(iii) as if it were the adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
(C)
Optional reduction for plans that are not collectively bargained plans.
A plan sponsor of a plan that is not a collectively bargained plan (and, thus, is not required to reduce the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance under the rules of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section) is permitted to elect to reduce those balances in order to increase the updated interim value of adjusted plan assets that is used to determine the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage under this paragraph (g)(2)(iii).
(D)
Plans funded below the threshold.
If, after application of paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(iii) is less than the applicable threshold under section 436(b) or 436(c), then the plan is not permitted to provide any benefits attributable to the unpredictable contingent event, nor is the plan amendment permitted to take effect, unless the plan sponsor makes a section 436 contribution as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section.
See
paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section for rules that apply on and after the date the enrolled actuary for the plan issues a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year.
(E)
Plans funded at or above the threshold.
If, after application of paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section, the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage is greater than or equal to the applicable threshold under section 436(b) or 436(c), then the plan is not permitted to limit the payment of unpredictable contingent event benefits described in paragraph (b) of this section, nor is the plan permitted to restrict a plan amendment increasing benefit liabilities described in paragraph (c) of this section from taking effect, based on an expectation that the limitations under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section will apply following the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year.
(iv)
Section 436 contributions
—(A)
Plans with presumed AFTAP below 60 percent
—(
1
)
Unpredictable contingent event benefits.
If the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan is less than 60 percent, then unpredictable contingent event benefits are permitted to be paid as a result of an unpredictable contingent event occurring during the period described in this paragraph (g)(2) if the plan sponsor makes the section 436 contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.
(
2
)
Plan amendments.
If the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan is less than 60 percent, then no plan amendment increasing plan liabilities is permitted to take effect during the period described in this paragraph (g)(2). See paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(
3
)
Benefit accruals.
If the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year of less than 60 percent is determined based on the plan's enrolled actuary certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year made during that prior plan year (as opposed to being presumed to be less than 60 percent under the rules of section 436(h)(2) and paragraph (h)(3) of this section because the actuary has not certified the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year before the first day of the 10th month of the prior plan year), then benefits are permitted to accrue if the plan sponsor makes a section 436 contribution in the amount necessary to bring the ratio of the updated interim value of adjusted plan assets to the presumed adjusted funding target up to 60 percent, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section.
(B)
Plan amendments for plans with presumed AFTAP below 80 percent.
If the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan is less than 80 percent, but is not less than 60 percent, then a plan amendment increasing plan liabilities is permitted to take effect during the period described in this paragraph (g)(2) if the plan sponsor makes a section 436 contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.
(C)
Contributions required to reach threshold.
If a plan is described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(D) of this section and neither paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(A) nor (B) of this section apply to the plan, then unpredictable contingent event benefits are permitted to be paid or the plan amendment is permitted to become effective during the period this paragraph (g)(2) applies to the plan only if the plan sponsor makes a section 436 contribution in the amount necessary to bring the ratio of the updated interim value of adjusted plan assets to the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target up to the applicable threshold under section 436(b) or (c), as described in paragraph
(f)(2)(iii)(B) or (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. This paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(C) applies, for example, if an unpredictable contingent event occurs in the case of a plan with a presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage of more than 60 percent where taking into account the unpredictable contingent event benefit in the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target would cause the ratio of the interim value of adjusted plan assets to the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target to be less than 60 percent.
(v)
Bankruptcy of plan sponsor.
Pursuant to section 436(d)(2), during any period in which the plan sponsor of a plan is a debtor in a case under title 11, United States Code, or any similar Federal or State law (as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section), no prohibited payment within the meaning of paragraph (j)(6) of this section may be paid if the plan's enrolled actuary has not yet certified the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year to be at least 100 percent. Thus, the presumption rules of paragraph (h) of this section do not apply for purposes of section 436(d)(2) and this paragraph (g)(2)(v).
(3)
Periods prior to certification during which no presumption applies
—(i)
Prohibited payments and benefit accruals.
If no presumptions under section 436(h) apply to a plan during a period and the plan's enrolled actuary has not yet issued the certification of the plan's actual adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year, the plan is not permitted to limit prohibited payments under paragraph (d) of this section or the accrual of benefits under paragraph (e) of this section based on an expectation that those paragraphs will apply to the plan once an actuarial certification is issued. However, see paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section for a restriction on prohibited payments during any period in which the plan sponsor of a plan is a debtor in a case under title 11, United States Code, or any similar Federal or State law.
(ii)
Unpredictable contingent event benefits and plan amendments increasing benefit liability
—(A)
In general.
If no presumptions under section 436(h) apply to a plan during a period and the plan's enrolled actuary has not yet issued a certification of the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year, the limitations on unpredictable contingent event benefits under paragraph (b) of this section and plan amendments increasing benefit liabilities under paragraph (c) of this section must be applied during that period by following the rules of paragraphs (g)(2)(iii) of this section, based on the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target determined using the prior plan year adjusted funding target attainment percentage. Thus, whether unpredictable contingent event benefits are permitted to be paid or a plan amendment is permitted to take effect during a plan year is determined by calculating the ratio of the interim value of adjusted plan assets to the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target, where the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target is determined by dividing the interim value of adjusted plan assets by the prior plan year adjusted funding target attainment percentage and then adding the adjustments described in paragraphs (g)(2)(iii)(A)(
1
), (
2
) and (
3
) of this section. If, after application of paragraphs (g)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, that ratio is less than the applicable threshold under section 436(b) or 436(c), then the plan is not permitted to provide any benefits attributable to the unpredictable contingent event, nor is the plan amendment permitted to take effect, unless the plan sponsor makes the contribution described in paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(C) of this section.
(B)
Recharacterization of contributions made to avoid benefit limitations.
In any case where, pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the plan sponsor makes section 436 contributions to avoid the application of the applicable benefit limitation, to the extent those contributions would not be needed to permit the payment of the unpredictable contingent event benefits or for the plan amendment to go into effect based on a subsequent certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the current plan year that takes into account the increase in the liability attributable to the unpredictable contingent
event benefits or plan amendment, the excess section 436 contributions are recharacterized as employer contributions taken into account under section 430 for the current plan year.
(4)
Modification of the presumed AFTAP
—(i)
Section 436 contributions.
If, in accordance with the rules of paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, unpredictable contingent event benefits are permitted to be paid, or a plan amendment takes effect, during the plan year because the plan sponsor makes a contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B) or (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, then the presumed adjusted funding target must be adjusted to reflect any increase in the funding target attributable to the unpredictable contingent event benefits or the plan amendment and the interim value of plan assets must be increased by the present value of the contribution. Similarly, if benefit accruals are permitted to resume in a plan year because the plan sponsor makes the contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section, then the presumed adjusted funding target must be adjusted to reflect any increase in the funding target attributable to the benefit accruals for the prior plan year and the interim value of adjusted plan assets must be increased by the present value of the contribution. The adjustment to the presumed adjusted funding target is made as of the date of the contribution, and that date is a section 436 measurement date.
(ii)
Modification of the presumed AFTAP for reduction in balances.
If a plan's funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance is reduced under the rules of paragraph (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this section, then the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year is increased to reflect the higher interim value of adjusted plan assets resulting from the reduction in the funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance. The date of the event that causes the reduction is a section 436 measurement date.
(5)
Periods after certification of AFTAP
—(i)
Plan must follow certified AFTAP
—(A)
In general.
The rules of paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section no longer apply for a plan year on and after the date the enrolled actuary for the plan issues a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year, provided that the certification is issued before the first day of the 10th month of the plan year. For example, the plan must provide that the limitations on prohibited payments apply for distributions with annuity starting dates on and after the date of that certification using the certified adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the plan year. Similarly, the plan must provide that any prohibition on accruals under paragraph (e) of this section as a result of the enrolled actuary's certification that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the plan year is less than 60 percent is effective as of the date of the certification and that any prohibition on accruals ceases to be effective on the date the enrolled actuary issues a certification that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the plan year is at least 60 percent.
(B)
Unpredictable contingent events and plan amendments.
In the case of a plan that has been issued a certification of the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year by the plan's enrolled actuary, the plan sponsor must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for an unpredictable contingent event that occurs or a plan amendment that takes effect on or after the date of the enrolled actuary's certification. Thus, the plan administrator must determine if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage would be at or above the applicable threshold if it were modified to take into account—
(
1
) The unpredictable contingent event or plan amendment;
(
2
) Any other unpredictable contingent event benefits that were permitted to be paid as a result of any unpredictable contingent event that occurred, and any other plan amendment that took effect, earlier during the plan year to the extent not taken into account in the certified adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year; and
(
3
) Any earlier section 436 contributions made for the plan year to the extent those contributions were not taken into account in the certified adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
(C)
Application of rule for deemed election to reduce funding balances.
After the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year is certified by the plan's enrolled actuary, the deemed election to reduce the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances under paragraph (a)(5) of this section must be reapplied based on the actual funding target for the year (provided the certification is issued before the first day of the 10th month of the plan year). The reapplication of the rules under this paragraph (g)(5) regarding the deemed election in paragraph (a)(5) of this section may require an additional reduction in the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances if the amount of the reduction in the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances that is necessary to reach the applicable threshold to avoid the application of a section 436 limitation exceeds the amount that was initially reduced. Prior reductions of the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances continue to apply.
(ii)
Applicability to prior periods
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g)(5)(ii), the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan for the plan year does not affect prior periods. For example, the certification does not affect the application of the limitation under paragraph (d) of this section for distributions with annuity starting dates before the certification or the application of the limitation under paragraph (e) of this section prior to the date of that certification.
See
paragraph (a)(4) of this section for rules relating to the period of time after benefits cease to be limited. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g)(5)(ii), the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan for the plan year does not affect the application of the limitation under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to unpredictable contingent event benefits, or a plan amendment that increases the liability for benefits, where the unpredictable contingent event occurs or the amendment takes effect during the periods to which paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section apply.
(B)
Special rule for unpredictable contingent event benefits.
If a plan does not pay benefits attributable to an unpredictable contingent event because of the application of paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(D) or (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, then the plan must pay the benefits attributable to that event that were not previously paid if such benefits would be permitted under the rules of section 436 based on a certified adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year that takes into account the increase in the funding target that would be attributable to those unpredictable contingent event benefits.
(C)
Special rule for plan amendments that increase liability.
If a plan amendment does not take effect because of the application of paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(D) or (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the plan amendment must go into effect if it would be permitted under the rules of section 436 based on a certified actual adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year that takes into account the increase in the funding target attributable to the plan amendment, unless the plan amendment provides otherwise.
(D)
Ordering rule for multiple unpredictable contingent events or plan amendments.
[Reserved]
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (g). Unless otherwise indicated, these examples are based on the following facts: each plan has a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1; section 436 applies to the plan beginning in 2008; the plan has no funding standard carryover balance; the plan sponsor is not in bankruptcy; no annuity purchases have been made from the plan; and the plan offers a lump sum form of payment. No plan is in at-risk status for the years discussed in the examples. The examples read as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) The plan's certified AFTAP as of January 1, 2010, is 75%. As of January 1, 2011, Plan A has assets of $3,300,000 and a prefunding balance of $300,000. Beginning on January 1, 2011, Plan A's AFTAP for 2011 is presumed to be 75%, under the rules of paragraph (h) of this section and based on the certified AFTAP for 2010.
(ii) Based on Plan A's presumed AFTAP of 75%, Plan A would continue to be subject to the restriction on prohibited payments in paragraph (d)(3) of this section as of January 1, 2011. However, under the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, if the prefunding balance is large enough, Plan A's sponsor is deemed to elect to reduce the prefunding balance to the extent needed to avoid this restriction.
(iii) The amount needed to avoid the restriction in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is determined by comparing the presumed adjusted funding target for Plan A with the interim value of adjusted plan assets as of the valuation date. The interim value of adjusted plan assets for Plan A is $3,000,000 (that is, the asset value of $3,300,000 reduced by the prefunding balance of $300,000). The presumed adjusted funding target for Plan A is the interim value of the adjusted plan assets divided by the presumed AFTAP, or $4,000,000 (that is, $3,000,000 divided by 75%).
(iv) In order to avoid the restriction on prohibited payments in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, Plan A's presumed AFTAP must be increased to 80%. This requires an increase in Plan A's adjusted plan assets of $200,000 (that is, 80% of the presumed adjusted funding target of $4,000,000, minus the interim value of the adjusted plan assets of $3,000,000). Plan A's prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, is reduced by $200,000 under the deemed election provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Accordingly, Plan A's prefunding balance is $100,000 (that is, $300,000 minus $200,000) and the interim value of adjusted plan assets is increased to $3,200,000 (that is, $3,300,000 minus the reduced prefunding balance of $100,000). Pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section, the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for Plan A is redetermined as 80% and Plan A must pay the full amount of the accelerated benefit distributions elected by participants with an annuity starting date of January 1, 2011, or later.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
As of April 1, 2011, the enrolled actuary for Plan A has not certified the 2011 AFTAP. Therefore, beginning April 1, 2011, Plan A's AFTAP is presumed to be reduced by 10 percentage points to 70%, in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Under the provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the deemed election to reduce the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section must be reapplied based on the new presumed AFTAP.
(ii) In accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, a new presumed adjusted funding target must be determined based on the new presumed AFTAP and must be compared to an updated interim value of adjusted plan assets. The new presumed adjusted funding target is $3,200,000 divided by the new presumed AFTAP of 70%, or $4,571,429.
(iii) In order to avoid the restriction on prohibited payments in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, Plan A's presumed AFTAP must be increased to 80%. This requires an additional increase in Plan A's adjusted plan assets of $457,143 (that is, 80% of the new presumed adjusted funding target of $4,571,429, minus the updated interim value of the adjusted plan assets of $3,200,000 reflecting the deemed reduction in Plan A's prefunding balance).
(iv) Plan A's remaining prefunding balance as of January 1, 2011, is only $100,000, which is not enough to avoid the restriction on prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Accordingly, unless Plan A's sponsor utilizes one of the methods described in paragraph (f) of this section to avoid the restriction, Plan A is subject to the restriction on prohibited payments in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and cannot pay accelerated benefit distributions elected by participants with an annuity starting date of April 1, 2011, or later.
(v) Plan A's prefunding balance remains at $100,000 because, under paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, the deemed reduction rules do not apply if the prefunding balance is not large enough to increase the adjusted value of plan assets enough to avoid the restriction. However, the earlier deemed reduction of $200,000 continues to apply because all elections (including deemed elections) to reduce a plan's funding standard carryover balance or prefunding balance are irrevocable and must be unconditional in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
On July 1, 2011, the enrolled actuary for Plan A calculates the actual adjusted funding target as $3,700,000 as of January 1, 2011. Therefore, the 2011 AFTAP would have been 81.08% without reducing the prefunding balance (that is, plan assets of $3,300,000 minus the prefunding balance of $300,000, divided by the adjusted funding target of $3,700,000), and Plan A would not have been subject to the restrictions under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(ii) However, paragraph (g)(5)(i)(C) of this section requires that any prior reductions in the prefunding or funding standard carryover balances continue to apply, and so Plan A's prefunding balance remains at the reduced amount of $100,000 as of January 1, 2011. The enrolled actuary certifies that the 2011
AFTAP is 86.49% (that is, plan assets of $3,300,000 reduced by the prefunding balance of $100,000, divided by the adjusted funding target of $3,700,000).

# Example 4.
(i) Plan B is a collectively bargained plan with assets of $2,500,000 and a prefunding balance of $150,000 as of January 1, 2011. On August 14, 2010, the enrolled actuary for Plan B certified the AFTAP for 2010 to be 83%. No unpredictable contingent events giving rise to unpredictable contingent event benefits occurred during 2010 and no plan amendments took effect in 2010 that were not taken into account in the certified AFTAP.
(ii) On January 10, 2011, Plan B's sponsor amends the plan to increase benefits effective on February 1, 2011. The amendment would increase Plan B's funding target by $350,000. Under the rules of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the determination of whether the amendment is permitted to take effect is based on a comparison of the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target with the updated interim value of adjusted plan assets.
(iii) Plan B's interim value of adjusted plan assets as of the valuation date is $2,350,000 (that is, $2,500,000 minus the prefunding balance of $150,000). Prior to reflecting the amendment, Plan B's presumed adjusted funding target as of January 1, 2011, is $2,831,325, which is equal to the interim value of adjusted plan assets as of the valuation date of $2,350,000, divided by the presumed AFTAP of 83%. Increasing Plan B's presumed adjusted funding target by $350,000 to reflect the amendment results in an inclusive presumed adjusted funding target of $3,181,325 and would result in a presumed AFTAP of 73.87% (that is, the interim value of adjusted plan assets as of the valuation date of $2,350,000 divided by the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target of $3,181,325).
(iv) Because Plan B's presumed AFTAP was over 80% prior to taking the amendment into account but would be less than 80% if the amendment were taken into account, section 436(c) and paragraph (c) of this section prohibit the plan amendment from taking effect unless the adjusted plan assets are increased so that the inclusive presumed AFTAP would be increased to 80%. This would require an additional amount of $195,060 (that is, 80% of the inclusive presumed adjusted funding target of $3,181,325 less the interim value of adjusted plan assets of $2,350,000).
(v) Plan B's prefunding balance of $150,000 is not large enough for Plan B to avoid the restriction on plan amendments, and therefore the deemed election to reduce the prefunding balance under paragraph (a)(5) of this section does not apply, and the amendment cannot take effect unless the plan sponsor makes a contribution described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except that Plan B's sponsor decides to make a contribution on February 1, 2011, to avoid the benefit limitation as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. As of February 1, 2011, Plan B's effective interest rate for the 2011 plan year has not yet been determined. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section, Plan B's effective interest rate for 2011 is treated as 6.25%, which is the largest of the three segment interest rates applicable to the 2011 plan year, as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section.
(ii) The amount of the contribution as of January 1, 2011, needed to avoid the restriction on plan amendments under paragraph (c) of this section is $195,060. However, because the contribution is not paid until February 1, 2011, the necessary contribution amount must be adjusted to reflect interest that would otherwise have accrued between the valuation date and the date of the contribution, at Plan B's effective interest rate for the 2011 plan year. The amount of the required contribution after adjustment is $196,048, determined as $195,060 increased for one month of compound interest at an effective annual interest rate of 6.25%.
(iii) In accordance with paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, the inclusive presumed AFTAP as of February 1, 2011, is 80 percent.

# Example 6.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 5.
As of April 1, 2011, the enrolled actuary for the plan has not certified the 2011 AFTAP. Beginning April 1, 2011, Plan A's presumed AFTAP is equal to be 70%, 10 percentage points lower than the inclusive presumed AFTAP as of February 1, 2011, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2)(iii)(A) and (h)(2) of this section. On July 1, 2011, the enrolled actuary for the plan calculates the actual adjusted funding target, prior to taking the plan amendment into account, as $2,700,000, and determines the actual effective interest rate for 2011 to be 5.25%. On this basis, the actual AFTAP for 2011 (prior to taking the amendment into account) as 87.04% (that is, adjusted assets of $2,350,000 divided by the adjusted funding target of $2,700,000). Reflecting the $350,000 increase in funding target due to the plan amendment would increase the adjusted funding target to $3,050,000 and would decrease Plan B's AFTAP to 77.05%.
(ii) Based on the calculated adjusted funding target, the amount that was necessary to avoid the benefit restriction under paragraph (c) of this section was $90,000 (that is, 80% of the adjusted funding target reflecting the plan amendment (or $3,050,000), minus the adjusted value of plan assets of $2,350,000). This amount must be adjusted for interest between the valuation date and the date the contribution was made using the effective interest rate for Plan B. Therefore, the amount required on the payment date of
February 1, 2011, was $90,385 (that is, $90,000 adjusted for compound interest for one month at Plan B's effective interest rate of 5.25% per year).
(iii) Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the contribution made on February 1, 2011, is recharacterized as an employer contribution under section 430 to the extent that it exceeded the amount necessary to avoid application of the restriction on plan amendments under paragraph (c) of this section. Therefore, $105,663 (that is, the $196,048 actual contribution paid on February 1, 2011, minus the $90,385 required contribution based on the actual AFTAP) is recharacterized as an employer contribution under section 430 for the 2011 plan year. As such, it may be applied toward the minimum required contribution for 2011, or the plan sponsor can elect to credit the contribution to Plan B's prefunding balance to the extent that the contributions for the 2011 plan year exceed the minimum required contribution.
(iv) This recharacterization applied only because the 436 contribution was made during a period prior to the certification of Plan B's actual AFTAP for 2011 and during which no presumption applied (that is, when section 436 is applied based on the 2010 AFTAP, which was high enough that no restrictions applied for 2010). If the contribution had been made during a time when the presumptions applied (for instance, after April 1, 2011, when the presumed AFTAP was under 80%) then the only portion of the 436 contribution that would be recharacterized as an employer contribution under section 430 would be the portion of the interest adjustment attributable to the difference between the highest segment rate (6.25%) and the plan's actual effective interest rate (5.25%), in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section.
(v) After reflecting the plan amendment and the present value of the portion of the section 436 contribution that is not recharacterized as an employer contribution under section 430, the adjusted assets as of January 1, 2011, for purposes of section 436 are $2,440,000 ($2,350,000 plus $90,000) and the inclusive adjusted funding target is $3,050,000. Accordingly, the enrolled actuary certifies the inclusive AFTAP for 2011 as 80% ($2,440,00 ÷ $3,050,000). Note that assets for section 430 purposes are not increased to reflect the section 436 contribution as of January 1, 2011.

# Example 7.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 6,
except that on July 1, 2011, the enrolled actuary for Plan B calculates the actual adjusted funding target (before reflecting the plan amendment) as $3,000,000 and certifies the actual AFTAP as 78.33% prior to reflecting the plan amendment (that is, adjusted plan assets of $2,350,000 divided by the actual adjusted funding target of $3,000,000). Based on the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, because the AFTAP prior to reflecting the amendment is less than 80%, the contribution required to avoid the restriction on plan amendments would have been the amount equal to the increase in funding target due to the plan amendment, or $350,000.
(ii) However, according to paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, the enrolled actuary's certification of the 2011 AFTAP does not affect the application of the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section to the amendment, because the amendment to Plan B took effect prior to the date of the certification. Therefore, it is not necessary for Plan B's sponsor to contribute an additional amount in order for the plan amendment to remain in effect regardless of the extent to which the certified AFTAP for the plan year is less than the presumed inclusive AFTAP.
(h)
Presumed underfunding for purposes of benefit limitations
—(1)
Presumption of continued underfunding
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (h)(1) applies to a plan for a plan year if a limitation under paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section applied to the plan on the last day of the preceding plan year. If this paragraph (h)(1) applies to a plan, the first day of the plan year is a section 436 measurement date and the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan is the percentage under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, whichever applies to the plan, beginning on that first day of the plan year and ending on the date specified in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section.
(ii)
Rule where preceding year certification issued during preceding year
—(A)
General rule.
In any case in which the plan's enrolled actuary has issued a certification under paragraph (h)(4) of this section of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year preceding the current plan year before the first day of the current plan year, the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year is equal to the prior plan year adjusted funding target attainment percentage until it is changed under paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section.
(B)
Special rule for late certifications.
If the certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year occurred after the first day of the 10th month of that prior plan year, the plan is treated as if
no such certification was made, unless the certification took into account the effect of any unpredictable contingent event benefits that are permitted to be paid based on unpredictable contingent events that occurred, and any plan amendments that became effective, during the prior plan year but before the certification (and any associated section 436 contributions).
(iii)
No certification for preceding year issued during preceding year
—(A)
Deemed percentage continues.
In any case in which the plan's enrolled actuary has not issued a certification under paragraph (h)(4) of this section of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the plan year preceding the current plan year during that prior plan year, the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year is equal to the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage that applied on the last day of the preceding plan year until the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage is changed under paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(B) or (h)(1)(iv) of this section. Thus, if the prior plan year was a 12-month plan year (so that the last day of the plan year was after the first day of the 10th month of the plan year and the rules of section 436(h)(2) and paragraph (h)(3) of this section applied to the plan for that plan year), then the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the current plan year is presumed to be less than 60 percent. By contrast, if the prior plan year was less than 9 months, the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the current plan year is the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage at the last day of the preceding plan year.
(B)
Enrolled actuary's certification in following year.
In any case in which the plan's enrolled actuary has issued the certification under paragraph (h)(4) of this section of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the plan year preceding the current plan year on or after the first day of the current plan year, the date of that prior plan year certification is a new section 436 measurement date for the current plan year. In such a case, the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the current plan year is equal to the prior plan year adjusted funding target attainment percentage (reduced by 10 percentage points if paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section applies to the plan) until it is changed under paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section. The rules of paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section apply for purposes of determining whether the enrolled actuary has issued a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year during the current plan year.
(iv)
Duration of use of presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
If this paragraph (h)(1) applies to a plan for a plan year, the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage determined under this paragraph (h)(1) applies until the earliest of—
(A) The first day of the 4th month of the plan year if paragraph (h)(2) of this section applies;
(B) The first day of the 10th month of the plan year if paragraph (h)(3) of this section applies;
(C) The date of a change in the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (g)(4) of this section; or
(D) The date the enrolled actuary issues a certification under paragraph (h)(4) of this section of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year.
(2)
Presumption of underfunding beginning on first day of 4th month for certain underfunded plans
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (h)(2) applies to a plan for a plan year if—
(A) The enrolled actuary for the plan has not issued a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year before the first day of the 4th month of the plan year; and
(B) The plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the preceding plan year was either—
(
1
) At least 60 percent but less than 70 percent; or
(
2
) At least 80 percent but less than 90 percent.
(ii)
Special rule for first plan year a plan is subject to section 436.
This paragraph (h)(2) also applies to a plan for the first effective plan year if—
(A) The enrolled actuary for the plan has not issued a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year before the first day of the 4th month of the plan year; and
(B) The prior plan year adjusted funding target attainment percentage is at least 70 percent but less than 80 percent.
(iii)
Presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
If this paragraph (h)(2) applies to a plan for a plan year and the date of the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (h)(4) of this section for the prior plan year (taking into account the special rules for late certifications under paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section) occurred before the first day of the 4th month of the current plan year, then, commencing on the first day of the 4th month of the current plan year—
(A) The presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the plan year is reduced by 10 percentage points; and
(B) The first day of the 4th month of the plan year is a section 436 measurement date.
(iv)
Certification for prior plan year.
If this paragraph (h)(2) applies to a plan and the date of the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (h)(4) of this section for the prior plan year (taking into account the rules for late certifications under paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section) occurs on or after the first day of the 4th month of the current plan year, then, commencing on the date of that prior plan year certification—
(A) The presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year is equal to 10 percentage points less than the prior plan year adjusted funding target attainment percentage; and
(B) The date of the prior plan year certification is a section 436 measurement date.
(v)
Duration of use of presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
If this paragraph (h)(2) applies to a plan for a plan year, the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage determined under this paragraph (h)(2) applies until the earliest of—
(A) The first day of the 10th month of the plan year if paragraph (h)(3) of this section applies;
(B) The date of a change in the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (g)(4) of this section; or
(C) The date the enrolled actuary issues a certification under paragraph (h)(4) of this section of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year.
(3)
Presumption of underfunding beginning on first day of 10th month.
In any case in which no certification of the specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the current plan year under paragraph (h)(4) of this section is made with respect to the plan before the first day of the 10th month of the plan year, then, commencing on the first day of the 10th month of the current plan year—
(i) The presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the plan year is presumed to be less than 60 percent; and
(ii) The first day of the 10th month of the plan year is a section 436 measurement date.
(4)
Certification of AFTAP
—(i)
Rules generally applicable to certifications
—(A)
In general.
The enrolled actuary's certification referred to in this section must be made in writing, must be signed and dated to show the date of the signature, must be provided to the plan administrator, and, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section, must certify the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year. Except in the case of a range certification described in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section, the certification must set forth the value of plan assets, the prefunding balance, the funding standard carryover balance, the value of the funding target used in the determination, the aggregate amount of annuity purchases included in the adjusted value of plan assets and the adjusted funding target, the unpredictable contingent event benefits permitted to be paid for unpredictable contingent
events that occurred during the current plan year that were taken into account for the current plan year (including any associated section 436 contributions), the plan amendments that took effect in the current plan year that were taken into account for the current plan year (including any associated section 436 contributions), any benefit accruals that were restored for the plan year (including any section 436 contributions), and any other relevant factors. The actuarial assumptions and funding methods used in the calculation for the certification must be the actuarial assumptions and funding methods used for the plan for purposes of determining the minimum required contributions under section 430 for the plan year.
(B)
Determination of plan assets.
For purposes of making any determination of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage under this section, the determination is not permitted to include in plan assets contributions that have not been made to the plan by the certification date. Thus, the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year cannot take into account contributions that are expected to be made after the certification date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for plan years beginning before January 1, 2009, the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage is permitted to take into account employer contributions for the prior plan year that are reasonably expected to be made for that prior plan year but have not been contributed by the date of the enrolled actuary's certification. See paragraphs (h)(4)(iii) and (v) of this section for rules relating to changes in the certified percentage.
(ii)
Special rules for certification within range
—(A)
In general.
Under this paragraph (h)(4)(ii), the plan's enrolled actuary is permitted to certify during a plan year that the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for that plan year either is less than 60 percent, is 60 percent or higher (but is less than 80 percent), is 80 percent or higher, or is 100 percent or higher. If the enrolled actuary has issued such a range certification for a plan year and the enrolled actuary subsequently issues a certification of the specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan before the end of that plan year, then the certification of the specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage is treated as a change in the applicable percentage to which paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section applies.
(B)
Effect of range certification before certification of specific percentage.
If a plan's enrolled actuary issues a range certification pursuant to this paragraph (h)(4)(ii), then, for purposes of this section (including application of the limitations of sections 436(b) and (c), contributions described in sections 436(b)(2), 436(c)(2), and 436(e)(2), and the mandatory reduction of the prefunding and funding standard carryover balances under paragraph (a)(5) of this section), the plan is treated as having a certified percentage at the smallest value within the applicable range until a certification of the plan's specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year has been issued under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section. However, if the plan's enrolled actuary has issued a range certification for the plan year but does not issue a certification of the specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan by the last day of that plan year, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan is retroactively deemed to be less than 60 percent as of the first day of the 10th month of the plan year.
(C)
Effect of range certification on and after certification of specific percentage.
Once the certification of the specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage is issued by the plan's enrolled actuary, the certified percentage applies for all purposes of this section on and after the date of that certification. If the plan sponsor made section 436 contributions to avoid application of a benefit limitation during the period a range certification was in effect, those section 436 contributions are recharacterized as employer contributions under section 430 to the extent the contributions exceed the amount necessary to avoid application
of a limitation based on the specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage as certified by the plan's enrolled actuary on or before the last day of the plan year.
(iii)
Change of certified percentage
—(A)
Application of new percentage.
If the enrolled actuary for the plan provides a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the plan year under this paragraph (h)(4) (including a range certification) and that certified percentage is superseded by a subsequent determination of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for that plan year, then, except to the extent provided in paragraph (h)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, that later percentage must be applied for the portion of the plan year beginning on the date of the earlier certification. The subsequent determination could be the correction of a prior incorrect certification or it could be an update of a prior correct certification to take into account subsequent facts under the rules of paragraph (h)(4)(v) of this section. The implications of such a change depend on whether the change is a material change or an immaterial change.
See
paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section.
(B)
Material change.
A change in a plan's certified adjusted funding target attainment percentage constitutes a material change for a plan year if plan operations with respect to benefits that are addressed by section 436, taking into account any actual contributions and elections under section 430(f) made by the plan sponsor based on the prior certified percentage, would have been different based on the subsequent determination of the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year. A change in a plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year can be a material change even if the only impact of the change occurs in the following plan year under the rules for determining the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage in that following year.
(C)
Immaterial change.
In general, an immaterial change is any change in an adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year that is not a material change. In addition, subject to the requirement to recertify the adjusted funding target attainment percentage in paragraph (h)(4)(v)(B) of this section, a change in adjusted funding target attainment percentage is deemed to be an immaterial change if it merely reflects a change in the funding target for the plan year or the value of the adjusted plan assets after the date of the enrolled actuary's certification resulting from—
(
1
) Additional contributions for the preceding year that are made by the plan sponsor;
(
2
) The plan sponsor's election to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance;
(
3
) The plan sponsor's election to apply the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance to offset the prior plan year's minimum required contribution;
(
4
) A change in funding method or actuarial assumptions, where such change required actual approval of the Commissioner (rather than deemed approval);
(
5
) Unpredictable contingent event benefits which are permitted to be paid because the employer makes the section 436 contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section;
(
6
) Unpredictable contingent event benefits which are permitted to be paid because the plan's enrolled actuary determines that the increase in the funding target attributable to the occurrence of the unpredictable contingent event would not cause the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage to fall below 60 percent;
(
7
) A plan amendment which takes effect because the employer makes the section 436 contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, the liability for which was not taken into account in the certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage;
(
8
) A plan amendment which takes effect because the plan's enrolled actuary determines that the increase in the funding target attributable to the plan amendment would not cause the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage to fall below 80 percent, the liability for which was not taken into
account in the certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage; or
(
9
) Any other event prescribed in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(iv)
Effect of change in percentage
—(A)
Material change.
In the case of a material change, if the plan's prior operations were in accordance with the prior certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year (rather than the actual adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year), then the plan will not have satisfied the requirements of section 401(a)(29) and section 436. Even if the plan's prior operations were in accordance with the subsequent certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage, the plan will not have satisfied the qualification requirements of section 401(a) because the plan will not have been operated in accordance with its terms during the period of time the prior certification applied. In addition, in the case of a material change, the rules requiring application of a presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage under paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(3) of this section continue to apply from and after the date of the prior certification until the date of the subsequent certification.
(B)
Immaterial change.
An immaterial change in the adjusted funding target attainment percentage applies prospectively only and does not change the inapplicability of the presumptions under paragraphs (h)(1), (2), and (3) of this section prior to the date of the later certification.
(v)
Rules relating to updated certification
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (h)(4)(v) sets forth rules relating to updates of an actuary's certification of the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year. Paragraphs (h)(4)(v)(B) and (D) of this section require that an updated adjusted funding target attainment percentage be certified in certain situations. Even if the updated adjusted funding target attainment percentage is not required to be certified, plan administrators may request that the actuary prepare an updated certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage, as described in paragraphs (h)(4)(v)(C) and (E) of this section. Any updated adjusted funding target attainment percentage determined under this paragraph (h)(4)(v) will apply beginning as of the date of the event that gave rise to the need for the update which is a section 436 measurement date. Thus, pursuant to this paragraph (h)(4)(v), the updated funding target attainment percentage applies thereafter for all purposes of section 436, including application with respect to unpredictable contingent events occurring on or after the measurement date (but not for unpredictable contingent events that occurred before such measurement date or for benefits with annuity starting dates before that measurement date). The updated adjusted funding target attainment percentage will continue to apply for the remainder of the plan year and will be used for the presumed adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the next plan year, unless there is a later updated certification of adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year.
(B)
Requirement to recertify AFTAP if plan sponsor contributes to threshold.
If, during the plan year, unpredictable contingent event benefits are permitted to be paid, a plan amendment takes effect, or benefits are permitted to accrue because the plan sponsor makes a contribution described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B), (f)(2)(iv)(B), or (f)(2)(v) of this section, then, in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the plan's enrolled actuary must issue an updated certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage that takes into account such contribution as well as the liability for unpredictable contingent event benefits that are permitted to be paid, plan amendments that take effect during the plan year, and restored benefits.
(C)
Optional recertification of AFTAP after other unpredictable contingent event or plan amendment.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(4)(v)(D) of this section, if, during a plan year, unpredictable contingent event benefits are permitted to be paid, or a plan amendment takes effect, because either the plan sponsor makes a contribution described
in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) or (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or the plan's enrolled actuary determines that the increase in the funding target attributable to the occurrence of the unpredictable contingent event or the plan amendment would not cause the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage to fall below the applicable 60 percent or 80 percent threshold (taking into account the occurrence of all previous unpredictable contingent event benefits and plan amendments to the extent not already reflected in the certified adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year (or update)), then the plan administrator may request that the plan actuary issue an updated certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage that takes into account the unpredictable contingent event benefits or plan amendments and any associated section 436 contribution.
(D)
Requirement to recertify AFTAP after deemed immaterial change.
If a change in the adjusted funding target attainment percentage as a result of one of the items listed in paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(C) of this section would be a material change, then the change is treated as an immaterial change only if the plan's enrolled actuary recertifies the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year as soon as practicable after the event that gives rise to the change.
(E)
Optional recertification after other immaterial change.
If a change in the adjusted funding target attainment percentage is immaterial, then the plan administrator may request that the plan actuary issue an updated certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage that takes into account the unpredictable contingent event benefits or plan amendments and any associated section 436 contribution.
(5)
Examples of rules of paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2), and (h)(3) of this section.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2), and (h)(3) of this section. Unless otherwise indicated, the examples in this section are based on the information in this paragraph (h)(5). Each plan is a non-collectively bargained defined benefit plan with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1. The plan year is subject to section 436 in 2008. The plan does not have a funding standard carryover balance or a prefunding balance as of any of the dates mentioned, and the plan sponsor does not elect to utilize any of the methods in paragraph (f) of this section to avoid applicable benefit restrictions. No range certification under paragraph (h)(4) of this section has been issued. The plan sponsor is not in bankruptcy. The examples read as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) On July 15, 2010, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage (“AFTAP”) for Plan T for 2010 is certified to be 65%. Based on this AFTAP, Plan T is subject to the restriction on prohibited payments in paragraph (d)(3) of this section for the remainder of 2010.
(ii) Beginning January 1, 2011, Plan T's AFTAP for 2011 is presumed to be equal to the AFTAP for 2010, or 65%, under the provisions of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the restriction on prohibited payments in paragraph (d)(3) of this section continues to apply.
(iii) On March 1, 2011, the enrolled actuary for the plan certifies that the actual AFTAP for 2011 is 80%. Therefore, beginning March 1, 2011, Plan T is no longer subject to the restriction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and so Plan T resumes paying the full amount of any prohibited payments elected by participants with an annuity starting date of March 1, 2011, or later.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the enrolled actuary for the plan does not certify the AFTAP for 2011 until June 1, 2011, when it is certified to be 66%.
(ii) Beginning January 1, 2011, Plan T's AFTAP for 2011 is presumed to be equal to the AFTAP for 2010, or 65%, under the provisions of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the restriction on prohibited payments in paragraph (d)(3) of this section continues to apply.
(iii) Pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, beginning April 1, 2011, the AFTAP for 2011 is presumed to be 55% (10 percentage points less than the AFTAP for 2010). Plan T is subject to the restriction on prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for annuity starting dates on or after April 1, 2011. In addition, Plan T is subject to the restriction on unpredictable contingent event benefits under paragraph (b) of this section for unpredictable contingent events occurring on or after April 1, 2011 and benefits are required to be frozen on and after April 1, 2011 under paragraph (e) of this section.
(iv) Once the enrolled actuary for the plan certifies that the AFTAP for 2011 for Plan T
is 66%, Plan T is no longer subject to the restriction under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but it is subject to the restriction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Plan T must resume paying prohibited payments, as restricted under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, for participants who elect benefits in accelerated forms of payment and who have an annuity starting date of June 1, 2011, or later. In addition, Plan T must provide benefits for any unpredictable contingent event occurring on or after January 1, 2011, to the extent permitted under paragraph (b) of this section. Similarly, Plan T is no longer subject to the restriction on benefit accruals under paragraph (e) of this section, and benefit accruals resume under Plan T beginning June 1, 2011, unless Plan T provides otherwise.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the enrolled actuary for the plan does not certify the 2011 AFTAP until November 15, 2011. Beginning October 1, 2011, Plan T is conclusively presumed to have an AFTAP of less than 60%, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (h)(3) of this section. Accordingly, Plan T is subject to the restrictions in paragraphs (b), (d)(1), and (e) of this section commencing on October 1, 2011.
(ii) On November 15, 2011, the enrolled actuary for the plan certifies that the AFTAP for 2011 is 72%. However, because the certification occurred after September 30, 2011, the certification does not constitute a new section 436 measurement date, and Plan T continues to be subject to the restrictions on unpredictable contingent event benefits, prohibited payments, and benefit accruals under paragraphs (b), (d)(1), and (e) of this section.
(iii) Beginning January 1, 2012, the 2012 AFTAP for Plan T is presumed to be equal to the 2011 AFTAP of 72%. Because the presumed 2012 AFTAP is between 70% and 80% and, therefore, paragraph (h)(2) of this section (which provides for a 10 percentage point reduction in a plan's AFTAP in certain cases) will not apply, the presumed AFTAP will remain at 72% until the plan's enrolled actuary certifies the AFTAP for 2012 or until paragraph (h)(3) of this section applies on the first day of the 10th month of the plan year. Because the presumed AFTAP is 72%, Plan T is no longer subject to the restrictions on prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and Plan T must provide benefits for any unpredictable contingent event occurring on or after January 1, 2012, to the extent permitted under paragraph (b) of this section and must resume paying prohibited payments, as restricted under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, that are elected by participants with annuity starting dates on or after January 1, 2012. Similarly, Plan T is no longer subject to the restriction on benefit accruals under paragraph (e) of this section, and benefit accruals resume under Plan T beginning January 1, 2012, unless Plan T provides otherwise.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that the enrolled actuary for the plan does not issue a certification of the AFTAP for 2011 for Plan T until February 1, 2012.
(ii) Beginning on January 1, 2012, the presumptions in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section apply for the 2012 plan year. Because the enrolled actuary for the plan has not certified the AFTAP for 2011, the presumed AFTAP as of October 1, 2011, continues to apply for the period beginning January 1, 2012. Therefore, the AFTAP as of January 1, 2012, is presumed to be less than 60%, and Plan T continues to be subject to the restrictions on unpredictable contingent event benefits under paragraph (b) of this section, prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and benefit accruals under paragraph (e) of this section.
(iii) On February 1, 2012, the enrolled actuary for the plan certifies that the AFTAP for 2011 for Plan T is 65%. Because the enrolled actuary for the plan has not issued a certification of the AFTAP for 2012, the provisions of paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(B) of this section apply. Accordingly, the certification date for the 2011 AFTAP (February 1, 2012) is a section 436 measurement date and 65% is the presumed AFTAP for 2012 beginning on that date.
(iv) Because the presumed AFTAP is over 60% but less than 80%, the full restriction on prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(1) of this section no longer applies; however, the partial restriction on prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies beginning on February 1, 2012. Therefore, Plan T must pay a portion of the prohibited payments elected by participants with annuity starting dates on or after February 1, 2012. Furthermore, based on the presumed AFTAP of 65%, the restriction on unpredictable contingent event benefits under paragraph (b) of this section ceases to apply for events occurring on or after February 1, 2012, to the extent permitted under paragraph (b) of this section and the restriction on benefit accruals under paragraph (e) of this section no longer applies so that, unless Plan T provides otherwise, benefit accruals will resume as of February 1, 2012.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that the enrolled actuary for the plan does not issue a certification of the actual AFTAP for Plan T as of January 1, 2011, until May 1, 2012.
(ii) Beginning on January 1, 2012, the presumptions in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section apply for the 2012 plan year. Because the enrolled actuary for the plan has not certified the actual AFTAP as of January 1, 2011, the presumed AFTAP as of October 1, 2011, continues to apply for the period beginning January 1, 2012. Therefore, the AFTAP
as of January 1, 2012, is presumed to be less than 60%, and Plan T continues to be subject to the restrictions on unpredictable contingent event benefits under paragraph (b) of this section, on prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and on benefit accruals under paragraph (e) of this section.
(iii) Since the enrolled actuary for the plan has not issued a certification of the actual AFTAP as of January 1, 2011, the rules of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section apply beginning April 1, 2012, and the AFTAP is presumed to remain less than 60%. Plan T continues to be subject to the restrictions on unpredictable contingent event benefits under paragraph (b) of this section, on prohibited payments under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and on benefit accruals under paragraph (e) of this section.
(iv) On May 1, 2012, the enrolled actuary for the plan certifies that the actual AFTAP for 2011 for Plan T is 65%. Because the enrolled actuary for the plan has not issued a certification of the actual AFTAP as of January 1, 2012, the provisions of paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section apply. Accordingly, on May 1, 2012, the 2012 AFTAP is presumed to be 10 percentage points less than the 2011 AFTAP, or 55%, so that the restrictions under paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section continue to apply.

# Example 6.
(i) The enrolled actuary for Plan V certifies the plan's AFTAP for 2010 to be 69%. Based on this AFTAP, Plan V is subject to the restriction in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and can only pay a portion (generally 50%) of the prohibited payments otherwise due to plan participants who commence benefits while the restriction is in effect. The enrolled actuary for the plan does not issue a certification of the AFTAP for 2011 until June 1, 2011.
(ii) Beginning January 1, 2011, Plan V's 2011 AFTAP is presumed to be equal to the 2010 AFTAP, or 69%, under the provisions of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the restriction on prohibited payments in paragraph (d)(3) of this section continues to apply from January 1, 2011, through March 31, 2011, and Plan T may only pay a portion of the prohibited payments otherwise due to participants who commence benefit payments during this period.
(iii) Beginning April 1, 2011, the provisions of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section apply. Under those provisions, the AFTAP beginning April 1, 2011, is presumed to be 10 percentage points lower than the presumed 2011 AFTAP, or 59%. Because Plan V's presumed AFTAP for 2011 is less than 60%, the restrictions on unpredictable contingent event benefits under paragraph (b) of this section, on the payment of accelerated benefit distributions under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and on benefit accruals under paragraph (e) of this section apply. Accordingly, Plan V cannot pay any unpredictable contingent event benefits for events occurring on or after April 1, 2011, or prohibited payments to participants with an annuity starting date on or after April 1, 2011, and benefit accruals cease as of April 1, 2011.
(iv) On June 1, 2011, Plan V's enrolled actuary certifies that the plan's AFTAP for 2011 is 71%. Therefore, the restrictions on unpredictable contingent event benefits, prohibited payments, and benefit accruals in paragraphs (b), (d)(1), and (e) of this section no longer apply, but the partial restriction on benefit payments in paragraph (d)(3) of this section does apply. Accordingly, Plan V begins paying unpredictable contingent event benefits for events occurring on or after January 1, 2011, to the extent permitted under paragraph (b) of this section and a portion of the prohibited payments elected by participants with an annuity starting date on or after June 1, 2011. Benefit accruals previously restricted under paragraph (e) of this section resume effective June 1, 2011, unless Plan V provides otherwise.
(v) Participants who were not able to elect an accelerated form of payment during the period from April 1, 2011, through May 31, 2011, would be able to elect a new annuity starting date with a partial distribution of accelerated benefits effective June 1, 2011, if Plan V contained a preexisting provision permitting such an election after the restriction in paragraph (d)(1) of this section no longer applies. This is permitted because, under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, a preexisting provision of this type is not considered a plan amendment and is therefore not subject to the plan amendment restriction in paragraph (c) of this section even though Plan V's AFTAP for 2011 is less than 80%.
(vi) Benefit accruals for the period beginning April 1, 2011, through May 31, 2011, would be automatically restored if Plan V contained a preexisting provision to retroactively restore benefit accruals restricted under paragraph (e) of this section after the restriction no longer applies. This is permitted because under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, a preexisting provision of this type is not considered to be a plan amendment and is therefore not subject to the plan amendment restriction in paragraph (c) of this section even though Plan V's AFTAP for 2011 is less than 80%, because the period of the restriction did not exceed 12 months.
(6)
Examples of rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) Plan Y is a non-collectively bargained defined benefit plan with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1. Plan Y does not
have a funding standard carryover balance or a prefunding balance. Plan Y's sponsor is not in bankruptcy. In June of 2010, the actual AFTAP for 2010 for Plan Y is certified as 65%. On the last day of the 2010 plan year, Plan Y is subject to the restrictions in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(ii) The enrolled actuary for the plan issues a range certification on March 21, 2011, certifying that the AFTAP for 2011 is at least 60% and less than 80%. Because the certification was issued before the first day of the 4th month of the plan year, the 10 percentage point reduction in the presumed AFTAP under paragraph (h)(2) of this section does not apply. In addition, because the enrolled actuary for the plan has certified that the AFTAP is within this range, Plan Y is not subject to the full restriction on accelerated benefit payments in paragraph (d)(1) of this section or the restriction on benefit accruals under paragraph (e) of this section.
(iii) On August 1, 2011, the enrolled actuary for the plan certifies that the actual AFTAP as of January 1, 2011, is 75.86%. This AFTAP falls within the previously certified range. Thus, the change is immaterial under paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section and the new certification does not change the applicability or inapplicability of the restrictions in this section.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the plan sponsor makes an additional contribution for the 2010 plan year on September 1, 2011, that is not added to the prefunding balance. Reflecting this contribution, the enrolled actuary for the plan issues a revised certification stating that the AFTAP for 2011 is 81%, and Plan Y is no longer subject to the restriction on accelerated benefit payments under paragraph (d)(3) of this section on that date.
(ii) Although the revised certification changes the applicability of the restriction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the change is not a material change under paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section because the AFTAP changed only because of additional contributions for the preceding year made by the plan sponsor after the date of the enrolled actuary's initial certification.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Adjusted funding target attainment percentage
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (j)(1), the
adjusted funding target attainment percentage
for a plan year is the fraction (expressed as a percentage)—
(A) The numerator of which is the adjusted plan assets for the plan year described in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section; and
(B) The denominator of which is the adjusted funding target for the plan year described in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Adjusted plan assets
—(A)
General rule.
The adjusted plan assets for a plan year is generally determined by—
(
1
) Subtracting the plan's funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance as of the valuation date from the value of plan assets for the plan year under section 430(g) (but treating the resulting value as zero if it is below zero); and
(
2
) Increasing the resulting value by the aggregate amount of purchases of annuities for participants and beneficiaries (other than participants who, at the time of the purchase, were highly compensated employees as defined in section 414(q), which definition includes highly compensated former employees under § 1.414(q)-1T, Q
A-4) which were made by the plan during the preceding 2 plan years, to the extent not included in plan assets for purposes of section 430.
(B)
Special rule for plans that are fully funded without regard to subtraction of funding balances from plan assets.
If for a plan year the value of plan assets determined without subtracting the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance is not less than 100 percent of the plan's funding target determined under section 430 without regard to section 430(i), then the adjusted value of plan assets used in the calculation of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year is determined without subtracting the plan's funding standard carryover balance and prefunding balance from the value of plan assets for the plan year.
(C)
Special rule for plans with section 436 contributions.
If an employer makes a contribution described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section after the valuation date in order to avoid or terminate limitations under section 436, then the present value of that contribution (determined using the effective interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year) is permitted to be added to the plan assets as of the valuation date for purposes of determining or redetermining the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year,
but only if the liability for the benefits, amendment, or accruals that would have been limited (but for the contribution) is included in determining the adjusted funding target for the plan year.
(D)
Transition rule.
Paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(B) of this section is applied to plan years beginning after 2007 and before 2011 by substituting for “100 percent” the applicable percentage determined in accordance with the following table:
In the case of a plan year beginning in calendar year:
The applicable percentage is:
2008
92
2009
94
2010
96
(E)
Limitation on transition rule.
Paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section does not apply with respect to the current plan year unless, for each plan year beginning after December 31, 2007, and before the current plan year, the value of plan assets determined without subtracting the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance is not less than the product of—
(
1
) The applicable percentage determined under paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section for that plan year; and
(
2
) The funding target (determined without regard to the at-risk rules of section 430(i)) for that plan year.
(iii)
Adjusted funding target
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (j)(1)(iii), the adjusted funding target equals the funding target for the plan year, determined in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.430(d)-1, but without regard to the at-risk rules under section 430(i), increased by the aggregate amount of purchases of annuities that were added to assets for purposes of determining the plan's adjusted plan assets under paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section. The definition of adjusted funding target for a plan maintained by a commercial airline for which the plan sponsor has made the election described in section 402(a)(1) of Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA '06), Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780), is the same as if it did not make such an election.
(B)
Adjusted funding target after updated certification.
After the plan's enrolled actuary prepares an updated certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (h)(4)(v) of this section, the adjusted funding target will also be updated to reflect unpredictable contingent event benefits and plan amendments not already taken into account.
(iv)
Plans with zero adjusted funding target.
If the adjusted funding target for the plan year is zero, then the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan year is 100 percent.
(v)
Plans with end of year valuation dates.
[Reserved]
(vi)
Special rule for plans that are the result of a merger.
[Reserved]
(vii)
Special rule for plans that are involved in a spinoff.
[Reserved]
(2)
Annuity starting date
—(i)
General rule.
The term
annuity starting date
means, as applicable—
(A) The first day of the first period for which an amount is payable as an annuity as described in section 417(f)(2)(A)(i);
(B) In the case of a benefit not payable in the form of an annuity, the annuity starting date is the annuity starting date for the qualified joint and survivor annuity that is payable under the plan at the same time as the benefit that is not payable as an annuity;
(C) In the case of an amount payable under a retroactive annuity starting date, the benefit commencement date (instead of the date determined under paragraphs (j)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section);
(D) The date of the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits under the plan; and
(E) The date of any transfer to another plan described in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(C) of this section.
(ii)
Special rule for beneficiaries.
If a participant commences benefits at an annuity starting date (as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section) and, after the death of the participant, payments continue to a beneficiary, the annuity starting date for the payments to the participant constitutes the annuity starting date for payments to the beneficiary, except that a new annuity starting date occurs (determined by applying paragraph (j)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section to the payments to the beneficiary) if the amounts payable to all beneficiaries of the participant
in the aggregate at any future date can exceed the monthly amount that would have been paid to the participant had he or she not died.
(3)
First effective plan year.
The
first effective plan year
for a plan is the first plan year to which section 436 applies to the plan under paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this section.
(4)
Funding target.
In general, the
funding target
means the funding target under § 1.430(d)-1, without regard to the at-risk rules under section 430(i) and § 1.430(i)-1. However, solely for purposes of sections 436(b)(2)(A) and (c)(2)(A), the funding target means the funding target under § 1.430(i)-1 if the plan is in at-risk status for the plan year.
(5)
Prior plan year adjusted funding target attainment percentage
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (j)(5), the
prior plan year adjusted funding target attainment percentage
is the adjusted funding target attainment percentage determined under paragraph (j)(1) of this section for the immediately preceding plan year.
(ii)
Special rules
—(A)
Special rule for new plans.
In the case of a plan established during the plan year that was not the result of a merger or spinoff, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage is equal to 100 percent for plan years before the plan was established. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, a plan that has a predecessor plan in accordance with § 1.415(f)-1(c) is not a plan established during the plan year under this paragraph (j)(5)(ii)(A). Instead, if the plan has a predecessor plan, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year is the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the prior plan year for the predecessor plan (and that predecessor plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage is treated as equal to 100 percent on any date on which it is terminated, other than in a distress termination).
(B)
Special rules for plans that are the result of a merger.
[Reserved]
(C)
Special rules for plans that are involved in a spinoff.
[Reserved]
(iii)
Special rules for 2007 plan year
—(A)
General determination of 2007 adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
In the case of the first plan year beginning in 2008, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (j)(5), the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the immediately preceding plan year (the 2007 plan year) is determined as the fraction (expressed as a percentage)—
(
1
) The numerator of which is the value of plan assets determined under paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B) of this section increased by the aggregate amount of purchases of annuities for participants and beneficiaries (other than participants who, at the time of the purchase, were highly compensated employees as defined in section 414(q), which definition includes highly compensated former employees under § 1.414(q)-1T, Q
A-4 which were made by the plan during the preceding 2 plan years, to the extent not included in plan assets under section 412(c)(2) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06); and
(
2
) The denominator of which is the plan's current liability determined pursuant to section 412(l)(7) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06) on the valuation date for the 2007 plan year increased by the aggregate amount of purchases of annuities that were added to the plan assets under the rules of paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section.
(B)
General determination of value of plan assets
—(
1
)
In general.
The value of plan assets for purposes of this paragraph (j)(5)(iii) is determined under section 412(c)(2) as in effect for the 2007 plan year, except that the value of plan assets prior to subtracting the plan's funding standard account credit balance described in paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section must be adjusted so that the value of plan assets is neither less than 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets nor greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date for that plan year.
(
2
)
Subtraction of credit balance.
If a plan has a funding standard account credit balance as of the valuation date for the 2007 plan year, that balance is subtracted from the value of plan assets described in paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section as of that valuation date. However, the subtraction does not apply if the value of plan
assets prior to adjustment under paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section is greater than or equal to 90 percent of the plan's current liability as of the valuation date for the 2007 plan year.
(
3
)
Effect of funding standard carryover balance reduction for 2007 plan year.
Notwithstanding paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section, if, for the first plan year beginning in 2008, the employer has made an election to reduce some or all of the funding standard carryover balance as of the first day of that year in accordance with § 1.430(f)-1(e), then the present value (determined as of the valuation date for the 2007 plan year using the valuation interest rate for that plan year) of the amount so reduced is not treated as part of the funding standard account credit balance when that balance is subtracted from the asset value under paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(C)
Plan with end-of-year valuation date.
With respect to the first plan year beginning in 2008, if the plan had a valuation date under section 412 that was the last day of the plan year for each of the plan years beginning in 2006 and 2007, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the 2007 plan year may be determined as the fraction (expressed as a percentage)—
(
1
) The numerator of which is the value of plan assets determined under paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(D) of this section increased by the aggregate amount of purchases of annuities for participants and beneficiaries (other than participants who, at the time of the purchase, were highly compensated employees as defined in section 414(q), which definition includes highly compensated former employees under § 1.414(q)-1T, Q
A-4 which were made by the plan during the preceding 2 plan years, to the extent not included in plan assets under section 412(c)(2) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06); and
(
2
) The denominator of which is the plan's current liability determined pursuant to section 412(l)(7) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06) on the valuation date for the second plan year that begins before 2008 (the 2006 plan year), including the increase in current liability for the 2006 plan year, increased by the aggregate amount of purchases of annuities that were added to the plan assets under the rules of paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section.
(D)
Special asset determinations for 2006 adjusted funding target attainment percentage
—(
1
)
General rule.
If the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the 2007 plan year is determined under the rules of paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(C) of this section, then the value of plan assets is determined as the value of plan assets under section 412(c)(2) as in effect for the 2006 plan year, adjusted as provided in this paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(D).
(
2
)
Inclusion of contributions for 2006.
Contributions made for the 2006 plan year are taken into account in determining the value of plan assets, regardless of whether those contributions are made during the plan year or after the end of the plan year and within the period specified under section 412(c)(10) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06).
(
3
)
Restriction to 90-110 percent corridor.
The value of plan assets taking into account the amount of contributions made for the 2006 plan year is increased or decreased, as necessary, so that it is neither less than 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets nor greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date for the 2006 plan year (taking into account assets attributable to contributions for the 2006 plan year).
(
4
)
Subtraction of credit balance.
The plan's funding standard account credit balance as of the end of the 2006 plan year is generally subtracted from the value of plan assets determined after application of paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(D)(
3
) of this section. However, this subtraction does not apply if the value of plan assets is greater than or equal to 90 percent of the plan's current liability determined under section 412(l)(7) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06) on the valuation date for the 2006 plan year.
(E)
Special rules for mergers and spinoffs.
Rules similar to the rules of paragraph (j)(5)(ii) of this section apply for purposes of determining the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the 2007 plan year in the case of a newly established plan, a plan that is
the result of a merger of two plans, or a plan that is in involved in a spinoff.
(6)
Prohibited payment
—(i)
General rule.
The term
prohibited payment
means—
(A) Any payment for a month that is in excess of the monthly amount paid under a straight life annuity (plus any social security supplements described in the last sentence of section 411(a)(9)) to a participant or beneficiary whose annuity starting date occurs during any period that a limitation under paragraph (d) of this section is in effect;
(B) Any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits;
(C) Any transfer of assets and liabilities to another plan maintained by the same employer (or by any member of the employer's controlled group) that is made in order to avoid or terminate the application of section 436 benefit limitations; and
(D) Any other amount that is identified as a prohibited payment by the Commissioner in revenue rulings and procedures, notices, and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) relating to objectives and standards for publishing regulations, revenue rulings and revenue procedures in the Internal Revenue Bulletin).
(ii)
Special rule for beneficiaries.
In the case of a beneficiary that is not an individual, the amount that is a prohibited payment is determined by substituting for the amount in paragraph (j)(1)(i)(A) of this section the monthly amount payable in installments over 240 months that is actuarially equivalent to the benefit payable to the beneficiary.
(7)
Section 436 contributions. Section 436 contributions
are the contributions described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section that are made in order to avoid the application of section 436 limitations under a plan for a plan year.
(8)
Section 436 measurement date.
A
section 436 measurement date
is the date that is used to determine when the limitations of sections 436(d) and 436(e) apply or cease to apply, and is also used for calculations with respect to applying the limitations of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
See
paragraphs (h)(1)(i), (h)(2)(iii)(B), (h)(2)(iv)(B), and (h)(3)(i) of this section regarding section 436 measurement dates that result from application of the presumptions under paragraph (h) of this section.
(9)
Unpredictable contingent event.
An
unpredictable contingent event benefit
means any benefit or increase in benefits to the extent the benefit or increase would not be payable but for the occurrence of an unpredictable contingent event. For this purpose, an
unpredictable contingent event
means a plant shutdown (whether full or partial) or similar event, or an event (including the absence of an event) other than the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or the occurrence of death or disability. For example, if a plan provides for an unreduced early retirement benefit upon the occurrence of an event other than the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or the occurrence of death or disability, then that unreduced early retirement benefit is an unpredictable contingent event benefit to the extent of any portion of the benefit that would not be payable but for the occurrence of the event, even if the remainder of the benefit is payable without regard to the occurrence of the event. Similarly, if a plan includes a benefit payable upon the presence (including the absence) of circumstances specified in the plan (other than the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or the occurrence of death or disability), but not upon a severance from employment that does not include those circumstances, that benefit is an unpredictable contingent event benefit.
(10)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (j):

# Example 1.
(i) Plan S is a non-collectively bargained defined benefit plan with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1. The first effective plan year is 2008. Plan S is not in at-risk status for 2008.
(ii) As of January 1, 2008, Plan S has a value of plan assets (equal to the market value of assets) of $2,100,000 and a funding
standard carryover balance of $200,000. During 2006, assets from Plan S were used to purchase a total of $100,000 in annuities for employees other than highly compensated employees. No annuities were purchased during 2007. On May 1, 2008, the enrolled actuary for the plan determines that the funding target as of January 1, 2008, is $2,500,000.
(iii) The adjusted value of assets for Plan S as of January 1, 2008, is $2,000,000 (that is, plan assets of $2,100,000, plus annuity purchases of $100,000, and minus the funding standard carryover balance of $200,000). The adjusted funding target is $2,600,000 (that is, the funding target of $2,500,000, increased by the annuity purchases of $100,000).
(iv) Based on the above adjusted plan assets and adjusted funding target, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage (AFTAP) as of January 1, 2008, would be 76.92%. Since the AFTAP is less than 80% but is at least 60%, Plan S is subject to the restrictions in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
, except that it is reasonable to expect that the plan sponsor will make a contribution of $80,000 to Plan S for the 2007 plan year by September 15, 2008. This amount is in excess of the minimum required contribution for 2007. The plan sponsor elects to reduce the funding standard carryover balance by $80,000.
(ii) Because it is reasonable to expect that the $80,000 will be contributed by the plan sponsor, that amount is taken into account when the enrolled actuary certifies the 2008 AFTAP under the special rule in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section for plan years beginning before 2009. Accordingly, the enrolled actuary for the plan certifies the 2008 AFTAP as 80% (that is, adjusted plan assets of $2,080,000, reflecting the $80,000 in contributions receivable, divided by the adjusted funding target of $2,600,000).
(iii) The ability to take contributions into account before they are actually paid to the plan is available only for plan years beginning before 2009. Furthermore, if the employer does not actually make the contribution and the difference between the incorrect certification and the corrected AFTAP constitutes a material change, the plan will have violated section 401(a)(29) or will not have been operated in accordance with its terms.

# Example 3.
(i) Plan R is a defined benefit plan with a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1. Section 436 applies to Plan R for 2008. The valuation interest rate for the 2007 plan year for Plan R is 7%. The fair market value of assets of Plan R as of January 1, 2007, is $1,000,000. The actuarial value of assets of Plan R as of January 1, 2007, is $1,200,000. The current liability of Plan R as of January 1, 2007, is $1,500,000. The funding standard account credit balance as of January 1, 2007, is $80,000. The funding standard carryover balance of Plan R is $50,000 as of the beginning of the 2008 plan year. The sponsor of Plan R, Sponsor T, elects in 2008 to reduce the funding standard carryover balance in accordance with § 1.430(f)-1 by $45,000. No annuities were purchased using plan assets during 2005 or 2006.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the asset value used to determine the AFTAP for the 2007 plan year is limited to 110% of the fair market value of assets on January 1, 2007, or $1,100,000 (110% of $1,000,000).
(iii) Pursuant to paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section, the funding standard account credit balance as of January 1, 2007, is subtracted from the asset value used to determine the AFTAP for the 2007 plan year. However, pursuant to paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section, the present value of the amount by which Sponsor T elected to reduce the funding standard carryover balance in 2008 is not subtracted.
(iv) The present value, determined at an interest rate of 7%, of the $45,000 reduction in the funding standard carryover balance elected by Sponsor T in 2008 is $42,056. Thus, $42,056 is not subtracted from the 2007 plan year asset value. Accordingly, the funding standard account credit balance that is subtracted from the 2007 plan year asset value is $37,944 (that is, $80,000 less $42,056).
(v) Thus, the asset value that is used to determine the FTAP for the 2007 plan year is $1,100,000 less $37,944, or $1,062,056. Accordingly, for purposes of this section, the FTAP for the 2007 plan year for Plan R is 70.8% (that is, $1,062,056 divided by $1,500,000).

# Example 4.
(i) Plan T is a non-collectively bargained defined benefit plan that was established prior to 2007. Plan T has a plan year that is the calendar year and a valuation date of January 1. The first effective plan year is 2008; the plan met the conditions of paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(E) of this section for 2008. As of January 1, 2009, Plan T has a value of plan assets (equal to the market value of assets) of $3,000,000, a funding standard carryover balance of $150,000, and a prefunding balance of $50,000. During 2007 and 2008, assets from Plan T were used to purchase a total of $400,000 in annuities for employees other than highly compensated employees. The funding target for Plan T (without regard to the at-risk rules of section 430(i)) is $3,200,000 as of January 1, 2009.
(ii) The plan's funding status is calculated in accordance with paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(B) of this section to determine whether the special rule for fully-funded plans applies to Plan T. Accordingly, the value of plan assets determined without subtracting the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance is 93.75% of the plan's
funding target ($3,000,000 ÷ $3,200,000). The applicable transitional percentage in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section is 94% for 2009. Because the percentage calculated above is less than 94%, the transition rule does not apply to Plan T.
(iii) Accordingly, the January 1, 2009, AFTAP for Plan T is calculated without reflecting the special rule in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The AFTAP as of January 1, 2009, is calculated by dividing the adjusted assets by the adjusted funding target. For this purpose, the value of assets is increased by the annuities purchased for nonhighly compensated employees during 2007 and 2008, and decreased by the funding standard carryover balance and the prefunding balance as of January 1, 2009, resulting in an adjusted asset value of $3,200,000 (that is, $3,000,000 + $400,000−$150,000−$50,000). The funding target is increased by the annuities purchased for nonhighly compensated employees during 2007 and 2008, resulting in an adjusted funding target of $3,600,000 (that is, $3,200,000 + $400,000). The AFTAP for Plan T for 2009 is therefore $3,200,000 ÷ $3,600,000, or 88.89%.
(k)
Effective/applicability dates
—(1)
Statutory effective date.
Section 436 generally applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The applicability of section 436 for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution is delayed for certain plans in accordance with sections 104 through 106 of PPA '06.
(2)
Collectively bargained plan exception
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a collectively bargained plan that is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements between employee representatives and one or more employers ratified before January 1, 2008, section 436 does not apply to plan years beginning before the earlier of—
(A) January 1, 2010; or
(B) The later of—
(
1
) The date on which the last such collective bargaining agreement relating to the plan terminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof agreed to after August 17, 2006); or
(
2
) The first day of the first plan year to which section 436 would (but for this paragraph (k)(2)) apply.
(ii)
Treatment of certain plan amendments.
For purposes of this paragraph (k)(2), any plan amendment made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement relating to the plan which amends the plan solely to conform to any requirement added by section 436 is not treated as a termination of the collective bargaining agreement.
(iii)
Treatment of plans with both collectively bargained and non-collectively bargained employees.
In the case of a plan with respect to which a collective bargaining agreement applies to some, but not all, of the plan participants, the plan is considered a collectively bargained plan for purposes of this paragraph (k)(2) if it is considered a collectively bargained plan under the rules of paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.
(3)
Effective date/applicability date of regulations.
This section applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2010. For plan years beginning before January 1, 2010, plans are permitted to rely on the provisions set forth in this section for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 436.
